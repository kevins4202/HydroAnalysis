24080,in this study we assessed the performance of five shock capturing type reconstruction schemes in modeling shallow water waves implemented in the public domain boussinesq model funwave tvd the five shock capturing schemes include two fourth order monotonic upwind scheme for conservation laws total variation diminishing muscl tvd schemes with the minimod and van leer limiters respectively a second order muscl tvd scheme with the van leer limiter a fifth order weighted essentially non oscillatory weno scheme and a third order multi dimensional limiting process mlp scheme numerical simulations on solitary waves and laboratory measurements showed that for one dimensional simulations all five shock capturing schemes maintain non oscillatory properties but exhibit different numerical dissipations numerical dissipation can be affected by both the order of shock capturing schemes and choice of limiters the van leer limiter is more dissipative than minimod when used in fourth order schemes which is different from what would be inferred from the linear analysis for the second order for two dimensional problems the shock capturing schemes can generate either fewer or more high frequency oscillations depending on the applied courant friedrichs lewy cfl number the most stable results occur in the second order muscl tvd scheme with the van leer limiter which has large numerical dissipation and the third order mlp scheme which has the ability to control the oscillations in multi dimensional simulations the wavelet analysis showed that high frequency oscillations usually occur at later time and thus affect long time simulation decreasing the cfl number is an effective way of reducing high frequency oscillations in two dimensional applications models with different shock capturing schemes can predict similar strength and patterns of wave induced currents in the breaking wave application however the analysis based on the vorticity or enstrophy integral of the square of the vorticity calculations show that the schemes with higher numerical dissipation have more significant damping effect on the vorticity field which may affect the model accuracy in predicting wave current interaction in a long time simulation keywords shock capturing schemes limiters boussinesq model funwave tvd numerical instability numerical dissipation 1 introduction with increasing technological advancements in computational resources it is becoming more feasible to apply a phase resolving boussinesq wave model in a large domain 10 km for a long period of time hours to calculate wave statistics nearshore circulation patterns and morphological evolution in coastal regions the development of a numerically stable and accurate boussinesq solver is necessary for such applications in the last two decades aligned with improvements in the boussinesq theories the numerical methods for solving the boussinesq equations have been greatly enhanced kirby 2016 because the boussinesq equations contain third order derivatives in dispersive terms a higher order numerical scheme is needed in order to move leading order truncation errors to one order higher than the dispersive terms approaches to development of numerical implementations for the boussinesq equations include a wide range of finite difference finite volume or finite element formulations most of which have fourth order accuracy a typical example of a higher order scheme is the finite difference scheme developed by wei and kirby 1995 who used a mixed order difference scheme in space and the fourth order adams bashforth moulton abm scheme in time however finite difference and finite element numerical models for boussinesq equations proved to be noisy in practice requiring filters to suppress spurious oscillations near shorelines and for breaking waves kirby et al 1998 walkley and berzins 2002 the issue of numerical noise from a boussinesq solver has been recognized by a number of researchers such as liu 1995 who pointed out that when the boussinesq equations are solved numerically high frequency oscillations can occur and cause numerical instability models based on the high order finite difference schemes are basically weakly unstable at high wavenumbers near the grid nyquist limit leading to the need for intermittent or even fairly frequent filtering in addition a filtering application is usually case dependent making it difficult to tune for long simulations recently the vast majority of boussinesq models have shifted to a hybrid method combining finite volume and finite difference tvd schemes boussinesq models with a tvd type solver provide more stable solutions compared to their finite difference counterparts and have shown robust performance in modeling breaking waves and coastal inundation erduran et al 2005 shiach and mingham 2009 tonelli and petti 2009 roeber et al 2010 shi et al 2012a roeber and cheung 2012 kazolea and delis 2013 the concept of tvd was introduced initially by harten 1983 who proved that if the total variation of a discretized variable does not increase with time the scheme preserves monotonicity tvd is then used as a terminology to represent a property of numerical schemes in solving hyperbolic partial differential equations a tvd scheme is also called shock capturing scheme because it enables sharp shock predictions and avoids non physical spurious oscillations in the solution a linear tvd scheme has only first order accuracy which can be proved by godunov s theorem toro 1999 to get a higher order accuracy nonlinear techniques are usually used in a tvd scheme such as slope limiters typically there are a number of tvd type numerical schemes used in computational fluid dynamics in the developments of shallow water wave models godunov type schemes toro 1999 and weno type schemes jiang and shu 1996 are two popular shock capturing schemes used in solving either boussinesq or green naghdi wave equations the boussinesq model equations are constructed by basic terms of the nonlinear shallow water equations which can be easily handled using the tvd finite volume method along with the dispersive terms that can be implemented using finite differencing various finite volume formulations have been used in the recent development of boussinesq wave models the fourth order muscl tvd scheme by yamamoto and daiguji 1993 has been used in many studies e g erduran et al 2005 kim et al 2009 tonelli and petti 2009 shi et al 2012a and remained a popular choice for solving boussinesq equations however in the recent applications of the standard fourth order muscl scheme numerical instabilities were found for long time simulations such as in abadie et al 2012 who used the tvd version of the fully nonlinear boussinesq model funwave tvd to model tsunami waves generated by the flank collapse of the cumbre vieja volcano they chose the second order scheme a third order scheme was cited in their paper but later confirmed to be second order instead of the fourth order to run their simulations similar instability issues were also observed by other model users and recognized that the instability may occur mostly in long time simulations erduran et al 2005 pointed out that the choice of limiters used in the fourth order muscl tvd scheme may affect model results in particular numerical instability in solving the improved boussinesq equations derived by madsen and s√∏ rensen 1992 they suggested the fourth order muscl scheme with the van leer limiter as the most suitable one because the van leer limiter provides a smoother extrema of a discontinuous solution than the other limiters they tested however numerical accuracy of tvd schemes can be compromised at the smooth extrema of the solution even though a high order accuracy scheme is used gottlieb et al 2011 shu 2003 showed the degeneration of the accuracy in the tvd scheme after long time computations in solving the euler equations in comparison to muscl tvd schemes the weighted essentially non oscillatory weno scheme jiang and shu 1996 can represent not only sharp discontinuities but also smooth extrema of the solution recently the fifth order weno scheme has been applied in solving the shallow water equations li and raichlen 2002 xing and shu 2005 choi and seo 2017 and the weakly nonlinear boussinesq equations zhou et al 2016 as an alternative shock capturing scheme the multi dimensional limiting process mlp has been devised for preventing numerical oscillations occurring in multi dimensional flows kim and kim 2005 in a rectangular grid the muscl tvd and weno schemes just consider one way limiting processes for two dimensional problems however mlp can take into account multi dimensional shock discontinuity and provide a good convergence in two dimensional flows in the latest study roeber and cheung 2012 have employed the third order mlp to solve nwogu s 1993 weakly nonlinear boussinesq equations funwave tvd is a public domain model in the nearshore and coastal community it is in high demand among ocean and coastal researchers modeling nearshore waves wave driven currents ship wakes tsunami and sediment transport since the first official release of funwave tvd which was based on shi et al 2012a the model has been improved in several aspects including more numerical schemes options an efficient non iterative solver and additional model components for simulating ship wakes shi et al 2018 meteo tsunamis woodruff et al 2018 and sediment transport tehranirad et al 2016 malej et al 2018 in this study we present five shock capturing schemes implemented in funwave tvd including three muscl tvd schemes a high order weno scheme and an mlp scheme the scope of this study is to assess the performance of different shock capturing schemes in modeling shallow water surface waves and provide a guidance for future applications of shock capturing schemes in boussinesq type wave models in the next section a brief description of the funwave tvd model is presented five shock capturing schemes including the newly implemented muscl tvd high order weno scheme and mlp scheme are described in section 3 in section 4 we present three basic numerical tests to examine the performance of the five numerical schemes in simulating one dimensional and two dimensional problems section 5 provides a summary of test results 2 boussinesq model funwave tvd funwave tvd is a fully nonlinear boussineq wave model discretized by a godunov type riemann solver with a tvd scheme shi et al 2012a it was developed based on a more complete set of fully nonlinear boussinesq equations with the vertical vorticity correction derived by chen 2006 and a time varying reference elevation introduced by kennedy et al 2001 in addition shi et al 2012a reformulated the surface gradient term using the technique suggested by rogers et al 2003 to secure a well balanced solution the equations are reorganized into a conservative form to facilitate computations with a hybrid numerical scheme the set of conservative boussinesq equations in funwave tvd can be written as 1 Œ∑ t m x x m y y 0 2 m x t x 1 h m x 2 1 2 g Œ∑ 2 2 Œ∑ h y 1 h m x m y g Œ∑ h x h œá x v 1 x v 2 x v 3 x r x r b x 3 m y t x 1 h m x m y y 1 h m y 2 1 2 g Œ∑ 2 2 Œ∑ h g Œ∑ h y h œá y v 1 y v 2 y v 3

represent the quadratic form of the bottom friction modeled by cd u Œ± u Œ± where cd is the bottom friction coefficient r x r y were neglected intentionally in this study in order to examine the numerical dissipation the equations are solved using the muscl tvd scheme up to the fourth order accuracy yamamoto and daiguji 1993 within the riemann solver along with the third order time stepping runge kutta method gottlieb and shu 1998 the standard muscl tvd scheme will be described in the next section in conjunction with the new schemes added for this study by taking advantage of the shock capturing numerical scheme in the riemann solver wave breaking can be modeled by locally switching to the nonlinear shallow water equations nswe when the local ratio of the surface elevation to the water depth exceeds a certain threshold the eddy viscosity type breaking scheme developed in the previous version kennedy et al 2001 was also carried over to the tvd version as an optional breaking scheme the terms r b x r b y in eqs 2 and 3 express the eddy viscosity type breaking terms as below 9 r b x x ŒΩ x h u Œ± y ŒΩ y h u Œ± 10 r b y x ŒΩ x h v Œ± y ŒΩ y h v Œ± 11 ŒΩ b Œ¥ b 2 h Œ∑ Œ∑ t b

1991 in 11 b has the value of 0 or 1 representing the switch between non breaking and breaking a breaking event begins when Œ∑t exceeds an initial threshold Œ∑ t i c 1 g h when wave breaking develops the wave will continue to break until Œ∑t becomes lower than the second threshold Œ∑ t f c 2 g h where c 2 c 1 note that in kennedy et al 2000 b varies smoothly from 0 to 1 to avoid an impulsive start of breaking and the resulting instability in the present version a constant b 1 is adopted as breaking is initiated because there is no instability issue related to wave breaking the eddy viscosity type breaking scheme was found to provide more accurate breaking wave solutions compared to the nswe based breaker particularly for predicting breaking undular bores or solitons as pointed out by shi et al 2018 thus the eddy viscosity breaker is used in the following numerical experiments time stepping is adaptive based on the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition the time step Œ¥t is computed by 12 Œ¥ t cfl min min Œ¥ x u g h min Œ¥ y v g h where cfl is the courant number Œ¥x and Œ¥y are grid sizes in the x and y directions respectively the code was parallelized using the message passing interface mpi domain decomposition with non blocking communication the model has been validated against a suite of benchmark test data in applications of wave shoaling breaking wave induced nearshore circulation tsunami waves and coastal inundation tehranirad et al 2011 shi et al 2012b kirby et al 2013 lynett et al 2017 3 shock capturing schemes for comparing the performance of different shock

study the standard fourth order muscl tvd yamamoto and daiguji 1993 and the second order muscl tvd schemes zhou et al 2001 in the existing version of funwave tvd were also used for comparisons in this section we briefly summarize all the schemes used in the study for facilitating comparisons and discussions in the following section 3 1 the standard fourth order muscl tvd scheme ms4 minmod the

limiters such as superbee minmod van albada and van leer in their experiments using the boussinesq equations of madsen and s√∏ rensen 1992 but showed that the van leer limiter required the proper number of grid points per wavelength to prevent numerical dissipation 3 3 the second order muscl tvd scheme ms2 vanleer for the second order muscl tvd scheme with the van leer limiter the cell

studies the first case is the simulation of a solitary wave in which the numerical dissipation and its effect on propagation speed are investigated for different schemes the second case is a simulation of the laboratory experiments of luth et al 1994 which is the standard one dimensional benchmark test used by many model developers e g gobbi et al 2000 the last case is simulation of the laboratory experiments by vincent and briggs 1989 who measured the refraction and diffraction of waves propagating over a two dimensional submerged shoal this test case is used to examine performance of the different orders of schemes and limiters in handling two dimensional calculations 4 1 solitary wave experiment simulations of a solitary wave propagating over a constant depth were conducted using the five shock capturing schemes the analytical solution of a solitary wave was used as an initial condition in the model the analytical expression of the initial values of Œ∑ uŒ± is based on wei and kirby 1995 who derived an approximate analytical solution to the boussinesq model equations assuming weak nonlinearity a solitary wave with wave height of 0 5 m was specified with the peak located at x 200 m in a 1d flume x 0 4500 m with a constant depth of 1 0 m the grid size is 0 05 m the time step is automatically adjusted based on the cfl condition 12 and cfl 0 5 was used similar to the observation in wei and kirby 1995 the initial solitary wave given by the analytical solution evolves with the result that a slightly higher solitary wave is formed together with a small dispersive tail due to the mismatch between the weekly nonlinear solution and the fully nonlinear model for the given solitary wave with the amplitude to depth ratio of 0 5 the wave form is adjusted in a short period of time with the predicted wave height first decreasing and then reaching a stable height the wave height ends up as 0 534 m at about t 20 s in all cases indicating the stable solution is not affected by the different schemes table 1 lists the wave height changes from the maximum wave height h 1 to the wave height h 2 at t 1000 s and the percentage changes damping rate over 1000 s for all test cases the results from ms4 vanleer mlp3 and ms2 vanleer show more obvious damping than weno5 and ms4 minmod weno5 and ms4 minmod show a similar damping rate and have the least numerical dissipation with the second order accuracy ms2 vanleer is the most dissipative compared to the higher order schemes quantitatively a decrease of 6 4 in wave amplitude can be found in ms2 vanleer over the time period of 1000 s while only 1 7 was found in weno5 and ms4 minmod the solitary wave speed predicted by a numerical model can be affected by both numerical dispersion and numerical diffusion numerical dispersion can contaminate the physical dispersion and thus change the wave phase speed numerical diffusion can damp the wave and thus slow down wave propagation due to the decreased wave amplitude in an application of the shock capturing scheme solitary phase error is believed to be caused by the numerical diffusion due to the use of a limiter kim et al 2009 fig 1 illustrates snapshots of solitary wave solutions at t 1000 s from the different schemes here we also include the result from the same ms4 minmod scheme but a different parameter b 1 1 to facilitate the discussion below the results from weno5 and ms4 minmod are almost identical because they have nearly the same damping rate as shown in table 1 the wave speeds predicted by mlp3 ms4 vanleer and ms2 vanleer are 0 60 0 87 and 1 42 slower than that of weno5 respectively it is interesting to note that the minmod limiter is less dissipative than the van leer limiter when it is combined with the fourth order scheme this is inconsistent with the finding in sanders and bradford 2006 who suggested that the minmod limiter is more diffusive than the van leer in their study a lower order second order in their analysis scheme was used to confirm sanders and bradford s 2006 conclusion we used the same example of the solitary wave propagation but applied the minmod and van leer limiters in the second order scheme our results not shown indicated that for the second order scheme the minmod limiter is more diffusive than the van leer limiter which is consistent with sanders and bradford s 2006 analysis our results suggest that the two limiters used in the higher order scheme have different behaviors from that in the lower order scheme it should also be mentioned that for the minmod limiter used in the fourth order scheme the numerical dissipation is sensitive to the choice of b value in eqs 15 18 in yamamoto and daiguji 1993 1 b 4 was suggested kim et al 2009 conducted tests of a solitary wave propagation using a range of b from 1 1 to 4 0 in the fourth order scheme their tests showed that the model with b 1 1 is much more dissipative than the model with b 4 0 our test of ms4 minmod with b 1 1 also showed the same feature as shown in fig 1 the phase speed from ms4 minmod with b 1 1 is even slower than that from the second order scheme ms2 vanleer ms4 minmod with b 1 1 was not used in the following tests to compare the grid convergences between the different schemes we used a sequence of different grid size Œ¥x p where Œ¥ x 0 1 m and p 1 2 5 a constant time step Œ¥ t 0 0025 s was used the courant numbers are less than 0 5 for all the cases following shi et al 2001 the convergence rates are demonstrated by the rms differences of simulated surface elevations at t 100 s the rms difference of surface elevation is defined by 50 rms p i 1 m j 1 n Œ∑ p i j Œ∑ p 1 i j 2 m n where Œ∑p denotes the computed surface elevation in the case p m n are the grid dimensions in the case of p 1 fig 2 shows the logarithmic rms differences versus the grid spacing calculated from the different schemes similar decreasing trends slopes of the rms difference with grid refinement can be found in the comparison indicating the similar convergence rates in the different schemes however the magnitudes of the rms difference are quite different between the different models weno5 and ms4 minmod b 4 0 show smaller rms differences than other schemes consistent with the smaller damping rates described earlier 4 2 periodic wave propagation over submerged bar luth et al 1994 the laboratory experiments conducted by beji and battjes 1993 and luth et al 1994 have been widely used as a benchmark test for validating phase resolving wave models such as boussinesq wave models e g gobbi et al 2000 and non hydrostatic wave models e g ma et al 2012 beji and battjes 1993 and luth et al 1994 have the same geometric configuration as shown in fig 3 except that the length scale in luth et al is twice as large as that in beji and battjes in addition luth et al has more measurement station locations in this study we used luth et al s data for model data comparisons note that in fig 3 we re scaled the geometry to the scale used in beji and battjes 1993 and shifted the horizontal coordinate to the left by 10 m in order to specify a wavemaker at x 10 m and a sponge layer in x 0 5 m the experiment set up includes a flat bottom of 0 4 m depth in front and back of the bar a front slope of 1 20 and back slope of 1 10 measurement locations are denoted by station 1 10 with the horizontal coordinates in meters the measurement at x 15 7 m before the toe of the slope is not used because of the phase mismatch in the data gobbi and kirby 1999 the experiments are usually used to investigate the frequency dispersion characteristics and nonlinear interaction during wave propagation over a complicated geometry as the wave propagates on the slope of the submerged bar wave shoaling and amplification of bound harmonics occur through the energy transfer from the leading wave to higher harmonics as the wave re enters the deeper water on the lee side of the bar these higher harmonics are released as free waves gobbi et al 2000 a numerical simulation of this process requires a model with high accuracy in predicting wave dispersion and nonlinearity the non breaking wave case with the wave amplitude of 0 01 m and wave period of 2 02 s was simulated in the numerical simulations the grid size of 0 02 m and cfl 0 5 are used in the model fig 4 compares the time series of surface elevation at st 1 st 10 obtained from all five numerical schemes as well as the data all models perform quite well for stations up to the top of the bar st 1 st 6 as the waves pass the back slope of the bar the model results start to deviate from the data because the model with accuracy to the o Œº 2 cannot predict well the higher harmonics in other words the higher harmonics or short waves do not necessarily fall in the required weakly dispersive boussinesq Œº k h 1 regime the results of all numerical schemes look similar with visible differences only appearing at st 8 st 10 to quantify the differences more precisely the model effectiveness across different schemes was evaluated using the measure developed by willmott 1981 expressed by 51 g 1 i 1 n x i x d i 2 i 1 n x i x d x d i x d 2 where xd i represents the experimental data x i is the numerical solution and x d is the mean value of xd i n denotes the number of data samples points g 1 means a perfect agreement between the numerical solution and the data whereas g 0 represents a complete disagreement table 2 lists the model efficacy calculated at st 1 st 10 for all five numerical schemes although some differences in model accuracy are noticeable especially at st 7 st 8 the numbers in table 2 do not sufficiently lead to a conclusion that one scheme is better than the other the model data comparisons suggest that for simulations of luth et al s experiment the computational errors are mainly due to the theoretical approximation rather than the errors from the numerical schemes tests with a smaller grid size 0 01 m were also conducted to examine the consistency and convergence the models with the smaller grid size performed similarly to the former ones indicating the converged solutions of the different schemes are close to each other no high frequency oscillations were observed in any of the tested shock capturing schemes 4 3 vincent and briggs experiments vincent and briggs 1989 conducted laboratory experiments to investigate such nearshore processes as wave refraction diffraction shoaling and wave breaking as waves propagated over a submerged shoal in their experiments both monochromatic and irregular waves with frequency directional spreading were tested including both non breaking and breaking waves over the years multiple numerical studies of these particular laboratory experiments have been carried out by a number of researchers who used this dataset to validate models based on different wave modeling theories for example choi et al 2009 used the data to examine the performance of the coupled ref dif shorecirc and swan shorecirc models and the initial version of funwave wei and kirby 1995 they noted that for breaking wave cases wave induced currents behind the shoal cause wave defocusing and thus result in a wave shadow zone with lower wave heights therefore the inclusion of the wave induced currents in the wave model component is important for the wave circulation coupled models in comparison to the wave current coupled models the phase resolving boussinesq model funwave is more capable of simulating wave transformation properties such as wave reflection refraction and diffraction for instance wave reflection is not included in ref dif and swan in addition swan is not able to predict the transverse interference patterns due to wave diffraction even though the decoupled diffraction terms were added in the model holthuijsen et al 2003 moreover funwave calculates both waves and currents therefore the wave current interaction is automatically included choi et al 2009 showed that funwave performs better in simulating both non breaking and breaking wave cases than the wave current coupled models in this study we examined two monochromatic wave cases including non breaking and breaking waves with the purpose of testing model performance in two dimensional simulations the model setup was based on the laboratory configuration as shown in fig 5 the center of the submerged shoal is located at x y 6 1 12 5 m the water depth is 0 4572 m except over the shoal which can be formulated by 52 h 0 9144 0 7620 1 x 3 81 2 y 4 95 2 0 5 where x and y are localized coordinates centered at the shoal crest eq 52 results in the depth of 0 1524 m at the shoal crest note that the actual computational domain was larger than the domain shown in fig 5 grid extensions were made to both left and right boundaries in order to allow more space for an internal wavemaker as well as the sponge layers on the both sides of the grid edge 4 3 1 non breaking wave case in the non breaking wave case monochromatic waves with a wave height of 0 0254 m and a period of 1 3 s were generated to demonstrate wave focusing and diffraction patterns fig 6 shows the distribution of wave heights normalized by the incident wave height in the model of mlp3 large wave heights can be observed behind the shoal due to wave focusing processes strong transverse oscillations in wave height distribution can be found behind the shoal which are consistent with the laboratory data to check the model convergence with an increasing grid refinement for different schemes convergence tests were performed using varying grid sizes fig 7 illustrates wave height distributions along section 4 from models with grid sizes from 0 1 m to 0 025 m compared to the data in vincent and briggs 1989 wave heights in the monochromatic wave case were analyzed using the collected data over a time period of 36 4 s 28 wave periods 28t hereafter the same time period was used for calculating wave heights for the numerical simulation for Œ¥ x Œ¥ y 0 1 m differences in wave height distribution are obvious between different schemes in particular wave heights from ms4 vanleer mlp3 and ms2 vanleer are generally lower than that from weno5 and ms4 minmod this behavior is consistent with the findings in the solitary wave tests which compared numerical dissipation among the different schemes as the grid size decreased the differences between the schemes reduced fig 7 c shows the results from Œ¥ x Œ¥ y 0 025 m the deviations among the different schemes are now minimal indicating all models converge at this grid size hence Œ¥ x Œ¥ y 0 025 m will be used for the rest of the tests it should be mentioned however that the models over predicted wave heights in line with the result of choi et al 2009 who used the initial version of funwave without a shock capturing scheme the possible reason for the over prediction is that bottom friction was not applied in the model to examine model stability for a long time simulation we extended the computational time to 1000 s interestingly both weno5 and ms4 minmod cannot survive the long simulation without decreasing the cfl number fig 8 shows a snapshot of the surface elevation along section 4 in the results the cfl numbers were reduced to smaller values as shown in the legends of the figure in weno5 and ms4 minmod to complete the 1000 s simulation it can be seen that even with the reduced cfl values high frequency spurious oscillations or noises still appear in weno5 and ms4 minmod in contrast both the ms4 vanleer and mlp3 models were able to complete the 1000 s simulation with only minimal amount of visible high frequency oscillations decreasing the cfl number from 0 5 to 0 4 improved the numerical instabilities for the cases of ms4 vanleer and mlp3 as shown in fig 8 c and d an instability problem was not found in ms2 vanleer using cfl 0 5 in the long time simulation as shown in fig 8 e fig 9 shows the morlet wavelet spectra of the time series of surface elevation at the central point of section 4 for weno5 with cfl 0 3 ms4 minimod with cfl 0 3 ms4 vanleer with cfl 0 5 mlp3 with cfl 0 5 and ms2 vanleer with cfl 0 5 from top to bottom ms4 vanleer mlp3 and ms2 vanleer provided horizontal strips at frequencies lower than 2 0 hz with constant magnitudes over the entire simulation time the peak frequency of the spectrum is at 0 7692 hz which is the input wave frequency weno5 predicted a constant spectrum until t 100 s then high frequency waves occurred for ms4 minimod high frequency oscillations appear later around t 330 s and are weaker than that in weno5 the frequencies of the numerical oscillations are in the range of 2 5 4 hz which are much lower than the frequencies associated with the grid nyquist limit 11 hz based on the grid size of 0 025 m the oscillatory behavior of the two dimensional application of shock capturing schemes has been discussed by several researchers such as kim and kim 2005 our tests showed that the schemes with smaller numerical dissipation such as weno5 and ms4 minmod can cause more obvious oscillations than the dissipative schemes such as ms4 vanleer and ms2 vanleer an effective way to reduce high frequency oscillations is to decrease the cfl number especially for a long time simulation 4 3 2 breaking wave case large waves with a wave height of 0 135 m and a period of 1 3 s were generated in the breaking wave case for modeling breaking waves high frequency oscillations with high wavenumber near the grid nyquist limit usually occur in boussinesq models with higher order finite difference schemes wei and kirby 1995 liu 1995 kennedy et al 2000 pointed out that a major source of noise is related to the eddy viscosity formulation for modeling wave breaking in the breaking wave case model accuracy and numerical instability of different shock capturing schemes were examined the breaking parameters c 1 0 45 and c 2 0 35 needed for 11 were applied in the resulting analysis the first 9 1 s of the simulation data were removed in order to align with the laboratory experiments fig 10 shows the model data comparisons of wave height distribution along section 4 wave heights were calculated using 36 4 s 28 t of simulation time series the same as in the laboratory experiments all the models predicted wave defocusing due to the strong wave induced current behind the shoal which will be described below differences in wave height distribution among different schemes were small except for slightly larger wave heights were found in weno5 to examine the effects of the different schemes on modeling wave breaking we compare the wave height distributions along the central section y 12 5 m of the tank predicted by the different models as shown in fig 11 the wave breaking point can be identified by the peak of wave height distribution appearing on the shoal the comparison shows that the breaking locations predicted by the different models are very close and the wave height distribution is not affected much by the different numerical schemes for modeling the wave induced nearshore circulation using a boussinesq wave model a non zero bottom friction term is usually needed to balance the frictional force and the gradient of the radiation stresses and pressure without a bottom friction modeled wave induced currents will grow with time and eventually become unrealistically strong in a long time simulation in this study we neglected the bottom friction term intentionally in order to evaluate the numerical dissipation and instability the model data comparison shown in fig 10 indicates that the models without the bottom friction predicted the wave current interaction reasonably well in the initial time period of 36 4 s for data analysis longer simulations were also carried out in order to explore the evolution of wave induced circulation affected by different numerical schemes the development of wave induced currents is demonstrated by the results from the model with the mlp3 scheme as shown in fig 12 the currents were calculated by averaging wave velocity components u v over 28 t the left panel shows the current field obtained by averaging the first 28 t wave induced currents concentrate on the shoal with two circulation cells and a jet behind the shoal as time elapses the wave induced currents intensify downstream forming strong jet like currents as shown in the middle panel which was from the second 28 t then the strong jet like currents diverge into two symmetric circulation cells near the right boundary as shown in the right panel which was from the third 28 t the wave induced circulation continues to evolve and become asymmetric at a later time not shown in the current paper arising from the lack of the bottom friction for the longer time simulations a smaller courant number cfl 0 3 was adopted to guarantee stable solutions for all schemes except weno5 weno5 had an instability problem even with cfl further reduced tested up to cfl 0 05 fig 13 compares the current fields vectors and the fields of vertical vorticity œâ color unit 1 s obtained in the third 28t from ms4 minmod mlp3 ms4 vanleer and ms2 vanleer weno5 not shown because of an instability problem wave induced currents calculated from different schemes are qualitatively identical suggesting that the models with different shock capturing schemes except weno5 can predict similar circulation patterns as long as the numerical instability can be suppressed by using small cfl numbers however the intensity of the vorticity field from ms4 minmod is higher than that from the other three schemes for a detailed comparison fig 14 provides a sectional view of the vorticity distribution along x 16 25 m where the peaks of vorticity values appear in the four cases in contrast to the other three cases visibly larger peaks of vorticity can be found in the case of ms4 minmod the generation of vertical vorticity in a boussinesq type wave model can be explained by the vorticity conservation equation derived by chen 2006 and others the major source of vorticity generation is the dissipation term associated with wave breaking although the numerical dissipation can also be a source of vorticity generation it seems to play a minor role in this case in fact it rather dissipates vorticity as indicated in the model model comparisons with the least amount of numerical dissipation the model with ms4 minmod predicted the largest peaks of vorticity among the tested cases the strength of the vorticity can also be measured by integrating the enstrophy œâ 2 2 over the whole computational domain the results are 7 23 6 25 6 15 and 6 02 103 1 s 2 respectively for ms4 minmod ms4 vanleer mlp3 and ms2 vanleer the results indicate that the enstrophy is strongly correlated with numerical dissipation and decreases due to the dissipation inherent to a numerical scheme the larger vorticity or current magnitude in ms4 minmod alters wave distribution patterns due to the wave refraction by the currents fig 15 compares wave height distributions along the same transect as fig 14 from all four numerical schemes different from the other three schemes the wave height peaks from ms4 minmod appear to be shifted into the center of the domain due to the refraction by stronger currents overall for the wave breaking case ms4 vanleer mlp3 and ms2 vanleer have similar damping effects on vorticity fields which may affect the model accuracy in predicting wave induced currents and wave current interaction in a long time simulation ms4 minmod has less numerical dissipation but suffers from an instability problem for a large cfl parameter weno5 also has instability problems for the 2d breaking wave case which is consistent with the findings of kim and kim 2005 the instability problems are caused by the oscillations at higher frequencies similar to those shown in the non breaking wave case which are lower than the frequencies associated with the grid nyquist limit 5 conclusions and remarks in this study we implemented five shock capturing numerical schemes in the public domain boussinesq model funwave tvd the five shock capturing schemes include two fourth order muscl tvd schemes with the minimod and van leer limiters ms4 minimod and ms4 vanleer a second order muscl tvd scheme with the van leer limiter ms2 vanleer a fifth order weno scheme weno5 and a third order mlp scheme mlp3 performance of the five shock capturing schemes were assessed using numerical experiments for both one and two dimensional problems numerical experiments of a progressive solitary wave showed that the numerical dissipation can be affected by both the order of the shock capturing scheme and the choice of limiter the higher order schemes generally have less numerical dissipation compared to the lower order schemes however for ms4 minimod the choice of the parameter b where 1 b 4 can significantly affect the numerical dissipation the model with a smaller b e g b 1 1 is even more dissipative than the second order scheme ms2 vanleer the van leer and minimod limiters behave differently when they are used in different orders of muscl schemes although it has been proved in theory that the minmod limiter is more dissipative than the van leer limiter when they are used in the second order schemes our numerical experiments showed the minmod limiter is less dissipative than the van leer limiter when employed in the fourth order schemes weno5 is the least dissipative whereas ms2 vanleer is the most dissipative among the five shock capturing schemes for a one dimensional problem the five shock capturing schemes perform similarly for the converging grid configuration in the simulations of luth et al 1994 model data comparisons show that all models agree well with the data the differences in numerical schemes and limiters do not lead to apparent discrepancies in model results in the one dimensional simulations for a two dimensional problem the five shock capturing schemes behave differently in the non breaking case of vincent and briggs 1989 experiments the models with less dissipative schemes such as weno5 and ms4 minimod converge faster than other schemes in grid refinements however the schemes with smaller numerical dissipation can generate high frequency oscillations in long time simulations the wavelet analysis showed that high frequency oscillations usually occur at a later time and thus affect long time simulations the frequencies of the numerical oscillations are much lower than the frequencies associated with the grid nyquist limit decreasing the cfl parameter is an effective way to reduce high frequency oscillations among the higher order schemes the mlp3 generates the least amount of noise because of its ability to control high frequency oscillations in two dimensions in the breaking wave case the models with different schemes predicted similar strength and pattern of wave induced circulation as well as wave defocusing due to wave current interaction longer time simulations showed that ms4 vanleer mlp3 and ms2 vanleer have similar damping effects on vorticity fields which may affect the model accuracy in predicting wave induced currents in a long time simulation weno5 is the most unstable scheme for two dimensional simulations it failed to complete a longer time simulation of the breaking wave case even with a very small cfl number because the shock capturing schemes were developed based on one dimen sional flow physics the direct extension to two dimensional flows using dimensional splitting may change the non oscillatory characteristics proved in one dimensional flows kim and kim 2005 pointed out that most multi dimensional schemes do not show monotonic behavior across a multi dimensional discontinuity especially for higher order schemes the mathematical analysis of a non oscillatory scheme is usually based on the one dimensional advection equation which may not be suitable for two dimensional problems because of the nonlinearities it is difficult to prove the non oscillatory property of a numerical scheme for two dimensional problems therefore the behaviors of a two dimensional shock capturing scheme are usually characterized based on practical experiences and numerical experiments this study revealed general features of the shock capturing schemes implemented in funwave tvd it would be difficult to conclude which is the best of the five schemes due to their pros and cons in different applications although mlp3 is more stable and also has a reasonable accuracy it is computationally more demanding for some practical applications model accuracy may be compromised by robustness and computational efficiency more characteristics of the shock capturing schemes may be found in a wide variety of different applications in a future study

24080,in this study we assessed the performance of five shock capturing type reconstruction schemes in modeling shallow water waves implemented in the public domain boussinesq model funwave tvd the five shock capturing schemes include two fourth order monotonic upwind scheme for conservation laws total variation diminishing muscl tvd schemes with the minimod and van leer limiters respectively a second order muscl tvd scheme with the van leer limiter a fifth order weighted essentially non oscillatory weno scheme and a third order multi dimensional limiting process mlp scheme numerical simulations on solitary waves and laboratory measurements showed that for one dimensional simulations all five shock capturing schemes maintain non oscillatory properties but exhibit different numerical dissipations numerical dissipation can be affected by both the order of shock capturing schemes and choice of limiters the van leer limiter is more dissipative than minimod when used in fourth order schemes which is different from what would be inferred from the linear analysis for the second order for two dimensional problems the shock capturing schemes can generate either fewer or more high frequency oscillations depending on the applied courant friedrichs lewy cfl number the most stable results occur in the second order muscl tvd scheme with the van leer limiter which has large numerical dissipation and the third order mlp scheme which has the ability to control the oscillations in multi dimensional simulations the wavelet analysis showed that high frequency oscillations usually occur at later time and thus affect long time simulation decreasing the cfl number is an effective way of reducing high frequency oscillations in two dimensional applications models with different shock capturing schemes can predict similar strength and patterns of wave induced currents in the breaking wave application however the analysis based on the vorticity or enstrophy integral of the square of the vorticity calculations show that the schemes with higher numerical dissipation have more significant damping effect on the vorticity field which may affect the model accuracy in predicting wave current interaction in a long time simulation keywords shock capturing schemes limiters boussinesq model funwave tvd numerical instability numerical dissipation 1 introduction with increasing technological advancements in computational resources it is becoming more feasible to apply a phase resolving boussinesq wave model in a large domain 10 km for a long period of time hours to calculate wave statistics nearshore circulation patterns and morphological evolution in coastal regions the development of a numerically stable and accurate boussinesq solver is necessary for such applications in the last two decades aligned with improvements in the boussinesq theories the numerical methods for solving the boussinesq equations have been greatly enhanced kirby 2016 because the boussinesq equations contain third order derivatives in dispersive terms a higher order numerical scheme is needed in order to move leading order truncation errors to one order higher than the dispersive terms approaches to development of numerical implementations for the boussinesq equations include a wide range of finite difference finite volume or finite element formulations most of which have fourth order accuracy a typical example of a higher order scheme is the finite difference scheme developed by wei and kirby 1995 who used a mixed order difference scheme in space and the fourth order adams bashforth moulton abm scheme in time however finite difference and finite element numerical models for boussinesq equations proved to be noisy in practice requiring filters to suppress spurious oscillations near shorelines and for breaking waves kirby et al 1998 walkley and berzins 2002 the issue of numerical noise from a boussinesq solver has been recognized by a number of researchers such as liu 1995 who pointed out that when the boussinesq equations are solved numerically high frequency oscillations can occur and cause numerical instability models based on the high order finite difference schemes are basically weakly unstable at high wavenumbers near the grid nyquist limit leading to the need for intermittent or even fairly frequent filtering in addition a filtering application is usually case dependent making it difficult to tune for long simulations recently the vast majority of boussinesq models have shifted to a hybrid method combining finite volume and finite difference tvd schemes boussinesq models with a tvd type solver provide more stable solutions compared to their finite difference counterparts and have shown robust performance in modeling breaking waves and coastal inundation erduran et al 2005 shiach and mingham 2009 tonelli and petti 2009 roeber et al 2010 shi et al 2012a roeber and cheung 2012 kazolea and delis 2013 the concept of tvd was introduced initially by harten 1983 who proved that if the total variation of a discretized variable does not increase with time the scheme preserves monotonicity tvd is then used as a terminology to represent a property of numerical schemes in solving hyperbolic partial differential equations a tvd scheme is also called shock capturing scheme because it enables sharp shock predictions and avoids non physical spurious oscillations in the solution a linear tvd scheme has only first order accuracy which can be proved by godunov s theorem toro 1999 to get a higher order accuracy nonlinear techniques are usually used in a tvd scheme such as slope limiters typically there are a number of tvd type numerical schemes used in computational fluid dynamics in the developments of shallow water wave models godunov type schemes toro 1999 and weno type schemes jiang and shu 1996 are two popular shock capturing schemes used in solving either boussinesq or green naghdi wave equations the boussinesq model equations are constructed by basic terms of the nonlinear shallow water equations which can be easily handled using the tvd finite volume method along with the dispersive terms that can be implemented using finite differencing various finite volume formulations have been used in the recent development of boussinesq wave models the fourth order muscl tvd scheme by yamamoto and daiguji 1993 has been used in many studies e g erduran et al 2005 kim et al 2009 tonelli and petti 2009 shi et al 2012a and remained a popular choice for solving boussinesq equations however in the recent applications of the standard fourth order muscl scheme numerical instabilities were found for long time simulations such as in abadie et al 2012 who used the tvd version of the fully nonlinear boussinesq model funwave tvd to model tsunami waves generated by the flank collapse of the cumbre vieja volcano they chose the second order scheme a third order scheme was cited in their paper but later confirmed to be second order instead of the fourth order to run their simulations similar instability issues were also observed by other model users and recognized that the instability may occur mostly in long time simulations erduran et al 2005 pointed out that the choice of limiters used in the fourth order muscl tvd scheme may affect model results in particular numerical instability in solving the improved boussinesq equations derived by madsen and s√∏ rensen 1992 they suggested the fourth order muscl scheme with the van leer limiter as the most suitable one because the van leer limiter provides a smoother extrema of a discontinuous solution than the other limiters they tested however numerical accuracy of tvd schemes can be compromised at the smooth extrema of the solution even though a high order accuracy scheme is used gottlieb et al 2011 shu 2003 showed the degeneration of the accuracy in the tvd scheme after long time computations in solving the euler equations in comparison to muscl tvd schemes the weighted essentially non oscillatory weno scheme jiang and shu 1996 can represent not only sharp discontinuities but also smooth extrema of the solution recently the fifth order weno scheme has been applied in solving the shallow water equations li and raichlen 2002 xing and shu 2005 choi and seo 2017 and the weakly nonlinear boussinesq equations zhou et al 2016 as an alternative shock capturing scheme the multi dimensional limiting process mlp has been devised for preventing numerical oscillations occurring in multi dimensional flows kim and kim 2005 in a rectangular grid the muscl tvd and weno schemes just consider one way limiting processes for two dimensional problems however mlp can take into account multi dimensional shock discontinuity and provide a good convergence in two dimensional flows in the latest study roeber and cheung 2012 have employed the third order mlp to solve nwogu s 1993 weakly nonlinear boussinesq equations funwave tvd is a public domain model in the nearshore and coastal community it is in high demand among ocean and coastal researchers modeling nearshore waves wave driven currents ship wakes tsunami and sediment transport since the first official release of funwave tvd which was based on shi et al 2012a the model has been improved in several aspects including more numerical schemes options an efficient non iterative solver and additional model components for simulating ship wakes shi et al 2018 meteo tsunamis woodruff et al 2018 and sediment transport tehranirad et al 2016 malej et al 2018 in this study we present five shock capturing schemes implemented in funwave tvd including three muscl tvd schemes a high order weno scheme and an mlp scheme the scope of this study is to assess the performance of different shock capturing schemes in modeling shallow water surface waves and provide a guidance for future applications of shock capturing schemes in boussinesq type wave models in the next section a brief description of the funwave tvd model is presented five shock capturing schemes including the newly implemented muscl tvd high order weno scheme and mlp scheme are described in section 3 in section 4 we present three basic numerical tests to examine the performance of the five numerical schemes in simulating one dimensional and two dimensional problems section 5 provides a summary of test results 2 boussinesq model funwave tvd funwave tvd is a fully nonlinear boussineq wave model discretized by a godunov type riemann solver with a tvd scheme shi et al 2012a it was developed based on a more complete set of fully nonlinear boussinesq equations with the vertical vorticity correction derived by chen 2006 and a time varying reference elevation introduced by kennedy et al 2001 in addition shi et al 2012a reformulated the surface gradient term using the technique suggested by rogers et al 2003 to secure a well balanced solution the equations are reorganized into a conservative form to facilitate computations with a hybrid numerical scheme the set of conservative boussinesq equations in funwave tvd can be written as

numerical dissipation the equations are solved using the muscl tvd scheme up to the fourth order accuracy yamamoto and daiguji 1993 within the riemann solver along with the third order time stepping runge kutta method gottlieb and shu 1998 the standard muscl tvd scheme will be described in the next section in conjunction with the new schemes added for this study by taking advantage of the shock capturing numerical scheme in the riemann solver wave breaking can be modeled by locally switching to the nonlinear shallow water equations nswe when the local ratio of the surface elevation to the water depth exceeds a certain threshold the eddy viscosity type breaking scheme developed in the previous version kennedy et al 2001 was also carried over to the tvd version as an optional breaking scheme the terms r b x r b y in eqs 2 and 3 express the eddy viscosity type breaking terms as below 9 r b x x ŒΩ x h u Œ± y ŒΩ y h u Œ± 10 r b y x ŒΩ x h v Œ± y ŒΩ y h v Œ± 11 ŒΩ b Œ¥ b 2 h Œ∑ Œ∑ t b

1991 in 11 b has the value of 0 or 1 representing the switch between non breaking and breaking a breaking event begins when Œ∑t exceeds an initial threshold Œ∑ t i c 1 g h when wave breaking develops the wave will continue to break until Œ∑t becomes lower than the second threshold Œ∑ t f c 2 g h where c 2 c 1 note that in kennedy et al 2000 b varies smoothly from 0 to 1 to avoid an impulsive start of breaking and the resulting instability in the present version a constant b 1 is adopted as breaking is initiated because there is no instability issue related to wave breaking the eddy viscosity type breaking scheme was found to provide more accurate breaking wave solutions compared to the nswe based breaker particularly for predicting breaking undular bores or solitons as pointed out by shi et al 2018 thus the eddy viscosity breaker is used in the following numerical experiments time stepping is adaptive based on the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition the time step Œ¥t is computed by 12 Œ¥ t cfl min min Œ¥ x u g h min Œ¥ y v g h where cfl is the courant number Œ¥x and Œ¥y are grid sizes in the x and y directions respectively the code was parallelized using the message passing interface mpi domain decomposition with non blocking communication the model has been validated against a suite of benchmark test data in applications of wave shoaling breaking wave induced nearshore

limiters such as superbee minmod van albada and van leer in their experiments using the boussinesq equations of madsen and s√∏ rensen 1992 but showed that the van leer limiter required the proper number of grid points per wavelength to prevent numerical dissipation 3 3 the second order muscl tvd scheme ms2 vanleer for the second order muscl tvd scheme with the van leer limiter the cell

studies the first case is the simulation of a solitary wave in which the numerical dissipation and its effect on propagation speed are investigated for different schemes the second case is a simulation of the laboratory experiments of luth et al 1994 which is the standard one dimensional benchmark test used by many model developers e g gobbi et al 2000 the last case is simulation of the laboratory experiments by vincent and briggs 1989 who measured the refraction and diffraction of waves propagating over a two dimensional submerged shoal this test case is used to examine performance of the different orders of schemes and limiters in handling two dimensional calculations 4 1 solitary wave experiment simulations of a solitary wave propagating over a constant depth were conducted using the five shock capturing schemes the analytical solution of a solitary wave was used as an initial condition in the model the analytical expression of the initial values of Œ∑ uŒ± is based on wei and kirby 1995 who derived an approximate analytical solution to the boussinesq model equations assuming weak nonlinearity a solitary wave with wave height of 0 5 m was specified with the peak located at x 200 m in a 1d flume x 0 4500 m with a constant depth of 1 0 m the grid size is 0 05 m the time step is automatically adjusted based on the cfl condition 12 and cfl 0 5 was used similar to the observation in wei and kirby 1995 the initial solitary wave given by the analytical solution evolves with the result that a slightly higher solitary wave is formed together with a small dispersive tail due to the mismatch between the weekly nonlinear solution and the fully nonlinear model for the given solitary wave with the amplitude to depth ratio of 0 5 the wave form is adjusted in a short period of time with the predicted wave height first decreasing and then reaching a stable height the wave height ends up as 0 534 m at about t 20 s in all cases indicating the stable solution is not affected by the different schemes table 1 lists the wave height changes from the maximum wave height h 1 to the wave height h 2 at t 1000 s and the percentage changes damping rate over 1000 s for all test cases the results from ms4 vanleer mlp3 and ms2 vanleer show more obvious damping than weno5 and ms4 minmod weno5 and ms4 minmod show a similar damping rate and have the least numerical dissipation with the second order accuracy ms2 vanleer is the most dissipative compared to the higher order schemes quantitatively a decrease of 6 4 in wave amplitude can be found in ms2 vanleer over the time period of 1000 s while only 1 7 was found in weno5 and ms4 minmod the solitary wave speed predicted by a numerical model can be affected by both numerical dispersion and numerical diffusion numerical dispersion can contaminate the physical dispersion and thus change the wave phase speed numerical diffusion can damp the wave and thus slow down wave propagation due to the decreased wave amplitude in an application of the shock capturing scheme solitary phase error is believed to be caused by the numerical diffusion due to the use of a limiter kim et al 2009 fig 1 illustrates snapshots of solitary wave solutions at t 1000 s from the different schemes here we also include the result from the same ms4 minmod scheme but a different parameter b 1 1 to facilitate the discussion below the results from weno5 and ms4 minmod are almost identical because they have nearly the same damping rate as shown in table 1 the wave speeds predicted by mlp3 ms4 vanleer and ms2 vanleer are 0 60 0 87 and 1 42 slower than that of weno5 respectively it is interesting to note that the minmod limiter is less dissipative than the van leer limiter when it is combined with the fourth order scheme this is inconsistent with the finding in sanders and bradford 2006 who suggested that the minmod limiter is more diffusive than the van leer in their study a lower order second order in their analysis scheme was used to confirm sanders and bradford s 2006 conclusion we used the same example of the solitary wave propagation but applied the minmod and van leer limiters in the second order scheme our results not shown indicated that for the second order scheme the minmod limiter is more diffusive than the van leer limiter which is consistent with sanders and bradford s 2006 analysis our results suggest that the two limiters used in the higher order scheme have different behaviors from that in the lower order scheme it should also be mentioned that for the minmod limiter used in the fourth order scheme the numerical dissipation is sensitive to the choice of b value in eqs 15 18 in yamamoto and daiguji 1993 1 b 4 was suggested kim et al 2009 conducted tests of a solitary wave propagation using a range of b from 1 1 to 4 0 in the fourth order scheme their tests showed that the model with b 1 1 is much more dissipative than the model with b 4 0 our test of ms4 minmod with b 1 1 also showed the same feature as shown in fig 1 the phase speed from ms4 minmod with b 1 1 is even slower than that from the second order scheme ms2 vanleer ms4 minmod with b 1 1 was not used in the following tests to compare the grid convergences between the different schemes we used a sequence of different grid size Œ¥x p where Œ¥ x 0 1 m and p 1 2 5 a constant time step Œ¥ t 0 0025 s was used the courant numbers are less than 0 5 for all the cases following shi et al 2001 the convergence rates are demonstrated by the rms differences of simulated surface elevations at t 100 s the rms difference of surface elevation is defined by 50 rms p i 1 m j 1 n Œ∑ p i j Œ∑ p 1 i j 2 m n where Œ∑p denotes the computed surface elevation in the case p m n are the grid dimensions in the case of p 1 fig 2 shows the logarithmic rms differences versus the grid spacing calculated from the different schemes similar decreasing trends slopes of the rms difference with grid refinement can be found in the comparison indicating the similar convergence rates in the different schemes however the magnitudes of the rms difference are quite different between the different models weno5 and ms4 minmod b 4 0 show smaller rms differences than other schemes consistent with the smaller damping rates described earlier 4 2 periodic wave propagation over submerged bar luth et al 1994 the laboratory experiments conducted by beji and battjes 1993 and luth et al 1994 have been widely used as a benchmark test for validating phase resolving wave models such as boussinesq wave models e g gobbi et al 2000 and non hydrostatic wave models e g ma et al 2012 beji and battjes 1993 and luth et al 1994 have the same geometric configuration as shown in fig 3 except that the length scale in luth et al is twice as large as that in beji and battjes in addition luth et al has more measurement station locations in this study we used luth et al s data for model data comparisons note that in fig 3 we re scaled the geometry to the scale used in beji and battjes 1993 and shifted the horizontal coordinate to the left by 10 m in order to specify a wavemaker at x 10 m and a sponge layer in x 0 5 m the experiment set up includes a flat bottom of 0 4 m depth in front and back of the bar a front slope of 1 20 and back slope of 1 10 measurement locations are denoted by station 1 10 with the horizontal coordinates in meters the measurement at x 15 7 m before the toe of the slope is not used because of the phase mismatch in the data gobbi and kirby 1999 the experiments are usually used to investigate the frequency dispersion characteristics and nonlinear interaction during wave propagation over a complicated geometry as the wave propagates on the slope of the submerged bar wave shoaling and amplification of bound harmonics occur through the energy transfer from the leading wave to higher harmonics as the wave re enters the deeper water on the lee side of the bar these higher harmonics are released as free waves gobbi et al 2000 a numerical simulation of this process requires a model with high accuracy in predicting wave dispersion and nonlinearity the non breaking wave case with the wave amplitude of 0 01 m and wave period of 2 02 s was simulated in the numerical simulations the grid size of 0 02 m and cfl 0 5 are used in the model fig 4 compares the time series of surface elevation at st 1 st 10 obtained from all five numerical schemes as well as the data all models perform quite well for stations up to the top of the bar st 1 st 6 as the waves pass the back slope of the bar the model results start to deviate from the data because the model with accuracy to the o Œº 2 cannot predict well the higher harmonics in other words the higher harmonics or short waves do not necessarily fall in the required weakly dispersive boussinesq Œº k h 1 regime the results of all numerical schemes look similar with visible differences only appearing at st 8 st 10 to quantify the differences more precisely the model effectiveness across different schemes was evaluated using the measure developed by willmott 1981 expressed by 51 g 1 i 1 n x i x d i 2 i 1 n x i x d x d i x d 2 where xd i represents the experimental data x i is the numerical solution and x d is the mean value of xd i n denotes the number of data samples points g 1 means a perfect agreement between the numerical solution and the data whereas g 0 represents a complete disagreement table 2 lists the model efficacy calculated at st 1 st 10 for all five numerical schemes although some differences in model accuracy are noticeable especially at st 7 st 8 the numbers in table 2 do not sufficiently lead to a conclusion that one scheme is better than the other the model data comparisons suggest that for simulations of luth et al s experiment the computational errors are mainly due to the theoretical approximation rather than the errors from the numerical schemes tests with a smaller grid size 0 01 m were also conducted to examine the consistency and convergence the models with the smaller grid size performed similarly to the former ones indicating the converged solutions of the different schemes are close to each other no high frequency oscillations were observed in any of the tested shock capturing schemes 4 3 vincent and briggs experiments vincent and briggs 1989 conducted laboratory experiments to investigate such nearshore processes as wave refraction diffraction shoaling and wave breaking as waves propagated over a submerged shoal in their experiments both monochromatic and irregular waves with frequency directional spreading were tested including both non breaking and breaking waves over the years multiple numerical studies of these particular laboratory experiments have been carried out by a number of researchers who used this dataset to validate models based on different wave modeling theories for example choi et al 2009 used the data to examine the performance of the coupled ref dif shorecirc and swan shorecirc models and the initial version of funwave wei and kirby 1995 they noted that for breaking wave cases wave induced currents behind the shoal cause wave defocusing and thus result in a wave shadow zone with lower wave heights therefore the inclusion of the wave induced currents in the wave model component is important for the wave circulation coupled models in comparison to the wave current coupled models the phase resolving boussinesq model funwave is more capable of simulating wave transformation properties such as wave reflection refraction and diffraction for instance wave reflection is not included in ref dif and swan in addition swan is not able to predict the transverse interference patterns due to wave diffraction even though the decoupled diffraction terms were added in the model holthuijsen et al 2003 moreover funwave calculates both waves and currents therefore the wave current interaction is automatically included choi et al 2009 showed that funwave performs better in simulating both non breaking and breaking wave cases than the wave current coupled models in this study we examined two monochromatic wave cases including non breaking and breaking waves with the purpose of testing model performance in two dimensional simulations the model setup was based on the laboratory configuration as shown in fig 5 the center of the submerged shoal is located at x y 6 1 12 5 m the water depth is 0 4572 m except over the shoal which can be formulated by 52 h 0 9144 0 7620 1 x 3 81 2 y 4 95 2 0 5 where x and y are localized coordinates centered at the shoal crest eq 52 results in the depth of 0 1524 m at the shoal crest note that the actual computational domain was larger than the domain shown in fig 5 grid extensions were made to both left and right boundaries in order to allow more space for an internal wavemaker as well as the sponge layers on the both sides of the grid edge 4 3 1 non breaking wave case in the non breaking wave case monochromatic waves with a wave height of 0 0254 m and a period of 1 3 s were generated to demonstrate wave focusing and diffraction patterns fig 6 shows the distribution of wave heights normalized by the incident wave height in the model of mlp3 large wave heights can be observed behind the shoal due to wave focusing processes strong transverse oscillations in wave height distribution can be found behind the shoal which are consistent with the laboratory data to check the model convergence with an increasing grid refinement for different schemes convergence tests were performed using varying grid sizes fig 7 illustrates wave height distributions along section 4 from models with grid sizes from 0 1 m to 0 025 m compared to the data in vincent and briggs 1989 wave heights in the monochromatic wave case were analyzed using the collected data over a time period of 36 4 s 28 wave periods 28t hereafter the same time period was used for calculating wave heights for the numerical simulation for Œ¥ x Œ¥ y 0 1 m differences in wave height distribution are obvious between different schemes in particular wave heights from ms4 vanleer mlp3 and ms2 vanleer are generally lower than that from weno5 and ms4 minmod this behavior is consistent with the findings in the solitary wave tests which compared numerical dissipation among the different schemes as the grid size decreased the differences between the schemes reduced fig 7 c shows the results from Œ¥ x Œ¥ y 0 025 m the deviations among the different schemes are now minimal indicating all models converge at this grid size hence Œ¥ x Œ¥ y 0 025 m will be used for the rest of the tests it should be mentioned however that the models over predicted wave heights in line with the result of choi et al 2009 who used the initial version of funwave without a shock capturing scheme the possible reason for the over prediction is that bottom friction was not applied in the model to examine model stability for a long time simulation we extended the computational time to 1000 s interestingly both weno5 and ms4 minmod cannot survive the long simulation without decreasing the cfl number fig 8 shows a snapshot of the surface elevation along section 4 in the results the cfl numbers were reduced to smaller values as shown in the legends of the figure in weno5 and ms4 minmod to complete the 1000 s simulation it can be seen that even with the reduced cfl values high frequency spurious oscillations or noises still appear in weno5 and ms4 minmod in contrast both the ms4 vanleer and mlp3 models were able to complete the 1000 s simulation with only minimal amount of visible high frequency oscillations decreasing the cfl number from 0 5 to 0 4 improved the numerical instabilities for the cases of ms4 vanleer and mlp3 as shown in fig 8 c and d an instability problem was not found in ms2 vanleer using cfl 0 5 in the long time simulation as shown in fig 8 e fig 9 shows the morlet wavelet spectra of the time series of surface elevation at the central point of section 4 for weno5 with cfl 0 3 ms4 minimod with cfl 0 3 ms4 vanleer with cfl 0 5 mlp3 with cfl 0 5 and ms2 vanleer with cfl 0 5 from top to bottom ms4 vanleer mlp3 and ms2 vanleer provided horizontal strips at frequencies lower than 2 0 hz with constant magnitudes over the entire simulation time the peak frequency of the spectrum is at 0 7692 hz which is the input wave frequency weno5 predicted a constant spectrum until t 100 s then high frequency waves occurred for ms4 minimod high frequency oscillations appear later around t 330 s and are weaker than that in weno5 the frequencies of the numerical oscillations are in the range of 2 5 4 hz which are much lower than the frequencies associated with the grid nyquist limit 11 hz based on the grid size of 0 025 m the oscillatory behavior of the two dimensional application of shock capturing schemes has been discussed by several researchers such as kim and kim 2005 our tests showed that the schemes with smaller numerical dissipation such as weno5 and ms4 minmod can cause more obvious oscillations than the dissipative schemes such as ms4 vanleer and ms2 vanleer an effective way to reduce high frequency oscillations is to decrease the cfl number especially for a long time simulation 4 3 2 breaking wave case large waves with a wave height of 0 135 m and a period of 1 3 s were generated in the breaking wave case for modeling breaking waves high frequency oscillations with high wavenumber near the grid nyquist limit usually occur in boussinesq models with higher order finite difference schemes wei and kirby 1995 liu 1995 kennedy et al 2000 pointed out that a major source of noise is related to the eddy viscosity formulation for modeling wave breaking in the breaking wave case model accuracy and numerical instability of different shock capturing schemes were examined the breaking parameters c 1 0 45 and c 2 0 35 needed for 11 were applied in the resulting analysis the first 9 1 s of the simulation data were removed in order to align with the laboratory experiments fig 10 shows the model data comparisons of wave height distribution along section 4 wave heights were calculated using 36 4 s 28 t of simulation time series the same as in the laboratory experiments all the models predicted wave defocusing due to the strong wave induced current behind the shoal which will be described below differences in wave height distribution among different schemes were small except for slightly larger wave heights were found in weno5 to examine the effects of the different schemes on modeling wave breaking we compare the wave height distributions along the central section y 12 5 m of the tank predicted by the different models as shown in fig 11 the wave breaking point can be identified by the peak of wave height distribution appearing on the shoal the comparison shows that the breaking locations predicted by the different models are very close and the wave height distribution is not affected much by the different numerical schemes for modeling the wave induced nearshore circulation using a boussinesq wave model a non zero bottom friction term is usually needed to balance the frictional force and the gradient of the radiation stresses and pressure without a bottom friction modeled wave induced currents will grow with time and eventually become unrealistically strong in a long time simulation in this study we neglected the bottom friction term intentionally in order to evaluate the numerical dissipation and instability the model data comparison shown in fig 10 indicates that the models without the bottom friction predicted the wave current interaction reasonably well in the initial time period of 36 4 s for data analysis longer simulations were also carried out in order to explore the evolution of wave induced circulation affected by different numerical schemes the development of wave induced currents is demonstrated by the results from the model with the mlp3 scheme as shown in fig 12 the currents were calculated by averaging wave velocity components u v over 28 t the left panel shows the current field obtained by averaging the first 28 t wave induced currents concentrate on the shoal with two circulation cells and a jet behind the shoal as time elapses the wave induced currents intensify downstream forming strong jet like currents as shown in the middle panel which was from the second 28 t then the strong jet like currents diverge into two symmetric circulation cells near the right boundary as shown in the right panel which was from the third 28 t the wave induced circulation continues to evolve and become asymmetric at a later time not shown in the current paper arising from the lack of the bottom friction for the longer time simulations a smaller courant number cfl 0 3 was adopted to guarantee stable solutions for all schemes except weno5 weno5 had an instability problem even with cfl further reduced tested up to cfl 0 05 fig 13 compares the current fields vectors and the fields of vertical vorticity œâ color unit 1 s obtained in the third 28t from ms4 minmod mlp3 ms4 vanleer and ms2 vanleer weno5 not shown because of an instability problem wave induced currents calculated from different schemes are qualitatively identical suggesting that the models with different shock capturing schemes except weno5 can predict similar circulation patterns as long as the numerical instability can be suppressed by using small cfl numbers however the intensity of the vorticity field from ms4 minmod is higher than that from the other three schemes for a detailed comparison fig 14 provides a sectional view of the vorticity distribution along x 16 25 m where the peaks of vorticity values appear in the four cases in contrast to the other three cases visibly larger peaks of vorticity can be found in the case of ms4 minmod the generation of vertical vorticity in a boussinesq type wave model can be explained by the vorticity conservation equation derived by chen 2006 and others the major source of vorticity generation is the dissipation term associated with wave breaking although the numerical dissipation can also be a source of vorticity generation it seems to play a minor role in this case in fact it rather dissipates vorticity as indicated in the model model comparisons with the least amount of numerical dissipation the model with ms4 minmod predicted the largest peaks of vorticity among the tested cases the strength of the vorticity can also be measured by integrating the enstrophy œâ 2 2 over the whole computational domain the results are 7 23 6 25 6 15 and 6 02 103 1 s 2 respectively for ms4 minmod ms4 vanleer mlp3 and ms2 vanleer the results indicate that the enstrophy is strongly correlated with numerical dissipation and decreases due to the dissipation inherent to a numerical scheme the larger vorticity or current magnitude in ms4 minmod alters wave distribution patterns due to the wave refraction by the currents fig 15 compares wave height distributions along the same transect as fig 14 from all four numerical schemes different from the other three schemes the wave height peaks from ms4 minmod appear to be shifted into the center of the domain due to the refraction by stronger currents overall for the wave breaking case ms4 vanleer mlp3 and ms2 vanleer have similar damping effects on vorticity fields which may affect the model accuracy in predicting wave induced currents and wave current interaction in a long time simulation ms4 minmod has less numerical dissipation but suffers from an instability problem for a large cfl parameter weno5 also has instability problems for the 2d breaking wave case which is consistent with the findings of kim and kim 2005 the instability problems are caused by the oscillations at higher frequencies similar to those shown in the non breaking wave case which are lower than the frequencies associated with the grid nyquist limit 5 conclusions and remarks in this study we implemented five shock capturing numerical schemes in the public domain boussinesq model funwave tvd the five shock capturing schemes include two fourth order muscl tvd schemes with the minimod and van leer limiters ms4 minimod and ms4 vanleer a second order muscl tvd scheme with the van leer limiter ms2 vanleer a fifth order weno scheme weno5 and a third order mlp scheme mlp3 performance of the five shock capturing schemes were assessed using numerical experiments for both one and two dimensional problems numerical experiments of a progressive solitary wave showed that the numerical dissipation can be affected by both the order of the shock capturing scheme and the choice of limiter the higher order schemes generally have less numerical dissipation compared to the lower order schemes however for ms4 minimod the choice of the parameter b where 1 b 4 can significantly affect the numerical dissipation the model with a smaller b e g b 1 1 is even more dissipative than the second order scheme ms2 vanleer the van leer and minimod limiters behave differently when they are used in different orders of muscl schemes although it has been proved in theory that the minmod limiter is more dissipative than the van leer limiter when they are used in the second order schemes our numerical experiments showed the minmod limiter is less dissipative than the van leer limiter when employed in the fourth order schemes weno5 is the least dissipative whereas ms2 vanleer is the most dissipative among the five shock capturing schemes for a one dimensional problem the five shock capturing schemes perform similarly for the converging grid configuration in the simulations of luth et al 1994 model data comparisons show that all models agree well with the data the differences in numerical schemes and limiters do not lead to apparent discrepancies in model results in the one dimensional simulations for a two dimensional problem the five shock capturing schemes behave differently in the non breaking case of vincent and briggs 1989 experiments the models with less dissipative schemes such as weno5 and ms4 minimod converge faster than other schemes in grid refinements however the schemes with smaller numerical dissipation can generate high frequency oscillations in long time simulations the wavelet analysis showed that high frequency oscillations usually occur at a later time and thus affect long time simulations the frequencies of the numerical oscillations are much lower than the frequencies associated with the grid nyquist limit decreasing the cfl parameter is an effective way to reduce high frequency oscillations among the higher order schemes the mlp3 generates the least amount of noise because of its ability to control high frequency oscillations in two dimensions in the breaking wave case the models with different schemes predicted similar strength and pattern of wave induced circulation as well as wave defocusing due to wave current interaction longer time simulations showed that ms4 vanleer mlp3 and ms2 vanleer have similar damping effects on vorticity fields which may affect the model accuracy in predicting wave induced currents in a long time simulation weno5 is the most unstable scheme for two dimensional simulations it failed to complete a longer time simulation of the breaking wave case even with a very small cfl number because the shock capturing schemes were developed based on one dimen sional flow physics the direct extension to two dimensional flows using dimensional splitting may change the non oscillatory characteristics proved in one dimensional flows kim and kim 2005 pointed out that most multi dimensional schemes do not show monotonic behavior across a multi dimensional discontinuity especially for higher order schemes the mathematical analysis of a non oscillatory scheme is usually based on the one dimensional advection equation which may not be suitable for two dimensional problems because of the nonlinearities it is difficult to prove the non oscillatory property of a numerical scheme for two dimensional problems therefore the behaviors of a two dimensional shock capturing scheme are usually characterized based on practical experiences and numerical experiments this study revealed general features of the shock capturing schemes implemented in funwave tvd it would be difficult to conclude which is the best of the five schemes due to their pros and cons in different applications although mlp3 is more stable and also has a reasonable accuracy it is computationally more demanding for some practical applications model accuracy may be compromised by robustness and computational efficiency more characteristics of the shock capturing schemes may be found in a wide variety of different applications in a future study

24081,this paper proposes a buoy independent directional calibration methodology that uses satellite altimeter data to correct the simultaneous wind sea and all swell partitions available from wave hindcasts the proposed technique was applied to a 20 year wave hindcast in the new zealand region and showed promising results the method could potentially be applied worldwide to fully assess systematic errors in wind sea and swell partitions keywords hindcast satellite data directional sea and swell correction 1 introduction wave climate data is fundamental to a variety of applications ranging from scientific studies to the assessment of hazards coastal and offshore structures may be either under designed or over designed due to the uncertainty in the wave data leading to significant economical and operational risks bitner gregersen et al 1995 in coastal management wave climate data is used to study the seasonal and long term sediment budget which in turn is related to coastal vulnerability and risk assessment international transport tourism and commerce activities also rely on wave climate data as it can be used to provide optimal ship routing finally a number of atmospheric studies also require estimations of air and sea interaction derived from wave climate young 1999 wave climate data is commonly sourced from observations such as in situ buoys and satellite measurements another source for wave climate data are wave hindcasts or wave reanalysis from numerical simulations each of the aforementioned sources has its advantages and limitations buoys provide valuable time series of local wave climate variables such as wave height period and direction among others however mostly due to their high operational cost the data provided usually covers a short time span eventually presenting gaps due to failure or maintenance another issue related to buoys is their spatial coverage particularly in the southern hemisphere satellite altimeters have near global coverage and provide measurements along a continuous pass that is defined by the satellite s orbit however for a given location the data is available only at each satellite pass and for a short period of time altimeter data accuracy varies between missions tending to overestimate low wave heights and underestimate high wave heights queffeulou and croiz√© fillon 2017 hence the data requires post processing and cross validation with buoys and other altimeters in order to assess and correct the errors in the measurements table 3 from zieger et al 2009 shows a list of altimeter missions and their respective errors compared to buoys average of 17 cm after quality control calibration and validation procedures altimeter readings may also not be available or reliable especially in the presence of rain sea ice or within the transition up to 50 km offshore between land and sea tournadre et al 2009 shanas et al 2014 sepulveda et al 2015 despite the requirement of calibration cross validation and data quality control these two approaches are capable of delivering accurate and reliable wave information however given their limitation in temporal and spatial coverage they may not always be suitable for all research purposes the time and space reproduction of wave fields provided by numerical models has allowed filling the temporal and spatial gaps from instrumental data wave hindcasts are a source for wave climate data at locations where the in situ measurements are unavailable or nonexistent bitner gregersen and de valk 2008 wave models use wind forcings from atmospheric reanalysis to simulate the interaction between wind water and bathymetry the resulting wave hindcast is usually a simplified representation of what occurs in the real world and each hindcast point carries the information about the sea conditions e g directional spectra and bulk parameters such as significant wave height hs peak period tp direction Œ∏ etc at a given time as one might expect the more detailed the bathymetry wind forcings and modeled physics the more accurate is the wave hindcast wave hindcasts also present issues and limitations cavaleri and bertotti 2004 demonstrated that due to the changes in the surface roughness length at the land sea interface the interpolation between land and sea in a coarse resolution grid results in lower wind speeds in atmospheric and reanalysis models the underestimation of the wind fields can propagate and affect wave generation for up to several hundred kilometers offshore also it is possible for the same wave model to produce different results for the same location and time span when distinct reanalysis wind fields are used as input lavidas et al 2017 at the same time different wave models can provide different results when the same wind fields are provided caires et al 2004 even though these inhomogeneities can be addressed by fine tuning the wave model parameters rascle et al 2008 ardhuin et al 2011 stopa et al 2016 among others a validation against instrumental data must still be performed before the hindcast can be used finally wave hindcasts can present different biases depending on the location of comparison against instrumental data caires et al 2004 in order to maximize the benefits that hindcasts have offered to the scientific community several studies have proposed techniques to correct hindcast errors a nonparametric method to correct model data proposed by caires and sterl 2005 was based on a learning dataset built with simultaneous hindcast and instrumental data the errors in hs observed in the learning dataset are then used to estimate and correct the wave height at points where no instrumental data is available the technique was applied to a 40 year dataset from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts re analysis era 40 and was able to improve the reanalysis another approach for calibration was presented by cavaleri and sclavo 2006 and tested in the mediterranean sea concurrent satellite and buoy data at a given point were paired and the best fit coefficient for the point was then used to calibrate a 0 5 resolution wave hindcast tomas et al 2008 developed a spatial calibration method based on empirical orthogonal functions and applied it to the western mediterranean the approach used the spatial correlation between different hindcast points to extend the calibration data finally m√≠nguez et al 2011 demonstrated the benefits of taking into account the mean wave direction in the correction procedure a fit between hindcast buoy and satellite data using a non linear model the aforementioned works contributed significantly to the understanding of the causes for hindcast inaccuracies and to the development of techniques to limit their effect however these studies also have limitations in caires and sterl 2005 the distance between the learning dataset and the points to be corrected limited the quality of the calibration also both caires and sterl 2005 and cavaleri and sclavo 2006 did not consider the spatial distribution of the correction an issue later addressed by tomas et al 2008 which in turn assumed an a priori distribution of data throughout the analyzed area something that may not be valid for all cases the study of m√≠nguez et al 2011 was one of the first to propose a directional calibration for the significant wave height yet the correction is only based on the bulk wave height and mean wave direction bulk wave parameters which the previous methodologies aim to correct do not represent the simultaneous wave systems snodgrass et al 1966 that can be present in a sea state as an example a sea state may be composed of wind sea waves swell waves and a combination of both wind sea waves are irregular and short crested waves generated by the local wind forcing that have not propagated far from their generation area as wind sea waves disperse across the ocean they grow more and more regular becoming long crested and turning into swell waves holthuijsen 2007 hence information from multimodal directional spectra i e a sea state with more than one wave system generated by different storms is often neglected as the bulk representation focusses on the aggregated wave height and mean direction even for sea states with separated sea and swell partitions the aggregation of the multiple wave systems that might be present in the swell component implies loss of information gerling 1992 moreover the interpolation between ocean and land is recognized as the main reason for the underestimation of local winds and the consequent disparities between modeled and measured wave heights caires and sterl 2005 m√≠nguez et al 2011 recent implementations of third generation wave models i e wavewatch iii tolman et al 2009 included an algorithm hanson and phillips 2001 that performs the spectral partitioning for all wave hindcast grid points providing a detailed description of the sea state composed of a wind sea wave partition and several simultaneous swell partitions this is a definite step forward for improved hindcasts of wave climate 1 1 it is important to acknowledge however that there is no strict definition of when a wind sea wave system becomes swell the partitioning algorithm relies on the wind direction and a directional wave age criterion to define whether a peak in the wave spectra is a wind sea or a swell system hanson and phillips 2001 hence roughly waves that propagate approximately in the same direction as the wind are defined as wind sea and the remaining wave systems are defined as swell eq 5 and fig 2 of hanson and phillips 2001 since partitioned representation of wave hindcasts is becoming popular within the scientific community hegermiller et al 2017 rueda et al 2017 specific corrections for each wave partition sea or swells are desirable and necessary to perform a full validation of the available data rascle et al 2008 stopa et al 2016 this paper proposes a novel directional calibration method that uses satellite data to correct the wave height of the wind sea and swell partitions and applies it to a 20 year wave hindcast rascle and ardhuin 2013 of the new zealand wave climate the significance of the directional calibration for each of the six partitions of the hindcast one for wind sea and the remaining five for different concurrent swells is assessed and compared to the same technique applied to the bulk wave parameter the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the data used while the methodology can be found in section 3 results are shown in section 4 and section 5 discusses the results obtained finally section 6 concludes the work summarizing the main findings 2 data 2 1 hindcast the wave data is provided by ifremer institut fran√ßais de recherche pour l exploitation de la mer and is an accurate and homogeneous series of wave hindcasts also valid for extreme events rascle and ardhuin 2013 the wave database was obtained using the wavewatch iii model version 4 04 with cfsr climate forecast system reanalysis wind forcing and the test451 parametrization proposed by rascle and ardhuin 2013 with improvements for swell dissipation the grid resolution for the new zealand area is 0 5 in both latitude and longitude while the spectral grid consists of 24 directions and 31 frequencies exponentially distributed from 0 037 hz to 0 7 hz rascle and ardhuin 2013 the database consists of a 20 year 1993 2012 three hourly gridded fields with time series of wave parameters such as significant wave height peak period mean direction and directional spread refer to table a 4 from rascle and ardhuin 2013 for the complete list of parameters available the hindcast contains up to six wave partitions i e sets of wave parameters the wind sea waves are represented in the first partition and swells from up to five different wave generation areas propagating with their specific direction and frequency are represented in the five remaining partitions each partition can represent swell systems from any direction and the wave height defines which partition a swell system is assigned to the swell with highest hs is assigned to the first partition the second highest hs to the second partition and so on a local domain covering the range from 165 to 180 e and from 50 to 33 s encompassing new zealand was selected fig 1 since the aim of our methodology is to correct offshore points only the deep water e g more than 200 m depth points of the domain were selected for the calibration procedure 2 2 satellite data all the instrumental data used in this study are derived from satellite altimeters the satellite database was obtained from the esa european space agency globwave project busswell et al 2010 which aims to provide an easy access to integrated and reliable satellite wave data the continuously updated data consists of satellite altimeter measurements from 1985 onwards and includes the ers 1 ers 2 envisat topex poseidon jason 1 jason 2 cryosat and geosat follow on missions among others altimeter readings from satellites have been post processed screened corrected validated cross validated and quality controlled in order to minimize the error in the measurements queffeulou 2004 2006 reducing the bias to an average of less than 10 cm queffeulou et al 2010 compared to buoys a description of the procedures applied to each mission data in order to generate this information as well as the latest database updates can be found in queffeulou and croiz√© fillon 2017 it is important to notice that even tough the corrections significantly improved the accuracy of the satellite readings the aforementioned error is still likely to remain a source of uncertainty 2 3 bathymetry and distance from land two other databases were used for this research the first is a 250 m resolution bathymetry of the new zealand area provided by the national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa the second is a 0 04 distance to the nearest coast database provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the two databases were used to create a filter to avoid the effects of shoaling detected by satellite altimeters but not properly represented by the hindcast due the 0 5 grid resolution and to prevent the use of inaccurate wave height readings caused by land interference in the altimeter s footprint which can persist up to 50 km offshore the new zealand bathymetry presents small shallow areas far from the mainland as well as nearshore deep water areas thus the filter was applied simultaneously to both hindcast and satellite databases fig 1 left shows the 50 km offshore and the 200 m depth filters together with the hindcast and satellite data that were used 3 methodology the procedure presented is based on fitting satellite and hindcast wave heights through a multiple linear regression model the coefficients obtained correction coefficients from the model are applied to the hindcast wave heights in order to minimize the difference between the modeled values and the altimeter measurements two hindcast points are used in this section to illustrate our multiple linear regression approach and compare it to the standard bulk regression model 3 1 data pairing in order to fit the modeled wave hindcast parameters and satellite measurements for each hindcast point criteria regarding temporal and spatial characteristics of each record were applied to merge information from both databases as an example given a hindcast point the spatial criteria must provide satellite data close to the point of interest so that it properly represents the wave conditions at this given location at the same time the more satellite data can be used in the regression the better to define the appropriate maximum distance from the hindcast point where satellite data could be used a sensitivity analysis with radius values from 0 5 to 1 0 was performed the analysis demonstrated that the 1 0 radius provides a satisfactory balance between the amount of satellite data that can be used and the representativeness of the wave conditions fig 1 right shows the satellite data within the 1 0 distance for locations w 173 0e 37 0s and e 176 5e 42 0s once the satellite data points were spatially selected they were paired to the closest sea state in time the hindcast has a 3 hourly temporal resolution hence for a given sea state of a point all the altimeter measurements tracks from different satellites that occurred within 1 30 h before or after the given sea state were averaged and paired to it a scatter plot of all the pairs found over the 20 year hindcast is shown for points w and e see fig 2 the colors reflect the probability density while the horizontal and vertical axis display the hindcast and the satellite hs 3 2 scatter analysis given the location of the two example points w on the west coast of the north island and e on the east coast of the north island one might expect different types of errors for each point the scatter plots from fig 2 indicate that compared to satellite measurements the hindcast fairly represents the wave heights of point w and underestimates the wave heights of point e however by plotting data from location w using different colors to identify the wave direction fig 3 it becomes evident that hindcast wave heights from the s sw green directions are underestimated while hs from the wsw to wnw magenta directions are overestimated the directional error changes according to the point location and can be observed in both wind sea and swell components of the modeled wave heights in terms of wind sea and swell it is possible to plot in distinct colors the modeled wave heights from the sea states where at least 90 of the significant wave height 2 2 calculated as h s w 2 h s a l l 2 where w s e a s w e l l for wind sea and swell sea states is from swell swell dominated or wind sea sea dominated waves fig 4 both plots show satellite measurements on the vertical axis and hindcast results on the horizontal axis the swell wave heights are displayed in red and the wind sea wave heights are displayed in blue for points w left and e right at location w satellite and hindcast of swell wave heights compare well despite the directional issues while the hindcast wind sea wave heights tend to be slightly underestimated point e despite the overall underestimation of hindcast hs does not display a difference between satellite and hindcast data of wind sea and swell the analysis exposes the different errors at each location and how they are related to wave direction and wind sea swell reinforcing the need for the proposed correction 3 3 multiple linear regression model since wave energy varies linearly with the square of the wave amplitude a linear model can be employed the multiple linear regression model used in this study fits the 20 years of paired satellite and hindcast data as follows 1 h s a t 2 a 2 h a l l 2 …õ 2 and provides the coefficient a that minimizes Œµ the variable h refers to hs hsat is the response variable hall is the predictor vector variable a is the vector of regression parameters and Œµ is the error the intercept was not introduced in the statistical model as the large amount of degrees of freedom 32 coefficients for the sea and swell corrections of the directional sectors used is capable of indirectly minimizing any bias eventually present also a sensitivity analysis performed showed no improvements in the correction by adding an intercept to the model in order to correct wind sea and swell significant wave height one can expand eq 1 and substitute h s a l l with 2 h a l l 2 h s e a 2 h s w e l l 2 the resulting equation requires a new set of coefficients a and b to correct both the wind sea and swell wave heights therefore the model is rewritten as 3 h s a t 2 a 2 h s e a 2 b 2 h s w e l l 2 …õ 2 the same relation from eq 2 can be used to model the aggregated swell wave height hswell from eq 3 and the five swell components of a sea state in h s w e l l 2 j 1 5 h s w e l l j 2 as each of the hindcast partitions can present wave systems from any direction the 360 wave directional spectra was split in 16 clockwise directional sectors s0 to s15 of 22 5 degrees where 0 s0 22 5 22 5 s1 45 0 337 5 s15 360 0 these sectors were included in the sea and swell representations of the model by adding coefficients for each possible sector as shown below 4 h s a t 2 i 0 15 a i 2 h i s e a 2 i 0 15 b i 2 h i s w e l l 2 …õ 2 where a i b i i 0 15 represent the correction coefficients for the i th directional sector of the wind sea and swell partitions respectively and h i s e a h i s w e l l i 0 15 represent the wave height present in the i th directional sector of the wind sea and swell partitions notice that while there is only one sector for wind sea waves there may be up to five sectors for swell waves one for each partition whenever more than one swell is present in the same sector at the same time the aggregated wave heights were calculated before inserting the data into the model as an example of how each of the sea states of the hindcast is modeled consider the sea state in table 1 partition p 0 represents the sea component of the sea state with a wave height of 1 864 and a direction of 323 this direction belongs to sector 14 thus the sea part of the model is a 14 2 p 0 2 the swell components shown as p 1 5 represent five different directional sectors to be used in the swell part of the model however as p 2 and p 4 belong to the same directional sector 15 the wave height squares must be aggregated p 2 2 p 4 2 the resulting wave height is used in the model with b 15 while the wave heights of p 1 p 3 and p 5 are associated to b 1 b 6 and b 2 respectively the resulting equation for the sea state in the model in terms of h s s a t and Œµ is 5 h s sat 2 a 14 2 p 0 2 b 1 2 p 1 2 b 2 2 p 5 2 b 6 2 p 3 2 b 15 2 p 2 2 p 4 2 …õ 2 this approach applied to the 20 year paired data provided the calibration coefficients for all the 16 sectors of sea and swell wave heights cavaleri and sclavo 2006 among others mentioned that the regression model requires a minimum amount of data n to find values that are physically plausible the definition of n for each directional sector is based on the assumption that the higher the value of n the more reliable the results i e sectors with a number of samples smaller than n should not be included in the regression the proposed methodology allows all sectors containing data independently of the amount to be fitted into the model the reliability of the coefficients is then assessed based on their 90 confidence interval in general the values obtained by the regression model for this application range between 0 5 and 1 5 while the 90 confidence interval changes according to the data variability within the pairs if the correction coefficients are not statistically different from 1 i e 1 is within the coefficient s 90 confidence interval they are discarded their value is set to 1 and the correction is not performed once the directional coefficients are obtained for sea and swell they are applied to their correspondent partitions and directions for every sea state of the hindcast the comparison of the scatter index si eq 7 calculated before and after the correction provides a quantitative assessment of the accuracy improvement at each hindcast point 3 4 bulk linear regression model to assess the benefits of the proposed methodology when correcting sea and swells the results obtained were compared to a bulk wave parameter calibration technique similar to m√≠nguez et al 2011 the bulk model here described follows the same physical principles of the proposed model however as this bulk model does not distinguish sea and swell waves the equation is assembled according only to the aggregated wave height and mean direction last column of table 1 the bulk representation of the sea state could be modeled as 6 h s s a t 2 a 1 2 p a l l 2 …õ 2 for the example sea state since the mean wave direction is 9 5 first sector the coefficient related to it a 1 is used the same statistical significance criterion used to select the coefficients in the proposed calibration was applied to this method 4 results four types of results are shown in this section i the individual set of coefficients for each hindcast point ii the spatial distribution of the obtained coefficients throughout the study area iii the si 7 s i 1 n i 1 n h s i h s i s a t 2 h s 100 where h s is the averaged significant wave height and iv the spatial distribution of the improvements obtained after applying the correction the sea swell and bulk directional coefficients calculated for the two study cases are presented in table 2 and fig 5 correction coefficients less than 1 0 indicate the sectors where hs is overestimated by the hindcast while values greater than 1 0 indicate sectors where the hindcast hs is less than h s s a t values in bold represent statistically significant coefficients each of the plots in fig 5 shows information about the sea swell and bulk directional coefficients for points w and e respectively the colors represent the correction value and the position of each color indicates the sector where it should be applied the colormap uses blue to represent correction coefficients greater than 1 0 increasing the hindcast hs and red for coefficients smaller than 1 0 reducing the hindcast hs white means no correction due to the absence of data while sectors in grey mean no correction due to the lack of significance of the calculated coefficients for the west coast point w the sectors facing land do not contain enough data to provide a reliable swell coefficient hence the correction for these sectors is mostly for wind sea fig 5 the three sets of coefficients when significant indicate that hindcast waves at point w are mostly over predicted from sectors 11 to 5 clockwise and under predicted from sectors 6 to 9 the comparison between the available wind sea and swell coefficients shows that in sectors 10 and 13 the wind sea waves require more correction than the swell waves while the opposite is observed in the remaining sectors also sector 10 presents divergent correction for wind sea 0 97 and swell 1 01 the bulk coefficients tend to present values between the sea and swell results following a similar trend for the directional correction the east coast study location e also presents variations among the correction coefficients according with the wave direction and type no valid wind sea coefficients were found for sectors 4 9 and 11 the wind sea waves are overestimated in sectors 10 and 12 and underestimated in the remaining sectors in all the sectors the swell wave heights were underestimated and also required higher correction compared to the sea wave heights sectors 10 and 12 also presented diverging corrections for sea and swell with the sea coefficients of 0 93 for both and swell coefficients of 1 18 and 1 32 respectively the results obtained for both locations are consistent with the plots shown in figs 3 and 4 however since the directional plots in fig 3 do not separate swell waves from sea waves the diverging corrections required for sector 10 point w can not be identified at the same time the plots for sea and swell presented in fig 4 used only wind sea and swell dominated sea states with no directional information the individual scatter plots showing the effect of the corrections at the study points are shown in fig 6 in order to provide a better visualization of the directional correction colors were added according to the mean wave direction the first column of plots presents all the sea states followed by the sea dominated and swell dominated sea states all wind sea and swell sea states hereinafter rows 1 and 2 fig 6 display the original and corrected data for point w while rows 3 and 4 present the same information for location e the color bar on the right displays the colors associated with each wave direction in order to facilitate the visualization the number of directional sectors in the figure was reduced to 8 instead of the 16 actually used in the correction the color scale used for both points shows significant differences between the all wind sea and swell predominant directions at each location for point w it is possible to identify the different sectors shifting directions from the non corrected to the corrected plot the overall correction pattern shows that the dots representing the wind sea have been corrected for the positive bias while the swell shows a generalized improvement a similar behavior is observed for the all sea states plot for e it is possible to notice an improvement for waves from different directions both wind sea and swell are underpredicted and the swell data improves more than the wind sea data the all sea states plot similar to point w shows a generalized improvement following the calibration the calibration statistics for the points analyzed are displayed in table 3 results for the all dataset as well as wind sea and swell dominated sea states are presented in columns for points w and e the rows indicate the si from the original hindcast data the resulting si obtained after each type proposed bulk of correction and the percentage of improvement over the original si for both techniques the proposed method has improved skill over the bulk method in all cases the si value of the hindcast for both study points is about 0 11 for the wind sea sea states however while the improvements at location w were about 13 and 12 for the proposed and the bulk corrections at point e the improvement was about 1 6 for the proposed method and 0 9 for the bulk technique this negative result occurred due to the diverging sea and swell coefficients found in sector 10 which can not be properly solved by the single coefficient provided by the bulk model refer to table 2 despite the specific negative result at the same location e the bulk correction of the all sea states resulted in almost 12 5 improvement while the proposed correction presented an accuracy improvement of about 15 6 the correction of the swell sea states presents an opposite behavior to the wind sea correction at these locations at point w the improvement for the swell is of nearly 6 and 4 while point e presents an improvement of 21 and 15 for the proposed and bulk techniques respectively two different statistics were calculated for the whole study area and plotted in fig 7 the first is the si defined in eq 7 applied before and after each correction technique the second is the difference between the averaged 20 year hs hind and hs sat for the original and the corrected h s h i n d 8 Œ¥ h s h s h i n d h s s a t fig 7 first row displays the original si values for the all wind sea and swell sea states followed by the original Œ¥hs the second and third rows fig 7 display the percentage of improvement in the si and the decreasing values of Œ¥hs for the bulk and proposed correction methods the original si for the studied sea states first row of fig 7 is higher close to the shore and decreases in the seaward direction the east coast presents higher values of si than the west coast for all the sea states the original Œ¥hs plot shows overestimated h s h i n d along the west coast and underestimated h s h i n d along the east coast and close to the shore values of Œ¥hs vary from 0 5 to 0 08 m the improvement achieved by the bulk correction is shown in the second row of fig 7 for the all sea states the improvement is higher for the nearshore points of the east coast reaching up to 32 3 the correction at the remote points of the west coast is better than at the east coast the results obtained for the wind sea sea states are better along the west coast than the east coast presenting a maximum improvement of 30 7 for the swell sea states the most noticeable improvements occur for the nearshore points no significant improvement can be noticed in the offshore points of the west coast while similar locations on the east coast show improvements of up to 34 7 the Œ¥hs improves ranging between 0 19 and 0 01 m for the proposed technique third row fig 7 the improvements obtained for the all sea states were larger on the east coast and for nearshore points reaching up to 41 the wind sea and swell sea states results are opposite the first performing better on the west coast and the latter achieving its best results on the east coast maximum values obtained were 32 for the wind sea and 49 for the swell sea states the maximum and minimum Œ¥hs variation observed for the proposed correction is of 0 09 and 0 03 m finally table 4 summarizes the si and respective improvements for all the hindcast points all wind sea and swell sea states together with the same results for the 90th and 95th percentiles fig 8 shows all the hindcast points before and after the correction in the corrected plot it is possible to notice that the correction method works over the whole range of values 5 discussion the correction methodology proposed in this study was applied to the new zealand area using a partitioned wave hindcast the results obtained were compared to a benchmark that represents the standard approach for correcting wave heights of wave hindcasts the robustness of the results was assessed by a cross validation where the first 80 of the data was used for training the model the remaining 20 for validating and vice versa a comparison between both results demonstrated that changes in the training dataset did not imply a significant change in the model s performance we also calculated the difference between the coefficients obtained with 100 and 80 of the data to quantify the change in their values less than 1 0 of the coefficients presented a variation higher than 0 1 the new zealand wave climate is mostly dominated by swells along the west coast these are the predominant waves from the western extreme of the south island until the north of the north island swell waves are also predominant along the east coast although their occurrence is significantly reduced in the north and south east coasts of the north island wind sea waves are not dominant but they are present all along the study area their occurrence increases shoreward along the west coast and they are mostly concentrated in the south of south island and the north east of the north island the si values obtained for the whole hindcast table 4 indicate the errors in the swell sea states are larger than the errors in the wind sea sea states which is reasonable due to the swell dominance in the wave climate of new zealand at the same time the improvement obtained by applying the proposed correction is higher for swell waves the bulk correction however performed better with wind sea sea states rather than with the swell sea states for extreme events represented by the 90th and 95th percentiles both techniques perform better correcting the wind sea sea states rather than the other sets of sea states swell and all the main reason for this result is that wind seas from extreme events contain higher values of significant wave height caused by the winds associated to storms in order to provide the spatial distribution of the correction throughout new zealand we plotted the coefficients across the study area wind correction coefficients were also calculated and plotted for the same area by applying the bulk correction method to the cfsr wind fields not shown despite the 0 5 resolution of the results the coefficients were plotted every 1 0 to better display the data fig 9 shows the wind sea swell and bulk corrections coefficients apart from the nearshore points the waves along the west coast are over estimated by the hindcast fig 7 by comparing the bulk correction coefficients with the wind sea and swell ones fig 9 both wind sea and swell waves present a similar error correction pattern along the west coast sectors facing land are underestimated by the hindcast while the remaining sectors are overestimated hence although it is known in which directional sector the overestimation of the waves is occurring it is still not clear which wave partition is the cause for the error by comparing the si improvements between the bulk and proposed approach for both wind sea and swell sea states along the west coast fig 7 it is possible to deduce that the error is mostly related to the wind sea partition since this is where the higher levels of correction were obtained by both techniques the east coast presents lower wave heights when compared to satellite data before the corrections a strong agreement i e underestimated waves and increasing coefficients can be noticed between the Œ¥hs fig 7 first row and the swell coefficients fig 9 after the calibration we observe large si improvements and Œ¥hs reduction along the east coast for the swell and small improvements along the same coast for the wind sea fig 7 this suggests that for the east coast most of the hindcast errors are related to the swell partitions more patterns are evident in the maps showing the wind sea and swell coefficients fig 9 for most points of the west coast and the points on the east coast that are closer to land the wind sea coefficients increase the wave height in the sectors facing land and decrease it in the remaining sectors the swell coefficients present a similar pattern on the west coast and a slightly different pattern on the east coast where the correction increases for all sectors but with a higher correction for the sectors facing land the overall behavior of the hindcast is already known for both coasts however one of the possible reasons for the underestimation of the nearshore points could be the underestimation of the winds caused by the interpolation between land and sea in the coarse atmospheric model grid cavaleri and bertotti 1997 2004 however the correction coefficients of the wind fields suggest overestimation of wind speeds around almost all the nearshore points of new zealand except in the west of the south island for the sectors facing land hence considering the hindcast resolution of 0 5 and the proximity of the points from the shore it is possible to infer that the underestimation may be caused by the coarse resolution of a global scale model resolving a local scale problem i e there are not enough grid points for the model to properly simulate the wave growth in the nearshore area the overall agreement between the offshore wind and wind sea calibration coefficients supports this hypothesis the same reasoning is also valid for correction values found in the south west of new zealand for the wind sea and swell waves however these values tend to be amplified by the underestimation of the wind fields caused by the interpolation between land and sea cavaleri and bertotti 1997 2004 the wind sea coefficients vary smoothly on the west portion of the map and less smoothly on the east also the swell coefficients behave oppositely to the sea ones as they change smoothly on the east and sharply on the west coast this behavior is mostly related to the directional distribution of the waves from both partitions along each coast as evenly distributed wave directions tend to provide more coefficients per sector and a smoother variation among them supporting this assumption along the west coast the wind sea waves present a relatively even directional distribution showing some increase in the waves from sw towards the nearshore points at the same time swell waves along this coast are mostly from sw and ne for the east coast the wind sea waves present an uneven directional distribution while the swells show a more uniform directional pattern finally in general the coefficients suggest that the swell waves are underestimated and the wind sea waves are overestimated despite the correction coefficients for swell along the west coast suggest overestimation of swell waves in sectors between sw and n fig 9 this is likely to be caused by the overestimated winds which in turn are also likely to cause the overestimated wind sea waves fig 9 the improvements observed for the proposed method in all cases tables 3 and 4 clearly demonstrate the importance of the individual correction of each partition as well as the advantages of the proposed technique against the bulk correction the analysis of all the results obtained shows that besides the benefits of the correction this technique offers a valuable set of information that can be used to improve our understanding of wave hindcasts as well as their accuracy nevertheless further improvements are still required and future studies could address issues such as incorporating the wave generation area as a criterion for the correction of swell waves hanson and phillips 2001 at present the correction of the swell directional sectors is not able to identify whether waves belonging to the same directional sector were generated in the same or distinct ocean basins another improvement to the model accuracy can be achieved by incorporating the satellite altimeter error into the regression model as we acknowledge that these measurements are also not free of error 6 conclusion the correction of wave hindcasts can be substantially improved when the directional correction is applied to the wind sea and swell partitions separately a tool capable of correcting and validating such wave families at any location is highly desirable for the wave modeling community a multiple linear regression model that performs an independent directional calibration of the wind sea and swell partitions of a wave hindcast is proposed the model was tested with a state of the art 20 year 1993 2012 wave hindcast rascle and ardhuin 2013 and a unified satellite database provided by the globwave project the results were compared to a benchmark another model that corrects the bulk wave height based on the average wave direction which is the standard approach for wave hindcasts calibration the assessment of the correction was performed by comparing the scatter index eq 7 between the satellite and hindcast data before and after applying the proposed and the benchmark correction techniques our method overperforms the benchmark in all analysed cases presenting a residual error of less than half the error of the bulk correction at some locations an analysis of the spatial distribution of the wind sea swell and bulk coefficients was performed the comparison of the coefficients with the results of each correction technique provided valuable insights about the wave hindcast representation of the wave climate of new zealand and its errors the main findings of the present study can be summarized below 1 splitting the wind sea and swell partitions allows the obtention of more specific yet physically sound and statistically significant correction coefficients 2 the proposed method performs better than the standard approach in all the analyzed sets of sea states achieving si improvements of 12 11 and 9 against 5 6 and 8 obtained by the benchmark for the swell all and wind sea sea states respectively 3 the highest si values considering all the analyzed data were observed for the swell sea states this should be emphasized since the shortcomings in the description of the local wind fields could lead to the assumption that the error in the modeled wind sea waves is larger than the error in the swell waves potentially disregarding the importance of the dominant wave climate 4 during extreme events the swell correction shows lower improvements compared to the wind sea waves correction this can be explained by the higher hs from the wind sea partition which often occurs during these events the additional information provided by this method geographic distribution of coefficients and correction improvements can help addressing hindcast errors from a specific directional sector and wave type e g wind sea or swell waves although the method has been applied to the new zealand area and to only one wave hindcast the technique is world wide applicable and can be used to correct any global or regional wave hindcast with spectral or partitioned information acknowledgments the current research is funded by the

24081,this paper proposes a buoy independent directional calibration methodology that uses satellite altimeter data to correct the simultaneous wind sea and all swell partitions available from wave hindcasts the proposed technique was applied to a 20 year wave hindcast in the new zealand region and showed promising results the method could potentially be applied worldwide to fully assess systematic errors in wind sea and swell partitions keywords hindcast satellite data directional sea and swell correction 1 introduction wave climate data is fundamental to a variety of applications ranging from scientific studies to the assessment of hazards coastal and offshore structures may be either under designed or over designed due to the uncertainty in the wave data leading to significant economical and operational risks bitner gregersen et al 1995 in coastal management wave climate data is used to study the seasonal and long term sediment budget which in turn is related to coastal vulnerability and risk assessment international transport tourism and commerce activities also rely on wave climate data as it can be used to provide optimal ship routing finally a number of atmospheric studies also require estimations of air and sea interaction derived from wave climate young 1999 wave climate data is commonly sourced from observations such as in situ buoys and satellite measurements another source for wave climate data are wave hindcasts or wave reanalysis from numerical simulations each of the aforementioned sources has its advantages and limitations buoys provide valuable time series of local wave climate variables such as wave height period and direction among others however mostly due to their high operational cost the data provided usually covers a short time span eventually presenting gaps due to failure or maintenance another issue related to buoys is their spatial coverage particularly in the southern hemisphere satellite altimeters have near global coverage and provide measurements along a continuous pass that is defined by the satellite s orbit however for a given location the data is available only at each satellite pass and for a short period of time altimeter data accuracy varies between missions tending to overestimate low wave heights and underestimate high wave heights queffeulou and croiz√© fillon 2017 hence the data requires post processing and cross validation with buoys and other altimeters in order to assess and correct the errors in the measurements table 3 from zieger et al 2009 shows a list of altimeter missions and their respective errors compared to buoys average of 17 cm after quality control calibration and validation procedures altimeter readings may also not be available or reliable especially in the presence of rain sea ice or within the transition up to 50 km offshore between land and sea tournadre et al 2009 shanas et al 2014 sepulveda et al 2015 despite the requirement of calibration cross validation and data quality control these two approaches are capable of delivering accurate and reliable wave information however given their limitation in temporal and spatial coverage they may not always be suitable for all research purposes the time and space reproduction of wave fields provided by numerical models has allowed filling the temporal and spatial gaps from instrumental data wave hindcasts are a source for wave climate data at locations where the in situ measurements are unavailable or nonexistent bitner gregersen and de valk 2008 wave models use wind forcings from atmospheric reanalysis to simulate the interaction between wind water and bathymetry the resulting wave hindcast is usually a simplified representation of what occurs in the real world and each hindcast point carries the information about the sea conditions e g directional spectra and bulk parameters such as significant wave height hs peak period tp direction Œ∏ etc at a given time as one might expect the more detailed the bathymetry wind forcings and modeled physics the more accurate is the wave hindcast wave hindcasts also present issues and limitations cavaleri and bertotti 2004 demonstrated that due to the changes in the surface roughness length at the land sea interface the interpolation between land and sea in a coarse resolution grid results in lower wind speeds in atmospheric and reanalysis models the underestimation of the wind fields can propagate and affect wave generation for up to several hundred kilometers offshore also it is possible for the same wave model to produce different results for the same location and time span when distinct reanalysis wind fields are used as input lavidas et al 2017 at the same time different wave models can provide different results when the same wind fields are provided caires et al 2004 even though these inhomogeneities can be addressed by fine tuning the wave model parameters rascle et al 2008 ardhuin et al 2011 stopa et al 2016 among others a validation against instrumental data must still be performed before the hindcast can be used finally wave hindcasts can present different biases depending on the location of comparison against instrumental data caires et al 2004 in order to maximize the benefits that hindcasts have offered to the scientific community several studies have proposed techniques to correct hindcast errors a nonparametric method to correct model data proposed by caires and sterl 2005 was based on a learning dataset built with simultaneous hindcast and instrumental data the errors in hs observed in the learning dataset are then used to estimate and correct the wave height at points where no instrumental data is available the technique was applied to a 40 year dataset from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts re analysis era 40 and was able to improve the reanalysis another approach for calibration was presented by cavaleri and sclavo 2006 and tested in the mediterranean sea concurrent satellite and buoy data at a given point were paired and the best fit coefficient for the point was then used to calibrate a 0 5 resolution wave hindcast tomas et al 2008 developed a spatial calibration method based on empirical orthogonal functions and applied it to the western mediterranean the approach used the spatial correlation between different hindcast points to extend the calibration data finally m√≠nguez et al 2011 demonstrated the benefits of taking into account the mean wave direction in the correction procedure a fit between hindcast buoy and satellite data using a non linear model the aforementioned works contributed significantly to the understanding of the causes for hindcast inaccuracies and to the development of techniques to limit their effect however these studies also have limitations in caires and sterl 2005 the distance between the learning dataset and the points to be corrected limited the quality of the calibration also both caires and sterl 2005 and cavaleri and sclavo 2006 did not consider the spatial distribution of the correction an issue later addressed by tomas et al 2008 which in turn assumed an a priori distribution of data throughout the analyzed area something that may not be valid for all cases the study of m√≠nguez et al 2011 was one of the first to propose a directional calibration for the significant wave height yet the correction is only based on the bulk wave height and mean wave direction bulk wave parameters which the previous methodologies aim to correct do not represent the simultaneous wave systems snodgrass et al 1966 that can be present in a sea state as an example a sea state may be composed of wind sea waves swell waves and a combination of both wind sea waves are irregular and short crested waves generated by the local wind forcing that have not propagated far from their generation area as wind sea waves disperse across the ocean they grow more and more regular becoming long crested and turning into swell waves holthuijsen 2007 hence information from multimodal directional spectra i e a sea state with more than one wave system generated by different storms is often neglected as the bulk representation focusses on the aggregated wave height and mean direction even for sea states with separated sea and swell partitions the aggregation of the multiple wave systems that might be present in the swell component implies loss of information gerling 1992 moreover the interpolation between ocean and land is recognized as the main reason for the underestimation of local winds and the consequent disparities between modeled and measured wave heights caires and sterl 2005 m√≠nguez et al 2011 recent implementations of third generation wave models i e wavewatch iii tolman et al 2009 included an algorithm hanson and phillips 2001 that performs the spectral partitioning for all wave hindcast grid points providing a detailed description of the sea state composed of a wind sea wave partition and several simultaneous swell partitions this is a definite step forward for improved hindcasts of wave climate 1 1 it is important to acknowledge however that there is no strict definition of when a wind sea wave system becomes swell the partitioning algorithm relies on the wind direction and a directional wave age criterion to define whether a peak in the wave spectra is a wind sea or a swell system hanson and phillips 2001 hence roughly waves that propagate approximately in the same direction as the wind are defined as wind sea and the remaining wave systems are defined as swell eq 5 and fig 2 of hanson and phillips 2001 since partitioned representation of wave hindcasts is becoming popular within the scientific community hegermiller et al 2017 rueda et al 2017 specific corrections for each wave partition sea or swells are desirable and necessary to perform a full validation of the available data rascle et al 2008 stopa et al 2016 this paper proposes a novel directional calibration method that uses satellite data to correct the wave height of the wind sea and swell partitions and applies it to a 20 year wave hindcast rascle and ardhuin 2013 of the new zealand wave climate the significance of the directional calibration for each of the six partitions of the hindcast one for wind sea and the remaining five for different concurrent swells is assessed and compared to the same technique applied to the bulk wave parameter the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the data used while the methodology can be found in section 3 results are shown in section 4 and section 5 discusses the results obtained finally section 6 concludes the work summarizing the main findings 2 data 2 1 hindcast the wave data is provided by ifremer institut fran√ßais de recherche pour l exploitation de la mer and is an accurate and homogeneous series of wave hindcasts also valid for extreme events rascle and ardhuin 2013 the wave database was obtained using the wavewatch iii model version 4 04 with cfsr climate forecast system reanalysis wind forcing and the test451 parametrization proposed by rascle and ardhuin 2013 with improvements for swell dissipation the grid resolution for the new zealand area is 0 5 in both latitude and longitude while the spectral grid consists of 24 directions and 31 frequencies exponentially distributed from 0 037 hz to 0 7 hz rascle and ardhuin 2013 the database consists of a 20 year 1993 2012 three hourly gridded fields with time series of wave parameters such as significant wave height peak period mean direction and directional spread refer to table a 4 from rascle and ardhuin 2013 for the complete list of parameters available the hindcast contains up to six wave partitions i e sets of wave parameters the wind sea waves are represented in the first partition and swells from up to five different wave generation areas propagating with their specific direction and frequency are represented in the five remaining partitions each partition can represent swell systems from any direction and the wave height defines which partition a swell system is assigned to the swell with highest hs is assigned to the first partition the second highest hs to the second partition and so on a local domain covering the range from 165 to 180 e and from 50 to 33 s encompassing new zealand was selected fig 1 since the aim of our methodology is to correct offshore points only the deep water e g more than 200 m depth points of the domain were selected for the calibration procedure 2 2 satellite data all the instrumental data used in this study are derived from satellite altimeters the satellite database was obtained from the esa european space agency globwave project busswell et al 2010 which aims to provide an easy access to integrated and reliable satellite wave data the continuously updated data consists of satellite altimeter measurements from 1985 onwards and includes the ers 1 ers 2 envisat topex poseidon jason 1 jason 2 cryosat and geosat follow on missions among others altimeter readings from satellites have been post processed screened corrected validated cross validated and quality controlled in order to minimize the error in the measurements queffeulou 2004 2006 reducing the bias to an average of less than 10 cm queffeulou et al 2010 compared to buoys a description of the procedures applied to each mission data in order to generate this information as well as the latest database updates can be found in queffeulou and croiz√© fillon 2017 it is important to notice that even tough the corrections significantly improved the accuracy of the satellite readings the aforementioned error is still likely to remain a source of uncertainty 2 3 bathymetry and distance from land two other databases were used for this research the first is a 250 m resolution bathymetry of the new zealand area provided by the national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa the second is a 0 04 distance to the nearest coast database provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the two databases were used to create a filter to avoid the effects of shoaling detected by satellite altimeters but not properly represented by the hindcast due the 0 5 grid resolution and to prevent the use of inaccurate wave height readings caused by land interference in the altimeter s footprint which can persist up to 50 km offshore the new zealand bathymetry presents small shallow areas far from the mainland as well as nearshore deep water areas thus the filter was applied simultaneously to both hindcast and satellite databases fig 1 left shows the 50 km offshore and the 200 m depth filters together with the hindcast and satellite data that were used 3 methodology the procedure presented is based on fitting satellite and hindcast wave heights through a multiple linear regression model the coefficients obtained correction coefficients from the model are applied to the hindcast wave heights in order to minimize the difference between the modeled values and the altimeter measurements two hindcast points are used in this section to illustrate our multiple linear regression approach and compare it to the standard bulk regression model 3 1 data pairing in order to fit the modeled wave hindcast parameters and satellite measurements for each hindcast point criteria regarding temporal and spatial characteristics of each record were applied to merge information from both databases as an example given a hindcast point the spatial criteria must provide satellite data close to the point of interest so that it properly represents the wave conditions at this given location at the same time the more satellite data can be used in the regression the better to define the appropriate maximum distance from the hindcast point where satellite data could be used a sensitivity analysis with radius values from 0 5 to 1 0 was performed the analysis demonstrated that the 1 0 radius provides a satisfactory balance between the amount of satellite data that can be used and the representativeness of the wave conditions fig 1 right shows the satellite data within the 1 0 distance for locations w 173 0e 37 0s and e 176 5e 42 0s once the satellite data points were spatially selected they were paired to the closest sea state in time the hindcast has a 3 hourly temporal resolution hence for a given sea state of a point all the altimeter measurements tracks from different satellites that occurred within 1 30 h before or after the given sea state were averaged and paired to it a scatter plot of all the pairs found over the 20 year hindcast is shown for points w and e see fig 2 the colors reflect the probability density while the horizontal and vertical axis display the hindcast and the satellite hs 3 2 scatter analysis given the location of the two example points w on the west coast of the north island and e on the east coast of the north island one might expect different types of errors for each point the scatter plots from fig 2 indicate that compared to satellite measurements the hindcast fairly represents the wave heights of point w and underestimates the wave heights of point e however by plotting data from location w using different colors to identify the wave direction fig 3 it becomes evident that hindcast wave heights from the s sw green directions are underestimated while hs from the wsw to wnw magenta directions are overestimated the directional error changes according to the point location and can be observed in both wind sea and swell components of the modeled wave heights in terms of wind sea and swell it is possible to plot in distinct colors the modeled wave heights from the sea states where at least 90 of the significant wave height 2 2 calculated as h s w 2 h s a l l 2 where w s e a s w e l l for wind sea and swell sea states is from swell swell dominated or wind sea sea dominated waves fig 4 both plots show satellite measurements on the vertical axis and hindcast results on the horizontal axis the swell wave heights are displayed in red and the wind sea wave heights are displayed in blue for points w left and e right at location w satellite and hindcast of swell wave heights compare well despite the directional issues while the hindcast wind sea wave heights tend to be slightly underestimated point e despite the overall underestimation of hindcast hs does not display a difference between satellite and hindcast data of wind sea and swell the analysis exposes the different errors at each location and how they are related to wave direction and wind sea swell reinforcing the need for the proposed correction 3 3 multiple linear regression model since wave energy varies linearly with the square of the wave amplitude a linear model can be employed the multiple linear regression model used in this study fits the 20 years of paired satellite and hindcast data as follows 1 h s a t 2 a 2 h a l l 2 …õ 2 and provides the coefficient a that minimizes Œµ the variable h refers to hs hsat is the response variable hall is the predictor vector variable a is the vector of regression parameters and Œµ is the error the intercept was not introduced in the statistical model as the large amount of degrees of freedom 32 coefficients for the sea and swell corrections of the directional sectors used is capable of indirectly minimizing any bias eventually present also a sensitivity analysis performed showed no improvements in the correction by adding an intercept to the model in order to correct wind sea and swell significant wave height one can expand eq 1 and substitute h s a l l with 2 h a l l 2 h s e a 2 h s w e l l 2 the resulting equation requires a new set of coefficients a and b to correct both the wind sea and swell wave heights therefore the model is rewritten as 3 h s a t 2 a 2 h s e a 2 b 2 h s w e l l 2 …õ 2 the same relation from eq 2 can be used to model the aggregated swell wave height hswell from eq 3 and the five swell components of a sea state in h s w e l l 2 j 1 5 h s w e l l j 2 as each of the hindcast partitions can present wave systems from any direction the 360 wave directional spectra was split in 16 clockwise directional sectors s0 to s15 of 22 5 degrees where 0 s0 22 5 22 5 s1 45 0 337 5 s15 360 0 these sectors were included in the sea and swell representations of the model by adding coefficients for each possible sector as shown below 4 h s a t 2 i 0 15 a i 2 h i s e a 2 i 0 15 b i 2 h i s w e l l 2 …õ 2 where a i b i i 0 15 represent the correction coefficients for the i th directional sector of the wind sea and swell partitions respectively and h i s e a h i s w e l l i 0 15 represent the wave height present in the i th directional sector of the wind sea and swell partitions notice that while there is only one sector for wind sea waves there may be up to five sectors for swell waves one for each partition whenever more than one swell is present in the same sector at the same time the aggregated wave heights were calculated before inserting the data into the model as an example of how each of the sea states of the hindcast is modeled consider the sea state in table 1 partition p 0 represents the sea component of the sea state with a wave height of 1 864 and a direction of 323 this direction belongs to sector 14 thus the sea part of the model is a 14 2 p 0 2 the swell components shown as p 1 5 represent five different directional sectors to be used in the swell part of the model however as p 2 and p 4 belong to the same directional sector 15 the wave height squares must be aggregated p 2 2 p 4 2 the resulting wave height is used in the model with b 15 while the wave heights of p 1 p 3 and p 5 are associated to b 1 b 6 and b 2 respectively the resulting equation for the sea state in the model in terms of h s s a t and Œµ is 5 h s sat 2 a 14 2 p 0 2 b 1 2 p 1 2 b 2 2 p 5 2 b 6 2 p 3 2 b 15 2 p 2 2 p 4 2 …õ 2 this approach applied to the 20 year paired data provided the calibration coefficients for all the 16 sectors of sea and swell wave heights cavaleri and sclavo 2006 among others mentioned that the regression model requires a minimum amount of data n to find values that are physically plausible the definition of n for each directional sector is based on the assumption that the higher the value of n the more reliable the results i e sectors with a number of samples smaller than n should not be included in the regression the proposed methodology allows all sectors containing data independently of the amount to be fitted into the model the reliability of the coefficients is then assessed based on their 90 confidence interval in general the values obtained by the regression model for this application range between 0 5 and 1 5 while the 90 confidence interval changes according to the data variability within the pairs if the correction coefficients are not statistically different from 1 i e 1 is within the coefficient s 90 confidence interval they are discarded their value is set to 1 and the correction is not performed once the directional coefficients are obtained for sea and swell they are applied to their correspondent partitions and directions for every sea state of the hindcast the comparison of the scatter index si eq 7 calculated before and after the correction provides a quantitative assessment of the accuracy improvement at each hindcast point 3 4 bulk linear regression model to assess the benefits of the proposed methodology when correcting sea and swells the results obtained were compared to a bulk wave parameter calibration technique similar to m√≠nguez et al 2011 the bulk model here described follows the same physical principles of the proposed model however as this bulk model does not distinguish sea and swell waves the equation is assembled according only to the aggregated wave height and mean direction last column of table 1 the bulk representation of the sea state could be modeled as 6 h s s a t 2 a 1 2 p a l l 2 …õ 2 for the example sea state since the mean wave direction is 9 5 first sector the coefficient related to it a 1 is used the same statistical significance criterion used to select the coefficients in the proposed calibration was applied to this method 4 results four types of results are shown in this section i the individual set of coefficients for each hindcast point ii the spatial distribution of the obtained coefficients throughout the study area iii the si 7 s i 1 n i 1 n h s i h s i s a t 2 h s 100 where h s is the averaged significant wave height and iv the spatial distribution of the improvements obtained after applying the correction the sea swell and bulk directional coefficients calculated for the two study cases are presented in table 2 and fig 5 correction coefficients less than 1 0 indicate the sectors where hs is overestimated by the hindcast while values greater than 1 0 indicate sectors where the hindcast hs is less than h s s a t values in bold represent statistically significant coefficients each of the plots in fig 5 shows information about the sea swell and bulk directional coefficients for points w and e respectively the colors represent the correction value and the position of each color indicates the sector where it should be applied the colormap uses blue to represent correction coefficients greater than 1 0 increasing the hindcast hs and red for coefficients smaller than 1 0 reducing the hindcast hs white means no correction due to the absence of data while sectors in grey mean no correction due to the lack of significance of the calculated coefficients for the west coast point w the sectors facing land do not contain enough data to provide a reliable swell coefficient hence the correction for these sectors is mostly for wind sea fig 5 the three sets of coefficients when significant indicate that hindcast waves at point w are mostly over predicted from sectors 11 to 5 clockwise and under predicted from sectors 6 to 9 the comparison between the available wind sea and swell coefficients shows that in sectors 10 and 13 the wind sea waves require more correction than the swell waves while the opposite is observed in the remaining sectors also sector 10 presents divergent correction for wind sea 0 97 and swell 1 01 the bulk coefficients tend to present values between the sea and swell results following a similar trend for the directional correction the east coast study location e also presents variations among the correction coefficients according with the wave direction and type no valid wind sea coefficients were found for sectors 4 9 and 11 the wind sea waves are overestimated in sectors 10 and 12 and underestimated in the remaining sectors in all the sectors the swell wave heights were underestimated and also required higher correction compared to the sea wave heights sectors 10 and 12 also presented diverging corrections for sea and swell with the sea coefficients of 0 93 for both and swell coefficients of 1 18 and 1 32 respectively the results obtained for both locations are consistent with the plots shown in figs 3 and 4 however since the directional plots in fig 3 do not separate swell waves from sea waves the diverging corrections required for sector 10 point w can not be identified at the same time the plots for sea and swell presented in fig 4 used only wind sea and swell dominated sea states with no directional information the individual scatter plots showing the effect of the corrections at the study points are shown in fig 6 in order to provide a better visualization of the directional correction colors were added according to the mean wave direction the first column of plots presents all the sea states followed by the sea dominated and swell dominated sea states all wind sea and swell sea states hereinafter rows 1 and 2 fig 6 display the original and corrected data for point w while rows 3 and 4 present the same information for location e the color bar on the right displays the colors associated with each wave direction in order to facilitate the visualization the number of directional sectors in the figure was reduced to 8 instead of the 16 actually used in the correction the color scale used for both points shows significant differences between the all wind sea and swell predominant directions at each location for point w it is possible to identify the different sectors shifting directions from the non corrected to the corrected plot the overall correction pattern shows that the dots representing the wind sea have been corrected for the positive bias while the swell shows a generalized improvement a similar behavior is observed for the all sea states plot for e it is possible to notice an improvement for waves from different directions both wind sea and swell are underpredicted and the swell data improves more than the wind sea data the all sea states plot similar to point w shows a generalized improvement following the calibration the calibration statistics for the points analyzed are displayed in table 3 results for the all dataset as well as wind sea and swell dominated sea states are presented in columns for points w and e the rows indicate the si from the original hindcast data the resulting si obtained after each type proposed bulk of correction and the percentage of improvement over the original si for both techniques the proposed method has improved skill over the bulk method in all cases the si value of the hindcast for both study points is about 0 11 for the wind sea sea states however while the improvements at location w were about 13 and 12 for the proposed and the bulk corrections at point e the improvement was about 1 6 for the proposed method and 0 9 for the bulk technique this negative result occurred due to the diverging sea and swell coefficients found in sector 10 which can not be properly solved by the single coefficient provided by the bulk model refer to table 2 despite the specific negative result at the same location e the bulk correction of the all sea states resulted in almost 12 5 improvement while the proposed correction presented an accuracy improvement of about 15 6 the correction of the swell sea states presents an opposite behavior to the wind sea correction at these locations at point w the improvement for the swell is of nearly 6 and 4 while point e presents an improvement of 21 and 15 for the proposed and bulk techniques respectively two different statistics were calculated for the whole study area and plotted in fig 7 the first is the si defined in eq 7 applied before and after each correction technique the second is the difference between the averaged 20 year hs hind and hs sat for the original and the corrected h s h i n d 8 Œ¥ h s h s h i n d h s s a t fig 7 first row displays the original si values for the all wind sea and swell sea states followed by the original Œ¥hs the second and third rows fig 7 display the percentage of improvement in the si and the decreasing values of Œ¥hs for the bulk and proposed correction methods the original si for the studied sea states first row of fig 7 is higher close to the shore and decreases in the seaward direction the east coast presents higher values of si than the west coast for all the sea states the original Œ¥hs plot shows overestimated h s h i n d along the west coast and underestimated h s h i n d along the east coast and close to the shore values of Œ¥hs vary from 0 5 to 0 08 m the improvement achieved by the bulk correction is shown in the second row of fig 7 for the all sea states the improvement is higher for the nearshore points of the east coast reaching up to 32 3 the correction at the remote points of the west coast is better than at the east coast the results obtained for the wind sea sea states are better along the west coast than the east coast presenting a maximum improvement of 30 7 for the swell sea states the most noticeable improvements occur for the nearshore points no significant improvement can be noticed in the offshore points of the west coast while similar locations on the east coast show improvements of up to 34 7 the Œ¥hs improves ranging between 0 19 and 0 01 m for the proposed technique third row fig 7 the improvements obtained for the all sea states were larger on the east coast and for nearshore points reaching up to 41 the wind sea and swell sea states results are opposite the first performing better on the west coast and the latter achieving its best results on the east coast maximum values obtained were 32 for the wind sea and 49 for the swell sea states the maximum and minimum Œ¥hs variation observed for the proposed correction is of 0 09 and 0 03 m finally table 4 summarizes the si and respective improvements for all the hindcast points all wind sea and swell sea states together with the same results for the 90th and 95th percentiles fig 8 shows all the hindcast points before and after the correction in the corrected plot it is possible to notice that the correction method works over the whole range of values 5 discussion the correction methodology proposed in this study was applied to the new zealand area using a partitioned wave hindcast the results obtained were compared to a benchmark that represents the standard approach for correcting wave heights of wave hindcasts the robustness of the results was assessed by a cross validation where the first 80 of the data was used for training the model the remaining 20 for validating and vice versa a comparison between both results demonstrated that changes in the training dataset did not imply a significant change in the model s performance we also calculated the difference between the coefficients obtained with 100 and 80 of the data to quantify the change in their values less than 1 0 of the coefficients presented a variation higher than 0 1 the new zealand wave climate is mostly dominated by swells along the west coast these are the predominant waves from the western extreme of the south island until the north of the north island swell waves are also predominant along the east coast although their occurrence is significantly reduced in the north and south east coasts of the north island wind sea waves are not dominant but they are present all along the study area their occurrence increases shoreward along the west coast and they are mostly concentrated in the south of south island and the north east of the north island the si values obtained for the whole hindcast table 4 indicate the errors in the swell sea states are larger than the errors in the wind sea sea states which is reasonable due to the swell dominance in the wave climate of new zealand at the same time the improvement obtained by applying the proposed correction is higher for swell waves the bulk correction however performed better with wind sea sea states rather than with the swell sea states for extreme events represented by the 90th and 95th percentiles both techniques perform better correcting the wind sea sea states rather than the other sets of sea states swell and all the main reason for this result is that wind seas from extreme events contain higher values of significant wave height caused by the winds associated to storms in order to provide the spatial distribution of the correction throughout new zealand we plotted the coefficients across the study area wind correction coefficients were also calculated and plotted for the same area by applying the bulk correction method to the cfsr wind fields not shown despite the 0 5 resolution of the results the coefficients were plotted every 1 0 to better display the data fig 9 shows the wind sea swell and bulk corrections coefficients apart from the nearshore points the waves along the west coast are over estimated by the hindcast fig 7 by comparing the bulk correction coefficients with the wind sea and swell ones fig 9 both wind sea and swell waves present a similar error correction pattern along the west coast sectors facing land are underestimated by the hindcast while the remaining sectors are overestimated hence although it is known in which directional sector the overestimation of the waves is occurring it is still not clear which wave partition is the cause for the error by comparing the si improvements between the bulk and proposed approach for both wind sea and swell sea states along the west coast fig 7 it is possible to deduce that the error is mostly related to the wind sea partition since this is where the higher levels of correction were obtained by both techniques the east coast presents lower wave heights when compared to satellite data before the corrections a strong agreement i e underestimated waves and increasing coefficients can be noticed between the Œ¥hs fig 7 first row and the swell coefficients fig 9 after the calibration we observe large si improvements and Œ¥hs reduction along the east coast for the swell and small improvements along the same coast for the wind sea fig 7 this suggests that for the east coast most of the hindcast errors are related to the swell partitions more patterns are evident in the maps showing the wind sea and swell coefficients fig 9 for most points of the west coast and the points on the east coast that are closer to land the wind sea coefficients increase the wave height in the sectors facing land and decrease it in the remaining sectors the swell coefficients present a similar pattern on the west coast and a slightly different pattern on the east coast where the correction increases for all sectors but with a higher correction for the sectors facing land the overall behavior of the hindcast is already known for both coasts however one of the possible reasons for the underestimation of the nearshore points could be the underestimation of the winds caused by the interpolation between land and sea in the coarse atmospheric model grid cavaleri and bertotti 1997 2004 however the correction coefficients of the wind fields suggest overestimation of wind speeds around almost all the nearshore points of new zealand except in the west of the south island for the sectors facing land hence considering the hindcast resolution of 0 5 and the proximity of the points from the shore it is possible to infer that the underestimation may be caused by the coarse resolution of a global scale model resolving a local scale problem i e there are not enough grid points for the model to properly simulate the wave growth in the nearshore area the overall agreement between the offshore wind and wind sea calibration coefficients supports this hypothesis the same reasoning is also valid for correction values found in the south west of new zealand for the wind sea and swell waves however these values tend to be amplified by the underestimation of the wind fields caused by the interpolation between land and sea cavaleri and bertotti 1997 2004 the wind sea coefficients vary smoothly on the west portion of the map and less smoothly on the east also the swell coefficients behave oppositely to the sea ones as they change smoothly on the east and sharply on the west coast this behavior is mostly related to the directional distribution of the waves from both partitions along each coast as evenly distributed wave directions tend to provide more coefficients per sector and a smoother variation among them supporting this assumption along the west coast the wind sea waves present a relatively even directional distribution showing some increase in the waves from sw towards the nearshore points at the same time swell waves along this coast are mostly from sw and ne for the east coast the wind sea waves present an uneven directional distribution while the swells show a more uniform directional pattern finally in general the coefficients suggest that the swell waves are underestimated and the wind sea waves are overestimated despite the correction coefficients for swell along the west coast suggest overestimation of swell waves in sectors between sw and n fig 9 this is likely to be caused by the overestimated winds which in turn are also likely to cause the overestimated wind sea waves fig 9 the improvements observed for the proposed method in all cases tables 3 and 4 clearly demonstrate the importance of the individual correction of each partition as well as the advantages of the proposed technique against the bulk correction the analysis of all the results obtained shows that besides the benefits of the correction this technique offers a valuable set of information that can be used to improve our understanding of wave hindcasts as well as their accuracy nevertheless further improvements are still required and future studies could address issues such as incorporating the wave generation area as a criterion for the correction of swell waves hanson and phillips 2001 at present the correction of the swell directional sectors is not able to identify whether waves belonging to the same directional sector were generated in the same or distinct ocean basins another improvement to the model accuracy can be achieved by incorporating the satellite altimeter error into the regression model as we acknowledge that these measurements are also not free of error 6 conclusion the correction of wave hindcasts can be substantially improved when the directional correction is applied to the wind sea and swell partitions separately a tool capable of correcting and validating such wave families at any location is highly desirable for the wave modeling community a multiple linear regression model that performs an independent directional calibration of the wind sea and swell partitions of a wave hindcast is proposed the model was tested with a state of the art 20 year 1993 2012 wave hindcast rascle and ardhuin 2013 and a unified satellite database provided by the globwave project the results were compared to a benchmark another model that corrects the bulk wave height based on the average wave direction which is the standard approach for wave hindcasts calibration the assessment of the correction was performed by comparing the scatter index eq 7 between the satellite and hindcast data before and after applying the proposed and the benchmark correction techniques our method overperforms the benchmark in all analysed cases presenting a residual error of less than half the error of the bulk correction at some locations an analysis of the spatial distribution of the wind sea swell and bulk coefficients was performed the comparison of the coefficients with the results of each correction technique provided valuable insights about the wave hindcast representation of the wave climate of new zealand and its errors the main findings of the present study can be summarized below 1 splitting the wind sea and swell partitions allows the obtention of more specific yet physically sound and statistically significant correction coefficients 2 the proposed method performs better than the standard approach in all the analyzed sets of sea states achieving si improvements of 12 11 and 9 against 5 6 and 8 obtained by the benchmark for the swell all and wind sea sea states respectively 3 the highest si values considering all the analyzed data were observed for the swell sea states this should be emphasized since the shortcomings in the description of the local wind fields could lead to the assumption that the error in the modeled wind sea waves is larger than the error in the swell waves potentially disregarding the importance of the dominant wave climate 4 during extreme events the swell correction shows lower improvements compared to the wind sea waves correction this can be explained by the higher hs from the wind sea partition which often occurs during these events the additional information provided by this method geographic distribution of coefficients and correction improvements can help addressing hindcast errors from a specific directional sector and wave type e g wind sea or swell waves although the method has been applied to the new zealand area and to only one wave hindcast the technique is world wide applicable and can be used to correct any global or regional wave hindcast with spectral or partitioned information acknowledgments the current research is funded by the

24082,the western mediterranean sea is often affected by heavy precipitation which frequently generates floods or even flash floods these events generally produce brief but major freshwater inputs in the ocean in order to evaluate the sensitivity to the representation of river freshwater input three different runoff forcing dataset are used to drive the nemo ocean model a monthly climatology an observational dataset with a daily or a hourly frequency the sensitivity is investigated over the first special observation period sop1 of the hymex program that took place in autumn 2012 in two configurations of nemo the first is wmed36 over the western mediterranean sea at 1 36 resolution and the second is a new configuration covering the north western mediterranean sea with a 1 72 resolution named nwmed72 with nwmed72 the impact of the representation of the river freshwater flux i e moving from a surface flux to a vertical distribution of the flux is also evaluated the results show that the ocean stratification is significantly modified locally in simulations where runoff observations are used compared to those using the climatology the sea surface salinity is modified as well as the mixed layer which is thinner as bounded by a well marked halocline the sea surface temperature is also impacted by the change in runoff frequency moreover the current intensity in river plume during flood is increased vertical profiles of salinity and temperature and thus the mixed layer depth are changed when the runoff forcing is distributed over a depth those changes are limited and very local but the realism of the river runoff input is improved keywords flood heavy precipitation hymex north western mediterranean sea river plumes runoff freshwater flux stratification 1 introduction the mediterranean sea is a semi enclosed sea where all of the water exchanges are concentrated in the strait of gibraltar with the atlantic ocean and in the bosphorus strait with the black sea well known as an evaporation basin the loss of water in the atmosphere is compensated by an inflow of atlantic water aw bormans et al 1986 mariotti et al 2002 which circulates cyclonically at basin scale see millot and taupier letage 2005 for a review in the western basin it forms the eastward algerian current ac fig 1 and the southwestward northern current nc fig 1 the latter flows along slope from the ligurian sea to the balearic sea the northern limit of the reservoir of aw is materialized by the north balearic front nbf fig 1 the associated eastward recirculation along the northern side of the nbf and the nc form a cyclonic gyre interacting with atmosphere continental surface and bathymetry fig 1 during wintertime the dry and cold regional winds northerly mistral and northwesterly tramontane can induce deep water formation in the gulf of lion both by cascading and open sea convection marshall and schott 1999 houpert et al 2016 testor et al 2018 during the stratified period these winds induce upwelling cells in the gulf of lion e g millot 1990 and frequent shallow anticyclonic eddies along its western coast rubio et al 2009 hu et al 2011 the mediterranean sea is also a region frequently affected by heavy precipitation events hpes such events are characterized by large amounts of accumulated rainfall in short time typically more than 100 mm in 24h associated with mesoscale convective systems mcss ducrocq et al 2016 falling over small river catchments that are characteristic of the mediterranean region tarolli et al 2012 merheb et al 2016 these large and sudden precipitation amounts often lead to devastating flash floods and flooding events causing damages and sometimes casualties buzzi et al 1998 romero et al 1998 krichak et al 2004 delrieu et al 2005 efstathiou et al 2014 ivanƒçan picek et al 2014 hpes and the associated flooding can produce large amount of freshwater input into ocean therefore river freshwater runoff plays an important role on coastal regions freshwater flows from the river mouths to the ocean as a plume and previous studies have shown impact on the local circulation e g brando et al 2015 in most of the cases water from the plume tends to flow along the coast with the land on the right in the northern hemisphere due to the influence of the earth s rotation simpson 1997 this low salinity buoyant freshwater alters stratification in the vicinity of the river mouth thus a variability of the sea surface salinity sss and the sea surface temperature sst is observed sometimes it can be advected downstream and have an impact off shore brando et al 2015 tseng et al 2016 fournier et al 2016 this study investigates the impact of a better representation of river runoffs in a high resolution ocean model with a focus in the western mediterranean area indeed several case studies such as schiller and kourafalou 2010 and herzfeld 2015 have shown that the way the river runoff is modeled impacts the river plume area and the mixing processes in coastal regions more particularly a vertical distribution of the runoff flow can reduce low salinity surface bias tseng et al 2016 the morphology of the plumes is sensitive to wind events and river discharges otero et al 2008 more especially in our area of interest one of the largest rivers is the rh√¥ne river flowing in the gulf of lion with an average flow around 1 700 m3 s its plume can extend far away about 40 km from the coast estournel et al 1997 and presents a high variability depending on the meteorological conditions and outflow forcing broche et al 1998 estournel et al 2001 this study investigates how river plumes are represented and how a high temporal frequency flow can affect them especially during floods moreover we focus on how the heat and salt contents are impacted along with the stratification in the vicinity of river mouths to evaluate the sensitivity to the representation of river runoff the nemo ocean model is used forced in surface by the atmospheric forecasts of the 2 5 km horizontal resolution arome wmed atmospheric model over a well observed autumn period with the occurrence of several hpes and river floods in the northwestern mediterranean area two different ocean configurations are used fig 1a and b at a 1 36 and 1 72 horizontal resolutions the sensitivity is investigated by comparison of ocean simulations changing the river forcing in term of realism climatology vs observations frequency monthly daily hourly and distribution surface input vs vertical distribution first step is the validation of the two different configurations then the sensitivity to the frequency change of river runoff and to a more realistic vertical distribution of it is evaluated using several diagnostics on sss sst and local circulation this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a description of the ocean model used with two configurations of the river runoff forcing dataset and of the ocean observations used for the validation the latter is detailed in section 3 while section 4 presents results about the sensitivity to the different river runoff inputs conclusions and discussions are finally given in section 5 2 context and model description 2 1 hymex campaign the hydrological cycle in the mediterranean experiment hymex international programme drobinski et al 2014 aims to investigate the hydrological cycle processes with emphasis on high impact weather events over the mediterranean region two fields campaigns were organized during fall 2012 and winter 2013 called special observation period sop1 and sop2 respectively the sop1 from 5 september to 6 november 2012 was particularly devoted to the documentation of heavy precipitation with the deployment of more than 200 instruments on land as well as in the air and at sea ducrocq et al 2014 in particular several platforms monitoring the ocean surface and upper layer were deployed during the campaign most of these platforms were located in the north western mediterranean area and thus provide a valuable dataset to validate the ocean simulations 2 2 numerical set up 2 2 1 configurations the ocean model used is nemo version 3 6 madec and the nemo team 2016 in two configurations for these two configurations the common physical parametrizations are the following the total variance dissipation tvd scheme is used for tracer advection in order to conserve energy and enstrophy barnier et al 2006 the vertical diffusion follows the standard turbulent kinetic energy formulation of nemo blanke and delecluse 1993 in case of unstable conditions a higher diffusivity coefficient of 10 m2 s is applied lazar et al 1999 the sea surface height is a prognostic variable solved thanks to the filtered free surface scheme of roullet and madec 2000 a no slip lateral boundary condition is applied and the bottom friction is parameterized by a quadratic function with a coefficient depending on the 2d mean tidal energy lyard et al 2006 beuvier et al 2012 the diffusion is applied along isoneutral surfaces for the tracers using a laplacian operator with the horizontal eddy diffusivity value ŒΩh for the dynamics velocity a bi laplacian operator is used with the horizontal viscosity coefficient Œ∑h the first configuration is the sub regional eddy resolving configuration covering the western mediterranean basin fig 1a with a 1 36 horizontal resolution over an orca grid from 2 to 2 5 km resolution named wmed36 lebeaupin brossier et al 2014 it uses 50 stretched z levels in the vertical with level thickness ranging from 1 m near the surface to 400 m at the sea bottom i e around 4000 m depth fig 1c the model has two radiative open boundaries a west open boundary at 4 8 w nearly 60 km east of the strait of gibraltar and a south open boundary across the sicily channel 37 n the strait of messina between sicily and continental italy is closed in wmed36 ŒΩh is fixed at 30 m2 s and Œ∑h at 1 109 m4 s the second configuration covers the northwestern mediterranean basin fig 1b with a 1 72 horizontal resolution from 1 to 1 3 km resolution and is called nwmed72 for this one a new bathymetry was built from the interpolation of a 1 120 horizontal resolution topography with a particular attention on the islands coastlines and river mouths 50 stretched z levels are also used in the vertical but with a higher refinement near the surface and thus a first level thickness of 0 5 m fig 1c this configuration has 2 two open boundaries a south open boundary near 38 n south of the balearic islands and sardinia and a east open boundary across the tyrrhenian sea 12 5 e in nwmed72 ŒΩh is fixed at 15 m2 s and Œ∑h is fixed at 1 10 8 m4 s 2 2 2 model forcing and initial conditions every simulation begins on 1 september 2012 until the 4 november 2012 in the following this simulation period will sometimes be called sop1 for simplification simulations are driven at the air sea interface by the heat the short wave radiation minus the long wave radiation minus the sensible and latent heat fluxes freshwater evaporation minus precipitation and momentum fluxes taken from the arome wmed forecast fourri√© et al 2015 doi 10 6096 hymex arome wmed 2012 02 20 this atmospheric forcing dataset was already used in lebeaupin brossier et al 2014 and l√©ger et al 2016 as it well reproduces with a high resolution 2 5 km and frequency 1h the sop1 meteorological conditions the initial conditions on the 1 september 2012 for the conservative temperature Œ∏ and absolute salinity s are provided by the mercator oc√©an daily psy2v4r4 analysis 1 12 horizontal resolution lellouche et al 2013 ocean velocity is initially null the open boundary conditions Œ∏ s and velocities u v are also provided by the psy2v4r4 mean fields at a monthly frequency for wmed36 as in lebeaupin brossier et al 2014 and at a daily frequency for nwmed72 2 2 3 river runoff data set all the rivers used in the simulations are described in fig 1a b and table 1 in nwmed72 a total of 28 rivers are considered whereas 38 rivers are considered in wmed36 in this study we collected river flow observations to increase the accuracy of the freshwater input this is done for the 28 rivers in nwmed72 domain daily and hourly observations for french rivers were collected from the french institute banque hydro spanish and italian main rivers observations were provided by the ministerio de agricultura alimentaci√≥n y medio ambiente and by the university of l aquila respectively for the ebro and jucar rivers only daily observations were available the hourly set is then built from the daily set and consists in 24 consecutive identical values fig 2 b and c for the tibre only hourly observations were available so the daily runoff is built from the average of the hourly set fig 2a for each river runoff observations are taken at the hydrological station the nearest from the river mouth the runoff monthly climatology from beuvier et al 2010 is also used this climatology was built using the climatological average of ludwig et al 2009 dataset to compute monthly runoff values it is based on the values of 33 main rivers on the whole mediterranean sea listed in the rivdis database v√∂r√∂smarty et al 1996 furthermore in this climatology all the runoff of the secondary rivers are gathered and averaged by subbasin described in ludwig et al 2009 and put as a coastal runoff uniformly distributed over the coastal grid points fig 2 represents all the runoff time series available for 4 main rivers in the northwestern mediterranean during the sop1 there is a significant difference between observations and climatological data set indeed on fig 2d which represents the rh√¥ne river the peak flow of the intense observation period iop 7a at the end of september and iop13 occurring mid october appear clearly with the observations whereas they are obviously absent in the monthly climatology in the following the freshwater budget is calculated considering the wmed36 domain over the whole period of the simulation for the climatological runoff dataset it is about 2477 m3 s included 1126 m3 s of coastal runoff which represents almost 50 of the total whereas the contribution of freshwater for the daily runoff dataset is about 2142 m3 s with 482 m3 s for the coastal runoff the contribution for the hourly runoff dataset is nearly the same as for the daily runoff dataset with 2137 m3 s of total freshwater with 482 m3 s of coastal runoff the total amount of freshwater is larger in the climatological dataset due to the coastal runoff added along the coasts to figure all the secondary rivers when only considering the main rivers they have indeed a larger contribution in the daily and hourly observations than in climatology as shown in fig 2 in summary this means that the secondary rivers which are now explicitly included bring less water than the climatological coastal runoff this knowing that several rivers are missing in the observational datasets notably outside france but that there are also large uncertainties in the climatological coastal runoff values the daily and hourly observations improves the realism of the river forcing with a greater spatial and temporal variability it can also be noticed that a sub daily variation of the runoff is observed on fig 2a and d consequently three types of river runoff forcing are applied in wmed36 the first simulation named w36 cl uses the climatological data and coastal runoff on the whole domain the second one uses daily observations table 1 where available and climatological data over the south and west subbasins see fig 1d and is called hereafter w36 dd the last one is the same but with hourly observations and is named w36 hh in w36 dd and w36 hh the coastal runoff is as displayed in the fig 1d indeed a part of the coastal runoff is deleted where new river runoffs observation are added in nwmed72 the coastal runoff is never used in order to consider more realistic simulations the first river forcing uses climatological data of the 4 majors rivers rh√¥ne tibre ebro and jucar called n72 cl the second one uses daily runoff observations called n72 dd and the last one hourly runoff observations named n72 hh for each configuration river mouths are located in the domain using the nearest grid point from their exact locations in all the simulations described before the river inflow is injected at the surface as if it was precipitation the version 3 6 of nemo allows us to change the way the river input is applied with the possibility to prescribe it over a defined depth rather than only at the surface this method is only used here with nwmed72 this last simulation called n72 dd z has the same characteristics as the one with daily river runoff but the inflow is distributed over several ocean levels see section 4 3 validation in this section the validation is done by comparison of the simulations against several ocean surface observations using data from moored buoys ships and satellites for all of them only values with the highest quality index are kept for validation the observed dataset is inhomogeneous in space and time see fig s1 and table s1 in the supplement the simulated sss sea surface practical salinity and sst sea surface potential temperature were extracted from the model at the nearest grid point of the ocean observation locations the closest output in time is also chosen knowing that wmed36 outputs are given every 3 hours whereas nwmed72 has hourly outputs for ocean surface fields for each observed dataset a comparison is done via several scores such as the bias model minus observation the root mean square error rmse and the correlation coefficient over the simulation period from the 1 september to the 4 november although all the simulations have been compared to observations this section mainly presents the results of w36 cl and n72 cl for more clarity this also permits to complement the validation works of lebeaupin brossier et al 2014 and l√©ger et al 2016 that used the wmed36 configuration with the climatological runoff forcing first moored buoys give the observed series of atmospheric parameters 2 m temperature 2 m humidity 10 m wind speed direction and gust intensity mean sea level pressure wave parameters height and period as well as ocean parameters sst and sss the sst and sss observations of three buoys are used in this study see fig 1b the lion buoy hereafter gl located at 4 7 e 42 1 n and the azur buoy hereafter az at 7 8 e 43 4 n of m√©t√©o france and the tarragona buoy hereafter ta at 1 5 e 40 7 n of puertos del estado tables 2 and 3 summarize the scores against buoys in w36 cl the sst is in good agreement with the gl and ta buoys with a negative bias of less than 0 4 c and a correlation coefficient above 0 9 fig 3 d and f for the az buoy the bias is higher due to an overestimation in late october fig 3b that is explained by a transport of warmer water by the nc still a good correlation coefficient is obtained over the period table 2 in n72 cl the bias is reduced at the az buoy with an improvement of the correlation coefficient yet an overestimation is observed at the end of the simulation also due to the nc in this place for the gl buoy after the 20 october fig 3d an overestimation is noticed this is due to the buoy location south of the nbf in warmer water the sss for all three buoys are not very well reproduced with correlation around 0 2 a quasi constant underestimation of the sss is found table 3 which is mostly inherited from the initial conditions and a high variability with peaks is simulated fig 3 all of those peaks present both in w36 cl and n72 cl are due to precipitation in the atmosphere forcing and each one can be related to different iops iop13 from the 13 to 16 october with a first phase along the catalan coast fig 3e and a second along the french riviera fig 3a rainaud et al 2016

fig 3 even though the simulated peaks produce too low sss most of them are present in the observation n72 cl and w36 cl differ at the end of the simulation for the ta buoy where w36 cl has cooler and saltier water than n72 cl fig 3e and f this is due to the eddy present in the n72 cl which keeps the warmer and less salty water apart from the colder and saltier water offshore in w36 cl this eddy is farther from the coast so the water from the gulf of lion reaches the catalan coast surface in situ sst and sss data were collected with thermosalinometers on board of several ships the marfet niolon freighter hereafter mn made weekly round trips between france marseille and algeria mostaganem algiers fig 1a in the context of the hymex program mn was equipped with a thermosalinometer tsg as part of the transmed network taupier letage et al 2014 sst was measured with a high quality sensor sbe38 whereas the surface salinity was obtained with the tsg sbe45 see transmed website for more details along the different routes crossing the western basin shown in fig 1a the tsg data of several others ships such as the r v t√©thys ii ty the r v europe eu and the container ship barcelona express ba fig 1a and b were collected in the operational coriolis database and used here to validate the simulations the comparison to tsg dataset is done using the first model level knowing that the depth of the tsg measurement could vary 1 3 m between ships in space and time and also for a same ship due to its cargo the validation against tsg is done in figs 4 and 5 showing the biases along ship tracks during the sop1 the scores are summarized in tables 3 and 2 the results show that the sss underestimation concerns the whole domain for the sst a positive bias is observed yet a good correlation is obtained for both w36 cl and n72 cl simulations especially for the mn correlation around 0 9 more locally some areas are subject to a lot of sss and sst variability like the catalan coast and river mouths for example a zoom on the rh√¥ne river mouth is shown in figs 4 and 5 where tsg data are available in both w36 cl and n72 cl the sss is mainly overestimated compared to observations this can indicate that the influence of the rh√¥ne plume is too small and does not affect enough the sss at the tsg location see also fig s1 in the supplement the sst has mainly a positive bias in w36 cl which is reduced in n72 cl however bias values vary a lot from one ship to another and can be explained by the date of the sampling which may differ between ships and so as the ocean process sampled in order to enlarge the validation we use satellite observations of sst available during the sop1 from two different sources the first satellite sst dataset comes from the metop a platform equipped with the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr pathfinder instrument the l3p sst product used here is retrieved from the avhrr infrared channels by using a multispectral technique applying a re mapping onto a 0 02 resolution grid and a cloud mask it is available twice a day at midnight and noon the second satellite sst dataset is obtained using the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri data on the meteosat second generation msg satellite sst is retrieved from the seviri infrared channels 10 8 and 12 0 ¬µm using a multispectral algorithm that accounts for regional and seasonal biases due to changing atmospheric conditions the l3c product is obtained first by aggregating all 15 min sst data available in one hour time the priority being given to the value the closest of the nominal time and then by remapping over a 0 05 regular grid both dataset metop l3p and seviri l3c were developed by the group for high resolution sea surface temperature ghrsst and are produced by the european organization for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat ocean and sea ice satellite application facility osi saf in france they were made available on the hymex database by centre de meteorologie spatiale cms of m√©t√©o france their coverages sample the whole wmed domain but depend on the cloud cover only satellite sst observations over the north western mediterranean sea fig 1b are considered for the validation to be consistent between the two configurations for each sst satellite dataset metop l3p and seviri l3c the mean score for a day is calculated the evolution of the scores along the sop1 is shown in fig 6 the temporal evolution of the observation availability per day is also displayed on fig 6g and h for metop l3p it shows a good correlation with an average of 0 7 for both w36 cl and n72 cl days with weak values of correlation can be related to days with less data i e larger cloud covering fig 6g in average the bias value is around 0 55 c for w36 cl and it is reduced to 0 37 c for n72 cl for seviri l3c both simulations show a reduction of the bias fig 6 this is explained by the frequency of observations every hour more in agreement with the frequency of the model outputs in w36 cl the bias is reduced to 0 3 c and in n72 cl to 0 2 c the correlation is still around 0 7 comparing with both metop l3p and seviri l3c a reduction of the bias in n72 cl is found compared to w36 cl this suggests mainly that the finer horizontal resolution allows a better representation of the sst at fine scale furthermore the improvement in general of the scores in n72 cl might also be affected by the realistic boundary conditions prescribed closer than in w36 cl and impacting directly the area evaluated to summarize the w36 cl and n72 cl simulations give a good representation of the sea surface over the basin yet there is still some issues with some specific areas with larger biases such as close to the river mouths along the catalan coast with the effect of the nbf and along the french riviera impacted by the nc moreover models tend to underestimate the sss and especially the rapid decreases after hpes several causes can produced the too strong sss responses to precipitation errors in precipitations in arome wmed in terms of intensity a more refined vertical grid in n72 and a too small vertical diffusion this latter aspect has been investigated with an increase of the vertical diffusivity coefficients fig s2 and dummytxdummy table s2 in the supplement that does not show significant improvement the increase in resolution from w36 cl 1 36 to n72 cl 1 72 shows some improvements on the sst and the sss over the basin with bias reduction and slightly higher correlation coefficients the validation was also done for the others simulations using daily and hourly runoffs they do not showed large modification on average over the sop1 see tables 2 and 3 and figs s3 to s6 in the supplement but significant differences are found locally or for short periods of time and this will be discussed on the next section it appears that few observations are available close to river mouths especially when considering the salinity this makes difficult to clearly evaluate the possible improvements or degradations in the ocean simulation when changing the runoff forcing so only the sensitivity is considered in the following section 4 river runoff input sensitivity in this section the goal is to better understand the impact of several runoff representation on the sss sst and local circulation only results from the nwmed72 configuration will be described as the validation showed scores improvements with resolution and the experiment with a vertical distribution of runoff was only done with n72 dd z different cases will be studied to focus on the sop1 flood events 4 1 temporal variation of runoff 4 1 1 impact on the stratification the example of the iop16a from 25 to 28 october 2012 several mcss affected the north western mediterranean area causing heavy precipitation and flooding in the south east of france this event known as the iop16a is notably described in details in ducrocq et al 2014 and duffourg et al 2016 a peak flow was observed in the c√¥te d azur region and figs 7a and c show the differences between n72 dd and n72 cl fig 7b and d the difference between n72 dd and n72 hh of the simulated sss and sst for the 27 october in this area river plumes marked by low sst and sss are clearly seen along the coast in n72 dd whereas they are absent in n72 cl indeed in n72 dd the sss is reduced by more than 1 psu compare to n72 cl fig 7a fig 7e and f show the differences in the mixed layer depth mld the mld is based on a criterion on density œÅc 0 01 kg m 3 and on the frequency of brunt v√§is√§l√§ n that characterize the ocean stratification therefore the mld h satisfies the relation 1 m h n 2 d z g œÅ c œÅ 0 with g the gravity and œÅ 0 is the reference density of 1026 kg m 3 in the vicinity of the river mouths the presence of fresh very light water close to the surface increase the stratification of the upper layer and the mld bounded by this salt barrier is generally small the larger differences are found between n72 dd and n72 cl and can reach more than 15 m which represent locally a reduction by more than 80 of the n72 cl mld the differences between n72 dd and n72 hh are lower in term of mld but still can represent modifications by 30 to 100 the thinning of the ocean mixed layer oml enhances its sensitivity to the atmospheric forcing indeed the thinner the oml which is at the interface between the low atmospheric levels and the ocean thermocline the more sensitive it becomes to atmospheric forcing as a consequence of this increase in stratification the response in sst becomes stronger differences in simulated sst close to river mouths can reach 2 c between n72 dd and n72 cl fig 7c looking more locally on the french riviera close to the argens river fig 8 shows the evolution of the vertical profile of salinity and temperature during 27 october at a point near the river mouth see the red circle in fig 7e since the argens river is not represented in the climatology data set the ocean profile is well mixed in n72 cl indeed there are no variations in salinity or in temperature nor at the surface nor deeper in the ocean the hourly observations of the argens river show that the peak flow occurs early in the morning and then decreased along the day this decrease is taken into account in n72 hh whereas in n72 dd the peak flow is smoothed and happens artificially in the middle of the day not shown in the morning the stratification is larger in n72 hh with colder and fresher water near the surface thus a maximum difference of about 33 psu and 7 c at the surface is found between n72 hh and n72 cl and of 15 psu and 4 c between n72 dd and n72 hh in the afternoon the stratification in n72 hh is smaller than in n72 dd during the day the spatial extent of the river plume differs between n72 dd and n72 hh due to the higher frequency in n72 hh this also explains the differences of sss and sst shown in fig 7b and d of respectively more than 1 psu and almost 2 c the cooling at the end of the day is due to the set up of an upwelling caused by an intense episode of mistral over the gulf of lion which intensifies on 28 october lebeaupin brossier et al 2014 rainaud et al 2016 2017 4 1 2 plume and ocean surface circulation the amount of freshwater input from rivers forms a plume in the ocean fig 9 represents the evolution of the ebro plume surface during the sop1 for the three nwmed72 simulations the area is delineated over a domain around the ebro river mouth with a sss below 37 psu on average the surface of the river plume is 5 times higher in n72 dd than in n72 cl whereas the plume surface evolution is similar between n72 dd and n72 hh fig 9 this shows that using daily or a hourly frequency do not have a great influence on the extent of the river plume a high variability is found even in n72 cl as large peaks are found related to low salinity lenses caused by the precipitation that artificially increase the plume surface several decreases in the surface are also noticed mainly in n72 dd and n72 hh and can be due to various factors such as a decrease in the river flow a modification of the wind velocity or direction leading to coastward advection or to higher mixing or modification in the circulation in the area another approach is to look at the sss variability over the sop1 to estimate the extent of the plume fig 10 a it is shown for a zoom in the gulf of lion the variability is computed as i n s s s i s s s 2 n and high values give the influence area of the river plumes the rh√¥ne river plume appears clearly and have the largest variability the variability is larger in n72 dd than in n72 cl fig 10b and river plumes such as for the aude or the orb which are not present in n72 cl appear along the coast here sss variability between n72 dd and n72 hh appears quite similar as the differences are very small fig 10c and confirm previous results on the ebro case considering plume extent fig 11 a shows sss and surface current velocity differences between n72 dd and n72 cl over the gulf of lion on the 14 october 2012 this date corresponds to the iop13 when the rh√¥ne river reached a peak flow fig 2 most of the differences between simulations are located in the nbf mainly due to small modifications in the circulation not shown and near the rh√¥ne river mouth fig 11a fig 11b displays the surface current direction in the gulf of lion for n72 dd and n72 cl and the shade quantify the change in the current direction between the two simulation even if the general direction of the current is globally unchanged we can notice some local differences in the rh√¥ne river plume up to 30 the largest differences in velocity near river mouths can first be explained by the filtered free surface elevation scheme of roullet and madec 2000 that produces a larger additional force in the momentum equation in response to a larger runoff input at the river mouths as found here with the better represented rh√¥ne river flood in n72 dd in addition the spreading of freshwater over a heavier fluid results in a decrease in potential energy as it is partially converted into kinetic energy and thus in an intensification of the plume induced circulation chao and boicourt 1986 comparing n72 dd and n72 hh differences of current intensity are small and do not exceed 0 04 m s in this area not shown to summarize changing from climatological runoff forcing to daily forcing has a significant impact on the local ocean surface and stratification indeed during flood events the sss and sst are lower when using daily observations in the vicinity of river mouths the impact is also observed on the representation of the river plumes becoming larger and thus extend their influence furthermore the current intensity within the plumes is increased and the current direction is slightly modified when changing from daily to hourly runoff forcing the overall impact is smaller regarding period of time of several months such as the sop1 similar comparisons were done for the wmed36 configuration not shown and lead to the same conclusions 4 2 depth sensitivity in this section the impact of a vertical distribution of the runoff forcing is examined indeed the depth in which the flow is homogeneously distributed can be imposed or calculated inline via a linear expression which is now made available in nemo v3 6 it takes into account a maximum depth d e p t h max in meter and a maximum runoff r u n max in kg m2 s therefore the depth over which the river runoff will be prescribed is calculated as r u n o f f d e p t h d e p t h max r u n max z r n f with zrnf the maximum value of runoff for a specific river over a period of time in our case we choose to compute once and for all the depth for each river with d e p t h max 7 m corresponding to 14 levels in nwmed72 r u n max 0 6 kg m 2 s and zrnf the maximum runoff for the considered river over the sop1 r u n max is defined just above the maximum value of the rh√¥ne river taken as reference since it represents the biggest river inflow during our period of simulation following the same rule d e p t h max is defined to 7 m compared to the bathymetry depth at the rh√¥ne river mouth fig 12 shows for 27 october the surface and vertical sections of the salinity and temperature differences between n72 dd and n72 dd z near the argens river whose runoff input is over 1 m depth representing 2 levels in our model in n72 dd z the surface water is warmer and saltier whereas the water deeper is colder and less salty than in n72 dd in range of more than 1 psu and 1 c the mld differences over the french riviera between n72 dd and n72 dd z are only about few meters fig 12c but the mld is increased by 70 at some points near the river mouths in n72 dd z compared to n72 dd not shown the sss variability differences between n72 dd and n72 dd z over the whole sop1 fig 10d confirm that the major changes are located close to the river mouths like for the others simulations the validation of n72 dd z was done and scores are shown in tables 2 and 3 generally the scores for moored buoys and tsg in sst and sss are the same as for n72 dd or slightly better in some case tsg biases of n72 dd and n72 dd z are comparable between the two simulations over the domain more locally looking at the europe ship sss fig 13 a and c and sst fig 13b and d biases showed significant differences indeed fig 13e and f represents sss and sst differences between n72 dd and n72 dd z large variations are only located in the vicinity of the rh√¥ne river mouth and can reach more than 1 psu and 3 c indeed near the rh√¥ne river mouth in n72 dd the sst is mainly underestimated compared to the observations fig 13b in n72 dd z the biases are reduced with an increase of the sst fig 13d this is due to the vertical redistribution of the input flow that brings less freshwater at the surface but more in the levels below indeed when the river flow is injected in surface it induces a very thin layer of freshwater and induces a marked salt barrier in the very first meters 1 2 m depth of the ocean this salt barrier thus bounds an internal mixed layer that isolates the layer s below from the air sea interactions it means that for identical sea surface fluxes the response of the internal layer will be more intense than for a typical mixed layer of 20 to 30 m depth when the river flow is injected along a depth the internal layer is in fact thicker and the salt barrier is less marked so due to this high but lower stratification in the very upper layer and in case of heat loss the temperature of the internal layer will decrease less than when runoff forcing is applied in surface but the cooling will affect a deeper layer 5 7 m depth the sst decreases but to a lesser extent and finally for a same river flow and same atmospheric forcing it leads to a warmer sst when the flow is vertically distributed the sss is also impacted notably in the influence area of the rh√¥ne plume where the sss values in n72 dd z are mostly higher than in n72 dd to summarize the vertical distribution of the runoff is impacting the ocean salinity and temperature near river mouths with saltier and warmer water at the surface than below the stratification is thus reduced and the mld is increased 5 conclusion heavy precipitation events occurring in the northwestern mediterranean basin have a significant impact on the river runoff producing brief and large amount of freshwater running to the sea such events constitute major contributions to the water cycle of the region and concern the three earth compartments atmosphere continental surface and ocean this study investigates the ocean sensitivity to river forcing in addition it allows a first validation of a new ocean configuration over the northwestern mediterranean basin at 1 72 horizontal resolution the results of the nemo ocean model simulations using three types of runoff forcing monthly climatology daily and hourly observations were compared to ocean in situ observations collected during the sop1 and satellite data they showed an agreement with observations on average even if the model tend to underestimate the sss indeed overestimation of sss decreases and sst diurnal cycle are noticed considering this our model might overestimate coastal oceanic responses to flood event in the results discussed in this paper a test with higher vertical diffusivity coefficients for tracers and momentum does not lead to significant improvement in fact such oceanic responses strongly depend on the atmospheric flux forcing moreover for n72 our changes in the description of the vertical levels in the ocean might have enhanced the large response of the first layer so this problem might be more complex and requires further investigation and notably sensitivity tests on vertical mixing scheme and comparison to what is used for example in operational oceanography for regional models such as at mercator oc√©an in any case more salinity observations over the domain and especially near the coast and in the mixed layer would have been useful for validation and in order to better assess the modifications of simulations using runoff observations to go further in the process of validation satellite images of chlorophyll could be used to look at the extent and shape of river plumes however this implies to correctly relate chlorophyll with modelled tracers and such evaluation is difficult in the absence of a biogeochemistry compartment in the model then a detailed comparison between the simulations were done showing large differences on the ocean stratification during flood events in particular the sss is significantly impacted near river mouths indeed observed runoff values allowed to describe the high frequency variability and thus the peak flows thus the extent and variability of river plumes are drastically increased large reduction of the mld is noticed in the vicinity of river mouths in the simulations with observed runoff forcing compared to those using the climatology this leads to a modification of the sst as the smaller the mld is the higher the response of the ocean mixed layer to the atmospheric forcing is in this area in future work the coupled arome nemo system will be used in order to better assess the impact on the air sea fluxes and on the low level atmospheric conditions the current intensity is also increased in the river plume when using runoff observations in response to the free surface elevation related to the larger amount of incoming freshwater during flood smaller differences are found when comparing simulations using daily and hourly observed forcing in both cases the peak flow is well represented but a delay can be artificially introduced in simulations using daily dataset as in that case the peak flow always happen at noon due to the nemo time interpolation this has an impact mostly on the extent of the plume and thus locally on the sss sst and mld finally a simulation where the runoff is vertically distributed shows local impacts the salinity and the temperature are changed in surface but also on the ocean levels below this is due to the lower contribution of freshwater at the surface than deeper the mld and the stratification are also changed such as the plume variability near river mouths to conclude the need of using observed runoff data with a high temporal frequency daily hourly to drive ocean models has been illustrated here especially in case of floods indeed such realistic forcing allows to well reproduce the ocean response to flood event in term of stratification and plume dynamics nowadays almost all european ocean forecast centers use monthly mean runoff datasets lellouche et al 2013 tonani et al 2014 therefore the results obtained here show that the use of a higher runoff frequency in forecast system can strongly impact the ocean circulation and stratification in particular in coastal areas nevertheless the use of high frequency river runoff observations requires to collect a large amount of data thus an and sometimes several updated and maintained database is are needed in addition the data collection can be difficult particularly when the studied domain covers several countries the use of a vertical input for river runoff demands also accurate information about each river depth in the domain and that can be difficult to collect nevertheless the simulation appears to be more realistic a way to describe the strong river flow variations properly could be to use river runoff forecasts at a daily or hourly time step from a hydrometeorological model and or a box model approach verri et al 2018 more broadly this finally calls for the development of integrated prediction systems that are of strong interest for coastal regions that have a huge vulnerability to severe hazards in many

24082,the western mediterranean sea is often affected by heavy precipitation which frequently generates floods or even flash floods these events generally produce brief but major freshwater inputs in the ocean in order to evaluate the sensitivity to the representation of river freshwater input three different runoff forcing dataset are used to drive the nemo ocean model a monthly climatology an observational dataset with a daily or a hourly frequency the sensitivity is investigated over the first special observation period sop1 of the hymex program that took place in autumn 2012 in two configurations of nemo the first is wmed36 over the western mediterranean sea at 1 36 resolution and the second is a new configuration covering the north western mediterranean sea with a 1 72 resolution named nwmed72 with nwmed72 the impact of the representation of the river freshwater flux i e moving from a surface flux to a vertical distribution of the flux is also evaluated the results show that the ocean stratification is significantly modified locally in simulations where runoff observations are used compared to those using the climatology the sea surface salinity is modified as well as the mixed layer which is thinner as bounded by a well marked halocline the sea surface temperature is also impacted by the change in runoff frequency moreover the current intensity in river plume during flood is increased vertical profiles of salinity and temperature and thus the mixed layer depth are changed when the runoff forcing is distributed over a depth those changes are limited and very local but the realism of the river runoff input is improved keywords flood heavy precipitation hymex north western mediterranean sea river plumes runoff freshwater flux stratification 1 introduction the mediterranean sea is a semi enclosed sea where all of the water exchanges are concentrated in the strait of gibraltar with the atlantic ocean and in the bosphorus strait with the black sea well known as an evaporation basin the loss of water in the atmosphere is compensated by an inflow of atlantic water aw bormans et al 1986 mariotti et al 2002 which circulates cyclonically at basin scale see millot and taupier letage 2005 for a review in the western basin it forms the eastward algerian current ac fig 1 and the southwestward northern current nc fig 1 the latter flows along slope from the ligurian sea to the balearic sea the northern limit of the reservoir of aw is materialized by the north balearic front nbf fig 1 the associated eastward recirculation along the northern side of the nbf and the nc form a cyclonic gyre interacting with atmosphere continental surface and bathymetry fig 1 during wintertime the dry and cold regional winds northerly mistral and northwesterly tramontane can induce deep water formation in the gulf of lion both by cascading and open sea convection marshall and schott 1999 houpert et al 2016 testor et al 2018 during the stratified period these winds induce upwelling cells in the gulf of lion e g millot 1990 and frequent shallow anticyclonic eddies along its western coast rubio et al 2009 hu et al 2011 the mediterranean sea is also a region frequently affected by heavy precipitation events hpes such events are characterized by large amounts of accumulated rainfall in short time typically more than 100 mm in 24h associated with mesoscale convective systems mcss ducrocq et al 2016 falling over small river catchments that are characteristic of the mediterranean region tarolli et al 2012 merheb et al 2016 these large and sudden precipitation amounts often lead to devastating flash floods and flooding events causing damages and sometimes casualties buzzi et al 1998 romero et al 1998 krichak et al 2004 delrieu et al 2005 efstathiou et al 2014 ivanƒçan picek et al 2014 hpes and the associated flooding can produce large amount of freshwater input into ocean therefore river freshwater runoff plays an important role on coastal regions freshwater flows from the river mouths to the ocean as a plume and previous studies have shown impact on the local circulation e g brando et al 2015 in most of the cases water from the plume tends to flow along the coast with the land on the right in the northern hemisphere due to the influence of the earth s rotation simpson 1997 this low salinity buoyant freshwater alters stratification in the vicinity of the river mouth thus a variability of the sea surface salinity sss and the sea surface temperature sst is observed sometimes it can be advected downstream and have an impact off shore brando et al 2015 tseng et al 2016 fournier et al 2016 this study investigates the impact of a better representation of river runoffs in a high resolution ocean model with a focus in the western mediterranean area indeed several case studies such as schiller and kourafalou 2010 and herzfeld 2015 have shown that the way the river runoff is modeled impacts the river plume area and the mixing processes in coastal regions more particularly a vertical distribution of the runoff flow can reduce low salinity surface bias tseng et al 2016 the morphology of the plumes is sensitive to wind events and river discharges otero et al 2008 more especially in our area of interest one of the largest rivers is the rh√¥ne river flowing in the gulf of lion with an average flow around 1 700 m3 s its plume can extend far away about 40 km from the coast estournel et al 1997 and presents a high variability depending on the meteorological conditions and outflow forcing broche et al 1998 estournel et al 2001 this study investigates how river plumes are represented and how a high temporal frequency flow can affect them especially during floods moreover we focus on how the heat and salt contents are impacted along with the stratification in the vicinity of river mouths to evaluate the sensitivity to the representation of river runoff the nemo ocean model is used forced in surface by the atmospheric forecasts of the 2 5 km horizontal resolution arome wmed atmospheric model over a well observed autumn period with the occurrence of several hpes and river floods in the northwestern mediterranean area two different ocean configurations are used fig 1a and b at a 1 36 and 1 72 horizontal resolutions the sensitivity is investigated by comparison of ocean simulations changing the river forcing in term of realism climatology vs observations frequency monthly daily hourly and distribution surface input vs vertical distribution first step is the validation of the two different configurations then the sensitivity to the frequency change of river runoff and to a more realistic vertical distribution of it is evaluated using several diagnostics on sss sst and local circulation this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a description of the ocean model used with two configurations of the river runoff forcing dataset and of the ocean observations used for the validation the latter is detailed in section 3 while section 4 presents results about the sensitivity to the different river runoff inputs conclusions and discussions are finally given in section 5 2 context and model description 2 1 hymex campaign the hydrological cycle in the mediterranean experiment hymex international programme drobinski et al 2014 aims to investigate the hydrological cycle processes with emphasis on high impact weather events over the mediterranean region two fields campaigns were organized during fall 2012 and winter 2013 called special observation period sop1 and sop2 respectively the sop1 from 5 september to 6 november 2012 was particularly devoted to the documentation of heavy precipitation with the deployment of more than 200 instruments on land as well as in the air and at sea ducrocq et al 2014 in particular several platforms monitoring the ocean surface and upper layer were deployed during the campaign most of these platforms were located in the north western mediterranean area and thus provide a valuable dataset to validate the ocean simulations 2 2 numerical set up 2 2 1 configurations the ocean model used is

velocity a bi laplacian operator is used with the horizontal viscosity coefficient Œ∑h the first configuration is the sub regional eddy resolving configuration covering the western mediterranean basin fig 1a with a 1 36 horizontal resolution over an orca grid from 2 to 2 5 km resolution named wmed36 lebeaupin brossier et al 2014 it uses 50 stretched z levels in the vertical with level thickness ranging from 1 m near the surface to 400 m at the sea bottom i e around 4000 m depth fig 1c the model has two radiative open boundaries a west open boundary at 4 8 w nearly 60 km east of the strait of

second configuration covers the northwestern mediterranean basin fig 1b with a 1 72 horizontal resolution from 1 to 1 3 km resolution and is called nwmed72 for this one a new bathymetry was built from the interpolation of a 1 120 horizontal resolution topography with a particular attention on the islands coastlines and river mouths 50 stretched z levels are also used in the vertical but with a higher refinement near the surface and thus a first level thickness of 0 5 m fig 1c this configuration has 2 two open boundaries a south open boundary near 38 n south of the balearic islands and

on 1 september 2012 until the 4 november 2012 in the following this simulation period will sometimes be called sop1 for simplification simulations are driven at the air sea interface by the heat the short wave radiation minus the long wave radiation minus the sensible and latent heat fluxes freshwater evaporation minus precipitation and momentum fluxes taken from the arome wmed forecast fourri√© et al 2015 doi 10 6096 hymex arome wmed 2012 02 20 this atmospheric forcing dataset was already used in lebeaupin brossier et al 2014 and l√©ger et al 2016 as it well reproduces with a high resolution 2 5 km and frequency 1h the sop1 meteorological conditions the initial conditions on the 1 september 2012 for the conservative temperature Œ∏ and absolute salinity s are provided by the mercator oc√©an daily psy2v4r4 analysis 1 12 horizontal resolution lellouche et al 2013 ocean velocity is initially null the open boundary conditions Œ∏ s and velocities u v are also provided by the psy2v4r4 mean fields at a monthly frequency for wmed36 as in lebeaupin brossier et al 2014 and at a daily frequency for nwmed72 2 2 3 river runoff data set all the rivers used in the simulations are described in fig 1a b and table 1 in nwmed72 a total of 28 rivers are considered whereas 38 rivers are considered in wmed36 in this study we collected river flow observations to increase the accuracy of the freshwater input this is done for the 28 rivers in nwmed72 domain daily and hourly observations for french rivers were collected from the french institute banque hydro spanish and italian main rivers observations were provided by the ministerio de agricultura alimentaci√≥n y medio ambiente and by the university of l aquila respectively for the ebro and jucar rivers only daily observations were available the hourly set is then built from the daily set and consists in 24 consecutive identical values fig 2 b and c for the tibre only hourly observations were available so the daily runoff is built from the average of the hourly set fig 2a for each river runoff observations are taken at the hydrological station the nearest from the river mouth the runoff monthly climatology from beuvier et al 2010 is also used this climatology was built using the climatological average of ludwig et al 2009 dataset to compute monthly runoff values it is based on the values of 33 main rivers on the whole mediterranean sea listed in the rivdis database v√∂r√∂smarty et al 1996 furthermore in this climatology all the runoff of the secondary rivers are gathered and averaged by subbasin described in ludwig et al 2009 and put as a coastal runoff uniformly distributed over the coastal grid points fig 2 represents all the runoff time series available for 4 main rivers in the northwestern mediterranean during the sop1 there is a significant difference between observations and climatological data set indeed on fig 2d which represents the rh√¥ne river the peak flow of the intense observation period iop 7a at the end of september and iop13 occurring mid october appear clearly with the observations whereas they are obviously absent in the monthly climatology in the following the freshwater budget is calculated considering the wmed36 domain over the whole period of the simulation for the climatological runoff dataset it is about 2477 m3 s included 1126 m3 s of coastal runoff which represents almost 50 of the total whereas the contribution of freshwater for the daily runoff dataset is about 2142 m3 s with 482 m3 s for the coastal runoff the contribution for the hourly runoff dataset is nearly the same as for the daily runoff dataset with 2137 m3 s of total freshwater with 482 m3 s of coastal runoff the total amount of freshwater is larger in the climatological dataset due to the coastal runoff added along the coasts to figure all the secondary rivers when only considering the main rivers they have indeed a larger contribution in the daily and hourly observations than in climatology as shown in fig 2 in summary this means that the secondary rivers which are now explicitly included bring less water than the climatological coastal runoff this knowing that several rivers are missing in the observational datasets notably outside france but that there are also large uncertainties in the climatological coastal runoff values the daily and hourly observations improves the realism of the river forcing with a greater spatial and temporal variability it can also be noticed that a sub daily variation of the runoff is observed on fig 2a and d consequently three types of river runoff forcing are applied in wmed36 the first simulation named w36 cl uses the climatological data and coastal runoff on the whole domain the second one uses daily observations table 1 where available and climatological data over the south and west subbasins see fig 1d and is called hereafter w36 dd the last one is the same but with hourly observations and is named w36 hh in w36 dd and w36 hh the coastal runoff is as displayed in the fig 1d indeed a part of the coastal runoff is deleted where new river runoffs observation are added in nwmed72 the coastal runoff is never used in order to consider more realistic simulations the first river forcing uses climatological data of the 4 majors rivers rh√¥ne tibre ebro and jucar called n72 cl the second one uses daily runoff observations called n72 dd and the last one hourly runoff observations named n72 hh for each configuration river mouths are located in the domain using the nearest grid point from their exact locations in all the simulations described before the river inflow is injected at the surface as if it was precipitation the version 3 6 of nemo allows us to change the way the river input is applied with the possibility to prescribe it over a defined depth rather than only at the surface this method is only used here with nwmed72 this last simulation called n72 dd z has the same characteristics as the one with daily river runoff but the inflow is distributed over several ocean levels see section 4 3 validation in this section the validation is done by comparison of the simulations against several ocean surface observations using data from moored buoys ships and satellites for all of them only values with the highest quality index are kept for validation the observed dataset is inhomogeneous in space and time see fig s1 and table s1 in the supplement the simulated sss sea surface practical salinity and sst sea surface potential temperature were extracted from the model at the nearest grid point of the ocean observation locations the closest output in time is also chosen knowing that wmed36 outputs are given every 3 hours whereas nwmed72 has hourly outputs for ocean surface fields for each observed dataset a comparison is done via several scores such as the bias model minus observation the root mean square error rmse and the correlation coefficient over the simulation period from the 1 september to the 4 november although all the simulations have been compared to observations this section mainly presents the results of w36 cl and n72 cl for more clarity this also permits to complement the validation works of lebeaupin brossier et al 2014 and l√©ger et al 2016 that used the wmed36 configuration with the climatological runoff forcing first moored buoys give the observed series of atmospheric parameters 2 m temperature 2 m humidity 10 m wind speed direction and gust intensity mean sea level pressure wave parameters height and period as well as ocean parameters sst and sss the sst and sss observations of three buoys are used in this study see fig 1b the lion buoy hereafter gl located at 4 7 e 42 1 n and the azur buoy hereafter az at 7 8 e 43 4 n of m√©t√©o france and the tarragona buoy hereafter ta at 1 5 e 40 7 n of puertos del estado tables 2 and 3 summarize the scores against buoys in w36 cl the sst is in good agreement with the gl and ta buoys with a negative bias of less than 0 4 c and a correlation coefficient above 0 9 fig 3 d and f for the az buoy the bias is higher due to an overestimation in late october fig 3b that is explained by a transport of warmer water by the nc still a good correlation coefficient is obtained over the period table 2 in n72 cl the bias is reduced at the az buoy with an improvement of the correlation coefficient yet an overestimation is observed at the end of the simulation also due to the nc in this place for the gl buoy after the 20 october fig 3d an overestimation is noticed this is due to the buoy location south of the nbf in warmer water the sss for all three buoys are not very well reproduced with correlation around 0 2 a quasi constant underestimation of the sss is found table 3 which is mostly inherited from the initial conditions and a high variability with peaks is simulated fig 3 all of those peaks present both in w36 cl and n72 cl are due to precipitation in the atmosphere forcing and each one can be related to different iops iop13 from the 13 to 16 october with a first phase along the catalan coast fig 3e and a second along the french riviera fig 3a rainaud et al 2016 duffourg et al 2018 iop15b between the 20 and 22 october impacting the gulf of lion fig 3c chazette et al 2016 and the iop16a between 24 and 26 october duffourg et al 2016 visible on all three buoys fig 3 even though the simulated peaks produce too low sss most of them are present in the observation n72 cl and w36 cl differ at the end of the simulation for the ta buoy where w36 cl has cooler and saltier water than n72 cl fig 3e and f this is due to the eddy present in the n72 cl which keeps the warmer and less salty water apart from the colder and saltier water offshore in w36 cl this eddy is farther from the coast so the water from the gulf of lion reaches the catalan coast surface in situ sst and sss data were collected with thermosalinometers on board of several ships the marfet niolon freighter hereafter mn made weekly round trips between france marseille and algeria mostaganem algiers fig 1a in the context of the hymex program mn was equipped with a thermosalinometer tsg as part of the transmed network taupier letage et al 2014 sst was measured with a high quality sensor sbe38 whereas the surface salinity was obtained with the tsg sbe45 see transmed website for more details along the different routes crossing the western basin shown in fig 1a the tsg data of several others ships such as the r v t√©thys ii ty the r v europe eu and the container ship barcelona express ba fig 1a and b were collected in the operational coriolis database and used here to validate the simulations the comparison to tsg dataset is done using the first model level knowing that the depth of the tsg measurement could vary 1 3 m between ships in space and time and also for a same ship due to its cargo the validation against tsg is done in figs 4 and 5 showing the biases along ship tracks during the sop1 the scores are summarized in tables 3 and 2 the results show that the sss underestimation concerns the whole domain for the sst a positive bias is observed yet a good correlation is obtained for both w36 cl and n72 cl simulations especially for the mn correlation around 0 9 more locally some areas are subject to a lot of sss and sst variability like the catalan coast and river mouths for example a zoom on the rh√¥ne river mouth is shown in figs 4 and 5 where tsg data are available in both w36 cl and n72 cl the sss is mainly overestimated compared to observations this can indicate that the influence of the rh√¥ne plume is too small and does not affect enough the sss at the tsg location see also fig s1 in the supplement the sst has mainly a positive bias in w36 cl which is reduced in n72 cl however bias values vary a lot from one ship to another and can be explained by the date of the sampling which may differ between ships and so as the ocean process sampled in order to enlarge the validation we use satellite observations of sst available during the sop1 from two different sources the first satellite sst dataset comes from the metop a platform equipped with the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr pathfinder instrument the l3p sst product used here is retrieved from the avhrr infrared channels by using a multispectral technique applying a re mapping onto a 0 02 resolution grid and a cloud mask it is available twice a day at midnight and noon the second satellite sst dataset is obtained using the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri data on the meteosat second generation msg satellite sst is retrieved from the seviri infrared channels 10 8 and 12 0 ¬µm using a multispectral algorithm that accounts for regional and seasonal biases due to changing atmospheric conditions the l3c product is obtained first by aggregating all 15 min sst data available in one hour time the priority being given to the value the closest of the nominal time and then by remapping over a 0 05 regular grid both dataset metop l3p and seviri l3c were developed by the group for high resolution sea surface temperature ghrsst and are produced by the european organization for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat ocean and sea ice satellite application facility osi saf in france they were made available on the hymex database by centre de meteorologie spatiale cms of m√©t√©o france their coverages sample the whole wmed domain but depend on the cloud cover only satellite sst observations over the north western mediterranean sea fig 1b are considered for the validation to be consistent between the two configurations for each sst satellite dataset metop l3p and seviri l3c the mean score for a day is calculated the evolution of the scores along the sop1 is shown in fig 6 the temporal evolution of the observation availability per day is also displayed on fig 6g and h for metop l3p it shows a good correlation with an average of 0 7 for both w36 cl and n72 cl days with weak values of correlation can be related to days with less data i e larger cloud covering fig 6g in average the bias value is around 0 55 c for w36 cl and it is reduced to 0 37 c for n72 cl for seviri l3c both simulations show a reduction of the bias fig 6 this is explained by the frequency of observations every hour more in agreement with the frequency of the model outputs in w36 cl the bias is reduced to 0 3 c and in n72 cl to 0 2 c the correlation is still around 0 7 comparing with both metop l3p and seviri l3c a reduction of the bias in n72 cl is found compared to w36 cl this suggests mainly that the finer horizontal resolution allows a better representation of the sst at fine scale furthermore the improvement in general of the scores in n72 cl might also be affected by the realistic boundary conditions prescribed closer than in w36 cl and impacting directly the area evaluated to summarize the w36 cl and n72 cl simulations give a good representation of the sea surface over the basin yet there is still some issues with some specific areas with larger biases such as close to the river mouths along the catalan coast with the effect of the nbf and along the french riviera impacted by the nc moreover models tend to underestimate the sss and especially the rapid decreases after hpes several causes can produced the too strong sss responses to precipitation errors in precipitations in arome wmed in terms of intensity a more refined vertical grid in n72 and a too small vertical diffusion this latter aspect has been investigated with an increase of the vertical diffusivity coefficients fig s2 and dummytxdummy table s2 in the supplement that does not show significant improvement the increase in resolution from w36 cl 1 36 to n72 cl 1 72 shows some improvements on the sst and the sss over the basin with bias reduction and slightly higher correlation coefficients the validation was also done for the others simulations using daily and hourly runoffs they do not showed large modification on average over the sop1 see tables 2 and 3 and figs s3 to s6 in the supplement but significant differences are found locally or for short periods of time and this will be discussed on the next section it appears that few observations are available close to river mouths especially when considering the salinity this makes difficult to clearly evaluate the possible improvements or degradations in the ocean simulation when changing the runoff forcing so only the sensitivity is considered in the following section 4 river runoff input sensitivity in this section the goal is to better understand the impact of several runoff representation on the sss sst and local circulation only results from the nwmed72 configuration will be described as the validation showed scores improvements with resolution and the experiment with a vertical distribution of runoff was only done with n72 dd z different cases will be studied to focus on the sop1 flood events 4 1 temporal variation of runoff 4 1 1 impact on the stratification the example of the iop16a from 25 to 28 october 2012 several mcss affected the north western mediterranean area causing heavy precipitation and flooding in the south east of france this event known as the iop16a is notably described in details in ducrocq et al 2014 and duffourg et al 2016 a peak flow was observed in the c√¥te d azur region and figs 7a and c show the differences between n72 dd and n72 cl fig 7b and d the difference between n72 dd and n72 hh of the simulated sss and sst for the 27 october in this area river plumes marked by low sst and sss are clearly seen along the coast in n72 dd whereas they are absent in n72 cl indeed in n72 dd the sss is reduced by more than 1 psu compare to n72 cl fig 7a fig 7e and f show the differences in the mixed layer depth mld the mld is based on a criterion on density œÅc 0 01 kg m 3 and on the frequency of brunt v√§is√§l√§ n that characterize the ocean stratification therefore the mld h satisfies the relation 1 m h n 2 d z g œÅ c œÅ 0 with g the gravity and œÅ 0 is the reference density of 1026 kg m 3 in the vicinity of the river mouths the presence of fresh very light water close to the surface increase the stratification of the upper layer and the mld bounded by this salt barrier is generally small the larger differences are found between n72 dd and n72 cl and can reach more than 15 m which represent locally a reduction by more than 80 of the n72 cl mld the differences between n72 dd and n72 hh are lower in term of mld but still can represent modifications by 30 to 100 the thinning of the ocean mixed layer oml enhances its sensitivity to the atmospheric forcing indeed the thinner the oml which is at the interface between the low atmospheric levels and the ocean thermocline the more sensitive it becomes to atmospheric forcing as a consequence of this increase in stratification the response in sst becomes stronger differences in simulated sst close to river mouths can reach 2 c between n72 dd and n72 cl fig 7c looking more locally on the french riviera close to the argens river fig 8 shows the evolution of the vertical profile of salinity and temperature during 27 october at a point near the river mouth see the red circle in fig 7e since the argens river is not represented in the climatology data set the ocean profile is well mixed in n72 cl indeed there are no variations in salinity or in temperature nor at the surface nor deeper in the ocean the hourly observations of the argens river show that the peak flow occurs early in the morning and then decreased along the day this decrease is taken into account in n72 hh whereas in n72 dd the peak flow is smoothed and happens artificially in the middle of the day not shown in the morning the stratification is larger in n72 hh with colder and fresher water near the surface thus a maximum difference of about 33 psu and 7 c at the surface is found between n72 hh and n72 cl and of 15 psu and 4 c between n72 dd and n72 hh in the afternoon the stratification in n72 hh is smaller than in n72 dd during the day the spatial extent of the river plume differs between n72 dd and n72 hh due to the higher frequency in n72 hh this also explains the differences of sss and sst shown in fig 7b and d of respectively more than 1 psu and almost 2 c the cooling at the end of the day is due to the set up of an upwelling caused by an intense episode of mistral over the gulf of lion which intensifies on 28 october lebeaupin brossier et al 2014 rainaud et al 2016 2017 4 1 2 plume and ocean surface circulation the amount of freshwater input from rivers forms a plume in the ocean fig 9 represents the evolution of the ebro plume surface during the sop1 for the three nwmed72 simulations the area is delineated over a domain around the ebro river mouth with a sss below 37 psu on average the surface of the river plume is 5 times higher in n72 dd than in n72 cl whereas the plume surface evolution is similar between n72 dd and n72 hh fig 9 this shows that using daily or a hourly frequency do not have a great influence on the extent of the river plume a high variability is found even in n72 cl as large peaks are found related to low salinity lenses caused by the precipitation that artificially increase the plume surface several decreases in the surface are also noticed mainly in n72 dd and n72 hh and can be due to various factors such as a decrease in the river flow a modification of the wind velocity or direction leading to coastward advection or to higher mixing or modification in the circulation in the area another approach is to look at the sss variability over the sop1 to estimate the extent of the plume fig 10 a it is shown for a zoom in the gulf of lion the variability is computed as i n s s s i s s s 2 n and high values give the influence area of the river plumes the rh√¥ne river plume appears clearly and have the largest variability the variability is larger in n72 dd than in n72 cl fig 10b and river plumes such as for the aude or the orb which are not present in n72 cl appear along the coast here sss variability between n72 dd and n72 hh appears quite similar as the differences are very small fig 10c and confirm previous results on the ebro case considering plume extent fig 11 a shows sss and surface current velocity differences between n72 dd and n72 cl over the gulf of lion on the 14 october 2012 this date corresponds to the iop13 when the rh√¥ne river reached a peak flow fig 2 most of the differences between simulations are located in the nbf mainly due to small modifications in the circulation not shown and near the rh√¥ne river mouth fig 11a fig 11b displays the surface current direction in the gulf of lion for n72 dd and n72 cl and the shade quantify the change in the current direction between the two simulation even if the general direction of the current is globally unchanged we can notice some local differences in the rh√¥ne river plume up to 30 the largest differences in velocity near river mouths can first be explained by the filtered free surface elevation scheme of roullet and madec 2000 that produces a larger additional force in the momentum equation in response to a larger runoff input at the river mouths as found here with the better represented rh√¥ne river flood in n72 dd in addition the spreading of freshwater over a heavier fluid results in a decrease in potential energy as it is partially converted into kinetic energy and thus in an intensification of the plume induced circulation chao and boicourt 1986 comparing n72 dd and n72 hh differences of current intensity are small and do not exceed 0 04 m s in this area not shown to summarize changing from climatological runoff forcing to daily forcing has a significant impact on the local ocean surface and stratification indeed during flood events the sss and sst are lower when using daily observations in the vicinity of river mouths the impact is also observed on the representation of the river plumes becoming larger and thus extend their influence furthermore the current intensity within the plumes is increased and the current direction is slightly modified when changing from daily to hourly runoff forcing the overall impact is smaller regarding period of time of several months such as the sop1 similar comparisons were done for the wmed36 configuration not shown and lead to the same conclusions 4 2 depth sensitivity in this section the impact of a vertical distribution of the runoff forcing is examined indeed the depth in which the flow is homogeneously distributed can be imposed or calculated inline via a linear expression which is now made available in nemo v3 6 it takes into account a maximum depth d e p t h max in meter and a maximum runoff r u n max in kg m2 s therefore the depth over which the river runoff will be prescribed is calculated as r u n o f f d e p t h d e p t h max r u n max z r n f with zrnf the maximum value of runoff for a specific river over a period of time in our case we choose to compute once and for all the depth for each river with d e p t h max 7 m corresponding to 14 levels in nwmed72 r u n max 0 6 kg m 2 s and zrnf the maximum runoff for the considered river over the sop1 r u n max is defined just above the maximum value of the rh√¥ne river taken as reference since it represents the biggest river inflow during our period of simulation following the same rule d e p t h max is defined to 7 m compared to the bathymetry depth at the rh√¥ne river mouth fig 12 shows for 27 october the surface and vertical sections of the salinity and temperature differences between n72 dd and n72 dd z near the argens river whose runoff input is over 1 m depth representing 2 levels in our model in n72 dd z the surface water is warmer and saltier whereas the water deeper is colder and less salty than in n72 dd in range of more than 1 psu and 1 c the mld differences over the french riviera between n72 dd and n72 dd z are only about few meters fig 12c but the mld is increased by 70 at some points near the river mouths in n72 dd z compared to n72 dd not shown the sss variability differences between n72 dd and n72 dd z over the whole sop1 fig 10d confirm that the major changes are located close to the river mouths like for the others simulations the validation of n72 dd z was done and scores are shown in tables 2 and 3 generally the scores for moored buoys and tsg in sst and sss are the same as for n72 dd or slightly better in some case tsg biases of n72 dd and n72 dd z are comparable between the two simulations over the domain more locally looking at the europe ship sss fig 13 a and c and sst fig 13b and d biases showed significant differences indeed fig 13e and f represents sss and sst differences between n72 dd and n72 dd z large variations are only located in the vicinity of the rh√¥ne river mouth and can reach more than 1 psu and 3 c indeed near the rh√¥ne river mouth in n72 dd the sst is mainly underestimated compared to the observations fig 13b in n72 dd z the biases are reduced with an increase of the sst fig 13d this is due to the vertical redistribution of the input flow that brings less freshwater at the surface but more in the levels below indeed when the river flow is injected in surface it induces a very thin layer of freshwater and induces a marked salt barrier in the very first meters 1 2 m depth of the ocean this salt barrier thus bounds an internal mixed layer that isolates the layer s below from the air sea interactions it means that for identical sea surface fluxes the response of the internal layer will be more intense than for a typical mixed layer of 20 to 30 m depth when the river flow is injected along a depth the internal layer is in fact thicker and the salt barrier is less marked so due to this high but lower stratification in the very upper layer and in case of heat loss the temperature of the internal layer will decrease less than when runoff forcing is applied in surface but the cooling will affect a deeper layer 5 7 m depth the sst decreases but to a lesser extent and finally for a same river flow and same atmospheric forcing it leads to a warmer sst when the flow is vertically distributed the sss is also impacted notably in the influence area of the rh√¥ne plume where the sss values in n72 dd z are mostly higher than in n72 dd to summarize the vertical distribution of the runoff is impacting the ocean salinity and temperature near river mouths with saltier and warmer water at the surface than below the stratification is thus reduced and the mld is increased 5 conclusion heavy precipitation events occurring in the northwestern mediterranean basin have a significant impact on the river runoff producing brief and large amount of freshwater running to the sea such events constitute major contributions to the water cycle of the region and concern the three earth compartments atmosphere continental surface and ocean this study investigates the ocean sensitivity to river forcing in addition it allows a first validation of a new ocean configuration over the northwestern mediterranean basin at 1 72 horizontal resolution the results of the nemo ocean model simulations using three types of runoff forcing monthly climatology daily and hourly observations were compared to ocean in situ observations collected during the sop1 and satellite data they showed an agreement with observations on average even if the model tend to underestimate the sss indeed overestimation of sss decreases and sst diurnal cycle are noticed considering this our model might overestimate coastal oceanic responses to flood event in the results discussed in this paper a test with higher vertical diffusivity coefficients for tracers and momentum does not lead to significant improvement in fact such oceanic responses strongly depend on the atmospheric flux forcing moreover for n72 our changes in the description of the vertical levels in the ocean might have enhanced the large response of the first layer so this problem might be more complex and requires further investigation and notably sensitivity tests on vertical mixing scheme and comparison to what is used for example in operational oceanography for regional models such as at mercator oc√©an in any case more salinity observations over the domain and especially near the coast and in the mixed layer would have been useful for validation and in order to better assess the modifications of simulations using runoff observations to go further in the process of validation satellite images of chlorophyll could be used to look at the extent and shape of river plumes however this implies to correctly relate chlorophyll with modelled tracers and such evaluation is difficult in the absence of a biogeochemistry compartment in the model then a detailed comparison between the simulations were done showing large differences on the ocean stratification during flood events in particular the sss is significantly impacted near river mouths indeed observed runoff values allowed to describe the high frequency variability and thus the peak flows thus the extent and variability of river plumes are drastically increased large reduction of the mld is noticed in the vicinity of river mouths in the simulations with observed runoff forcing compared to those using the climatology this leads to a modification of the sst as the smaller the mld is the higher the response of the ocean mixed layer to the atmospheric forcing is in this area in future work the coupled arome nemo system will be used in order to better assess the impact on the air sea fluxes and on the low level atmospheric conditions the current intensity is also increased in the river plume when using runoff observations in response to the free surface elevation related to the larger amount of incoming freshwater during flood smaller differences are found when comparing simulations using daily and hourly observed forcing in both cases the peak flow is well represented but a delay can be artificially introduced in simulations using daily dataset as in that case the peak flow always happen at noon due to the nemo time interpolation this has an impact mostly on the extent of the plume and thus locally on the sss sst and mld finally a simulation where the runoff is vertically distributed shows local impacts the salinity and the temperature are changed in surface but also on the ocean levels below this is due to the lower contribution of freshwater at the surface than deeper the mld and the stratification are also changed such as the plume variability near river mouths to conclude the need of using observed runoff data with a high temporal frequency daily hourly to drive ocean models has been illustrated here especially in case of floods indeed such realistic forcing allows to well reproduce the ocean response to flood event in term of stratification and plume dynamics nowadays almost all european ocean forecast centers use monthly mean runoff datasets lellouche et al 2013 tonani et al 2014 therefore the results obtained here show that the use of a higher runoff frequency in forecast system can strongly impact the ocean circulation and stratification in particular in coastal areas nevertheless the use of high frequency river runoff observations requires to collect a large amount of data thus an and sometimes several updated and maintained database is are needed in addition the data collection can be difficult particularly when the studied domain covers several countries the use of a vertical input for river runoff demands also accurate information about each river depth in the domain and that can be difficult to collect nevertheless the simulation appears to be more realistic a way to describe the strong river flow variations properly could be to use river runoff forecasts at a daily or hourly time step from a hydrometeorological model and or a box model approach verri et al

24083,a fully coupled atmosphere ocean wave model is applied to study the upper ocean response of the south china sea scs to typhoon kalmaegi the model results are validated by satellite observations and in situ observations at four stations the coupled model system reproduces the air sea thermal and dynamic features typhoon kalmaegi passed through the scs with a mean translation speed of approximately 8 0 m s 1 a fast moving storm with a predominantly baroclinic ocean response the results show some typhoon induced rightward intensifications in sea surface cooling current speed and significant wave height they also show inertial pumping with alternating upwelling and downwelling and strong isotherm and current oscillations with near inertial frequencies some remarkable ocean responses are also found 1 a significant cooling occurred in the northern scs slope and shelf regions and 2 the storm induced a near inertial internal wave propagating in the track direction where the wave crest impinged the slope and climbed up the shelf a two layer ocean current response and strong mixing at the slope bottom induced by breaking waves are also observed a heat budget analysis shows that the vertical diffusion dominates the rate of change of temperature in the upper layer while the total advection plays a major role in the subsurface layer the net surface heat flux makes a minor contribution to cooling in the upper layer on the right side of the storm s track in contrast its contribution to the surface layer cooling on the left side is comparable to that of the vertical diffusion terms indicating that surface heat fluxes cannot be ignored in this region keywords south china sea typhoon kalmaegi coupled atmosphere ocean wave model topographic effect near inertial oscillations 1 introduction tropical cyclones tcs are among the most destructive natural hazards on earth when moving over the ocean they drive upwelling and bring cold and nutrient rich subsurface waters to the surface hence reducing sea surface temperature sst and producing large phytoplankton blooms after their passage price 1981 taira et al 1993 lin et al 2003 wang and zhao 2008 low sst near the core of a storm can weaken or destroy the cyclone emanuel 1999 when the 26 c isotherm is deep enough however the sst can be maintained above 26 c for the tc to sustain or intensify its strength despite the strong mixing emanuel 1986 demaria and kaplan 1994 for a fast moving storm e g with a translation speed u equal to or exceeding the first mode baroclinic phase speed c one conspicuous feature of the dynamic response is the near inertial oscillations nios left behind by the storm which is characterized by the vertical displacement of water particles and the oscillating horizontal currents e g liu et al 2011 2015a b this response is baroclinic in contrast for a slow moving system u c the local upwelling is induced by ekman pumping and the response is barotropic geisler 1970 the south china sea scs covering a domain from 2 50 n to 23 50 n and 99 0 e to 121 8 e is the largest marginal sea of the western north pacific with a deep basin maximum depth 5000 m located at its center fig 1 every year the scs experiences the passage of an average of approximately 11 typhoons either locally generated or from the tropical western north pacific making landfall on the southern china or indochina peninsula wang et al 2007 accurate predictions of the track and intensity of tcs are crucial to protect coastal residents and properties during the past two decades significant advancements have been made in tc track predictions however the same cannot be said for tc intensity forecasts demaria et al 2014 this can be largely attributed to poor understanding of the physical processes of the atmospheric boundary layer the coarse spatial resolution of tc models and in particular the lack of understanding of upper ocean response to tcs emanuel 2017 many previous studies of the scs responses to the passage of a storm mainly focused on one of the prominent features of dynamics the nios based on moored acoustic doppler current profiler data e g liu et al 2011 2015a b sun et al 2011a 2011b 2012 chen et al 2013 guan et al 2014 yang and hou 2014 zheng et al 2017 some studies also used the slab ocean model developed by pollard and millard 1970 to help discuss the typhoon induced inertial currents e g guan et al 2014 liu et al 2015a b zheng et al 2017 the general dynamic features of typhoon induced nios e g the periodicity and magnitude vertical propagations energy evolution interaction with background vorticity and tide are discussed in detail in these studies among them some interesting phenomena have been reported for example liu et al 2011 found near bottom strong currents induced by typhoon pabuk 2007 in the northern scs guan et al 2014 demonstrated that the near inertial response was weak because of nonlinear coupling with diurnal tides sun et al 2011a showed that blueshifts of nios were induced by the geostrophic shear in some mooring locations the blueshifts or redshifts of nios are associated with background vorticity kunze 1985 the sst and biological responses have also been discussed on the basis of in situ and satellite derived data in the scs e g zhao et al 2009 ye et al 2013 chu et al 2000 used the princeton ocean model pom to study the scs response to typhoon ernie of 1996 with the wind forcing provided by the tropical cyclone wind profile model tcwpm they found that the open ocean and coastal responses are similar chiang et al 2011 investigated the abnormal cooling up to 10 88 c induced by typhoon kai tak 2000 observed in the northern scs and also used the pom forced by the 6 h 0 5 0 5 reanalysis and satellite derived blended wind product milliff et al 1999 to study the mechanisms responsible for inducing the significant cooling tseng et al 2010 examined the sea surface cooling induced by typhoon kai tak 2000 using an ocean model driven by similar wind data because of low spatial and temporal resolutions typhoon structure may not be adequately resolved in the wind products they used in particular the reanalysis data may significantly underestimate tc intensity hodges et al 2017 ko et al 2014 used typhoon scale resolving wind to force their ocean model for simulation of the impacts of typhoon megi of 2010 on the scs without coupling the oceanic and atmospheric models some studies e g aldrian et al 2005 chen et al 2007 have pointed out that the coupling of the atmosphere and the ocean is essential for the correct simulations of tcs especially their intensity and other extreme meteorological events jiang et al 2009 developed a three dimensional coupled air sea model to study the upper ocean response to typhoon krovanh of 2003 in the scs and argued that the sea surface cooling is mainly induced by entrainment however their coupling model did not consider the influence of waves coupling of the wave model can further improve the simulations for tc intensity powers and stoelinga 2000 chen et al 2007 in recent years a fully coupled atmosphere ocean wave model has been found to be powerful and has been widely used in studying air sea interactions e g zambon et al 2014 ricchi et al 2016 2017 in this work we use such a fully coupled model system to study the impacts of typhoon kalmaegi of 2014 on the scs typhoon kalmaegi fig 1 induced a rapid and pronounced decrease in sst up to approximately 6 c in the slope regions of the northern scs see the black rectangle in fig 1 studies have noted that a drastic decrease of water temperature may lead to physiological and fitness related consequences for fish hoag 2003 donaldson et al 2008 thus the mechanism controlling the abrupt drop in sst is useful information for protecting aquaculture which is abundant in the northern scs although there are extensive studies on the scs response to tcs e g sun et al 2011a 2012 sun et al 2011b chen et al 2013 guan et al 2014 yang and hou 2014 zheng et al 2017 an analysis of ocean response along the track is limited in this study the following questions will be addressed 1 what are the mechanisms responsible for controlling the abrupt drop in sst 2 what are the surface and subsurface ocean responses to the passage of typhoon kalmaegi 3 what are the characteristics of surface waves under such a fast moving typhoon 4 how well does the coupled model reproduce the wind field wave height and thermal and dynamic responses the remainder of this article is arranged as follows section 2 describes the datasets used in this study a detailed description of typhoon kalmaegi is given in section 3 followed by a detailed description of the coupled model configuration in section 4 section 5 presents the results and discussion while section 6 summarizes the major findings 2 data data for typhoon kalmaegi including the time series of the center location central pressure at sea level maximum sustained wind speed and radius of the maximum wind at 6 h intervals were obtained from the joint typhoon warning center jtwc http www usno navy mil jtwc the translation speed was calculated on the basis of the center location at 6 h intervals fig 2 panel b for intercomparison typhoon data from the china meteorological administration cma http tcdata typhoon gov cn see ying et al 2014 were also used the microwave only mwo sst daily products http www remss com were used to illustrate the sst response to the passage of the typhoon the cross calibrated multi platform ccmp gridded surface wind data http www remss com atlas et al 2011 produced from a combination of satellite moored buoy and modeled wind data were used to assess the spatial structure of typhoon wind simulated by our coupled model the argo data used in this study were acquired from the coriolis data center http www coriolis eu org the data were used to estimate external parameters and the scales of ocean response to typhoon kalmaegi information from the world ocean atlas 2013 woa13 a set of objectively analyzed monthly data of 0 25 0 25 climatological fields of temperature and salinity at standard depth levels https www nodc noaa gov oc5 woa13 were used as the initial conditions for the ocean model in the coupled model system jason 2 altimeters were used to calculate significant wave height only observations from the ku band were used in this study since they have higher accuracy than observations from the c band http globwave ifremer fr products in situ data from an array of five cross shaped buoys and four subsurface moorings were used fig 3 station 3 was destroyed by typhoon kalmaegi and hence no useful data were obtained a detailed description of the observational design can be found in zhang et al 2016 here we describe only the data used for this study 1 meteorological parameters including wind speed and direction air temperature and air pressure from stations 1 2 4 and 5 were used to verify the atmospheric model output 2 significant wave heights measured at stations 1 and 4 were extracted to validate the wave model 3 subsurface temperature and salinity at depths down to 100 m at stations 4 and 5 were used to assess the output from the ocean model and 4 ocean current velocities observed at stations 2 and 4 were used to validate the ocean model stations 1 and 4 were located on the right of typhoon kalmaegi s track while stations 2 and 5 were on the left 3 typhoon kalmaegi a tropical depression was observed near 10 n 141 e on the night of september 10 2014 it then traveled northwestward and developed into a tropical storm on september 12 and finally intensified into a category 1 typhoon typhoon kalmaegi on september 14 with a maximum sustained wind of approximately 36 m s 1 the maximum wind weakened by approximately 3 m s 1 when the typhoon passed through the philippines before restrengthening to approximately 38 m s 1 when it moved over our observational array fig 3 on september 15 when heading to the city of zhanjiang fig 3 the storm gradually intensified and reached its peak intensity with its center air pressure at sea level decreasing to approximately 962 mbar fig 2 panel a by early morning on september 16 it then decayed quickly after making its first landfall at zhanjiang typhoon kalmaegi was a fast moving typhoon from 0000 utc on september 13 to 1200 utc on september 14 the storm kept accelerating and had a moving speed of approximately 10 m s 1 by 1200 utc on september 14 fig 2 panel b after entering the scs it moved at an average speed of approximately 7 9 m s 1 the mean nondimensional storm moving speed s u h 2fr max where u h is the storm translation speed and r max is the radius of maximum winds price 1981 s was about 2 17 when the storm was in the scs suggesting that a predominantly baroclinic ocean response might be expected to occur given the moving speed as pointed out by chan et al 2001 the intensity of the typhoon is not only sensitive to sst but is also largely influenced by the initial mixed layer depth mld with a high sst e g 29 c both relatively low e g 5 m s 1 and relatively high e g 6 m s 1 translation speeds are not favorable for the typhoon to develop when the mld is low e g 20 m mainly because of the immediate negative feedback of the ocean or lack of oceanic heat energy zhao and chan 2017 before the passage of typhoon kalmaegi the ssts were above 29 c and the mlds were greater than 25 m not shown in most regions of the northern scs however because of its fast propagation and the scs being relatively narrow in the east west direction typhoon kalmaegi did not fully extract the underlying oceanic heat energy making landfall swiftly and these may be the reasons for the storm reaching a peak intensity of only category 1 during its lifetime to further quantify the ocean response greatbatch 1984 price et al 1994 price 1983 when typhoon kalmaegi was over the mooring array the air sea parameters and nondimensional numbers of typhoon kalmaegi based on the scaling arguments of price 1983 were estimated table 1 the temperature salinity and pressure profile data observed by the argo float red triangle in fig 1 on september 12 before typhoon strength was reached were used to calculate the mld h reduced gravity g and first mode phase speed c 1 the position of the argo float 19 31 n 117 74 e on september 12 was near station 4 19 2 n 117 5 e fig 3 the data measured by station 4 were mainly limited to the upper 400 m zhang et al 2016 hence the argo float data were used here the typhoon moving speed u h radius of maximum winds r max maximum wind speed w max and maximum wind stress œÑ max at 0600 utc on september 15 when typhoon kalmaegi approached station 4 were provided by or derived from the jtwc data these parameters table 1 were used to estimate the nondimensional numbers and scales the nondimensional storm speed s was approximately 2 87 when the center of typhoon kalmaegi was near the argo float as a result the upper ocean response should be manifested as strong inertial motions that are asymmetric across the typhoon track the froude number fr the ratio of the storm moving speed u h to the first mode phase speed c 1 for typhoon kalmaegi was 2 83 the first mode phase speed was 3 46 table 1 the estimated froude number indicated that the geostrophic component and upwelling induced by typhoon kalmaegi would be rather modest the burger number m a direct measure of dynamic coupling between the mixed layer and the thermocline layer was 0 09 for typhoon kalmaegi suggesting a moderate pressure coupling and a moderately significant relaxation stage price 1994 the rossby number q was about 0 29 in the ocean mixed layer this rossby number is small and indicates that advection or a nonlocal process should be less important during the forced and early relaxation stages 4 coupled model the coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport coawst modeling system warner et al 2008 2010 was used in this study this coupling system comprises three components the regional ocean modeling system roms http www myroms org shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the weather research and forecasting wrf atmospheric model skamarock et al 2008 and the spectral wave model swan booij et al 1999 the model coupling toolkit was used to enable communication among these components case studies using the coawst modeling system can be found in the literature e g zambon et al 2014 carniel et al 2016 ricchi et al 2016 2017 these documents provide us with a good reference for the successful configuration of a real case study using the coawst modeling system 4 1 wrf atmospheric model the wrf model is a nonhydrostatic quasicompressible atmospheric model the advanced research wrf arw solver is used in the coawst modeling system the arw solver offers different kinds of physical parameterizations of subgrid scale processes for simulating mesoscales and microscales of motions a variety of physical processes including microphysics land surface surface layer planetary boundary layer and cumulus parameterization as well as long wave radiation and short wave radiation are incorporated into the wrf model and many options are available for each physical process the wrf model has been widely used in numerical experiments and forecasts in the coawst modeling system bottom roughness is modified in the wrf code to consider the effects from oceanic surface waves warner et al 2010 in this study the wrf model was run on a horizontal grid with 9 km resolution covering the region fig 3 including the whole scs and parts of the western pacific ocean with the track regions in the scs located near the center of the model domain because of limited computational resources a 9 km horizontal grid resolution was used but is somewhat coarse but is nevertheless able to resolve the inner core dynamics of a storm to some extent jin et al 2014 there are 28 sigma levels in the vertical which seems to be coarse compared with the 60 levels used by ricchi et al 2016 however some studies used a similar setup e g 27 levels in warner et al 2010 30 levels in liu et al 2015a b 28 levels in olabarrieta et al 2012a 27 levels in lee et al 2013 the quality performance of these models suggests that see more discussion later the use of 28 levels as in this study is acceptable we also note that the focus of this study is mainly on the ocean response not the atmosphere itself we use only the sea level forcing function of the atmosphere to the ocean not the entire vertical structure of the atmosphere the kain fritsch cumulus convection scheme kain 2004 was chosen to simulate cloud detrainment and subgrid scale convection the wrf single moment six class vapor cloud rain snow ice and graupel moisture microphysics scheme was used to simulate grid scale precipitation processes we used the rapid radiative transfer model mlawer et al 1997 and the dudhia scheme dudhia 1989 to compute long wave and short wave radiation physics respectively for the boundary layer wave effects in the estimation of the sea surface roughness are implemented in the current version of the coawst modeling scheme by the following two methods see also ricchi et al 2016 2017 one is based on the mellor yamada janjiƒá scheme janjiƒá 1990 1994 a 1 5 order closure scheme the other is based on the mellor yamada nakanishi niino scheme nakanishi and niino 2006 2009 a 2 5 order scheme applicable to a variety of different static stability regimes cohen et al 2015 the mellor yamada nakanishi niino scheme combined with the unified noah land surface model tewari et al 2004 and the eta similarity surface layer scheme janjiƒá 2002 were applied in this study sensitivity tests for different planetary boundary layer schemes can be found in ricchi et al 2017 the interaction between the wrf model and the ocean model roms was through the following two schemes 1 the roms transferred sst with high temporal and spatial resolutions to the wrf model and 2 the wrf model provided roms with momentum and heat fluxes we used a flux conservative remapping scheme that had been integrated into the coawst modeling system in a recent version in this manner roms and the wrf model used the same fluxes at the atmosphere ocean interface the coupling between the wrf model and the swan model was done as follows 1 the wrf model offered the swan model wind data with high temporal and spatial resolutions and 2 the swan model supplied the wrf model with peak wavelengths peak periods and significant wave heights for estimation of the wave induced surface roughness at the sea surface the current version of the coawst modeling system offers three methods to do this warner et al 2010 olabarrieta et al 2012 in the present study the wave induced enhanced bottom roughness was computed with the formulation from taylor and yelland 2001 the wrf model was initialized at 0000 utc on september 12 2014 on the basis of data from the national centers for environmental prediction global forecast system gfs with a 1 horizontal resolution and 6 h time interval the same data were used to derive the boundary conditions to further improve the simulation for typhoon track and intensity for the purpose of this study the spectral nudging scheme von storch et al 2000 was applied on horizontal winds temperature and geopotential height in the upper layer k 10 of the gfs data a nudging coefficient of 0 0003 s 1 indicating a relaxation time of approximately 1 h was used for all the nudging variables a wave number of 3 was used for both the zonal direction and the meridional direction and hence waves with wavelengths equal to or great than approximately 1300 km were nudged nudging was performed every 6 h during the whole simulation time the total run time for all the three model components was 10 days i e from 0000 utc on september 12 to 0000 utc on september 22 we did not use any scheme e g warner et al 2010 to restrengthen the initial intensity in the simulation because the gfs data could not adequately simulate typhoons the intensity of the modeled typhoon kalmaegi was very close to observations after the spin up of 1 day fig 5 4 2 roms ocean model roms is a free surface terrain following three dimensional ocean model extensively used for numerous applications e g wilkin et al 2005 maccready et al 2009 the detailed numerical algorithm for roms can be found in shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the code for roms is written with high flexibility offering a wide range of solution algorithms for pressure gradient and horizontal and vertical advections as well as subgrid scale parameterizations in this application we used the same model domain and grids for roms as for the wrf model 9 km horizontal resolution for computational efficiency since the time for transmission of regridded data among model components is reduced vertically 30 levels were used for the stretched terrain following coordinate the vertical stretching parameters Œ∏s 5 Œ∏b 0 8 and tcline 150 m were used the water temperature and salinity for the initial conditions were from the august woa13 climatological monthly data the initial currents depth averaged currents and sea surface height were calculated on the basis of the aforementioned temperature and salinity data with the following steps roms was run with these initial water temperature and salinity values fixed ts fixed until the steady state to obtain the currents u v depth averaged currents ubar vbar and sea surface height zeta furthermore the upmost layer initial water temperature was replaced by the mwo observed sst on september 12 with these initial conditions our coupled model results showed good agreement with the observations in particular the simulated typhoon intensity was much closer to the observations see the following discussion for the model results when roms was initialized with the output of hycom glbu0 08 https hycom org data glbu0pt08 expt 91pt1 the modeled intensity of the typhoon was much stronger than the observations from both jtwc and cma and the sst cooling was much weaker than the mwo observations not shown for the present studies being able to simulate the typhoon more accurately would give us more confidence to discuss the ocean responses a more sophisticated method e g li et al 2014 including data assimilation for the ocean model initialization will be useful for such a coupled model system but it requires much greater computational resources here it is assumed that ocean model was run from an initial steady state and the surface cooling and mld changes are due to the passage of the storm furthermore our focus is on the northern scs where the storm began to have a direct influence about 3 days after the model initialization therefore the ocean model should undergo further adjustment in this period in addition the scs is rich in mesoscale eddies lin et al 2015 which may modulate the upper ocean response to a typhoon jaimes et al 2011 and detailed mesoscale features may be missing in the woa13 data however the output of the ocean model initialized with the woa13 data suggested that mesoscale structures did not induce any significant effect in such a short period at high frequency on typhoon kalmaegi probably because the storm was moving fast the open boundary conditions for currents temperature and salinity were taken from the output of hycom however for such a short term simulation 10 days september 12 to september 22 2014 the influence of open boundary conditions is negligible given that tides may enhance cold wake through additional mixing eight tidal constituents k1 o1 p1 q1 k2 m2 n2 and s2 obtained from http volkov oce orst edu tides global html were applied the open boundary conditions were as follows chapman conditions for the free surface flather conditions for the two dimensional momentum radiation plus nudging conditions for the three dimensional momentum and temperature and salinity with a 1 day nudging coefficient the sea surface forcing including wind stress and heat fluxes were provided by the wrf model the following effects of surface waves in roms were considered 1 the injection of turbulent kinetic energy induced by wave breaking which was incorporated into roms by the generic length scale method warner et al 2005 and 2 wave forces the vortex force approach was used kumar et al 2012 although these effects were included in the simulation we will not discuss them here to avoid distraction and for brevity 4 3 swan wave model to compute wave induced surface roughness in the wrf model and the effects of surface waves in roms some wave parameters e g wave length wave height wave period wave direction and wave breaking must be provided by the swan wave model booij et al 1999 which solves the wave action balance equation accounting for wind wave generation nonlinear wave wave interactions bottom dissipation wave breaking shoaling and refraction for the present study the model grids for swan were the same as for roms fig 4 with the wind forcing computed by the wrf model the directional grid resolution was set to 10 with a total of 36 directions twenty four frequencies 0 04 1 0 hz were used the boundary conditions were taken from the wavewatch iii model ftp polar ncep noaa gov pub history waves swan runs in nonstationary mode and takes into account the effects of changes in currents kirby and chen 1989 and free surface elevations dissipation processes whitecapping bottom friction and quadruplet nonlinear wave wave interactions currents and free surface elevations were provided by roms whitecapping was computed on the basis of komen et al 1984 in this fully coupled model simulation the baroclinic time step was set to 60 s with a time splitting ratio of 30 for roms swan ran with a time step of 60 s and the wrf model ran with a time step of 30 s the time interval for data interchange among the models was set to 600 s 5 results and discussion 5 1 meteorological fields in this subsection meteorological fields including typhoon track and intensity surface wind and air temperature are discussed on the basis of the wrf model output observations and ccmp wind data fig 3 displays comparisons between the simulated track red line in fig 3 and the two observed tracks with one from the jtwc and the other from the cma it is interesting to examine whether the two observed tracks are consistent with each other the tracks from the jtwc and cma black and blue lines in fig 3 are almost the same until 1200 utc on september 15 after which they show some discrepancies the simulated tracks generally follow the two observed tracks closely except when the storm made landfall at the philippines the mean deviation is about 42 km increasing the model grid resolution e g 4 km improving the spectral nudging scheme used in this study and using more accurate land topography etc may further improve the track simulation the time series of the simulated minimum sea level air pressure is compared with the observations from the jtwc and cma fig 5 discrepancies exists between the simulated results red line in fig 5 and observed data black and blue lines but the model results show good consistency with observations from the cma when the storm entered the scs at around 1600 utc on september 14 to 0000 utc on september 16 in particular the simulated intensity is nearly the same as that from the cma when the typhoon passed the observational array from 0000 utc on september 15 to 1200 utc on september 15 the mean deviation between the simulated minimum sea level air pressure and that from the cma is about 4 mbar when the storm was crossing over the scs it can be seen that there are relatively large differences between the two best tracks and generally the jtwc data have weaker intensity than the cma data comparisons between the simulated sea level air pressure 10 m wind speed and direction and surface air temperature and those observed by the four stations stations 1 2 4 and 5 are shown in figs 6 and 7 for the sea level air pressure the model performed well in general for all four stations throughout the whole simulation period panels a and e in figs 6 and 7 however the model results show lower minimum pressure which is more evident at stations 1 and 4 which are located on the right side of the simulated track fig 3 the main reason for these discrepancies is that there is a slight track error in the simulation fig 3 red line it was too close to stations 1 and 4 and further away from stations 2 and 5 the comparisons for the 10 m wind speed panels b and f in figs 6 and 7 at the four stations are similar to those for the sea level air pressure for the 10 m wind direction the model results are generally in agreement with the observations except when the storm center was approaching the stations e g from 0500 utc on september 14 to 0000 utc on september 15 in fig 6 panel c the wind generally turned clockwise counterclockwise to the right left side of the track for the surface air temperature the variation trends in the simulated results and observations are consistent with each other but the observations show variations with more irregularity probably due to some atmospheric boundary physical processes not well resolved in our coupled model and the adoption of higher resolution model grids may alleviate this issue the spatial structure of the 1 day average of the simulated 10 m wind for september 15 is shown in fig 8 b for comparison the ccmp wind data on the same day are also presented fig 8c as stated in section 3 typhoon kalmaegi is a fast moving storm so the wind speed shows a clear bias to the right side of its track which is more evident in the snapshots of the wrf simulated wind field fig 8a furthermore the maximum wind speed was found to be in the right front quadrant of the track fig 8b the ccmp wind data also show a similar pattern fig 8c but with a lower wind speed to the right side of the track the ccmp wind data atlas et al 2011 produced from a combination of satellite moored buoy and modeled wind data can be used to describe the typhoon s wind spatial structure although they underestimate the typhoon s maximum wind speed in general our coupled model system reproduced well typhoon kalmaegi s track and intensity and its associated surface wind spatial structure therefore it allows us to investigate the ocean responses confidently 5 2 surface waves in this subsection we validate and discuss the simulated wave results in terms of significant wave height h s fig 9 demonstrates the comparison between simulated h s from the swan model and the values observed at stations 1 and 4 both of them are located on the right side of the storm s track we have no wave observations from the left side of the track it can be seen that the simulated results in general agree with the observations with a root mean square error of h s of about 0 6 m for station 1 and 1 0 m for station 4 however there is a 2 3 h phase lag between the simulated and observed results probably because the simulated typhoon was moving a little faster as it passed over the stations than the actual typhoon did fig 6 panel a exploration of the mechanisms for this small discrepancy between simulated and observed typhoon translation speeds is beyond the scope of this study but is of considerable importance for accurate typhoon landing time forecast in general the model underestimated the wave height at these two stations which may be because wave enhanced bottom roughness was not well simulated we did another experiment in which the bottom roughness was computed with a combination of the formulas proposed by charnock 1955 and liu et al 1979 this modeled wave height showed better agreement with the observations not shown here to further validate the wave model results the simulated significant wave heights h s were compared with those of the jason 2 ku band measured fig 10 the agreements are overall good with a slope of the regression line of approximately 0 87 with a bias of approximately 0 37 m indicating that the h s values were overestimated by the wave model to some extent if only the model results and jason 2 data near the typhoon track region are used the slope of the regression line is approximately 0 96 with a bias of approximately 0 33 m note that the modeled and measured results show increasing dispersion with h s olabarrieta et al 2012 encountered the same situation in a study on the ocean atmosphere dynamics during hurricane ida and hurricane nor ida and argued that this might be associated with the frequency of model output model grid resolution and the method used to estimate h s from the satellite data fig 11 displays the spatial distribution of h s for four different snapshots the maximum h s is distributed around the track with the largest h s values found in the right front quadrant of the advancing typhoon s track the maximum h s value increased with the intensity of the storm the largest h s was observed in the continental slope and shelf regions with a value of approximately 12 m fig 11 panels c and d owing to the fast movement of the storm crossing the scs in less than 2 days the storm generated wind wave zone was limited to be moving with the typhoon the asymmetry in the h s distribution fig 11 on both sides of the track is more evident than that of the wind speed fig 8 this can be explained as follows the wind direction to the right side of the track was roughly aligned with the storm propagation direction consequently in this region the waves propagate forward with the typhoon and keep following the strong wind regions of the typhoon for a long time therefore they would undergo an extended fetch influence these waves are sometimes called fetch trapped waves king and shemdin 1987 in contrast the wind direction and the storm moving direction are opposite on the left side of the storm track and the waves stay in the intensive wind regions for only a short time this implies that the degree of asymmetry in the wave field is expected to be larger than that in the wind field in particular if the group velocity of the waves is close to or equal to the storm moving speed the waves will stay in the storm region and hence the fetch trapped waves would play a role bowyer and macafee 2005 5 3 surface responses during typhoon kalmaegi some portions of our study domain had no satellite observations for sst because of heavy cloud fig 12 panel a which was more evident in the coastal regions however most of the region still had satellite sst observations which allowed quantification of the sst change between september 12 before typhoon kalmaegi and september 16 after the arrival of typhoon kalmaegi the results from both the model and the satellite fig 12 panels a and b showed a reduction of sst in most of the study domain caused by typhoon kalmaegi with the maximum cooling occurring in the northern scs slope and shelf regions additionally a right biased cooling was found which was more obvious in the model results this rightward bias in cooling was caused by the fast moving storm with enhanced wind speed to the right side of its path further resonance would occur since both wind and current rotate clockwise in turn inducing more vigorous turbulent mixing in this region similar cooling patterns were frequently reported in other studies e g jordan and frank 1964 price 1981 taira et al 1993 there are some discrepancies between model based and satellite measured sst cooling the observed maximum cooling was approximately 5 4 c while that from the model simulation was approximately 4 5 c the model simulated maximum sst cooling was mainly located in the shelf region of the northern scs while the satellite observed maximum sst cooling extended to the slope and deep basin region of the northern scs these two discrepancies are attributed to the model initial subsurface temperature being derived from woa13 which might have higher than actual water temperature the maximum cooling that occurred in the northern scs may be due to a combination of two effects 1 the storm passing the maximum cooling region reached its peak intensity fig 2 panel a hence generating the most intensive mixing of its lifetime and 2 the breaking of the highest waves fig 11 panels c and d observed in the maximum cooling region might inject more momentum causing more mixing than in the rest of the study domain to show the surface current response low pass filtering was implemented on the simulated surface current to suppress the tide signal fig 13 it can be seen that the current velocity is much stronger on the right side of the track than on the left furthermore the surface currents rotate clockwise with a period roughly equal to the local inertial period e g 36 h at 19 2 n specifically at 0000 utc on september 16 the central position of typhoon kalmaegi was located in the northern scs shelf region and the rear of the typhoon center consists of alternating downwelling and upwelling cells color shading in fig 13 panel a which were induced by alternating convergence and divergence of surface currents for a fast moving typhoon geisler 1970 found that the upwelling is situated beneath the rear of the typhoon center however for a slow moving storm the upwelling is mainly located near the storm center with an average translation speed of approximately 7 9 m s 1 passing over the scs the fast moving typhon kalmaegi generated alternating downwelling and upwelling cells at the rear of its center eighteen hours later fig 13 panel b the downwelling upwelling regions were replaced by upwelling downwelling regions and the surface currents were in the opposite direction to those 18 h before fig 13 panel a thirty six hours later the distribution reversed again fig 13 panel b indicating that the dominant dynamic responses were baroclinic with strong nios the alternate downwelling and upwelling motions are often called inertial pumping price et al 1994 both the near inertial currents and the wind stress turn clockwise with time on the right side of the typhoon s track whereas the wind stress rotates counterclockwise on the left making the coupling less efficient this leads to a strong asymmetry in the surface layer velocity across the track significantly greater on the right side than on the left 5 4 cross track subsurface responses two observational stations stations 4 and 5 were chosen to discuss subsurface temperature and salinity responses with one situated on the right side of the storm s track station 4 and the other located on the left fig 3 the distance between station 4 and the observed simulated center of the typhoon at the time when the storm was over the observational array was around 127 km 88 km and that for station 5 was 48 km 82 km the model results were interpolated onto the positions of stations 4 and 5 both the observations and the model results were low pass filtered to eliminate tide signal a difference can be seen between the observed and simulated tracks of the typhoon 45 km fig 3 at the time when it was over the observation array however the observed and modeled wind speeds were quite consistent fig 6 panels b and f as stated in section 5 1 during this period the simulated typhoon intensity matched well with the observations fig 5 hence it is expected that the simulated subsurface responses would be consistent with those of the observations for station 4 figs 14 panels a d the time evolution of the temperature of the upper 100 m of the water column exhibits a clear response to the passage of the storm which can be seen both in the observational data and in the model results fig 14 panels a and c the model results overall match the observations during the forced stage about half a day the 28 c isotherm was immediately raised up to the surface the sst was quickly reduced by approximately 2 c and the depth of the 25 c isotherm was increased by approximately 14 m it is remarkable that during the relaxation period the subsurface isotherms undulated significantly with a period of approximately 36 h which is close to the local inertial period at 19 n for the 25 c isotherm as an example its maximum oscillation amplitude was around 10 m which was approximately equal to the isopycnal displacements Œ∑ s estimated on the basis of œÑ max œÅ o fu h 7 0 m table 1 the vertical velocity can also be estimated from the isopycnal displacements Œ∑ s according to w 4Œ∑ s ip where ip is the inertial period here approximately 36 h the estimated value 3 0 10 4 m s 1 is approximately equal to the model computed values fig 13 the oscillations of the isotherms were driven by the divergence and convergence of inertial current in the mixed layer which would induce subsurface water cooling and warming fig 14 panel a the surface salinity was increased by about 0 2 which is clearly seen in the observations fig 14 panel b but is not evident in the model results fig 14 panel d the subsurface salinity response showed a very similar pattern as the response of temperature it is worth mentioning that the reduction of sst and increase of surface salinity indicate an entrainment of cooler and more saline water into the surface layer from the upper thermocline for station 5 figs 14 panels e h the sst was reduced by around 1 c a very modest reduction in comparison with that observed at station 4 the subsurface isotherm oscillation period was nearly the same as that at station 4 the model results show a smaller oscillation amplitude 5 m compared with that at station 4 10 m fig 14 panels c and g because of a lower simulated wind speed fig 6 panels b and f at station 5 whereas this was not seen in the observations fig 14 panels a and e the observed maximum wind speeds at these two stations are nearly the same hence the observed subsurface isotherm oscillations show little difference later on september 19 the 28 c isotherm was observed to have rapidly uplifted toward the surface fig 14 panel e when another tropical storm fung wong zhang et al 2016 passed the model did not reproduce this response fig 14 panel g probably because the track of fung wong was not well simulated not shown in contrast to the salinity at station 4 the surface salinity decreased by approximately 0 1 fig 14 panels b and f at station 5 this was also captured by the model fig 14 panel h the reason for the different response of salinity between these two stations is that the much stronger vertical mixing due to the enhanced wind speed on the right side of the storm s track can potentially entrain more and saltier water into the mixed layer hence increasing the surface salinity in this region further after examination of the rainfall data observed at these two stations not shown it is found that station 5 received much more freshwater during typhoon kalmaegi these factors would be favorable for inducing a leftward bias of the surface salinity anomalies the observed and simulated upper ocean current responses to typhoon kalmaegi at stations 2 and 4 are presented in fig 15 these two stations were located on the left side and the right side of the storm s track respectively the closest distance between station 2 and the observed simulated typhoon center was 28 km 63 km here we have excluded bad data zhang et al 2016 the model results again are generally consistent with the observations some common features are found in both the observations and the model results 1 an increase in energy in the near inertial period immediately after the passage of typhoon kalmaegi was found at almost all depths 2 the current velocity had a near inertial clockwise rotating motion which decayed slowly with time 3 below 50 m the current responding to typhoon kalmaegi was weaker than that at shallower depths and showed an increase in magnitude with time indicating a downward propagation of energy 4 the current velocity in the upper 50 m was out of phase with that at lower layers indicating a first baroclinic mode response which was more evident at station 4 and 5 in contrast to that at station 2 the current at station 4 was much stronger because of a rightward bias wind speed and the resonance between wind and current as mentioned previously 5 5 along track subsurface response on the basis of the preceding comparison of model results and observations we conclude that the coupled model is capable of faithfully reproducing many features of air sea dynamics for typhoon kalmaegi hence allowing us to examine in more detail the ocean response we selected one cross section roughly parallel to the simulated storm s track and at about 80 km on the right the black line in fig 12 panel b this cross section was chosen as it crossed the maximum cooling region the red triangle in fig 12 panel b allowing us to study the subsurface dynamics in this region six snapshots of the response for the selected cross section are presented in fig 16 some notable features deserve to be mentioned at 1300 utc on september 15 the 28 c isotherm was immediately raised up to the surface in response to the passage of the storm fig 16 panel a as the storm intensified and approached the shelf of the northern scs figs 3 and 5 the sst was further decreased as shown by the outcrop of the 27 c isotherm at 0130 utc on september 16 fig 16 panels b and c the subsurface isotherm lines were all lifted up but lagged the surface response to some extent during the relaxation stage after 0700 utc on september 16 strong internal waves with near inertial frequency were observed which can be seen in the up and down oscillations of the thermocline figs 16 panels d and e the amplitude of the thermocline oscillation in deep ocean is the same as observed in fig 14 7 m when the crests of the westward propagating internal waves encountered the topography the thermocline was significantly uplifted the black rectangle in fig 16 panel d when the trough approached the uplifted thermocline retreated fig 16 panel e again at the next crest the thermocline was raised up fig 16 panel f it is interesting to note that the interval between the two remarkable raisings of the thermocline figs 16 panels d and f is roughly 36 h which is close to the inertial period at 19 n internal waves generated by storms have long been noted e g gill 1982 the wavelength can be estimated by Œª 2 œÄ u h f 1 c 1 u h 2 which is about 900 km in the scs and approximately matches the distance between the two troughs of the internal waves fig 16 panel b because of the pronounced motions of the waves discussed above it can be seen that at one selected station very close to the cross section line mentioned above the red triangle in fig 12 panel b an obvious two layer motion is observed in the east u fig 17 panel a and north v fig 17 panel b velocity components a near bottom enhanced turbulent mixing manifested in the vertical diffusion coefficient fig 17 panel c was found which was possibly due to the breaking of the internal wave by its interaction with the topography the strong near bottom mixing was decaying but also oscillating with the near inertial frequency it is noteworthy that the strong mixing observed after september 20 was probably generated by the breaking of internal waves produced by the passage of another storm fung wong zhang et al 2016 additionally significantly enhanced near surface turbulent mixing was also observed fig 17 panel c which was evidently induced by the passage of typhoon kalmaegi between september 15 and september 17 it is expected that the oscillations of the thermocline will induce a similar vertical motion fig 17 panel d and temperature anomaly in the water column fig 17 panel e when the upward motions occurred the cold thermocline water was brought up toward the surface in contrast during the downward motion the warm upper layer water was taken to deeper levels 5 6 heat budget analysis the heat budget equation can be written as t t t u v t w t dh tdv q s where t t is the local rate of change of temperature t u v is horizontal advection t w is vertical advection t dh is horizontal diffusion t dv is vertical diffusion and q s is surface heat flux the horizontal diffusion terms are disregarded as they are orders of magnitude smaller all these terms are computed as diagnostic variables derived directly from the output of the ocean model we choose three representative stations for discussion station 4 station 5 and the station denoted by the red triangle in fig 12 panel b which was located in the maximum cooling region for station 4 the water temperature anomaly evolution defined as the temperature change from the initial value i e t z t t z 0 in which t 0 is defined at 0000 utc on september 12 fig 18 panel a showed a significant cooling in the upper 30 m of the water column and an alternation of cooling and warming below 30 m depth cooling in the surface layer was induced by a combination of surface heat loss and vertical diffusion of cold subsurface water the subsurface alternating warming and cooling was a combination of advection and vertical diffusion with the former dominant the vertical diffusion had a marked impact only during the passage of the storm fig 18 panel b while its influence was small before and after the storm in addition this term generally cooled the upper 30 m of the water column but warmed the water below 40 m depth its values were one order of magnitude smaller than the advection term the vertical advection and horizontal advection terms both oscillated with near inertial period but were out of phase and generally cancel each other out shown by the sum of these two terms in fig 18 panel f in the upper 30 m of the water column below 30 m the horizontal advection term was larger than the vertical advection term and therefore dominated the total advection term the local rate of change generally resembled the total advection fig 18 panels c and f below 40 m indicating that the total advection was the dominant factor controlling changes of temperature time series of each heat budget term fig 18 panel g averaged over the upper 30 m of the water column showed that vertical diffusion contributed the most to the cooling trend during the passage of the storm during the storm the total heat flux became negative at the surface because of losses to the atmosphere and contributed approximately 12 of the cooling such results are consistent with previous findings e g price 1981 which suggests that vertical mixing dominates the upper ocean cooling during storms it seems that the surface heat flux advection and vertical diffusion all contributed to the poststorm warming in the upper 30 m of the water column at this station for station 5 the results fig 19 were generally similar to those for station 4 except that the magnitude of each term was smaller because of a relatively low wind speed to the left side of the storm s track the maximum sst reduction was very modest approximately 1 c and the thickness of the upper cooling layer was significantly reduced at station 5 to approximately 10 m fig 19 panel a while the values for station 4 were about 2 c and 40 m respectively indicating a much weaker vertical mixing at station 5 which was also seen in the vertical diffusion term fig 19 panel b with a maximum value about a quarter of that at station 4 another notable feature was seen in the time evolution of the budget terms averaged over the upper 30 m fig 19 panel g the surface heat flux made a contribution to the cooling comparable to that of the vertical diffusion term if the effects of vertical diffusion were much reduced the surface heat flux should play an important role in the cooling event for the station located in the maximum cooling region red triangle in fig 12 panel b the surface layer cooling was more pronounced with a maximum of approximately 4 5 c and the alternating warming and cooling that occurred below 40 m was enhanced fig 20 panel a all the heat budget terms were larger than the corresponding terms at station 4 fig 20 panels b f the reason for these differences between stations is that the storm reached its peak intensity when passing over the maximum cooling region hence injecting more momentum into the ocean once again we see that the vertical diffusion dominated the temperature change in the upper 30 m of the water column fig 20 panel g during the storm below 30 m the total advection term played a major role in temperature change fig 20 panels c and f the local rate of change followed closely the total advection in the upper 30 m of the water column after the storm and presented an oscillation decaying with time fig 20 panel g 6 concluding remarks extensive previous studies on the impacts of a typhoon on the scs were based on numerical models that were mainly forced by either reanalysis winds data with low spatial and temporal resolutions or a constructed typhoon wind model both were insufficient to provide detailed typhoon wind forcing for the simulations of the ocean response to a typhoon in the present study a fully coupled atmosphere ocean wave model was applied to study the upper ocean response to the passage of typhoon kalmaegi the simulated track generally matched the observed tracks except when the storm made landfall at the philippines the mean deviation between the modeled track and the jtwc based track was about 42 km the mean deviation between the simulated minimum pressure and that of the cma was about 4 mbar when the storm crossed the scs the simulated sea level air pressure wind speed wind direction and surface air temperature are consistent with the observations from the four buoys typhoon kalmaegi passed through the scs with a mean nondimensional speed of approximately 2 87 and a froude number of approximately 2 8 both indicating that the storm was a fast moving system consistent with a notable rightward bias in wind speed the modeled significant wave heights h s are in good agreement with the observations at stations 1 and 4 with a root mean square error of about 0 6 m and 1 0 m respectively comparison between the simulated h s and the jason 2 ku band measurements also showed good agreement with a slope of the regression line of approximately 0 87 and a bias of approximately 0 37 m indicating that the h s values were overestimated by the wave model to some extent the simulated maximum h s is near the storm s center with the largest h s values found in the right front quadrant of the advancing typhoon furthermore the maximum h s values increased with the intensity of the storm the highest waves occurred in the right front quadrant and were well observed by an airborne scanning radar altimeter e g wright et al 2001 and the associated enhanced breaking waves would inject more momentum into the ocean hence causing strong mixing a rightward biased surface cooling induced by typhoon kalmaegi was found both in the model calculated results and in the satellite observations with the maximum cooling occurring in the northern scs slope and shelf regions the surface current response was characterized by a clockwise rotating current field with the near inertial period with a much stronger current speed to the right side of the storm s track the alternating convergence and divergence of the near inertial mixed layer current left by the storm generated alternating downwelling and upwelling cells respectively according to the theoretical work of greatbatch 1983 the maximum current speed in the mixed layer can be estimated by a t u h where u h is the storm moving speed and a t is the ratio of the along track advection to the local acceleration terms here it is 0 34 on the basis of greatbatch 1983 with a mean storm moving speed of about 7 9 m s 1 the estimated maximum current in the mixed layer was around 2 68 m s 1 which was close to the simulated maximum surface current of approximately 2 4 m s 1 because typhoon kalmaegi is a fast moving system having a mean froude number of approximately 2 8 the ocean response is baroclinic and hence it is not surprising that a strong nio occurred in the subsurface isotherm as well as in the ocean current which were both seen in the model results and the observations it is noteworthy that the current speed on the right side of the storm s track decayed rapidly with time while that on the left side of the storm s track persisted for much longer fig 15 this may be attributed to a more effective downward propagation of near inertial wave energy on the right side of the storm s track the model results are generally consistent with the observations suggesting the reliability of our coupled model system is good hence allowing us to discuss the along track ocean response a strong near inertial internal wave induced by the storm was found propagating along the track toward the northern scs slope where the wave crest impinged the slope then climbed up the shelf fig 16 accompanied by the wave motion a two layer ocean current response and strong mixing in the bottom of the slope induced by the breaking of the waves were also observed to the best of our knowledge the typhoon induced near inertial internal waves influenced by the northern scs topography were revealed for the first time here to discuss the mechanism responsible for the upper ocean cooling induced by typhoon kalmaegi three representative stations were selected for discussion with two of them located on the right station 4 and the station denoted by the red triangle in fig 12 panel b which was situated in the maximum cooling region and one on the left station 5 of the storm s track generally for all three stations the vertical diffusion dominated the rate of change of temperature in the upper layer while advection played a major role for the subsurface layer the net surface heat flux contributed only 10 14 to the rate of change of temperature in the upper layer for the stations located on the right side of the track consistent with previous findings e g price 1981 jiang et al 2009 however it is interesting to note that heat flux makes a contribution comparable to that of the vertical diffusion to the surface layer cooling during the passage of the storm to the left side of the track indicating that its role cannot be ignored in this region indeed if the upper ocean heat content is high enough the surface cooling may be determined by the net surface heat flux e g jaimes

24083,a fully coupled atmosphere ocean wave model is applied to study the upper ocean response of the south china sea scs to typhoon kalmaegi the model results are validated by satellite observations and in situ observations at four stations the coupled model system reproduces the air sea thermal and dynamic features typhoon kalmaegi passed through the scs with a mean translation speed of approximately 8 0 m s 1 a fast moving storm with a predominantly baroclinic ocean response the results show some typhoon induced rightward intensifications in sea surface cooling current speed and significant wave height they also show inertial pumping with alternating upwelling and downwelling and strong isotherm and current oscillations with near inertial frequencies some remarkable ocean responses are also found 1 a significant cooling occurred in the northern scs slope and shelf regions and 2 the storm induced a near inertial internal wave propagating in the track direction where the wave crest impinged the slope and climbed up the shelf a two layer ocean current response and strong mixing at the slope bottom induced by breaking waves are also observed a heat budget analysis shows that the vertical diffusion dominates the rate of change of temperature in the upper layer while the total advection plays a major role in the subsurface layer the net surface heat flux makes a minor contribution to cooling in the upper layer on the right side of the storm s track in contrast its contribution to the surface layer cooling on the left side is comparable to that of the vertical diffusion terms indicating that surface heat fluxes cannot be ignored in this region keywords south china sea typhoon kalmaegi coupled atmosphere ocean wave model topographic effect near inertial

have been made in tc track predictions however the same cannot be said for tc intensity forecasts demaria et al 2014 this can be largely attributed to poor understanding of the physical processes of

correct simulations of tcs especially their intensity and other extreme meteorological events jiang et al 2009 developed a three dimensional coupled air sea model to study the upper ocean response to typhoon krovanh of 2003 in the scs and argued that the sea surface cooling is mainly induced by entrainment however their coupling model did not consider the influence of waves coupling of the wave

been widely used in studying air sea interactions e g zambon et al 2014 ricchi et al 2016 2017 in this work we use such a fully coupled model system to study the impacts of typhoon kalmaegi of 2014 on the scs typhoon kalmaegi fig 1 induced a rapid and pronounced decrease in sst up to approximately 6 c in the slope regions of the northern scs see the black rectangle in fig 1 studies have noted that a drastic decrease of water temperature may lead to physiological and fitness related consequences for fish hoag 2003 donaldson et al 2008 thus the mechanism controlling the abrupt drop in sst is useful information for protecting aquaculture which is abundant in the northern scs although there are extensive studies on the scs response to tcs e g sun et al 2011a 2012 sun et al 2011b chen et al

the results and discussion while section 6 summarizes the major findings 2 data data for typhoon kalmaegi including the time series of the center location central pressure at sea level maximum sustained wind speed and radius of the maximum wind at 6 h intervals were obtained from the joint typhoon warning center jtwc http www usno navy mil jtwc the translation speed was calculated on the basis of the center location at 6 h intervals fig 2 panel b for intercomparison typhoon data from the china meteorological administration cma http tcdata typhoon gov cn see ying et al 2014 were also used the microwave only mwo sst daily products http www remss com were used to illustrate the sst response to the passage of the typhoon the cross calibrated multi platform ccmp gridded surface wind data http www remss com atlas et al 2011 produced from a combination of satellite moored buoy and modeled wind data were used to assess the spatial structure of typhoon wind simulated by our coupled model the argo data used in this study were acquired from the coriolis data center http www coriolis eu org the data were used to estimate external parameters and the scales of ocean response to typhoon kalmaegi information from the world ocean atlas 2013 woa13 a set of objectively analyzed monthly data of 0 25 0 25 climatological fields of temperature and salinity at standard depth levels https www nodc noaa gov oc5 woa13 were used as the initial conditions for the ocean model in the coupled model system jason 2 altimeters were used to calculate significant wave height only observations from the ku band were used in this study since they have higher accuracy than observations from the c band http globwave ifremer fr products in situ data from an array of five cross shaped buoys and four subsurface moorings were used fig 3 station 3 was destroyed by typhoon kalmaegi and hence no useful data were obtained a detailed description of the observational design can be found in zhang et al 2016 here we describe only the data used for this study 1 meteorological parameters including wind speed and direction air temperature and air pressure from stations 1 2 4 and 5 were used to verify the atmospheric model output 2 significant wave heights measured at stations 1 and 4 were extracted to validate the wave model 3 subsurface temperature and salinity at depths down to 100 m at stations 4 and 5 were used to assess the output from the ocean model and 4 ocean current velocities observed at stations 2 and 4 were used to validate the ocean model stations 1 and 4 were located on the right of typhoon kalmaegi s track while stations 2 and 5 were on the left 3 typhoon kalmaegi a tropical depression was observed near 10 n 141 e on the night of september 10 2014 it then traveled northwestward and developed into a tropical storm on september 12 and finally intensified into a category 1 typhoon typhoon kalmaegi on september 14 with a maximum sustained wind of approximately 36 m s 1 the maximum wind weakened by approximately 3 m s 1 when the typhoon passed through the philippines before restrengthening to approximately 38 m s 1 when it moved over our observational array fig 3 on september 15 when heading to the city of zhanjiang fig 3 the storm gradually intensified and reached its peak intensity with its center air pressure at sea level decreasing to approximately 962 mbar fig 2 panel a by early morning on september 16 it then decayed quickly after making its first landfall at zhanjiang typhoon kalmaegi was a fast moving typhoon from 0000 utc on september 13 to 1200 utc on september 14 the storm kept accelerating and had a moving speed of approximately 10 m s 1 by 1200 utc on september 14 fig 2 panel b after entering the scs it moved at an average speed of approximately 7 9 m s 1 the mean nondimensional storm moving speed s u h 2fr max where u h is the storm translation speed and r max is the radius of maximum winds price 1981 s was about 2 17 when the storm was in the scs suggesting that a predominantly baroclinic ocean response might be expected to occur given the moving speed as pointed out by chan et al 2001 the intensity of the typhoon is not only sensitive to sst but is also largely influenced by the initial mixed layer depth mld with a high sst e g 29 c both relatively low e g 5 m s 1 and relatively high e g 6 m s 1 translation speeds are not favorable for the typhoon to develop when the mld is low e g 20 m mainly because of the immediate negative feedback of the ocean or lack of oceanic heat energy zhao and chan 2017 before the passage of typhoon kalmaegi the ssts were above 29 c and the mlds were greater than 25 m not shown in most regions of the northern scs however because of its fast propagation and the scs being relatively narrow in the east west direction typhoon kalmaegi did not fully extract the underlying oceanic heat energy making landfall swiftly and these may be the reasons for the storm reaching a peak intensity of only category 1 during its lifetime to further quantify the ocean response greatbatch 1984 price et al 1994 price 1983 when typhoon kalmaegi was over the mooring array the air sea parameters and nondimensional numbers of typhoon kalmaegi based on the scaling arguments of price 1983 were estimated table 1 the temperature salinity and pressure profile data observed by the argo float red triangle in fig 1 on september 12 before typhoon strength was reached were used to calculate the mld h reduced gravity g and first mode phase speed c 1 the position of the argo float 19 31 n 117 74 e on september 12 was near station 4 19 2 n 117 5 e fig 3 the data measured by station 4 were mainly limited to the upper 400 m zhang et al 2016 hence the argo float data were used here the typhoon moving speed u h radius of maximum winds r max maximum wind speed w max and maximum wind stress œÑ max at 0600 utc on september 15 when typhoon kalmaegi approached station 4 were provided by or derived from the jtwc data these parameters table 1 were used to estimate the nondimensional numbers and scales the nondimensional storm speed s was approximately 2 87 when the center of typhoon kalmaegi was near the argo float as a result the upper ocean response should be manifested as strong inertial motions that are asymmetric across the typhoon track the froude number fr the ratio of the storm moving speed u h to the first mode phase speed c 1 for typhoon kalmaegi was 2 83 the first mode phase speed was 3 46 table 1 the estimated froude number indicated that the geostrophic component and upwelling induced by typhoon kalmaegi would be rather modest the burger number m a direct measure of dynamic coupling between the mixed layer and the thermocline layer was 0 09 for typhoon kalmaegi suggesting a moderate pressure coupling and a moderately significant relaxation stage price 1994 the rossby number q was about 0 29 in the ocean mixed layer this rossby number is small and indicates that advection or a nonlocal process should be less important during the forced and early relaxation stages 4 coupled model the coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport coawst modeling system warner et al 2008 2010 was used in this study this coupling system comprises three components the regional ocean modeling system roms http www myroms org shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the weather research and forecasting wrf atmospheric model skamarock et al 2008 and the spectral wave model swan booij et al 1999 the model coupling toolkit was used to enable communication among these components case studies using the coawst modeling system can be found in the literature e g zambon et al 2014 carniel et al 2016 ricchi et al 2016 2017 these documents provide us with a good reference for the successful configuration of a real case study using the coawst modeling system 4 1 wrf atmospheric model the wrf model is a nonhydrostatic quasicompressible atmospheric model the advanced research wrf arw solver is used in the coawst modeling system the arw solver offers different kinds of physical parameterizations of subgrid scale processes for simulating mesoscales and microscales of motions a variety of physical processes including microphysics land surface surface layer planetary boundary layer and cumulus parameterization as well as long wave radiation and short wave radiation are incorporated into the wrf model and many options are available for each physical process the wrf model has been widely used in numerical experiments and forecasts in the coawst modeling system bottom roughness is modified in the wrf code to consider the effects from oceanic surface waves warner et al 2010 in this study the wrf model was run on a horizontal grid with 9 km resolution covering the region fig 3 including the whole scs and parts of the western pacific ocean with the track regions in the scs located near the center of the model domain because of limited computational resources a 9 km horizontal grid resolution was used but is somewhat coarse but is nevertheless able to resolve the inner core dynamics of a storm to some extent jin et al 2014 there are 28 sigma levels in the vertical which seems to be coarse compared with the 60 levels used by ricchi et al 2016 however some studies used a similar setup e g 27 levels in warner et al 2010 30 levels in liu et al 2015a b 28 levels in olabarrieta et al 2012a 27 levels in lee et al 2013 the quality performance of these models suggests that see more discussion later the use of 28 levels as in this study is acceptable we also note that the focus of this study is mainly on the ocean response not the atmosphere itself we use only the sea level forcing function of the atmosphere to the ocean not the entire vertical structure of the atmosphere the kain fritsch cumulus convection scheme kain 2004 was chosen to simulate cloud detrainment and subgrid scale convection the wrf single moment six class vapor cloud rain snow ice and graupel moisture microphysics scheme was used to simulate grid scale precipitation processes we used the rapid radiative transfer model mlawer et al 1997 and the dudhia scheme dudhia 1989 to compute long wave and short wave radiation physics respectively for the boundary layer wave effects in the estimation of the sea surface roughness are implemented in the current version of the coawst modeling scheme by the following two methods see also ricchi et al 2016 2017 one is based on the mellor yamada janjiƒá scheme janjiƒá 1990 1994 a 1 5 order closure scheme the other is based on the mellor yamada nakanishi niino scheme nakanishi and niino 2006 2009 a 2 5 order scheme applicable to a variety of different static stability regimes cohen et al 2015 the mellor yamada nakanishi niino scheme combined with the unified noah land surface model tewari et al 2004 and the eta similarity surface layer scheme janjiƒá 2002 were applied in this study sensitivity tests for different planetary boundary layer schemes can be found in ricchi et al 2017 the interaction between the wrf model and the ocean model roms was through the following two schemes 1 the roms transferred sst with high temporal and spatial resolutions to the wrf model and 2 the wrf model provided roms with momentum and heat fluxes we used a flux conservative remapping scheme that had been integrated into the coawst modeling system in a recent version in this manner roms and the wrf model used the same fluxes at the atmosphere ocean interface the coupling between the wrf model and the swan model was done as follows 1 the wrf model offered the swan model wind data with high temporal and spatial resolutions and 2 the swan model supplied the wrf model with peak wavelengths peak periods and significant wave heights for estimation of the wave induced surface roughness at the sea surface the current version of the coawst modeling system offers three methods to do this warner et al 2010 olabarrieta et al 2012 in the present study the wave induced enhanced bottom roughness was computed with the formulation from taylor and yelland 2001 the wrf model was initialized at 0000 utc on september 12 2014 on the basis of data from the national centers for environmental prediction global forecast system gfs with a 1 horizontal resolution and 6 h time interval the same data were used to derive the boundary conditions to further improve the simulation for typhoon track and intensity for the purpose of this study the spectral nudging scheme von storch et al 2000 was applied on horizontal winds temperature and geopotential height in the upper layer k 10 of the gfs data a nudging coefficient of 0 0003 s 1 indicating a relaxation time of approximately 1 h was used for all the nudging variables a wave number of 3 was used for both the zonal direction and the meridional direction and hence waves with wavelengths equal to or great than approximately 1300 km were nudged nudging was performed every 6 h during the whole simulation time the total run time for all the three model components was 10 days i e from 0000 utc on september 12 to 0000 utc on september 22 we did not use any scheme e g warner et al 2010 to restrengthen the initial intensity in the simulation because the gfs data could not adequately simulate typhoons the intensity of the modeled typhoon kalmaegi was very close to observations after the spin up of 1 day fig 5 4 2 roms ocean model roms is a free surface terrain following three dimensional ocean model extensively used for numerous applications e g wilkin et al 2005 maccready et al 2009 the detailed numerical algorithm for roms can be found in shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the code for roms is written with high flexibility offering a wide range of solution algorithms for pressure gradient and horizontal and vertical advections as well as subgrid scale parameterizations in this application we used the same model domain and grids for roms as for the wrf model 9 km horizontal resolution for computational efficiency since the time for transmission of regridded data among model components is reduced vertically 30 levels were used for the stretched terrain following coordinate the vertical stretching parameters Œ∏s 5 Œ∏b 0 8 and tcline 150 m were used the water temperature and salinity for the initial conditions were from the august woa13 climatological monthly data the initial currents depth averaged currents and sea surface height were calculated on the basis of the aforementioned temperature and salinity data with the following steps roms was run with these initial water temperature and salinity values fixed ts fixed until the steady state to obtain the currents u v depth averaged currents ubar vbar and sea surface height zeta furthermore the upmost layer initial water temperature was replaced by the mwo observed sst on september 12 with these initial conditions our coupled model results showed good agreement with the observations in particular the simulated typhoon intensity was much closer to the observations see the following discussion for the model results when roms was initialized with the output of hycom glbu0 08 https hycom org data glbu0pt08 expt 91pt1 the modeled intensity of the typhoon was much stronger than the observations from both jtwc and cma and the sst cooling was much weaker than the mwo observations not shown for the present studies being able to simulate the typhoon more accurately would give us more confidence to discuss the ocean responses a more sophisticated method e g li et al 2014 including data assimilation for the ocean model initialization will be useful for such a coupled model system but it requires much greater computational resources here it is assumed that ocean model was run from an initial steady state and the surface cooling and mld changes are due to the passage of the storm furthermore our focus is on the northern scs where the storm began to have a direct influence about 3 days after the model initialization therefore the ocean model should undergo further adjustment in this period in addition the scs is rich in mesoscale eddies lin et al 2015 which may modulate the upper ocean response to a typhoon jaimes et al 2011 and detailed mesoscale features may be missing in the woa13 data however the output of the ocean model initialized with the woa13 data suggested that mesoscale structures did not induce any significant effect in such a short period at high frequency on typhoon kalmaegi probably because the storm was moving fast the open boundary conditions for currents temperature and salinity were taken from the output of hycom however for such a short term simulation 10 days september 12 to september 22 2014 the influence of open boundary conditions is negligible given that tides may enhance cold wake through additional mixing eight tidal constituents k1 o1 p1 q1 k2 m2 n2 and s2 obtained from http volkov oce orst edu tides global html were applied the open boundary conditions were as follows chapman conditions for the free surface flather conditions for the two dimensional momentum radiation plus nudging conditions for the three dimensional momentum and temperature and salinity with a 1 day nudging coefficient the sea surface forcing including wind stress and heat fluxes were provided by the wrf model the following effects of surface waves in roms were considered 1 the injection of turbulent kinetic energy induced by wave breaking which was incorporated into roms by the generic length scale method warner et al 2005 and 2 wave forces the vortex force approach was used kumar et al 2012 although these effects were included in the simulation we will not discuss them here to avoid distraction and for brevity 4 3 swan wave model to compute wave induced surface roughness in the wrf model and the effects of surface waves in roms some wave parameters e g wave length wave height wave period wave direction and wave breaking must be provided by the swan wave model booij et al 1999 which solves the wave action balance equation accounting for wind wave generation nonlinear wave wave interactions bottom dissipation wave breaking shoaling and refraction for the present study the model grids for swan were the same as for roms fig 4 with the wind forcing computed by the wrf model the directional grid resolution was set to 10 with a total of 36 directions twenty four frequencies 0 04 1 0 hz were used the boundary conditions were taken from the wavewatch iii model ftp polar ncep noaa gov pub history waves swan runs in nonstationary mode and takes into account the effects of changes in currents kirby and chen 1989 and free surface elevations dissipation processes whitecapping bottom friction and quadruplet nonlinear wave wave interactions currents and free surface elevations were provided by roms whitecapping was computed on the basis of komen et al 1984 in this fully coupled model simulation the baroclinic time step was set to 60 s with a time splitting ratio of 30 for roms swan ran with a time step of 60 s and the wrf model ran with a time step of 30 s the time interval for data interchange among the models was set to 600 s 5 results and discussion 5 1 meteorological fields in this subsection meteorological fields including typhoon track and intensity surface wind and air temperature are discussed on the basis of the wrf model output observations and ccmp wind data fig 3 displays comparisons between the simulated track red line in fig 3 and the two observed tracks with one from the jtwc and the other from the cma it is interesting to examine whether the two observed tracks are consistent with each other the tracks from the jtwc and cma black and blue lines in fig 3 are almost the same until 1200 utc on september 15 after which they show some discrepancies the simulated tracks generally follow the two observed tracks closely except when the storm made landfall at the philippines the mean deviation is about 42 km increasing the model grid resolution e g 4 km improving the spectral nudging scheme used in this study and using more accurate land topography etc may further improve the track simulation the time series of the simulated minimum sea level air pressure is compared with the observations from the jtwc and cma fig 5 discrepancies exists between the simulated results red line in fig 5 and observed data black and blue lines but the model results show good consistency with observations from the cma when the storm entered the scs at around 1600 utc on september 14 to 0000 utc on september 16 in particular the simulated intensity is nearly the same as that from the cma when the typhoon passed the observational array from 0000 utc on september 15 to 1200 utc on september 15 the mean deviation between the simulated minimum sea level air pressure and that from the cma is about 4 mbar when the storm was crossing over the scs it can be seen that there are relatively large differences between the two best tracks and generally the jtwc data have weaker intensity than the cma data comparisons between the simulated sea level air pressure 10 m wind speed and direction and surface air temperature and those observed by the four stations stations 1 2 4 and 5 are shown in figs 6 and 7 for the sea level air pressure the model performed well in general for all four stations throughout the whole simulation period panels a and e in figs 6 and 7 however the model results show lower minimum pressure which is more evident at stations 1 and 4 which are located on the right side of the simulated track fig 3 the main reason for these discrepancies is that there is a slight track error in the simulation fig 3 red line it was too close to stations 1 and 4 and further away from stations 2 and 5 the comparisons for the 10 m wind speed panels b and f in figs 6 and 7 at the four stations are similar to those for the sea level air pressure for the 10 m wind direction the model results are generally in agreement with the observations except when the storm center was approaching the stations e g from 0500 utc on september 14 to 0000 utc on september 15 in fig 6 panel c the wind generally turned clockwise counterclockwise to the right left side of the track for the surface air temperature the variation trends in the simulated results and observations are consistent with each other but the observations show variations with more irregularity probably due to some atmospheric boundary physical processes not well resolved in our coupled model and the adoption of higher resolution model grids may alleviate this issue the spatial structure of the 1 day average of the simulated 10 m wind for september 15 is shown in fig 8 b for comparison the ccmp wind data on the same day are also presented fig 8c as stated in section 3 typhoon kalmaegi is a fast moving storm so the wind speed shows a clear bias to the right side of its track which is more evident in the snapshots of the wrf simulated wind field fig 8a furthermore the maximum wind speed was found to be in the right front quadrant of the track fig 8b the ccmp wind data also show a similar pattern fig 8c but with a lower wind speed to the right side of the track the ccmp wind data atlas et al 2011 produced from a combination of satellite moored buoy and modeled wind data can be used to describe the typhoon s wind spatial structure although they underestimate the typhoon s maximum wind speed in general our coupled model system reproduced well typhoon kalmaegi s track and intensity and its associated surface wind spatial structure therefore it allows us to investigate the ocean responses confidently 5 2 surface waves in this subsection we validate and discuss the simulated wave results in terms of significant wave height h s fig 9 demonstrates the comparison between simulated h s from the swan model and the values observed at stations 1 and 4 both of them are located on the right side of the storm s track we have no wave observations from the left side of the track it can be seen that the simulated results in general agree with the observations with a root mean square error of h s of about 0 6 m for station 1 and 1 0 m for station 4 however there is a 2 3 h phase lag between the simulated and observed results probably because the simulated typhoon was moving a little faster as it passed over the stations than the actual typhoon did fig 6 panel a exploration of the mechanisms for this small discrepancy between simulated and observed typhoon translation speeds is beyond the scope of this study but is of considerable importance for accurate typhoon landing time forecast in general the model underestimated the wave height at these two stations which may be because wave enhanced bottom roughness was not well simulated we did another experiment in which the bottom roughness was computed with a combination of the formulas proposed by charnock 1955 and liu et al 1979 this modeled wave height showed better agreement with the observations not shown here to further validate the wave model results the simulated significant wave heights h s were compared with those of the jason 2 ku band measured fig 10 the agreements are overall good with a slope of the regression line of approximately 0 87 with a bias of approximately 0 37 m indicating that the h s values were overestimated by the wave model to some extent if only the model results and jason 2 data near the typhoon track region are used the slope of the regression line is approximately 0 96 with a bias of approximately 0 33 m note that the modeled and measured results show increasing dispersion with h s olabarrieta et al 2012 encountered the same situation in a study on the ocean atmosphere dynamics during hurricane ida and hurricane nor ida and argued that this might be associated with the frequency of model output model grid resolution and the method used to estimate h s from the satellite data fig 11 displays the spatial distribution of h s for four different snapshots the maximum h s is distributed around the track with the largest h s values found in the right front quadrant of the advancing typhoon s track the maximum h s value increased with the intensity of the storm the largest h s was observed in the continental slope and shelf regions with a value of approximately 12 m fig 11 panels c and d owing to the fast movement of the storm crossing the scs in less than 2 days the storm generated wind wave zone was limited to be moving with the typhoon the asymmetry in the h s distribution fig 11 on both sides of the track is more evident than that of the wind speed fig 8 this can be explained as follows the wind direction to the right side of the track was roughly aligned with the storm propagation direction consequently in this region the waves propagate forward with the typhoon and keep following the strong wind regions of the typhoon for a long time therefore they would undergo an extended fetch influence these waves are sometimes called fetch trapped waves king and shemdin 1987 in contrast the wind direction and the storm moving direction are opposite on the left side of the storm track and the waves stay in the intensive wind regions for only a short time this implies that the degree of asymmetry in the wave field is expected to be larger than that in the wind field in particular if the group velocity of the waves is close to or equal to the storm moving speed the waves will stay in the storm region and hence the fetch trapped waves would play a role bowyer and macafee 2005 5 3 surface responses during typhoon kalmaegi some portions of our study domain had no satellite observations for sst because of heavy cloud fig 12 panel a which was more evident in the coastal regions however most of the region still had satellite sst observations which allowed quantification of the sst change between september 12 before typhoon kalmaegi and september 16 after the arrival of typhoon kalmaegi the results from both the model and the satellite fig 12 panels a and b showed a reduction of sst in most of the study domain caused by typhoon kalmaegi with the maximum cooling occurring in the northern scs slope and shelf regions additionally a right biased cooling was found which was more obvious in the model results this rightward bias in cooling was caused by the fast moving storm with enhanced wind speed to the right side of its path further resonance would occur since both wind and current rotate clockwise in turn inducing more vigorous turbulent mixing in this region similar cooling patterns were frequently reported in other studies e g jordan and frank 1964 price 1981 taira et al 1993 there are some discrepancies between model based and satellite measured sst cooling the observed maximum cooling was approximately 5 4 c while that from the model simulation was approximately 4 5 c the model simulated maximum sst cooling was mainly located in the shelf region of the northern scs while the satellite observed maximum sst cooling extended to the slope and deep basin region of the northern scs these two discrepancies are attributed to the model initial subsurface temperature being derived from woa13 which might have higher than actual water temperature the maximum cooling that occurred in the northern scs may be due to a combination of two effects 1 the storm passing the maximum cooling region reached its peak intensity fig 2 panel a hence generating the most intensive mixing of its lifetime and 2 the breaking of the highest waves fig 11 panels c and d observed in the maximum cooling region might inject more momentum causing more mixing than in the rest of the study domain to show the surface current response low pass filtering was implemented on the simulated surface current to suppress the tide signal fig 13 it can be seen that the current velocity is much stronger on the right side of the track than on the left furthermore the surface currents rotate clockwise with a period roughly equal to the local inertial period e g 36 h at 19 2 n specifically at 0000 utc on september 16 the central position of typhoon kalmaegi was located in the northern scs shelf region and the rear of the typhoon center consists of alternating downwelling and upwelling cells color shading in fig 13 panel a which were induced by alternating convergence and divergence of surface currents for a fast moving typhoon geisler 1970 found that the upwelling is situated beneath the rear of the typhoon center however for a slow moving storm the upwelling is mainly located near the storm center with an average translation speed of approximately 7 9 m s 1 passing over the scs the fast moving typhon kalmaegi generated alternating downwelling and upwelling cells at the rear of its center eighteen hours later fig 13 panel b the downwelling upwelling regions were replaced by upwelling downwelling regions and the surface currents were in the opposite direction to those 18 h before fig 13 panel a thirty six hours later the distribution reversed again fig 13 panel b indicating that the dominant dynamic responses were baroclinic with strong nios the alternate downwelling and upwelling motions are often called inertial pumping price et al 1994 both the near inertial currents and the wind stress turn clockwise with time on the right side of the typhoon s track whereas the wind stress rotates counterclockwise on the left making the coupling less efficient this leads to a strong asymmetry in the surface layer velocity across the track significantly greater on the right side than on the left 5 4 cross track subsurface responses two observational stations stations 4 and 5 were chosen to discuss subsurface temperature and salinity responses with one situated on the right side of the storm s track station 4 and the other located on the left fig 3 the distance between station 4 and the observed simulated center of the typhoon at the time when the storm was over the observational array was around 127 km 88 km and that for station 5 was 48 km 82 km the model results were interpolated onto the positions of stations 4 and 5 both the observations and the model results were low pass filtered to eliminate tide signal a difference can be seen between the observed and simulated tracks of the typhoon 45 km fig 3 at the time when it was over the observation array however the observed and modeled wind speeds were quite consistent fig 6 panels b and f as stated in section 5 1 during this period the simulated typhoon intensity matched well with the observations fig 5 hence it is expected that the simulated subsurface responses would be consistent with those of the observations for station 4 figs 14 panels a d the time evolution of the temperature of the upper 100 m of the water column exhibits a clear response to the passage of the storm which can be seen both in the observational data and in the model results fig 14 panels a and c the model results overall match the observations during the forced stage about half a day the 28 c isotherm was immediately raised up to the surface the sst was quickly reduced by approximately 2 c and the depth of the 25 c isotherm was increased by approximately 14 m it is remarkable that during the relaxation period the subsurface isotherms undulated significantly with a period of approximately 36 h which is close to the local inertial period at 19 n for the 25 c isotherm as an example its maximum oscillation amplitude was around 10 m which was approximately equal to the isopycnal displacements Œ∑ s estimated on the basis of œÑ max œÅ o fu h 7 0 m table 1 the vertical velocity can also be estimated from the isopycnal displacements Œ∑ s according to w 4Œ∑ s ip where ip is the inertial period here approximately 36 h the estimated value 3 0 10 4 m s 1 is approximately equal to the model computed values fig 13 the oscillations of the isotherms were driven by the divergence and convergence of inertial current in the mixed layer which would induce subsurface water cooling and warming fig 14 panel a the surface salinity was increased by about 0 2 which is clearly seen in the observations fig 14 panel b but is not evident in the model results fig 14 panel d the subsurface salinity response showed a very similar pattern as the response of temperature it is worth mentioning that the reduction of sst and increase of surface salinity indicate an entrainment of cooler and more saline water into the surface layer from the upper thermocline for station 5 figs 14 panels e h the sst was reduced by around 1 c a very modest reduction in comparison with that observed at station 4 the subsurface isotherm oscillation period was nearly the same as that at station 4 the model results show a smaller oscillation amplitude 5 m compared with that at station 4 10 m fig 14 panels c and g because of a lower simulated wind speed fig 6 panels b and f at station 5 whereas this was not seen in the observations fig 14 panels a and e the observed maximum wind speeds at these two stations are nearly the same hence the observed subsurface isotherm oscillations show little difference later on september 19 the 28 c isotherm was observed to have rapidly uplifted toward the surface fig 14 panel e when another tropical storm fung wong zhang et al 2016 passed the model did not reproduce this response fig 14 panel g probably because the track of fung wong was not well simulated not shown in contrast to the salinity at station 4 the surface salinity decreased by approximately 0 1 fig 14 panels b and f at station 5 this was also captured by the model fig 14 panel h the reason for the different response of salinity between these two stations is that the much stronger vertical mixing due to the enhanced wind speed on the right side of the storm s track can potentially entrain more and saltier water into the mixed layer hence increasing the surface salinity in this region further after examination of the rainfall data observed at these two stations not shown it is found that station 5 received much more freshwater during typhoon kalmaegi these factors would be favorable for inducing a leftward bias of the surface salinity anomalies the observed and simulated upper ocean current responses to typhoon kalmaegi at stations 2 and 4 are presented in fig 15 these two stations were located on the left side and the right side of the storm s track respectively the closest distance between station 2 and the observed simulated typhoon center was 28 km 63 km here we have excluded bad data zhang et al 2016 the model results again are generally consistent with the observations some common features are found in both the observations and the model results 1 an increase in energy in the near inertial period immediately after the passage of typhoon kalmaegi was found at almost all depths 2 the current velocity had a near inertial clockwise rotating motion which decayed slowly with time 3 below 50 m the current responding to typhoon kalmaegi was weaker than that at shallower depths and showed an increase in magnitude with time indicating a downward propagation of energy 4 the current velocity in the upper 50 m was out of phase with that at lower layers indicating a first baroclinic mode response which was more evident at station 4 and 5 in contrast to that at station 2 the current at station 4 was much stronger because of a rightward bias wind speed and the resonance between wind and current as mentioned previously 5 5 along track subsurface response on the basis of the preceding comparison of model results and observations we conclude that the coupled model is capable of faithfully reproducing many features of air sea dynamics for typhoon kalmaegi hence allowing us to examine in more detail the ocean response we selected one cross section roughly parallel to the simulated storm s track and at about 80 km on the right the black line in fig 12 panel b this cross section was chosen as it crossed the maximum cooling region the red triangle in fig 12 panel b allowing us to study the subsurface dynamics in this region six snapshots of the response for the selected cross section are presented in fig 16 some notable features deserve to be mentioned at 1300 utc on september 15 the 28 c isotherm was immediately raised up to the surface in response to the passage of the storm fig 16 panel a as the storm intensified and approached the shelf of the northern scs figs 3 and 5 the sst was further decreased as shown by the outcrop of the 27 c isotherm at 0130 utc on september 16 fig 16 panels b and c the subsurface isotherm lines were all lifted up but lagged the surface response to some extent during the relaxation stage after 0700 utc on september 16 strong internal waves with near inertial frequency were observed which can be seen in the up and down oscillations of the thermocline figs 16 panels d and e the amplitude of the thermocline oscillation in deep ocean is the same as observed in fig 14 7 m when the crests of the westward propagating internal waves encountered the topography the thermocline was significantly uplifted the black rectangle in fig 16 panel d when the trough approached the uplifted thermocline retreated fig 16 panel e again at the next crest the thermocline was raised up fig 16 panel f it is interesting to note that the interval between the two remarkable raisings of the thermocline figs 16 panels d and f is roughly 36 h which is close to the inertial period at 19 n internal waves generated by storms have long been noted e g gill 1982 the wavelength can be estimated by Œª 2 œÄ u h f 1 c 1 u h 2 which is about 900 km in the scs and approximately matches the distance between the two troughs of the internal waves fig 16 panel b because of the pronounced motions of the waves discussed above it can be seen that at one selected station very close to the cross section line mentioned above the red triangle in fig 12 panel b an obvious two layer motion is observed in the east u fig 17 panel a and north v fig 17 panel b velocity components a near bottom enhanced turbulent mixing manifested in the vertical diffusion coefficient fig 17 panel c was found which was possibly due to the breaking of the internal wave by its interaction with the topography the strong near bottom mixing was decaying but also oscillating with the near inertial frequency it is noteworthy that the strong mixing observed after september 20 was probably generated by the breaking of internal waves produced by the passage of another storm fung wong zhang et al 2016 additionally significantly enhanced near surface turbulent mixing was also observed fig 17 panel c which was evidently induced by the passage of typhoon kalmaegi between september 15 and september 17 it is expected that the oscillations of the thermocline will induce a similar vertical motion fig 17 panel d and temperature anomaly in the water column fig 17 panel e when the upward motions occurred the cold thermocline water was brought up toward the surface in contrast during the downward motion the warm upper layer water was taken to deeper levels 5 6 heat budget analysis the heat budget equation can be written as t t t u v t w t dh tdv q s where t t is the local rate of change of temperature t u v is horizontal advection t w is vertical advection t dh is horizontal diffusion t dv is vertical diffusion and q s is surface heat flux the horizontal diffusion terms are disregarded as they are orders of magnitude smaller all these terms are computed as diagnostic variables derived directly from the output of the ocean model we choose three representative stations for discussion station 4 station 5 and the station denoted by the red triangle in fig 12 panel b which was located in the maximum cooling region for station 4 the water temperature anomaly evolution defined as the temperature change from the initial value i e t z t t z 0 in which t 0 is defined at 0000 utc on september 12 fig 18 panel a showed a significant cooling in the upper 30 m of the water column and an alternation of cooling and warming below 30 m depth cooling in the surface layer was induced by a combination of surface heat loss and vertical diffusion of cold subsurface water the subsurface alternating warming and cooling was a combination of advection and vertical diffusion with the former dominant the vertical diffusion had a marked impact only during the passage of the storm fig 18 panel b while its influence was small before and after the storm in addition this term generally cooled the upper 30 m of the water column but warmed the water below 40 m depth its values were one order of magnitude smaller than the advection term the vertical advection and horizontal advection terms both oscillated with near inertial period but were out of phase and generally cancel each other out shown by the sum of these two terms in fig 18 panel f in the upper 30 m of the water column below 30 m the horizontal advection term was larger than the vertical advection term and therefore dominated the total advection term the local rate of change generally resembled the total advection fig 18 panels c and f below 40 m indicating that the total advection was the dominant factor controlling changes of temperature time series of each heat budget term fig 18 panel g averaged over the upper 30 m of the water column showed that vertical diffusion contributed the most to the cooling trend during the passage of the storm during the storm the total heat flux became negative at the surface because of losses to the atmosphere and contributed approximately 12 of the cooling such results are consistent with previous findings e g price 1981 which suggests that vertical mixing dominates the upper ocean cooling during storms it seems that the surface heat flux advection and vertical diffusion all contributed to the poststorm warming in the upper 30 m of the water column at this station for station 5 the results fig 19 were generally similar to those for station 4 except that the magnitude of each term was smaller because of a relatively low wind speed to the left side of the storm s track the maximum sst reduction was very modest approximately 1 c and the thickness of the upper cooling layer was significantly reduced at station 5 to approximately 10 m fig 19 panel a while the values for station 4 were about 2 c and 40 m respectively indicating a much weaker vertical mixing at station 5 which was also seen in the vertical diffusion term fig 19 panel b with a maximum value about a quarter of that at station 4 another notable feature was seen in the time evolution of the budget terms averaged over the upper 30 m fig 19 panel g the surface heat flux made a contribution to the cooling comparable to that of the vertical diffusion term if the effects of vertical diffusion were much reduced the surface heat flux should play an important role in the cooling event for the station located in the maximum cooling region red triangle in fig 12 panel b the surface layer cooling was more pronounced with a maximum of approximately 4 5 c and the alternating warming and cooling that occurred below 40 m was enhanced fig 20 panel a all the heat budget terms were larger than the corresponding terms at station 4 fig 20 panels b f the reason for these differences between stations is that the storm reached its peak intensity when passing over the maximum cooling region hence injecting more momentum into the ocean once again we see that the vertical diffusion dominated the temperature change in the upper 30 m of the water column fig 20 panel g during the storm below 30 m the total advection term played a major role in temperature change fig 20 panels c and f the local rate of change followed closely the total advection in the upper 30 m of the water column after the storm and presented an oscillation decaying with time fig 20 panel g 6 concluding remarks extensive previous studies on the impacts of a typhoon on the scs were based on numerical models that were mainly forced by either reanalysis winds data with low spatial and temporal resolutions or a constructed typhoon wind model both were insufficient to provide detailed typhoon wind forcing for the simulations of the ocean response to a typhoon in the present study a fully coupled atmosphere ocean wave model was applied to study the upper ocean response to the passage of typhoon kalmaegi the simulated track generally matched the observed tracks except when the storm made landfall at the philippines the mean deviation between the modeled track and the jtwc based track was about 42 km the mean deviation between the simulated minimum pressure and that of the cma was about 4 mbar when the storm crossed the scs the simulated sea level air pressure wind speed wind direction and surface air temperature are consistent with the observations from the four buoys typhoon kalmaegi passed through the scs with a mean nondimensional speed of approximately 2 87 and a froude number of approximately 2 8 both indicating that the storm was a fast moving system consistent with a notable rightward bias in wind speed the modeled significant wave heights h s are in good agreement with the observations at stations 1 and 4 with a root mean square error of about 0 6 m and 1 0 m respectively comparison between the simulated h s and the jason 2 ku band measurements also showed good agreement with a slope of the regression line of approximately 0 87 and a bias of approximately 0 37 m indicating that the h s values were overestimated by the wave model to some extent the simulated maximum h s is near the storm s center with the largest h s values found in the right front quadrant of the advancing typhoon furthermore the maximum h s values increased with the intensity of the storm the highest waves occurred in the right front quadrant and were well observed by an airborne scanning radar altimeter e g wright et al 2001 and the associated enhanced breaking waves would inject more momentum into the ocean hence causing strong mixing a rightward biased surface cooling induced by typhoon kalmaegi was found both in the model calculated results and in the satellite observations with the maximum cooling occurring in the northern scs slope and shelf regions the surface current response was characterized by a clockwise rotating current field with the near inertial period with a much stronger current speed to the right side of the storm s track the alternating convergence and divergence of the near inertial mixed layer current left by the storm generated alternating downwelling and upwelling cells respectively according to the theoretical work of greatbatch 1983 the maximum current speed in the mixed layer can be estimated by a t u h where u h is the storm moving speed and a t is the ratio of the along track advection to the local acceleration terms here it is 0 34 on the basis of greatbatch 1983 with a mean storm moving speed of about 7 9 m s 1 the estimated maximum current in the mixed layer was around 2 68 m s 1 which was close to the simulated maximum surface current of approximately 2 4 m s 1 because typhoon kalmaegi is a fast moving system having a mean froude number of approximately 2 8 the ocean response is baroclinic and hence it is not surprising that a strong nio occurred in the subsurface isotherm as well as in the ocean current which were both seen in the model results and the observations it is noteworthy that the current speed on the right side of the storm s track decayed rapidly with time while that on the left side of the storm s track persisted for much longer fig 15 this may be attributed to a more effective downward propagation of near inertial wave energy on the right side of the storm s track the model results are generally consistent with the observations suggesting the reliability of our coupled model system is good hence allowing us to discuss the along track ocean response a strong near inertial internal wave induced by the storm was found propagating along the track toward the northern scs slope where the wave crest impinged the slope then climbed up the shelf fig 16 accompanied by the wave motion a two layer ocean current response and strong mixing in the bottom of the slope induced by the breaking of the waves were also observed to the best of our knowledge the typhoon induced near inertial internal waves influenced by the northern scs topography were revealed for the first time here to discuss the mechanism responsible for the upper ocean cooling induced by typhoon kalmaegi three representative stations were selected for discussion with two of them located on the right station 4 and the station denoted by the red triangle in fig 12 panel b which was situated in the maximum cooling region and one on the left station 5 of the storm s track generally for all three stations the vertical diffusion dominated the rate of change of temperature in the upper layer while advection played a major role for the subsurface layer the net surface heat flux contributed only 10 14 to the rate of change of temperature in the upper layer for the stations located on the right side of the track consistent with previous findings e g price 1981 jiang et al 2009 however it is interesting to note that heat flux makes a contribution comparable to that of the vertical diffusion to the surface layer cooling during the passage of the storm to the left side of the track indicating that its role cannot be ignored in this region indeed if the upper ocean heat content is high enough the surface cooling may be determined by the net surface heat flux e g jaimes

24084,the quality of a short term ocean forecast relies on its initialisation however operational shelf seas forecasting systems tend to assimilate fewer observation types than non tidal global systems for shelf seas systems the challenge is to incorporate observations into the 3d ocean state within a model with complex vertical coordinates and large amplitude variations in the sea surface height due to tides in this paper we describe the first use of altimeter and in situ profile observations to improve the initialisation of an operational shelf seas forecasting system foam shelf v9 is a 7 km horizontal resolution ocean model covering the european north west shelf nws seas we have adapted our assimilation scheme in this system to account for spatially and temporally varying vertical coordinates throughout the domain there is now assimilation of in situ profile measurements of temperature and salinity and satellite and in situ sea surface temperature observations additionally in deep water regions 700 m southward of 60 n the system assimilates newly available altimeter observations tailored for use in coastal models with this new system gross biases are significantly reduced the sub surface root mean square rms temperature and salinity errors are reduced by 25 and there is an increase in the number of eddying structures providing a better qualitative match to observation derived surface current products keywords data assimilation operational 3dvar shelf seas regional modelling altimetry 1 introduction the european north west shelf nws seas are of great societal and economic importance they are highly biologically active and host oil and gas extraction platforms pipelines fisheries and shipping through the copernicus marine environment modelling service cmems the met office provides operational forecasts of physical and biogeochemical variables for this dynamically diverse region including 3d temperature and salinity sea surface height ssh ocean currents chlorophyll concentration and visibility the previous met office operational system foam shelf v8 was implemented in late 2012 o dea et al 2017 the assimilation component of this system used only sea surface temperature sst observations to improve the modelled ocean state while this helps to constrain known surface temperature biases in stratified regions biases in the sub surface temperature are relatively unconstrained additionally since foam shelf v8 assimilated no salinity observations the surface and sub surface salinity were constrained only by the boundary conditions and forcing fields these biases which are discussed in detail in o dea et al 2017 provided the motivation for the assimilation developments described here in this article we will present the developments made to implement the assimilation of profile and altimeter observations in foam shelf v9 the new shelf seas forecasting system used operationally at the met office since april 2017 while the assimilation of sst in situ profiles and sea level anomaly sla observations has become routine in many global ocean forecasting systems martin et al 2015 operational shelf seas systems have not in general assimilated all of these observation types this has been due to a number of issues including the complex vertical co ordinate systems often used in coastal systems the mismatch between the cadence of observations and actual shelf dynamics and the filtering of tidal and atmospheric signals from existing altimeter products however several coastal ocean systems have demonstrated the use of these and other observation types using 4d var assimilation schemes kurapov et al 2011 and song et al 2016 assimilate sst and sla observations in non tidal coastal models a number of coastal ocean systems also assimilate high frequency hf radar measurements of surface currents e g yu et al 2012 kerry et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 have also demonstrated the use of 4d var for assimilating sst temperature and salinity t s profile and hf radar observations into a tidal model of the new york bight in a pre operational system zhuang et al 2011 used a univariate 3d var scheme to demonstrate the positive impact of assimilating t s profiles in the danish meteorological institute s coastal model of the baltic and north seas the existing cmems operational 1 36 iberia biscay ireland ibi ocean forecasting system has no direct data assimilation component sotillo et al 2015 however the cmems 1 12 ibi physical reanalysis system assimilates sst observations t s profiles and satellite sla observations both of these systems include tides and are forced by atmospheric pressure but the sla observations used have had the atmospheric and tidal signals removed finally dobricic et al 2012 have shown improved innovation statistics when assimilating sla observations which retain the inverse barometer effect in a non tidal ocean model which is forced by atmospheric pressure the met office operational ocean forecasting systems use a 3d var data assimilation scheme known as nemovar mogensen et al 2009 2012 waters et al 2015 this multivariate scheme employs balance relationships between the state variables that allow for balanced increments to the temperature salinity ssh and velocity fields the previous met office shelf seas forecasting system foam shelf v8 assimilated only sst observations by performing a 2d analysis of the innovations the resulting 2d increments were applied to the model using a cosine taper from the surface down to the base of the instantaneous mixed layer foam shelf v9 now assimilates temperature and salinity profile and sla observations in addition to sst observations and balanced 3d increments to the temperature salinity ssh and velocity fields are calculated by nemovar as is done for the global system the next section will provide an overview of the updated nws forecasting system including a brief description of the ocean model section 3 details the observations assimilated and the observation bias correction schemes section 4 will then describe the assimilation scheme including the developments made to implement the assimilation of profile and altimeter observations section 5 details our assessment of the new system and of each observation type separately and our conclusions are presented in section 6 2 overview of new system the ocean model component of the foam shelf v9 shelf seas forecasting system uses the 7 km 51 vertical level atlantic margin model configuration o dea et al 2017 of nemo version 3 6 madec 2008 with the teos 10 equation of state the ocean model is directly forced by hourly wind and atmospheric pressure fields 3 hourly radiative and e p evaporation minus precipitation fluxes and includes 15 tidal constituents calculated from a tidal model of the north east atlantic and specified on the open boundary via the flather radiation condition flather 1981 the model is nested within the met office 1 12 north atlantic model natl12 storkey et al 2010 blockley et al 2014 which provides the lateral boundary conditions except for the baltic boundary which is taken from the iow leibniz institut f√ºr ostseeforschung warnem√ºnde operational system gr√§we et al 2015 the natl12 model assimilates sst sla and t s profiles and is itself nested within the met office global 1 4 system surface forcing is provided by the met office operational numerical weather prediction nwp forecasting system the domain shown in fig 1 extends from 40 n 20 w to 65 n 13 e on a regular latitude longitude grid covering the north west european shelf and part of the north east atlantic ocean with a resolution of 1 15 latitude by 1 9 longitude giving a horizontal resolution of 7 km this area has a complex bathymetry containing regions of shallow water a continental shelf and regions of deep ocean depth 5000 m the resulting dynamics due to tidal mixing and the seasonal variation in wind strength and solar irradiation lead to seasonally stratified and well mixed regions with marked boundaries wind forcing and atmospheric pressure changes can produce storm surges and the internal ocean dynamics produce mesoscale eddies and fronts an important aspect of the physical model which distinguishes it from our global and basin scale ocean configurations is the vertical co ordinate system in this domain we use the œÉ coordinate defined by siddorn and furner 2013 which has a fixed surface vertical resolution tapering to terrain following levels at depth the assimilation component of foam shelf v9 uses nemovar version 3 waters et al 2015 with a 24 h assimilation window during a single analysis cycle the sst observations are first bias corrected using a reference data set of in situ sst measurements described in section 3 1 then during the observation operator step a model forecast is run and model equivalent background values produced for each observation at the appropriate time and position next the assimilation system calculates multi variate increments temperature salinity u and v velocities and sea surface height based on the observation model differences by minimising a 3d var cost function finally the model forecast is rerun for the same period and a fraction of the increments are added onto the model fields at each time step bloom et al 1996 incremental analysis update 3 observations the observations assimilated in foam shelf v9 include satellite and in situ observations of the sea surface temperature sst in situ temperature and salinity t s profile measurements and satellite altimeter observations of the sea level anomaly sla the bias correction and assimilation scheme will be described in more detail in sections 3 and 4 3 1 sst observations the in situ sst observations assimilated in foam shelf v9 include observations from ships surface drifters and moorings these data are distributed over the gts global telecommunication system in near real time nrt we also assimilate l2p l3c satellite observations of sst available from the group for high resolution sea surface temperature ghrsst donlon et al 2009 these observations have resolution of up to 1 km but are subsampled to approximately 5 km to reduce data volumes in addition to sst observations from noaa avhrr metop avhrr and seviri which were assimilated in the previous version of the system we now also assimilate observations from viirs and amsr2 however the hindcast experiments described in this article used only the satellite sst observations from noaa avhrr metop avhrr and seviri the average density of sst observations in our experiments is shown in fig 2 where clouds in the northern parts of the domain significantly affect the coverage of satellite observations this reduced coverage has been improved in the operational system due to the use of the microwave amsr2 observations in common with our other ocean configurations and the ostia sst analysis donlon et al 2012 the sst observations are filtered to remove those which do not reflect the foundation sst i e those which are influenced by diurnal warming this is done by removing daytime observations with wind speeds below 6 m s as was done in the previous system and in our global ocean forecasting system these satellite sst observations are then bias corrected before assimilation see donlon et al 2012 the assumption is that satellite observations of sst are biased due to large scale errors in the atmospheric conditions which are used in the conversion from measured brightness temperature to an estimate of the sst to bias correct the satellite measurements we first define a reference set of presumed unbiased observations from the highest quality in situ sst observations we then create observations of the bias by matching up the reference observations with satellite observations within fixed distances and times 25 km and 1 day apart with these observations of the bias we then perform a 2d analysis to update the previous day s bias field to represent the scales of synoptic weather patterns while accounting for the relatively low number of available reference observations this analysis uses a single horizontal length scale of 7 and is done separately for each satellite the bias at each observation location is then removed from each observation before assimilation 3 2 temperature salinity profiles the in situ temperature and salinity t s profiles assimilated in foam shelf v9 include observations made by ships fixed moored arrays gliders xbts ctds and observations from argo profiling floats all of these observations are available in nrt over the gts in this domain the coverage of temperature and salinity profiles over a single day is low the fleet of argo profilers provides useful coverage over the deep parts of the domain but currently on shelf observations are limited to a few fixed mooring locations and infrequent ship observations see fig 3 to extend the range of t s profile observations assimilated our operational implementation of this system includes observations from sensors mounted on marine mammals grey and harbour seals 3 3 altimeter observations the ocean model component of foam shelf v9 is tidally driven and is forced by hourly atmospheric surface pressure and wind fields as a result the standard sla product assimilated in our global ocean model cannot be used because they contain adjustments to remove the tidal and high frequency atmospheric signals our previous shelf seas forecasting system foam shelf v8 therefore did not assimilate altimeter sla observations however through cmems cls collecte localisation satellites have recently made available an sla product specifically tailored to shelf seas systems which include the high frequency atmospheric signals and tides which are removed from the standard product these observations have previously been used by dobricic et al 2012 in the mediterranean sea and here we are using the european area version of the dataset with updated altimeter standards as described in pujol et al 2016 these have been made available for the jason 2 jason 3 cryosat 2 sentinel 3 and altika satellites all of which are assimilated in foam shelf v9 when available this level 3 data product provides the standard sla observations with an along track spacing of 7 km along with the tidal and atmospheric components which we have combined to provide a meaningful sla to match the physical processes affecting the sea level in our tidal model although there is limited coverage of sla measurements over a single day even from multiple satellites over 1 month the full domain is well sampled see fig 4 as with our other configurations we use the cnes cls09 mean dynamic topography mdt rio et al 2011 to calculate observations of the sea surface height ssh from the observed sla which can be compared to our model ssh fields as is also done for our global and basin scale ocean configurations we apply a slowly evolving bias correction to the sla observations to correct for errors in the mdt lea et al 2008 4 description of assimilation scheme the data assimilation component of foam shelf v9 uses nemovar in its 3d var fgat first guess at appropriate time configuration this is a multi variate multi lengthscale assimilation scheme which is developed in collaboration with centre europ√©en de recherche et de formation avanc√©e en calcul scientifique cerfacs the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique inria mogensen et al 2009 2012 waters et al 2015 there is no sea ice component in the foam shelf v9 system nemovar employs linearised balance relationships to account for correlations between ocean variables as defined in weaver et al 2005 temperature is treated in totality with balance relationships for other variables salinity ssh u and v velocities defined with respect to temperature the linearised balance relationships between increments to temperature t salinity s sea surface height Œ∑ and the u and v components of velocity u v can be summarised as follows 1 Œ¥ t Œ¥ t Œ¥ s k s t Œ¥ t Œ¥ s u Œ¥ Œ∑ k Œ∑ œÅ Œ¥ œÅ Œ¥ Œ∑ u Œ¥ u k u p Œ¥ p Œ¥ u u Œ¥ v k v p Œ¥ p Œ¥ v u where the subscript u denotes the unbalanced component of the variable the operators kij are linearised balance transforms from variable j to i the density œÅ and pressure p increments are then defined as 2 Œ¥ œÅ k œÅ t Œ¥ t k œÅ s Œ¥ s Œ¥ p k p œÅ Œ¥ œÅ k p Œ∑ Œ¥ Œ∑ the temperature salinity balance operator k s t is a linearised version of the water mass property conservation scheme of troccoli and haines 1999 the ssh balance operator k Œ∑ œÅ is a linearised version of the cooper and haines 1996 scheme in which ssh changes are associated with the lifting and lowering of the entire water column the velocity balance operators k uv p are based on the geostrophic relation density balance is the linearised equation of state and the pressure balance is the vertically integrated hydrostatic equation the background error covariance matrix is approximated using an estimate of the model variable variances and with a correlation model based on an implicitly formulated diffusion operator mirouze and weaver 2010 this uses a combination of a short and a long length scale to account for both internal ocean processes and larger scale effects from atmospheric forcing mirouze et al 2016 a comprehensive technical description of the nemovar implementation in a 0 25 global model foam global at the met office is provided by waters et al 2015 the remainder of this section will focus on the specific developments to this implementation of nemovar which were required to implement the assimilation of sst sla and t s profile observations in foam shelf v9 these include changes to the horizontal background error correlation length scales the vertical background error correlation parameterisation the use of a time averaged background field in the balance operator and relaxation of the criteria restricting when the full ssh balance is applied 4 1 background error covariances in foam shelf v9 the spatial covariance of the background errors is modelled using an implicit diffusion operator with the horizontal length scales specified a priori and the vertical length scales specified using a varying parameterisation the variances are specified using a combination of statistical estimates and parameterisations for each length scale we apply three 1d diffusion operators in the x y and z directions with interleaving of the diffusion iterations in the x and y directions which are multiplied by the pre defined 3d background error standard deviations in the horizontal we use two correlation length scales to represent mesoscale and synoptic scale ocean processes the longer length scale was set at 100 km to represent the larger scale barotropic errors while the shorter length scale is defined by the first baroclinic mode of the rossby radius of deformation to avoid applying increments on the grid scale we have applied a minimum value of 21 km to the short length scale the horizontal diffusion is currently applied along model levels this has the effect that in regions where the depth of the model levels varies rapidly e g the shelf slope there will be spurious vertical correlations between neighbouring model grid cells this will be addressed in future upgrades to the foam shelf system where we plan to introduce a bathymetry dependent correlation length scale the vertical correlation length scales are specified at the surface to be half the depth of the background mixed layer using the definition of kara et al 2000 decreasing with depth until at half the depth of the mixed layer and below they are set to the local vertical grid scale this parameterisation was chosen with the intention of minimising any spurious mixing of surface increments below the mixed layer these length scales are smoothed vertically to ensure a smooth function to determine the background error standard deviations associated with the two horizontal correlation length scales for surface temperature we used the innovation method of hollingsworth and l√∂nnberg 1986 with sst innovations from an existing reanalysis o dea et al 2017 the period 1991 2010 was chosen such that the sst observations were all from the esa cci reprocessing merchant et al 2014 and the background error standard deviations were calculated for each season separately since our reanalysis with the previous version of this system did not assimilate salinity or sla observations we were unable to use the same method to determine the background error standard deviations as we did for sst therefore for ssh we estimated the unbalanced component of the background error standard deviations to be 1 cm across the entire domain based on the spatial mean error for ssh in our other operational systems for surface salinity we have chosen to use an average value calculated over the nws domain from our global system as we found there was little seasonal variation in our estimates for this region the estimates for the global system were themselves calculated using the nmc method parrish and derber 1992 with 2 years of forecast fields and then scaled using the hollingsworth l√∂nnberg method estimated background error standard deviations martin et al 2007 the full 3d background error standard deviations for temperature and salinity are parameterised as follows the surface value is set by the estimate described above and a minimum value at each model level is defined by a tapered function of the surface value to introduce some flow dependence the vertical temperature salinity gradient is then calculated from the background field at all grid points below the mixed layer depth the background error standard deviation is defined as the larger of the tapered surface value or a parameterisation of the temperature salinity gradient d t d z Œ¥z where Œ¥z 20 m as described by waters et al 2015 this results in the largest errors occurring at the thermocline halocline allowing the observations to have greater weight to shift the depth of the thermocline halocline 4 2 observation errors in our implementation of nemovar observation errors are assumed to be uncorrelated we therefore need only define the spatially varying variances for each model variable in a similar way to the background errors we were able to use results from the reanalysis of o dea et al 2017 to calculate the sst observation error standard deviations using the innovation method of hollingsworth and l√∂nnberg 1986 however as we have not assimilated t s profiles or sla observations in this model configuration before we have chosen to use spatially constant observation errors for these types for all sla observations we have chosen to set an observation error of 4 cm throughout the domain this is approximately the spatial mean of the sla observation error used in our north atlantic 1 12 regional model which provides the lateral boundaries for this system and agrees well with estimates of ponte et al 2007 for mid to high latitudes however future work is required to refine these errors to account for the varying spatial resolution of different instruments and also because the sla observations for shelf regions contain different physical signals to those used for global ocean models for temperature and salinity profile observation errors we have chosen to use the seasonal average error at each depth for this region from our operational north atlantic model natl12 to do this for each season we calculated a mean profile of the specified t s observation error standard deviations from the z coordinate natl12 model and interpolated this onto the œÉ coordinate grid of foam shelf v9 the resulting errors for temperature salinity are approximately 0 6 k 0 15 psu at the surface reducing to 0 4 k 0 05 psu at 250 m and 0 05 k 0 01 psu at 2000 m 4 3 specific developments for profile assimilation for the assimilation of profile observations we have made two further developments to nemovar since the vertical coordinates used are not constant across the domain we have introduced a generalised vertical coordinate profile observation operator previously the observation operator used in our global configuration assumed each model level corresponded to a specific depth the tangent linear and adjoint version of this new profile observation operator now properly accounts for the varying depth of model levels also the underlying ocean model nemo v3 6 now employs a variable volume layer vvl resulting in variations in the depth of model levels due to the sea surface height we have therefore added to nemovar an initialisation of the vertical co ordinates defined by the background field 4 4 specific developments for sla assimilation in addition to the developments described above we have made two further specific developments to allow the assimilation of sla observations in foam shelf v9 we have altered the background field used in the balance operator and we have changed the criteria for defining when to make balanced changes to the ssh 4 4 1 background field used in the balance operator our assimilation scheme defines the balance between ocean variables with a balance operator which uses a background field due to the rapid variations in sea surface height during a single assimilation window 24 h an instantaneous background field is not an appropriate choice when assimilating sla observations corresponding to different tidal phases we have therefore chosen to use a mean model field with the average taken over 24 h 50 min approximating twice the period of the main semi diurnal components of the tidal signal in this way the balance operator uses a background field which is representative of the state throughout the assimilation window we note that the calculation of the innovations in the observation operator still uses the model fields at the nearest time step to the observation 4 4 2 ssh balance the assimilation of sla observations in foam shelf v9 is carried out in the same manner as in the global foam system as described by waters et al 2015 except for the criteria for applying balanced ssh increments the ssh is adjusted by applying barotropic unbalanced increments to the sea surface height and a baroclinic balanced component which acts on the density structure in our global system the full ssh balance is applied when the top to bottom temperature difference exceeds 10 c with a linear ramp to apply no balance when the difference is less than 5 c this has the effect of reducing the balanced temperature and salinity changes made when assimilating sla observations in regions of low stratification while these conservative settings work well in a global configuration they are overly restrictive for the nws domain as they exclude a large fraction of the domain as a result we have chosen to relax the criteria for applying the full balance when the top to bottom temperature difference exceeds 2 c with no balance applied where the difference is less than 1 c these values allow us to restrict the assimilation from applying balanced changes to the ssh in unstratified waters initial tests of this new system showed that these settings produced reasonable results at latitudes south of 60 n but northward of this where the stratification is weaker the assimilation scheme made unrealistic changes to the temperature and salinity structure as a result we have chosen to apply a latitude cut off so that no sla observations are assimilated northward of 60 n finally we also do not assimilate any sla observations in regions where the water depth is shallower than 700 m this relatively arbitrary depth was chosen to exclude the majority of the continental shelf region where the water column is often well mixed and where our existing sla assimilation scheme would be unable to make changes physically consistent with the other available observations although these restrictions on the use of sla observations in foam shelf v9 mean we do not use a large fraction of the available data they have allowed us to implement a simple system based on our existing global configuration which can be further developed further work will be required to enable our system to make better use of sla observations in unstratified regions 4 4 3 effect of tidal signal on innovations increments as discussed in section 3 3 foam shelf v9 includes a tidal model and the sla observations used here are supplied with a model estimate of the tidal signal in non tidal global models this estimate is used to remove the tidal component from the observations before assimilation but for foam shelf v9 we have retained the tidal signal in the observation to match the model processes however since the tidal signal is the dominant component of variations in the ssh especially in shallow water it is questionable whether it would be better to assimilate observations including or excluding the tidal signal this could be done by calculating innovations observations minus model differences either with the tidal signal included in both the observations and model values or excluded in both cases clearly there are errors involved in both approaches to remove the tidal signal from the observations requires the use of the supplied correction which is estimated using a separate global ocean tide model ray 1999 to remove the tides from our model values requires some time averaging of the model fields the error variances included in the calculation of innovations without tides which includes both observation errors and errors of representation can be summarised as follows 3 œµ o m œµ s s h n t o s s h m œµ o œµ g o t œµ n t m œµ m where observed values are represented by a superscript o and model values by a superscript m subscripts nt and t represent the non tidal and tidal components while the over bar represents a time average the error variance in the model estimated tidal signal supplied with the observations is represented by œµ got on the other hand retaining the tidal signal in the observations adds no additional error but there is still an error involved in the representation of the tides in our model 4 œµ o m œµ s s h o s s h m œµ o œµ m œµ o œµ n t m œµ t m the choice between the two methods therefore depends on the relative magnitude of the errors in the tidal model in our system œµ t m compared to the combined errors in the model used to detide the observations œµ got and the error in producing a tide free model equivalent by temporally averaging model fields œµ m we have performed tests using innovations where the tidal signal was retained in the observations and model and also using innovations where the tidal signal was removed from the observations with the supplied correction and from the model by taking a 24 8 h average however comparisons of the two approaches showed similar innovations and resulting increments we have therefore chosen the simpler approach of retaining the tidal signal in both the observation and the model but it may be useful to revisit this in the future especially when trying to assimilate sla observations in shallow water where the tides are much larger for instance the balance relationships currently used may not be ideally suited where tides are significant furthermore the background error covariances currently used for sla will require tuning before we come to assimilate sla observations in the shallow water regions 4 5 summary of changes compared to foam shelf v8 while the main difference in the assimilation scheme between foam shelf v8 and foam shelf v9 is the addition of the assimilation of profile and altimeter observations there have been a small number of other changes firstly the previous system assimilated only sst observations and was run as a 2d analysis these 2d increments were then applied in the iau incremental analysis update step the full increment was applied at the surface with a cosine taper down to the background mixed layer depth the new foam shelf v9 system instead calculates 3d fields of increments which are applied during the iau step the previous system employed a single background error correlation length scale which was parameterised based on the background potential vorticity this alleviated issues with the impact of observations erroneously spreading between distinct water masses the new foam shelf v9 system now uses the dual length scale formulation used in our global configuration mirouze et al 2016 this allows us to define a short length scale based on the rossby radius and a longer length scale to account for both small scale internal ocean physical processes and larger scale signals associated with atmospheric fluxes currently the potential vorticity parameterisation is not included in foam shelf v9 5 assessment 5 1 experimental setup to assess the impact of the data assimilation changes from foam shelf v8 to foam shelf v9 we have performed five experiments listed in table 1 all using the same ocean modelling component of v9 where only the method of assimilation and the observation types assimilated have been altered each of the experiments also has the same initial conditions surface and lateral boundary conditions and river inputs each experiment was run for two years covering the period 01 jan 2014 to 31 dec 2015 initial conditions for all experiments were taken from a 30 year reanalysis of the previous system o dea et al 2017 valid on 1st january 2014 while this provides a reasonable initial model state for the surface temperature the temperature and salinity below the mixed layer are not expected to be well constrained as the reanalysis assimilated only surface temperature observations however the lateral boundary conditions in all experiments come from our 1 12 north atlantic model which does assimilate sst sla and t s profile observations providing some constraint on the sub surface direct surface forcing fluxes were taken from the met office operational nwp system and climatological river run offs were used in experiment sst ctl we perform a 2d analysis of only sst observations as was done in the previous foam shelf v8 system in the iau step these 2d increments are added to the model temperature field with the full increment applied in the top model layer then using a cosine taper the increment applied is reduced to zero below the mixed layer also sst ctl uses only a single length scale for the background error correlations this length scale has a maximum of 130 km with a parameterisation based on the background potential vorticity to limit spreading across dynamically separate water masses in experiment sst new again we assimilate only sst observations but in this experiment use our new foam shelf v9 assimilation scheme in the iau step 3d increments are applied to the 3d temperature salinity and u and v velocity fields along with the 2d increments to the sea surface height field a comparison of sst ctl with sst new therefore allows us to investigate the impact of switching from a 2d to a fully 3d analysis in the all new experiment we again use the new foam shelf v9 assimilation scheme and assimilate sst sla and in situ t s profile observations two further experiments were run to investigate the impact of adding each new observation type separately sst sla new and sst ts new except for the observations assimilated all settings are identical between sst new sst sla new sst ts new and all new experiments 5 1 1 metrics for assessment for each experiment we show similar plots of statistics calculated from the differences between observation values and their model equivalent values innovations for sst sla and t s profile observations while these statistics are not fully independent since the various experiments assimilate some or all of these observation types the statistics are calculated using the model background before assimilation the domain averaged innovation statistics for each experiment are detailed in table 2 5 2 impact of the 3d assimilation scheme by comparing the sst ctl and sst new experiments we can assess the impact of changing from the previous 2d assimilation scheme to the new full 3d scheme without the complication of a change in the observations assimilated a small reduction in the rmse of the sst innovations is found in the sst new experiment compared to sst ctl see table 2 unfortunately however the temperature profile innovation statistics show that in the top 500 m immediately below the surface there is a marked increase in the rmse and bias see fig 5 no significant impact is seen in the salinity profile innovation statistics but there is also a small degradation in the sla innovation bias and rmse detailed in table 2 which is presumably an impact of the density change resulting from the temperature bias this sub surface temperature bias introduced by the 3d assimilation scheme appears to vary in magnitude seasonally and has also been found to affect the global configuration of our system to better understand the source of this sub surface bias a short experiment was performed which assimilated idealised innovations of equal magnitude but opposite sign in alternate assimilation cycles ideally this test would introduce some additional noise but would not lead to a bias however averaged over 1 month this produced a negative mean surface increment and a positive mean subsurface increment as we found in sst new and which manifests as an increase in the temperature profile rmse and bias fig 5 this appears to result from the asymmetric effect of positive and negative increments on the vertical temperature structure whereby a negative surface innovation weakens the stratification and so deepens the mixed layer and then a subsequent positive surface innovation is projected deeper as will be shown in the next section the assimilation of profile observations ameliorates this effect even where the profile observations are sparse further testing has shown that this sub surface bias can be reduced by increasing the sst observation errors without a degradation in the fit to observations suggesting we may be over fitting the sst observations and by using a mixed layer depth field averaged over several cycles in our background error parameterisation this is an area of active investigation and a solution has not yet been selected for implementation in our operational system 5 3 impact of profile observations comparing the sst new and sst ts new experiments allows us to separate the impact of adding the assimilation of t s profiles within the new system there is no appreciable difference in sst statistics see table 2 which is to be expected given the existing coverage of surface temperature observations however there is a clear impact on the subsurface with a reduction of 35 28 in the rmse for temperature salinity as well as a substantial reduction in bias at almost all depths see fig 6 green to red lines importantly the sub surface bias seen when assimilating only sst observations has been substantially removed however these observation minus background statistics are limited to the regions where observations exist see fig 3 and so we cannot be sure of the reduction in bias in all areas times especially in the shallow shelf waters to reiterate these statistics use the difference between the observed values and the model equivalent before assimilation although the assimilation of t s profiles has a significant positive impact on the comparison with in situ measurements of the temperature and salinity there is a mixed impact on the sla top panel fig 7 while there is a modest improvement in the sla rmse in shallow water regions there is an overall degradation in the sla innovation rmse in deeper regions this suggests that there could be some inconsistency between the observations of the sea surface height and the changes to the vertical density structure made when assimilating t s profiles however we note that our bias correction scheme to correct errors in the mdt is only applied when assimilating sla observations so any errors in the mdt will affect comparisons with sla observations although we expect this to be a small effect 5 4 impact of altimeter observations the impact on the 3d temperature and salinity of assimilating sla observations varies depending on whether profile observations are also assimilated see fig 6 as mentioned previously since the assimilation of sla observations introduces changes to the density structure below the mixed layer it would be expected that sla assimilation would not perform as well when the t s structure is not already well constrained as also seen by lea et al 2014 comparing the sst new to the sst sla new experiment both without t s profile assimilation fig 6 green to blue lines there is a mixed impact on the temperature profile statistics when adding the assimilation of sla observations more strikingly there is a significant increase in the salinity bias in the upper few hundred metres however although there is a small degradation in the temperature profile innovation statistics between the sst ts new and all new both with assimilation of t s profiles fig 6 red to black lines there is little difference for salinity there is also a mixed impact of the assimilation of sla observations on the sla innovation statistics see fig 7 compared to the experiment assimilating only sst observations adding profile assimilation degrades the sla rmse significantly in the deep parts of the domain but has a smaller positive impact in the shallow regions top panel meanwhile combining the assimilation of sst and sla reduces the sla rmse in the deep regions where sla observations are assimilated but introduces a smaller degradation in shallow water regions middle panel perhaps due to spurious correlations between changes in the deeper parts of the domain which then propagate onto the shelf finally when adding both profile and sla assimilation bottom panel the positive and negative impacts of the assimilation developments on the sla statistics approximately cancel one another but importantly the significant improvements on the t s profile innovation statistics are retained see fig 6 and the representation of surface currents is improved see section 5 5 1 5 5 full impact of assimilation changes finally we will assess the overall impact of changing from the previous assimilation scheme used in foam shelf v8 to the new scheme assimilating all observations in foam shelf v9 as there were only minor changes made to the ocean model component between these versions this combination of experiments is the most relevant to our operational system as it demonstrates the impact of all the assimilation changes this is important as the impact of each observation type can depend on the presence or lack of other observation types for example we would expect improved results from assimilating altimeter observations when the sub surface is well constrained i e where we also assimilate profile observations the new assimilation scheme and the extra observation types assimilated result in only a small improvement in the sst rmse throughout the period see fig 8 given the large number of sst observations assimilated in both experiments it is unsurprising that additional sub surface temperature measurements along with salinity and sla make little difference to the overall quality of the surface temperature analyses however the assimilation changes have a large positive impact of the sub surface where there is a large reduction in the temperature rmse below 100 m and in the bias below 500 m see fig 9 for salinity there is also a clear reduction in the rmse and bias at almost all depths domain averaged time series of sla innovation statistics show little discernible impact of these assimilation developments but this masks the spatially varying impact on the sla innovations see fig 10 while the sla rmse is degraded in shallow water regions further from the coast a reduction in the rmse is apparent although there cannot be said to be a clear improvement or degradation overall it appears that the rmse has been reduced in the deeper part of the domain where sla observations are assimilated and the rmse has increased in the shallow water regions where no sla observations were assimilated the improvement from sst ctl to all new is shown in more detail in figs 11 and 12 while it is clear that the temperature rmse in particular has a seasonal variation in the upper ocean for both temperature and salinity there is rapid reduction in the rmse at all levels by the second year the experiment assimilating all observation types all new appears to be stable having corrected a number of gross errors present in the previous system sst ctl however it should be noted that these observation minus background statistics do not give a complete picture as the spatial and temporal sampling of in situ profile observations is incomplete especially in the shallow shelf waters overall the rmse for the temperature and salinity profile innovations have both been reduced by over 25 see table 2 but without more observations we cannot be sure of the impact in the northern north sea especially where there are very few in situ profiles fig 3 5 5 1 impact on the velocity field finally the assimilation developments described here also have a noticeable impact on the dynamical evolution of the foam shelf system monthly averaged fields of surface currents show a significant increase in variability and in the presence of eddies in fig 13 we show a comparison of the mean surface currents from january 2015 the second year of our experiments from the sst ctl and all new experiments with two observation derived current products globcurrent v3 0 rio et al 2014 and oscar bonjean and lagerloef 2002 only the geostrophic component of the 0 25 globcurrent product is shown although a globcurrent product which combines the geostrophic and ekman components is available the ekman component in this region was found to be very smooth and anomalously high 0 2 m s we therefore show the geostrophic only product to aid comparison of features between the observations and model output the oscar product is shown at 1 3 resolution and combines both the geostrophic and ekman components of the surface current the tidal currents in the english channel and irish sea seen in the observational products are not apparent in the mean surface currents from our experiments as they have been calculated from a series of 25 hourly averages while many of the main currents in the model fields are little changed between sst ctl and all new in the deep western parts of the domain we see an increase in the number and strength of eddies which agrees better with the observations this corresponds to the region where we assimilate altimeter sla observations suggesting that the surface current features resolved by the altimeter observations are being introduced by the assimilation in the near future various techniques for validating the currents predicted by foam shelf will be compared 6 conclusions and future developments the previous version of the met office operational shelf seas forecasting system foam shelf v8 assimilated only sst observations to address known biases in that system we have developed the assimilation scheme in order to make use of the available in situ temperature and salinity profile observations and satellite measurements of the sea level anomaly in particular newly available altimeter observations which retain atmospheric and tidal signals provide physically appropriate observations for assimilation into our ocean model and are now assimilated in deep water regions 700 m southward of 60 n we have updated the assimilation scheme used in foam shelf v9 to work with œÉ coordinates modified the background field used in the balance relationships to use a mean field over the assimilation window adapted the criteria compared to our global configuration used when applying ssh balance to be appropriate for the region of the nws and we have investigated the impact of removing or retaining the tidal signal in the observations and model when calculating the ssh innovations several experiments have been performed assimilating different combinations of observation types to identify the benefits delivered by each type and understand how they work in combination through this we have identified an issue with the vertical propagation of sst increments that can lead to a subsurface bias however this is ameliorated by the assimilation of in situ temperature profiles and when assimilating all observation types there is a significant improvement compared to the previous system the assimilation of in situ t s profiles results in a large improvement in the rmse of innovations for subsurface temperature and salinity correcting the biases which motivated this work the assimilation of sla observations has also been shown to reduce the sla rmse in some cases and introduces realistic eddying features however work remains to be done to understand how to maximise this improvement when assimilating profile and altimeter observations together overall these assimilation developments have reduced significant errors in our operational analyses and provide a solid base system from which to improve the use of the various observation types available in the near future we plan to investigate how we can make more use of the available altimeter observations particularly in seasonally stratified regions on the shelf and at high latitudes furthermore to make better use of the available observations we plan to modify our background error parameterisation to avoid spreading the influence of observations along model levels with large changes in depth i e near steep bathymetry we are also trying to identify additional near real time observations to expand the number and coverage of in situ temperature and salinity profiles finally we have begun developing the assimilation component for a 1 5 km resolution version of foam shelf graham et al 2017 which is planned to become operational during 2018 this presents several challenges including matching the resolution of features in the observations and model but will provide a step change in our ability to resolve dynamical features such as meso scale eddies internal

24084,the quality of a short term ocean forecast relies on its initialisation however operational shelf seas forecasting systems tend to assimilate fewer observation types than non tidal global systems for shelf seas systems the challenge is to incorporate observations into the 3d ocean state within a model with complex vertical coordinates and large amplitude variations in the sea surface height due to tides in this paper we describe the first use of altimeter and in situ profile observations to improve the initialisation of an operational shelf seas forecasting system foam shelf v9 is a 7 km horizontal resolution ocean model covering the european north west shelf nws seas we have adapted our assimilation scheme in this system to account for spatially and temporally varying vertical coordinates throughout the domain there is now assimilation of in situ profile measurements of temperature and salinity and satellite and in situ sea surface temperature observations additionally in deep water regions 700 m southward of 60 n the system assimilates newly available altimeter observations tailored for use in coastal models with this new system gross biases are significantly reduced the sub surface root mean square rms temperature and salinity errors are reduced by 25 and there is an increase in the number of eddying structures providing a better qualitative match to observation

met office provides operational forecasts of physical and biogeochemical variables for this dynamically diverse region including 3d temperature and salinity sea surface height ssh ocean currents chlorophyll concentration and visibility the previous met office operational system foam shelf v8 was implemented in late 2012 o dea et al 2017 the assimilation component of this system used only sea surface temperature sst observations to improve the modelled ocean state while this helps to constrain known surface temperature biases in stratified regions biases in the sub surface temperature are relatively unconstrained additionally since foam shelf v8 assimilated no salinity observations the surface and sub surface salinity were constrained only by the boundary conditions and forcing fields these biases which are discussed in detail in o dea et al 2017 provided the motivation for the assimilation developments described here in this article we will present the developments made to implement the assimilation of profile and altimeter observations in foam shelf v9 the new shelf seas forecasting system used operationally at the met office since april 2017 while the assimilation of sst in situ profiles and sea level anomaly sla observations has become routine in many global ocean forecasting systems martin et al 2015 operational shelf seas systems have not in general assimilated all of these observation types this has been due to a number of issues including the complex vertical co ordinate systems often used in coastal systems the mismatch between the cadence of observations and actual shelf dynamics and the filtering of tidal and atmospheric signals from existing altimeter products however several coastal ocean systems have demonstrated the use of these and other observation types using 4d var assimilation schemes kurapov et al 2011 and song et al 2016 assimilate sst and sla observations in non tidal coastal models a number of coastal ocean systems also assimilate high frequency hf radar measurements of surface currents e g yu et al 2012 kerry et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 have also demonstrated the use of 4d var for assimilating sst temperature and salinity t s profile and hf radar observations into a tidal model of the new york bight in a pre operational system zhuang et al 2011 used a univariate 3d var scheme to demonstrate the positive impact of assimilating t s profiles in the danish meteorological institute s coastal model of the baltic and north seas the existing cmems operational 1 36 iberia biscay ireland ibi ocean forecasting system has no direct data assimilation component sotillo et al 2015 however the cmems 1 12 ibi physical reanalysis system assimilates sst observations t s profiles and satellite sla observations both of these systems include tides and are forced by atmospheric pressure but the sla observations used have had the atmospheric and tidal signals removed finally dobricic et al 2012 have shown improved innovation statistics when assimilating sla observations which retain the inverse barometer effect in a non tidal ocean model which is forced by atmospheric pressure the met office operational ocean forecasting systems use a 3d var data assimilation scheme known as nemovar mogensen et al 2009 2012 waters et al 2015 this multivariate scheme employs balance relationships between the state variables that allow for balanced increments to the temperature salinity ssh and velocity fields the previous met office shelf seas forecasting system foam shelf v8 assimilated only sst observations by performing a 2d analysis of the innovations the resulting 2d increments were applied to the model using a cosine taper from the surface down to the base of the instantaneous mixed layer foam shelf v9 now assimilates temperature and salinity profile and sla observations in addition to sst observations and balanced 3d increments to the temperature salinity ssh and velocity fields are calculated by nemovar as is done for the global system the next section will provide an overview of the updated nws forecasting system including a brief description of the ocean model section 3 details the observations assimilated and the observation bias correction schemes section 4 will then describe the assimilation scheme including the developments made to implement the assimilation of profile and

ostseeforschung warnem√ºnde operational system gr√§we et al 2015 the natl12 model assimilates sst sla and t s profiles and is itself nested within the met office global 1 4 system surface forcing is provided by the met office operational numerical weather prediction nwp forecasting system the domain shown in fig 1 extends from 40 n 20 w to 65 n 13 e on a regular latitude longitude grid covering the north west european shelf and part of the north east atlantic ocean with a resolution of 1 15 latitude by 1 9 longitude giving a horizontal resolution of 7 km this area has a complex bathymetry containing regions of shallow water a continental shelf and regions of deep ocean depth 5000 m the resulting dynamics due to tidal mixing and the seasonal variation in wind strength and solar irradiation lead to seasonally stratified and well mixed regions with marked boundaries wind forcing and atmospheric pressure changes can produce storm surges and the internal ocean dynamics produce mesoscale eddies and fronts an important aspect of the physical model which distinguishes it from our global and basin scale ocean configurations is the vertical co ordinate system in this domain we use the œÉ coordinate defined by siddorn and furner 2013 which has a fixed surface vertical resolution tapering to terrain following levels at depth the assimilation component of foam shelf v9 uses nemovar version 3 waters et al 2015 with a 24 h assimilation window during a single analysis cycle the sst observations are first bias corrected using a reference data set of in situ sst measurements described in section 3 1 then during the observation operator step a model forecast is run and model equivalent background values produced for each observation at the appropriate time and position next the assimilation system calculates multi variate increments temperature salinity u and v velocities and sea surface height based on the observation model differences by minimising a 3d var cost function finally the model forecast is rerun for the same period and a fraction of the increments are added onto the model fields at each time step bloom et al 1996 incremental analysis update 3 observations the observations assimilated in foam shelf v9 include satellite and in situ observations of the sea surface temperature sst in situ temperature and salinity t s profile measurements and satellite altimeter observations of the sea level anomaly sla the bias correction and assimilation scheme will be described in more detail in sections 3 and 4 3 1 sst observations the in situ sst observations assimilated in foam shelf v9 include observations from ships surface drifters and moorings these data are distributed over the gts global telecommunication system in near real time nrt we also assimilate l2p l3c satellite observations of sst available from the group for high resolution sea surface temperature ghrsst donlon et al 2009 these observations have resolution of up to 1 km but are subsampled to approximately 5 km to reduce data volumes in addition to sst observations from noaa avhrr metop avhrr and seviri which were assimilated in the previous version of the system we now also assimilate observations from viirs and amsr2 however the hindcast experiments described in this article used only the satellite sst observations from noaa avhrr metop avhrr and seviri the average density of sst observations in our experiments is shown in fig 2 where clouds in the northern parts of the domain significantly affect the coverage of satellite observations this reduced coverage has been improved in the operational system due to the use of the microwave amsr2 observations in common with our other ocean configurations and the ostia sst analysis donlon et al 2012 the sst observations are filtered to remove those which do not reflect the foundation sst i e those which are influenced by diurnal warming this is done by removing daytime observations with wind speeds below 6 m s as was done in the previous system and in our global ocean forecasting system these satellite sst observations are then bias corrected before assimilation see donlon et al 2012 the assumption is that satellite observations of sst are biased due to large scale errors in the atmospheric conditions which are used in the conversion from measured brightness temperature to an estimate of the sst to bias correct the satellite measurements we first define a reference set of presumed unbiased observations from the highest quality in situ sst observations we then create observations of the bias by matching up the reference observations with satellite observations within fixed distances and times 25 km and 1 day apart with these observations of the bias we then perform a 2d analysis to update the previous day s bias field to represent the scales of synoptic weather patterns while accounting for the relatively low number of available reference observations this analysis uses a single horizontal length scale of 7 and is done separately for each satellite the bias at each observation location is then removed from each observation before assimilation 3 2 temperature salinity profiles the in situ temperature and salinity t s profiles assimilated in foam shelf v9 include observations made by ships fixed moored arrays gliders xbts ctds and observations from argo profiling floats all of these observations are available in nrt over the gts in this domain the coverage of temperature and salinity profiles over a single day is low the fleet of argo profilers provides useful coverage over the deep parts of the domain but currently on shelf observations are limited to a few fixed mooring locations and infrequent ship observations see fig 3 to extend the range of t s profile observations assimilated our operational implementation of this system includes observations from sensors mounted on marine mammals grey and harbour seals 3 3 altimeter observations the ocean model component of foam shelf v9 is tidally driven and is forced by hourly atmospheric surface pressure and wind fields as a result the standard sla product assimilated in our global ocean model cannot be used because they contain adjustments to remove the tidal and high frequency atmospheric signals our previous shelf seas forecasting system foam shelf v8 therefore did not assimilate altimeter sla observations however through cmems cls collecte localisation satellites have recently made available an sla product specifically tailored to shelf seas systems which include the high frequency atmospheric signals and tides which are removed from the standard product these observations have previously been used by dobricic et al 2012 in the mediterranean sea and here we are using the european area version of the dataset with updated altimeter standards as described in pujol et al 2016 these have been made available for the jason 2 jason 3 cryosat 2 sentinel 3 and altika satellites all of which are assimilated in foam shelf v9 when available this level 3 data product provides the standard sla observations with an along track spacing of 7 km along with the tidal and atmospheric components which we have combined to provide a meaningful sla to match the physical processes affecting the sea level in our tidal model although there is limited coverage of sla measurements over a single day even from multiple satellites over 1 month the full domain is well sampled see fig 4 as with our other configurations we use the cnes cls09 mean dynamic topography mdt rio et al 2011 to calculate observations of the sea surface height ssh from the observed sla which can be compared to our model ssh fields as is also done for our global and basin scale ocean configurations we apply a slowly evolving bias correction to the sla observations to correct for errors in the mdt lea et al 2008 4 description of assimilation scheme the data assimilation component of foam shelf v9 uses nemovar in its 3d var fgat first guess at appropriate time configuration this is a multi variate multi lengthscale assimilation scheme which is developed in collaboration with centre europ√©en de recherche et de formation avanc√©e en calcul scientifique cerfacs the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique inria mogensen et al 2009 2012 waters et al 2015 there is no sea ice component in the foam shelf v9 system nemovar employs linearised balance relationships to account for correlations between ocean variables as defined in weaver et al 2005 temperature is treated in totality with balance relationships for other variables salinity ssh u and v velocities defined with respect to temperature the linearised balance relationships between increments to temperature t salinity s sea surface height Œ∑ and the u and v components of velocity u v can be summarised as follows 1 Œ¥ t Œ¥ t Œ¥ s k s t Œ¥ t Œ¥ s u Œ¥ Œ∑ k Œ∑ œÅ Œ¥ œÅ Œ¥ Œ∑ u Œ¥ u k u p Œ¥ p Œ¥ u u Œ¥ v k v p Œ¥ p Œ¥ v u where the subscript u denotes the unbalanced component of the variable the operators kij are linearised balance transforms from variable j to i the density œÅ and pressure p increments are then defined as 2 Œ¥ œÅ k œÅ t Œ¥ t k œÅ s Œ¥ s Œ¥ p k p œÅ Œ¥ œÅ k p Œ∑ Œ¥ Œ∑ the temperature salinity balance operator k s t is a linearised version of the water mass property conservation scheme of troccoli and haines 1999 the ssh balance operator k Œ∑ œÅ is a linearised version of the cooper and haines 1996 scheme in which ssh changes are associated with the lifting and lowering of the entire water column the velocity balance operators k uv p are based on the geostrophic relation density balance is the linearised equation of state and the pressure balance is the vertically integrated hydrostatic equation the background error covariance matrix is approximated using an estimate of the model variable variances and with a correlation model based on an implicitly formulated diffusion operator mirouze and weaver 2010 this uses a combination of a short and a long length scale to account for both internal ocean processes and larger scale effects from atmospheric forcing mirouze et al 2016 a comprehensive technical description of the nemovar implementation in a 0 25 global model foam global at the met office is provided by waters et al 2015 the remainder of this section will focus on the specific developments to this implementation of nemovar which were required to implement the assimilation of sst sla and t s profile observations in foam shelf v9 these include changes to the horizontal background error correlation length scales the vertical background error correlation parameterisation the use of a time averaged background field in the balance operator and relaxation of the criteria restricting when the full ssh balance is applied 4 1 background error covariances in foam shelf v9 the spatial covariance of the background errors is modelled using an implicit diffusion operator with the horizontal length scales specified a priori and the vertical length scales specified using a varying parameterisation the variances are specified using a combination of statistical estimates and parameterisations for each length scale we apply three 1d diffusion operators in the x y and z directions with interleaving of the diffusion iterations in the x and y directions which are multiplied by the pre defined 3d background error standard deviations in the horizontal we use two correlation length scales to represent mesoscale and synoptic scale ocean processes the longer length scale was set at 100 km to represent the larger scale barotropic errors while the shorter length scale is defined by the first baroclinic mode of the rossby radius of deformation to avoid applying increments on the grid scale we have applied a minimum value of 21 km to the short length scale the horizontal diffusion is currently applied along model levels this has the effect that in regions where the depth of the model levels varies rapidly e g the shelf slope there will be spurious vertical correlations between neighbouring model grid cells this will be addressed in future upgrades to the foam shelf system where we plan to introduce a bathymetry dependent correlation length scale the vertical correlation length scales are specified at the surface to be half the depth of the background mixed layer using the definition of kara et al 2000 decreasing with depth until at half the depth of the mixed layer and below they are set to the local vertical grid scale this parameterisation was chosen with the intention of minimising any spurious mixing of surface increments below the mixed layer these length scales are smoothed vertically to ensure a smooth function to determine the background error standard deviations associated with the two horizontal correlation length scales for surface temperature we used the innovation method of hollingsworth and l√∂nnberg 1986 with sst innovations from an existing reanalysis o dea et al 2017 the period 1991 2010 was chosen such that the sst observations were all from the esa cci reprocessing merchant et al 2014 and the background error standard deviations were calculated for each season separately since our reanalysis with the previous version of this system did not assimilate salinity or sla observations we were unable to use the same method to determine the background error standard deviations as we did for sst therefore for ssh we estimated the unbalanced component of the background error standard deviations to be 1 cm across the entire domain based on the spatial mean error for ssh in our other operational systems for surface salinity we have chosen to use an average value calculated over the nws domain from our global system as we found there was little seasonal variation in our estimates for this region the estimates for the global system were themselves calculated using the nmc method parrish and derber 1992 with 2 years of forecast fields and then scaled using the hollingsworth l√∂nnberg method estimated background error standard deviations martin et al 2007 the full 3d background error standard deviations for temperature and salinity are parameterised as follows the surface value is set by the estimate described above and a minimum value at each model level is defined by a tapered function of the surface value to introduce some flow dependence the vertical temperature salinity gradient is then calculated from the background field at all grid points below the mixed layer depth the background error standard deviation is defined as the larger of the tapered surface value or a parameterisation of the temperature salinity gradient d t d z Œ¥z where Œ¥z 20 m as described by waters et al 2015 this results in the largest errors occurring at the thermocline halocline allowing the observations to have greater weight to shift the depth of the thermocline halocline 4 2 observation errors in our implementation of nemovar observation errors are assumed to be uncorrelated we therefore need only define the spatially varying variances for each model variable in a similar way to the background errors we were able to use results from the reanalysis of o dea et al 2017 to calculate the sst observation error standard deviations using the innovation method of hollingsworth and l√∂nnberg 1986 however as we have not assimilated t s profiles or sla observations in this model configuration before we have chosen to use spatially constant observation errors for these types for all sla observations we have chosen to set an observation error of 4 cm throughout the domain this is approximately the spatial mean of the sla observation error used in our north atlantic 1 12 regional model which provides the lateral boundaries for this system and agrees well with estimates of ponte et al 2007 for mid to high latitudes however future work is required to refine these errors to account for the varying spatial resolution of different instruments and also because the sla observations for shelf regions contain different physical signals to those used for global ocean models for temperature and salinity profile observation errors we have chosen to use the seasonal average error at each depth for this region from our operational north atlantic model natl12 to do this for each season we calculated a mean profile of the specified t s observation error standard deviations from the z coordinate natl12 model and interpolated this onto the œÉ coordinate grid of foam shelf v9 the resulting errors for temperature salinity are approximately 0 6 k 0 15 psu at the surface reducing to 0 4 k 0 05 psu at 250 m and 0 05 k 0 01 psu at 2000 m 4 3 specific developments for profile assimilation for the assimilation of profile observations we have made two further developments to nemovar since the vertical coordinates used are not constant across the domain we have introduced a generalised vertical coordinate profile observation operator previously the observation operator used in our global configuration assumed each model level corresponded to a specific depth the tangent linear and adjoint version of this new profile observation operator now properly accounts for the varying depth of model levels also the underlying ocean model nemo v3 6 now employs a variable volume layer vvl resulting in variations in the depth of model levels due to the sea surface height we have therefore added to nemovar an initialisation of the vertical co ordinates defined by the background field 4 4 specific developments for sla assimilation in addition to the developments described above we have made two further specific developments to allow the assimilation of sla observations in foam shelf v9 we have altered the background field used in the balance operator and we have changed the criteria for defining when to make balanced changes to the ssh 4 4 1 background field used in the balance operator our assimilation scheme defines the balance between ocean variables with a balance operator which uses a background field due to the rapid variations in sea surface height during a single assimilation window 24 h an instantaneous background field is not an appropriate choice when assimilating sla observations corresponding to different tidal phases we have therefore chosen to use a mean model field with the average taken over 24 h 50 min approximating twice the period of the main semi diurnal components of the tidal signal in this way the balance operator uses a background field which is representative of the state throughout the assimilation window we note that the calculation of the innovations in the observation operator still uses the model fields at the nearest time step to the observation 4 4 2 ssh balance the assimilation of sla observations in foam shelf v9 is carried out in the same manner as in the global foam system as described by waters et al 2015 except for the criteria for applying balanced ssh increments the ssh is adjusted by applying barotropic unbalanced increments to the sea surface height and a baroclinic balanced component which acts on the density structure in our global system the full ssh balance is applied when the top to bottom temperature difference exceeds 10 c with a linear ramp to apply no balance when the difference is less than 5 c this has the effect of reducing the balanced temperature and salinity changes made when assimilating sla observations in regions of low stratification while these conservative settings work well in a global configuration they are overly restrictive for the nws domain as they exclude a large fraction of the domain as a result we have chosen to relax the criteria for applying the full balance when the top to bottom temperature difference exceeds 2 c with no balance applied where the difference is less than 1 c these values allow us to restrict the assimilation from applying balanced changes to the ssh in unstratified waters initial tests of this new system showed that these settings produced reasonable results at latitudes south of 60 n but northward of this where the stratification is weaker the assimilation scheme made unrealistic changes to the temperature and salinity structure as a result we have chosen to apply a latitude cut off so that no sla observations are assimilated northward of 60 n finally we also do not assimilate any sla observations in regions where the water depth is shallower than 700 m this relatively arbitrary depth was chosen to exclude the majority of the continental shelf region where the water column is often well mixed and where our existing sla assimilation scheme would be unable to make changes physically consistent with the other available observations although these restrictions on the use of sla observations in foam shelf v9 mean we do not use a large fraction of the available data they have allowed us to implement a simple system based on our existing global configuration which can be further developed further work will be required to enable our system to make better use of sla observations in unstratified regions 4 4 3 effect of tidal signal on innovations increments as discussed in section 3 3 foam shelf v9 includes a tidal model and the sla observations used here are supplied with a model estimate of the tidal signal in non tidal global models this estimate is used to remove the tidal component from the observations before assimilation but for foam shelf v9 we have retained the tidal signal in the observation to match the model processes however since the tidal signal is the dominant component of variations in the ssh especially in shallow water it is questionable whether it would be better to assimilate observations including or excluding the tidal signal this could be done by calculating innovations observations minus model differences either with the tidal signal included in both the observations and model values or excluded in both cases clearly there are errors involved in both approaches to remove the tidal signal from the observations requires the use of the supplied correction which is estimated using a separate global ocean tide model ray 1999 to remove the tides from our model values requires some time averaging of the model fields the error variances included in the calculation of innovations without tides which includes both observation errors and errors of representation can be summarised as follows 3 œµ o m œµ s s h n t o s s h m œµ o œµ g o t œµ n t m œµ m where observed values are represented by a superscript o and model values by a superscript m subscripts nt and t represent the non tidal and tidal components while the over bar represents a time average the error variance in the model estimated tidal signal supplied with the observations is represented by œµ got on the other hand retaining the tidal signal in the observations adds no additional error but there is still an error involved in the representation of the tides in our model 4 œµ o m œµ s s h o s s h m œµ o œµ m œµ o œµ n t m œµ t m the choice between the two methods therefore depends on the relative magnitude of the errors in the tidal model in our system œµ t m compared to the combined errors in the model used to detide the observations œµ got and the error in producing a tide free model equivalent by temporally averaging model fields œµ m we have performed tests using innovations where the tidal signal was retained in the observations and model and also using innovations where the tidal signal was removed from the observations with the supplied correction and from the model by taking a 24 8 h average however comparisons of the two approaches showed similar innovations and resulting increments we have therefore chosen the simpler approach of retaining the tidal signal in both the observation and the model but it may be useful to revisit this in the future especially when trying to assimilate sla observations in shallow water where the tides are much larger for instance the balance relationships currently used may not be ideally suited where tides are significant furthermore the background error covariances currently used for sla will require tuning before we come to assimilate sla observations in the shallow water regions 4 5 summary of changes compared to foam shelf v8 while the main difference in the assimilation scheme between foam shelf v8 and foam shelf v9 is the addition of the assimilation of profile and altimeter observations there have been a small number of other changes firstly the previous system assimilated only sst observations and was run as a 2d analysis these 2d increments were then applied in the iau incremental analysis update step the full increment was applied at the surface with a cosine taper down to the background mixed layer depth the new foam shelf v9 system instead calculates 3d fields of increments which are applied during the iau step the previous system employed a single background error correlation length scale which was parameterised based on the background potential vorticity this alleviated issues with the impact of observations erroneously spreading between distinct water masses the new foam shelf v9 system now uses the dual length scale formulation used in our global configuration mirouze et al 2016 this allows us to define a short length scale based on the rossby radius and a longer length scale to account for both small scale internal ocean physical processes and larger scale signals associated with atmospheric fluxes currently the potential vorticity parameterisation is not included in foam shelf v9 5 assessment 5 1 experimental setup to assess the impact of the data assimilation changes from foam shelf v8 to foam shelf v9 we have performed five experiments listed in table 1 all using the same ocean modelling component of v9 where only the method of assimilation and the observation types assimilated have been altered each of the experiments also has the same initial conditions surface and lateral boundary conditions and river inputs each experiment was run for two years covering the period 01 jan 2014 to 31 dec 2015 initial conditions for all experiments were taken from a 30 year reanalysis of the previous system o dea et al 2017 valid on 1st january 2014 while this provides a reasonable initial model state for the surface temperature the temperature and salinity below the mixed layer are not expected to be well constrained as the reanalysis assimilated only surface temperature observations however the lateral boundary conditions in all experiments come from our 1 12 north atlantic model which does assimilate sst sla and t s profile observations providing some constraint on the sub surface direct surface forcing fluxes were taken from the met office operational nwp system and climatological river run offs were used in experiment sst ctl we perform a 2d analysis of only sst observations as was done in the previous foam shelf v8 system in the iau step these 2d increments are added to the model temperature field with the full increment applied in the top model layer then using a cosine taper the increment applied is reduced to zero below the mixed layer also sst ctl uses only a single length scale for the background error correlations this length scale has a maximum of 130 km with a parameterisation based on the background potential vorticity to limit spreading across dynamically separate water masses in experiment sst new again we assimilate only sst observations but in this experiment use our new foam shelf v9 assimilation scheme in the iau step 3d increments are applied to the 3d temperature salinity and u and v velocity fields along with the 2d increments to the sea surface height field a comparison of sst ctl with sst new therefore allows us to investigate the impact of switching from a 2d to a fully 3d analysis in the all new experiment we again use the new foam shelf v9 assimilation scheme and assimilate sst sla and in situ t s profile observations two further experiments were run to investigate the impact of adding each new observation type separately sst sla new and sst ts new except for the observations assimilated all settings are identical between sst new sst sla new sst ts new and all new experiments 5 1 1 metrics for assessment for each experiment we show similar plots of statistics calculated from the differences between observation values and their model equivalent values innovations for sst sla and t s profile observations while these statistics are not fully independent since the various experiments assimilate some or all of these observation types the statistics are calculated using the model background before assimilation the domain averaged innovation statistics for each experiment are detailed in table 2 5 2 impact of the 3d assimilation scheme by comparing the sst ctl and sst new experiments we can assess the impact of changing from the previous 2d assimilation scheme to the new full 3d scheme without the complication of a change in the observations assimilated a small reduction in the rmse of the sst innovations is found in the sst new experiment compared to sst ctl see table 2 unfortunately however the temperature profile innovation statistics show that in the top 500 m immediately below the surface there is a marked increase in the rmse and bias see fig 5 no significant impact is seen in the salinity profile innovation statistics but there is also a small degradation in the sla innovation bias and rmse detailed in table 2 which is presumably an impact of the density change resulting from the temperature bias this sub surface temperature bias introduced by the 3d assimilation scheme appears to vary in magnitude seasonally and has also been found to affect the global configuration of our system to better understand the source of this sub surface bias a short experiment was performed which assimilated idealised innovations of equal magnitude but opposite sign in alternate assimilation cycles ideally this test would introduce some additional noise but would not lead to a bias however averaged over 1 month this produced a negative mean surface increment and a positive mean subsurface increment as we found in sst new and which manifests as an increase in the temperature profile rmse and bias fig 5 this appears to result from the asymmetric effect of positive and negative increments on the vertical temperature structure whereby a negative surface innovation weakens the stratification and so deepens the mixed layer and then a subsequent positive surface innovation is projected deeper as will be shown in the next section the assimilation of profile observations ameliorates this effect even where the profile observations are sparse further testing has shown that this sub surface bias can be reduced by increasing the sst observation errors without a degradation in the fit to observations suggesting we may be over fitting the sst observations and by using a mixed layer depth field averaged over several cycles in our background error parameterisation this is an area of active investigation and a solution has not yet been selected for implementation in our operational system 5 3 impact of profile observations comparing the sst new and sst ts new experiments allows us to separate the impact of adding the assimilation of t s profiles within the new system there is no appreciable difference in sst statistics see table 2 which is to be expected given the existing coverage of surface temperature observations however there is a clear impact on the subsurface with a reduction of 35 28 in the rmse for temperature salinity as well as a substantial reduction in bias at almost all depths see fig 6 green to red lines importantly the sub surface bias seen when assimilating only sst observations has been substantially removed however these observation minus background statistics are limited to the regions where observations exist see fig 3 and so we cannot be sure of the reduction in bias in all areas times especially in the shallow shelf waters to reiterate these statistics use the difference between the observed values and the model equivalent before assimilation although the assimilation of t s profiles has a significant positive impact on the comparison with in situ measurements of the temperature and salinity there is a mixed impact on the sla top panel fig 7 while there is a modest improvement in the sla rmse in shallow water regions there is an overall degradation in the sla innovation rmse in deeper regions this suggests that there could be some inconsistency between the observations of the sea surface height and the changes to the vertical density structure made when assimilating t s profiles however we note that our bias correction scheme to correct errors in the mdt is only applied when assimilating sla observations so any errors in the mdt will affect comparisons with sla observations although we expect this to be a small effect 5 4 impact of altimeter observations the impact on the 3d temperature and salinity of assimilating sla observations varies depending on whether profile observations are also assimilated see fig 6 as mentioned previously since the assimilation of sla observations introduces changes to the density structure below the mixed layer it would be expected that sla assimilation would not perform as well when the t s structure is not already well constrained as also seen by lea et al 2014 comparing the sst new to the sst sla new experiment both without t s profile assimilation fig 6 green to blue lines there is a mixed impact on the temperature profile statistics when adding the assimilation of sla observations more strikingly there is a significant increase in the salinity bias in the upper few hundred metres however although there is a small degradation in the temperature profile innovation statistics between the sst ts new and all new both with assimilation of t s profiles fig 6 red to black lines there is little difference for salinity there is also a mixed impact of the assimilation of sla observations on the sla innovation statistics see fig 7 compared to the experiment assimilating only sst observations adding profile assimilation degrades the sla rmse significantly in the deep parts of the domain but has a smaller positive impact in the shallow regions top panel meanwhile combining the assimilation of sst and sla reduces the sla rmse in the deep regions where sla observations are assimilated but introduces a smaller degradation in shallow water regions middle panel perhaps due to spurious correlations between changes in the deeper parts of the domain which then propagate onto the shelf finally when adding both profile and sla assimilation bottom panel the positive and negative impacts of the assimilation developments on the sla statistics approximately cancel one another but importantly the significant improvements on the t s profile innovation statistics are retained see fig 6 and the representation of surface currents is improved see section 5 5 1 5 5 full impact of assimilation changes finally we will assess the overall impact of changing from the previous assimilation scheme used in foam shelf v8 to the new scheme assimilating all observations in foam shelf v9 as there were only minor changes made to the ocean model component between these versions this combination of experiments is the most relevant to our operational system as it demonstrates the impact of all the assimilation changes this is important as the impact of each observation type can depend on the presence or lack of other observation types for example we would expect improved results from assimilating altimeter observations when the sub surface is well constrained i e where we also assimilate profile observations the new assimilation scheme and the extra observation types assimilated result in only a small improvement in the sst rmse throughout the period see fig 8 given the large number of sst observations assimilated in both experiments it is unsurprising that additional sub surface temperature measurements along with salinity and sla make little difference to the overall quality of the surface temperature analyses however the assimilation changes have a large positive impact of the sub surface where there is a large reduction in the temperature rmse below 100 m and in the bias below 500 m see fig 9 for salinity there is also a clear reduction in the rmse and bias at almost all depths domain averaged time series of sla innovation statistics show little discernible impact of these assimilation developments but this masks the spatially varying impact on the sla innovations see fig 10 while the sla rmse is degraded in shallow water regions further from the coast a reduction in the rmse is apparent although there cannot be said to be a clear improvement or degradation overall it appears that the rmse has been reduced in the deeper part of the domain where sla observations are assimilated and the rmse has increased in the shallow water regions where no sla observations were assimilated the improvement from sst ctl to all new is shown in more detail in figs 11 and 12 while it is clear that the temperature rmse in particular has a seasonal variation in the upper ocean for both temperature and salinity there is rapid reduction in the rmse at all levels by the second year the experiment assimilating all observation types all new appears to be stable having corrected a number of gross errors present in the previous system sst ctl however it should be noted that these observation minus background statistics do not give a complete picture as the spatial and temporal sampling of in situ profile observations is incomplete especially in the shallow shelf waters overall the rmse for the temperature and salinity profile innovations have both been reduced by over 25 see table 2 but without more observations we cannot be sure of the impact in the northern north sea especially where there are very few in situ profiles fig 3 5 5 1 impact on the velocity field finally the assimilation developments described here also have a noticeable impact on the dynamical evolution of the foam shelf system monthly averaged fields of surface currents show a significant increase in variability and in the presence of eddies in fig 13 we show a comparison of the mean surface currents from january 2015 the second year of our experiments from the sst ctl and all new experiments with two observation derived current products globcurrent v3 0 rio et al 2014 and oscar bonjean and lagerloef 2002 only the geostrophic component of the 0 25 globcurrent product is shown although a globcurrent product which combines the geostrophic and ekman components is available the ekman component in this region was found to be very smooth and anomalously high 0 2 m s we therefore show the geostrophic only product to aid comparison of features between the observations and model output the oscar product is shown at 1 3 resolution and combines both the geostrophic and ekman components of the surface current the tidal currents in the english channel and irish sea seen in the observational products are not apparent in the mean surface currents from our experiments as they have been calculated from a series of 25 hourly averages while many of the main currents in the model fields are little changed between sst ctl and all new in the deep western parts of the domain we see an increase in the number and strength of eddies which agrees better with the observations this corresponds to the region where we assimilate altimeter sla observations suggesting that the surface current features resolved by the altimeter observations are being introduced by the assimilation in the near future various techniques for validating the currents predicted by foam shelf will be compared 6 conclusions and future developments the previous version of the met office operational shelf seas forecasting system foam shelf v8 assimilated only sst observations to address known biases in that system we have developed the assimilation scheme in order to make use of the available in situ temperature and salinity profile observations and satellite measurements of the sea level anomaly in particular newly available altimeter observations which retain atmospheric and tidal signals provide physically appropriate observations for assimilation into our ocean model and are now assimilated in deep water regions 700 m southward of 60 n we have updated the assimilation scheme used in foam shelf v9 to work with œÉ coordinates modified the background field used in the balance relationships to use a mean field over the assimilation window adapted the criteria compared to our global configuration used when applying ssh balance to be appropriate for the region of the nws and we have investigated the impact of removing or retaining the tidal signal in the observations and model when calculating the ssh innovations several experiments have been performed assimilating different combinations of observation types to identify the benefits delivered by each type and understand how they work in combination through this we have identified an issue with the vertical propagation of sst increments that can lead to a subsurface bias however this is ameliorated by the assimilation of in situ temperature profiles and when assimilating all observation types there is a significant improvement compared to the previous system the assimilation of in situ t s profiles results in a large improvement in the rmse of innovations for subsurface temperature and salinity correcting the biases which motivated this work the assimilation of sla observations has also been shown to reduce the sla rmse in some cases and introduces realistic eddying features however work remains to be done to understand how to maximise this improvement when assimilating profile and altimeter observations together overall these assimilation developments have reduced significant errors in our operational analyses and provide a solid base system from which to improve the use of the various observation types available in the near future we plan to investigate how we can make more use of the available altimeter observations particularly in seasonally stratified regions on the shelf and at high latitudes furthermore to make better use of the available observations we plan to modify our background error parameterisation to avoid spreading the influence of observations along model levels with large changes in depth i e near steep bathymetry we are also trying to identify additional near real time observations to expand the number and coverage of in situ temperature and salinity profiles finally we have begun developing the assimilation component for a 1 5 km resolution version of foam shelf graham et al 2017 which is planned to become operational during 2018 this presents several challenges including matching the resolution of features in the observations and model but will provide a step change in our ability to resolve dynamical features such as meso scale eddies internal
