6920,it remains a challenge to obtain an accurate middle and long term runoff forecast especially in flood seasons the forecast performance can be improved using ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd to produce cleaner signals as model inputs in many eemd based forecast models the entire time series are decomposed into several sub series and each sub series is divided into calibration and validation datasets and forecasted by some common models such as artificial neural network ann and finally an ensemble forecast is obtained by summing the forecasted results of each sub series in such a decomposition ensemble framework some future information is used and thus it is a hindcast experiment attempts have also been made to propose a real forecast experiment which however often cannot be able to adapt to the non stationary changes in runoff due to the lack of adaptive ability therefore this study tries to improve the decomposition ensemble framework and propose an adaptive middle and long term runoff forecast model especially for flood seasons unlike a hindcast experiment it does not use any future information and unlike conventional forecast experiments its decomposition and forecast models are adjusted adaptively as long as new runoff information is added eemd is used to decompose the original time series and ann is used to forecast each sub series hence the name an adaptive eemd ann aeemd ann model this model is applied to forecast the 1 month ahead streamflow of three stations in china and the results show that the aeemd ann model can improve forecast accuracy in flood seasons but it is not as good as ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis support vector machine svm and seasonal first order autoregressive sar 1 models in dry seasons while the conventional forecast models especially the sar 1 models are more suitable in dry season therefore it is recommended to use sar 1 model in dry season and aeemd ann model in flood season to forecast the monthly runoff in yangtze river basin keywords middle and long term runoff forecast runoff time series ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd artificial neural network ann non stationary adaptive forecast 1 introduction hydrological forecast is of significant importance for planning and managing water resources if the forecasted leading time is longer than the maximal confluence time of the basin and three days but shorter than one year it is belongs to middle and long term hydrological forecast tang et al 2008 an accurate middle and long term runoff forecast is important for hydrologists and water resource managers to maximize water use potential over long periods in the last decades many non linear data driven models such as artificial neural network ann humphrey et al 2016 shiri and ki si 2010 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis ashrafi et al 2017 nayak et al 2004 genetic programming gp kisi and cimen 2011 mehr et al 2013 ravansalar et al 2017 support vector machine svm asefa et al 2006 huang et al 2014 kisi and cimen 2011 and support vector regression svr liu et al 2014 yaseen et al 2016 have been proposed for middle and long term runoff forecast however despite a large body of literature on the performance of these models chua and wong 2011 he et al 2014 lohani et al 2012 valipour et al 2013 wang et al 2009 no definite conclusion has been made as to which model performs best in middle and long term runoff forecast ann is the most widely used in the hydrological fields due to its powerful parallel processing good fault tolerance and the ability to approximate virtually any function up to an arbitrary degree of accuracy a comprehensive review of the applications of ann to hydrology can be found in tanty and desmukh 2015 in spite of the good performance of ann there is still room to improve its forecast accuracy the non linear and non stationary natural runoff series can be regarded as a quasi periodic signal which can be contaminated by various noise signals at different flow levels wu et al 2009a there is compelling evidence that the performance of forecast models can be improved by using signal decomposition techniques to produce cleaner signals as model inputs based on this idea much work has been done to improve the forecast accuracy of ann for example partal and kişi 2007 developed a wavelet neuro fuzzy model to forecast precipitation and in the next year they developed a wavelet ann model to forecast daily suspended sediment load partal and cigizoglu 2008 their results showed that such hybrid models were significantly better than the single neuro fuzzy or ann models wu et al 2009a coupled three data preprocessing techniques including moving average ma singular spectrum analysis ssa and wavelet multi resolution analysis wmra with ann to improve its forecast accuracy of daily flow in the last few years hybrid models of wavelet transform wt and ann have been widely used for forecast of daily flow adamowski and sun 2010 flood kasiviswanathan et al 2016 tiwari and chatterjee 2010 hydro meteorological time series signals yu et al 2013 and daily water level seo et al 2015 in general most conventional decomposition techniques perform well only when the data satisfies some assumptions for example wt is a mathematical tool for non stationary data processing but the data are required to be linear niu et al 2016 however the hydrological time series rainfall and runoff processes are not only non stationary but non linear karthikeyan and kumar 2013 wang et al 2015a in addition some information such as the decomposition level and mother wavelets should be predetermined in wt wu et al 2009a b another decomposition method empirical mode decomposition emd proposed by huang et al 1998 has also been widely used in hydrology recently an important advantage of emd over other decomposition approaches is its complete self adaptiveness it is empirical intuitive direct and adaptive requiring no predetermined basis functions sang et al 2014 another important advantage of emd is its very local ability both in physical and frequency space which makes it especially suitable for nonlinear and non stationary time series huang et al 1998 huang and wu 2008 based on the principle of decomposition and ensemble emd and its improved version such as ensemble emd eemd are widely coupled with data driven forecast models for runoff forecast napolitano et al 2011 wang et al 2015a b rainfall forecast ouyang et al 2016 wang et al 2013 and period identification of hydrologic time series sang et al 2012 emd based forecast models are subject to some common shortcomings huang et al 2014 partal and cigizoglu 2008 santos and silva 2014 wei et al 2012 in these studies the forecast is based on a decomposition ensemble framework the entire time series are first decomposed into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions imfs and one residue series and then each imf and the residue are divided into calibration and validation datasets to build forecast models and finally the ensemble forecast of the original time series is obtained by summing the forecast results of imfs and the residue in this situation some future information which is actually unknown at the present moment is used in the modeling system which thus does not represent the actual conditions zhang et al 2015 pointed out that the decomposition ensemble framework acted as a hindcast experiment and then proposed a forecast experiment in which the time series in the calibration period were first decomposed and then that in the validation period were appended into the calibration period one by one and forecasted using the decomposition and forecast models of the calibration period however the decomposition results may vary with the length of the time series and thus the use of predefined decomposition model in the calibration period may bring about significant errors in addition the non linear and non stationary nature of the runoff time series can limit the generalization ability of the predetermined forecast model in the calibration period therefore the decomposition model as well as the forecast model should be updated with the introduction of new data in summary in order to improve the performance of emd family based forecast models 1 future information must not be used in the decomposition ensemble framework and 2 both decomposition and forecast models should be highly adaptive to achieve these two goals this study attempts to improve the decomposition ensemble framework and then propose an adaptive forecast experiment a hybrid eemd ann model is developed in which eemd is used as the decomposition model and ann is used as the forecast model a hindcast experiment and an adaptive forecast experiment are conducted and compared in each experiment the hybrid models are used to model and forecast the 1 month ahead streamflow of the three stations in the yangtze river basin of china the forecast results are compared with that obtained by ann anfis svm and seasonal first order autoregressive sar 1 models the next section introduces the proposed method the case study is introduced in section 3 and conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 eemd the eemd is an enhancement of emd which is an empirical intuitive direct and self adaptive data processing method for non linear and non stationary time series huang et al 1998 huang and wu 2008 the aim of the emd is to decompose the original time series into a finite and small number of oscillatory modes each oscillatory mode can be referred to as an intrinsic mode function imf if it satisfies the following two conditions 1 the function has the same number of extrema and zero crossings or differs at most by one and 2 the function is symmetric with respect to local zero mean emd can self adaptively decompose a time series into a finite number of imfs and one residue by a continuously shifting process which can be briefly described as follows step 1 input the original signal x t step 2 connect all local maxima and minima by a cubic spline interpolation and generate an upper envelope e max t and a lower envelope e min t step 3 compute the envelop mean m t using eq 1 1 m t e max t e min t 2 step 4 calculate the difference between x t and m t as c t 2 c t x t m t step 5 check whether or not c t is an imf according to the two conditions mentioned above if c t is an imf go to step 6 otherwise let x t c t and repeat steps 1 4 until c t is an imf step 6 calculate the residue r t x t c t if the residue r t becomes a monotonic function or at most has one local extreme point the whole decomposition is completed otherwise let x t r t and repeat steps 1 5 however it is important to note that 1 a single imf may consist of several signals with very different scales and 2 a signal of a specific scale may occur in different imfs a mode mixing problem may occur in either case and as a consequence the decomposed time series obtained by emd may be unable to characterize the original time series to overcome this problem eemd is proposed huang and wu 2008 by adding white noise eemd establishes a uniform reference background in the time frequency space so that the signals of different scales are automatically projected onto proper scales of reference huang and wu 2008 wang et al 2015a the steps of eemd are as follows step 1 input the original signal x 0 t step 2 given the amplitude of the white noise ε and the number of realizations i and initialize the number of realizations i 1 step 3 generate the white noise n i t and reconstruct the signal using eq 3 3 x i t x i 1 t n i t step 4 decompose x i t into n imfs c j i t j 1 2 n and one residue r i t using emd where x i t j 1 n c j i t r i t step 5 if the maximum number of realizations is achieved go to step 6 otherwise i i 1 and return to step 3 step 6 calculate the final imfs using eq 4 4 c j t 1 i i 1 i c j i t the original signal x 0 t can be decomposed into n imfs and one residue 5 x 0 t j 1 n c j t r t where c j t is the jth imf and r t is the residue which can be calculated using eq 5 2 2 ann ann is a mathematical model that attempts to simulate the structure and functionalities of biological neural networks rojas 1996 simon 1994 it has been widely used in the last decades due to its powerful ability to identify the complex non linear relationships between input output pairs among many different types of ann the back propagation neural network bpnn has been proven to be a very powerful tool for many engineering problems because of its simple and easily implemented architecture govindaraju and rao 2000 in this study bpnn is used to forecast runoff time series in the bpnn a node receives an input signal processes the signal using an activation function and outputs a signal to other interconnected nodes fig 1 shows the data transmission process in a three layered bpnn consisting of an input layer with m nodes a hidden layer with p nodes and an output layer with q nodes for the ith node in the hidden layer the input hin i is 6 hin i j 1 m w ij x j b 1 i its output hout i is 7 hout i ϕ hin i ϕ j 1 m w ij x j b 1 i similarly the input of the k th node in the output layer oin k is 8 oin k i 1 p w ki hout i b 2 k its output y k is 9 y k ψ oin k ψ i 1 p w ki hout i b 2 k ψ i 1 p w ki ϕ j 1 m w ij x j b 1 i b 2 k where w ij is the weight value between node i of the hidden layer and node j of the input layer w ki is the weight value between node k of the output layer and node i of the hidden layer b 1 i and b 2 k are the threshold values of node i in the hidden layer and node k in the output layer and ϕ and ψ are the activation functions in the hidden and output layers respectively in this study tangent sigmoid and linear activation functions are chosen as the activation functions of the hidden and output layers respectively the levenberg marquardt methodology which is more powerful than conventional gradient descent techniques hagan and menhaj 1994 is used to adjust the weights and threshold values of the neural network 2 3 eemd ann model a problem with ann and other linear and nonlinear forecast models is that they are not able to handle non stationary data in order to cope with the non stationary problem of the streamflow an eemd ann hybrid model is built where eemd is used to decompose the original time series into several sub series and ann is used to build forecast model for each sub series sub series obtained by eemd are relatively stationary and can provide information about the original data structure and its periodicity therefore the performance of the forecast models are expected to be improved by giving useful information on various resolution levels the eemd ann model is based on the decomposition ensemble framework which includes three stages 1 decompose runoff time series into a collection of imfs and a residue using eemd 2 forecast each sub series by its unique ann model and 3 obtain the final forecast by summing the outputs of all ann models according to whether or not future runoff series are considered in the decomposition models two experiments based on the eemd ann model are set which are referred to as the hindcast experiment napolitano et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 and the adaptive forecast experiment respectively for the purpose of distinction the adaptive forecast experiment is referred to as adaptive eemd ann aeemd ann model due to its adaptive ability 2 3 1 hindcast experiment fig 2 shows the framework of the hindcast experiment including step 1 decompose the entire original runoff time series q t into n imfs and one residue using eemd and divide the entire period into the calibration and validation periods step 2 develop ann models for each sub series of the calibration period with different previous lags as inputs and select the final ann model using rmse see eq 11 minimization criteria step 3 use the selected ann models to forecast imfs and the residue step 4 obtain the final forecast of the calibration period q cali f by summing the outputs of all ann models step 5 save the selected ann models step 6 apply the ann models to forecast sub series in the validation period and obtain the final forecast of the validation period q vali f by summing the outputs of all ann models as the hindcast experiment decomposes the series in the calibration and the validation periods simultaneously it considers the runoff information which is not happening at the moment to develop forecast models therefore it is not real forecast 2 3 2 adaptive forecast experiment to overcome the drawback of hindcast experiment zhang et al 2015 proposed a forecast experiment as shown in fig 3 its steps are similar to that of the hindcast experiment except in steps 1 5 and 6 in step 1 the entire runoff time series are divided into the calibration and validation periods and the data number in the validation period is initialized to k 1 and only the runoff time series in the calibration period are decomposed in step 5 not only the ann models but the decomposition model in the calibration period should be saved for use in the validation period in step 6 the kth data in the validation period q vali k is appended to the calibration period and then the saved decomposition and forecast models are used to decompose the data into n 1 sub series and forecast each series for 1 period ahead and thus the forecast results of the kth data in the validation period q vali k f are obtained if k m where m is the number of the data in the validation period stop and output q vali f otherwise repeat step 6 in the forecast experiment the decomposition and forecast models are predetermined in the calibration period and kept unchanged in the validation period in fact as the data in the validation period are appended the use of predetermined decomposition model may bring about significant errors as shown in fig 6 in addition the non linear and non stationary nature of the runoff time series can limit the generalization ability of the predetermined forecast model in the calibration period therefore the decomposition model as well as the forecast model should be updated as long as new runoff information is added thus we propose an adaptive forecast experiment fig 4 whose steps are as follows step 1 divide the entire data into the calibration period q cali and the validation period q vali and initialize the data number in the validation period k 1 step 2 decompose q cali into n imfs and one residue using eemd step 3 set ann models with different previous lags as inputs and select the final ann model using rmse minimization criteria for each sub series of the calibration period step 4 obtain q cali f by summing the outputs of all selected ann models step 5 save the selected ann models to forecast each sub series for 1 period ahead and q vali k f is obtained by summing the forecasted sub series step 6 if k m stop and output q vali f otherwise let k k 1 and append q vali k into the calibration data then repeat steps 2 to 6 the adaptive forecast experiment can adapt to the non stationary characteristics of the original time series from the two aspects on the one hand as mentioned above the eemd based decomposition techniques can process the non stationary signal into relatively stationary ones on the other hand compared with the conventional forecast experiment the decomposition and forecast models are highly self adaptive and can be updated if only there is new streamflow information 2 4 model performance evaluation nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns root mean squared error rmse correlation coefficient r mean absolute relative error mare and mean absolute error mae are used to evaluate the performance of forecast models 10 ns 1 i 1 n q i o q i f 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2 11 rmse 1

i o and q i f are the observed and forecasted runoff at time i q o and q f are the mean of the observed and forecasted runoff respectively the best fit between observed and forecasted values would have ns 1 r 1 rmse 0 mare 0 and mae 0 the closer the ns and r values are to 1 and the rmse mare and mae values are to 0 the better the performance of the forecast model would be 3 case study 3 1 study area and data the yangtze river originated from the tanggula mountain in the tibetan plateau china has an annual outflow of 960 billion m3 into the east china sea the yangtze river basin see fig 5 is the third largest river basin in the world covering a total of about 1 08 10 7 square kilometers accounting for 18 8 of the chinese land area it flows through the eastern central and western economic zones of china the most developed regions in china to efficiently utilize water resources in the yangtze river many reservoirs have been constructed a famous example of which is the three gorges reservoir tgr the largest water conservancy project in the world the middle and long term runoff forecast is of practical significance for the joint regulation of these reservoirs and rational allocation and utilization of water resources in this study three stations ertan yichang and cuntan stations in the yangtze river basin were selected to verify the aeemd ann model the ertan station is on the yalong river an important tributary of the yangtze river the cuntan and yichang stations are on the main stream of the yangtze river the runoff series of ertan and cuntan stations cover a period of 708 months 59 years from january 1954 to december 2012 and january 1950 to december 2008 respectively while that of yichang station cover a period of 744 months 62 years from january 1950 to december 2011 each data series is divided into a calibration dataset and a validation dataset the data series of the last 9 years act as the validation dataset for ertan station while that of the last 10 years act as the validation dataset for yichang and cuntan stations respectively 3 2 model development to verify the aeemd ann model four popular forecast models including ann anfis svm and sar 1 models which directly employ original series to generate model input output pairs are also developed 3 2 1 ann model bpnn is used in this study and the following seven combinations of input data are considered correspondingly we develop seven ann models with different inputs i qt 1 ii qt 1 qt 2 iii qt 1 qt 2 qt 3 iv qt 1 qt 2 qt 3 qt 4 v qt 1 qt 2 qt 3 qt 4 qt 5 vi qt 1 qt 2 qt 3 qt 4 qt 5 qt 6 vii qt 1 qt 2 qt 3 qt 4 qt 5 qt 6 qt 7 where qt 1 qt 2 qt 3 qt 4 qt 5 qt 6 and qt 7 represent the runoff at time t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 t 6 and t 7 respectively the number of nodes in the input layer is equal to the number of input variables while that in the output layer is 1 the trial and error method is used to determine the optimal number of hidden nodes for the seven ann models 3 2 2 eemd ann model for the eemd model the realization number i is set to 100 and the amplitude of white noise ε is set to 0 2 times the standard deviation of that of the sample data suggested by wu and huang 2005 the original runoff series are decomposed into a finite number of sub series and a unique ann model is developed for each sub series assuming that the original time series is decomposed into m sub series thus m ann models are needed for the adaptive forecast experiment the decomposition and forecast models are updated as long as new runoff information is added for example there are a total of 120 months in the validation set for the yichang station and thus 120 decomposition models and 120 m 7 ann models are needed it is time consuming if the number of hidden nodes for each ann model is determined by trial and error method thus the number of hidden nodes for each sub series period and input is assumed to be the same in this study then the number of hidden nodes from one to twenty for the eemd ann model is tried in this study the results show that a good fitting performance can be obtained with nine hidden nodes and thus the number of hidden nodes is set to nine for both eemd ann and aeemd ann it should be noted that the time consuming problem of adaptive forecast experiment exists only in our research stage in order to verify our models we set a long validation period however due to the leading time is one period ahead we just need to forecast the runoff of the next period in the real forecast stage meanwhile the middle and long term runoff forecast does not require a real time computation therefore the time consuming problem in the research stage does not limit its practical application and we can even develop more refined models without any assumptions in the real forecast stage 3 2 3 anfis model a subtractive clustering based anfis model rantala and koivisto 2002 is used to overcome the shortcomings of conventional anfis model that the number of control rules increases rapidly as the number of fuzzy variables increases subtractive clustering is used to determine the number of rules and antecedent membership functions and the linear least squares estimation is used to determine the consequent equation of each rule more details about the anfis algorithm and its hybrid learning algorithm can be found in jang 1993 3 2 4 svm model the least squares support vector machine ls svm proposed by suykens and vandewalle 1999 is used in this study because it can alleviate the computational burden of svm the radius basis function rbf is selected as the kernel function and penalty parameters and kernel function s parameters for svm are determined using the grid search algorithm with cross validation the ls svm toolbox is available on http www esat kuleuven be sista lssvmlab just like the ann model the seven combinations of input data are also considered in eemd ann anfis and svm models and the final model is selected using rmse minimization criteria 3 2 5 sar 1 model to characterize the nonstationary properties and the periodic dependence structure of the seasonal hydrologic time series the seasonal first order autoregressive sar 1 models are also developed the parameters of sar 1 models are determined by the least square method 3 3 results and discussion 3 3 1 decomposition results using eemd in previous forecast experiments the runoff series in the validation period are processed using the decomposition model saved in the calibration period however it is found that the decomposition results may differ significantly depending on the length of the series for example fig 6 shows the decomposition results of ertan station for the period 1954 2004 fig 6 a and 1954 2012 fig 6 b respectively the original runoff series are decomposed into a total of nine components including eight imfs and one residue with different frequencies and amplitudes it is noted that although imf7 imf8 and the residue have similar frequencies their amplitudes are quite different sometimes a great difference in the length of the series can even lead to different numbers of imfs therefore the decomposition model should be updated adaptively rather than be fixed in the calibration period and the same is true for the forecast model on the one hand the generation ability of the forecast model is very limited on the other hand the forecast model determined in the calibration period may be totally inappropriate for the data in the validation period thus we propose an adaptive forecast experiment in which the decomposition and forecast models are updated as long as new runoff information is added and one time period ahead forecast can be obtained at each run of the model which is completely in line with the actual forecast situation 3 3 2 hindcast experiment results in the hindcast experiment the entire time series are decomposed into several imfs and one residue and then each sub series is divided into a calibration period and a validation period the calibration dataset is used to build ann forecast model and the validation dataset is used to test the forecast model the final forecast performance is shown in table 1 the r and ns values are high and rmse mare and mae values are low thus indicating good performance in the two periods however the hindcast experiment is not a real forecast experiment as it uses future runoff information therefore it creates an illusion of high performance in both calibration and validation periods it is too early to conclude that eemd based hybrid model is suitable for middle and long term runoff forecast just based on the hindcast experiment results just for an example table 2 shows the forecast performance of imfs and the residue at ertan station of the hindcast experiment except the imf1 which has the highest frequency see fig 6 b other imfs are well forecasted as the original series are decomposed layer by layer the frequencies of the sub series are reduced gradually with obvious periodic processes see fig 6 b correspondingly the forecast performance of imfs is improved gradually resulting in an increase in the r and ns values and a decrease in the rmse mare and mae values the results are consistent with the motivation that we use the decomposition ensemble framework to build a forecast model the decomposition process can generate cleaner inputs for ann models thus improving the forecast performance 3 3 3 adaptive forecast experiment results the flowchart of the adaptive forecast experiment is much different from convention forecast experiments based on the following three considerations we do not pay much attention to the forecast performance of the calibration period in this study the forecast performance of the validation period is more important than that of the calibration period as the calibration period is used to train the forecast model its performance is evaluated using the data involved in modeling however the validation data set is not considered in building the forecast model and thus the performance of validation period can represent the real application effect usually if a model performs well in the calibration period but poorly in the validation period it is more likely to have poor generalization ability on the contrary the model is considered acceptable if it performs well in the validation period but poorly in the calidation period the concept of calibration and validation period in the adaptive forecast experiment is different from that in the convention forecast models the decomposition and forecast models are updated gradually and thus the calibration period will change constantly for example when we forecast the runoff at time t all runoff data before time t is included in the calibration dataset and used to build the forecast model which will be used to forecast the runoff at time t as the forecast continues the data in the validation set are appended into the calibration set gradually therefore the performance of the calibration period is always changing for the adaptive forecast experiment we do not care about the forecast performance of the calibration period in the calibration period the data is decomposed simultaneously which means that the decomposition and forecast results at time t are influenced by the runoff after time t thus the calibration period does not output the real forecast and it is a hindcast experiment the forecast performance of the hindcast experiment has been verified in section 3 3 2 therefore in the following sections we just show the forecast results of the validation period table 3 shows the validation performance of svm anfis ann sar 1 and eemd ann in adaptive forecast experiments at ertan cuntan and yichang stations in general no significant difference is noted in the validation performance among svm anfis ann and sar 1 models however the performance can be improved significantly by using the aeemd ann model the ns and r values are higher than that of general models thus indicating that the aeemd ann model results in a better agreement between forecasted and observed runoff while the rmse and mae values are lower than that of general models indicating lower average forecast errors however the mare value of the aeemd ann model is higher than that of the sar 1 model at ertan station and that of the ann and sar 1 models at cuntan station respectively which can be attributed to the fact that the aeemd ann model is not suitable in dry season see tables 4 6 and fig 7 the runoff in dry season is relatively low and thus even a small deviation will lead to a large relative error fig 7 shows the final forecast results in the validation period using aeemd ann and ann models clearly the aeemd ann model has much higher forecast accuracy than the ann model in flood season and both appearance time and peak scale can be well forecasted by the aeemd ann model fig 8 shows the scatter plot of forecasted and observed peaks of the three stations using aeemd ann and ann models respectively the forecasted peaks of the aeemd ann model are much closer to the observed ones and can be well fitted by linear regression equations y 1 22 x 437 y 0 94 x 2687 and y 1 09 x 388 which can be applied to modify forecasted peaks unlike the aeemd ann model the scatter points of ann models are ill organized indicating much lower forecast accuracy for the ann model it should be noted that the peak points of the aeemd ann model are generally above the line of y x indicating that the forecasted peaks are lower than the observed ones this phenomenon may come from the limitation of our method unlike some seasonal forecast models the continuous runoff time series are used to develop an aeemd ann model the model is used both in low normal and high flow seasons in order to improve the overall forecast performance the model may not perform well in some extreme points the forecasted peak flow may lower than the real one while the forecasted low flow may higher than the real one rmse mare and mae are used to evaluate the forecast accuracy in each month see tables 4 6 the dry seasons of the yangtze river basin are from november to march while the flood seasons are from april to october it is clear that the aeemd ann model is very suitable for runoff forecast in flood seasons but not as effective as conventional forecast models in dry seasons for ertan station the aeemd ann model outperforms other models examined in this study in the period from may to september but it is less accurate than one or more conventional models in others months there is no significant difference in the performance among ann anfis and svm models in dry seasons however it is noted that the performance of the sar 1 model in dry seasons is obviously better than that of other models the runoff in flood seasons in the yangtze river basin is mainly controlled by rainfall with high uncertainty while that in dry seasons is mainly recharged by groundwater and melt water with lower uncertainty therefore the autocorrelation is high in dry seasons but low in flood season the sar 1 models can well characterize the autocorrelation of runoff in dry seasons thus resulting in a high performance unlike the sar 1 models the entire continuous runoff time series are used to develop an aeemd ann forecast model in order to coordinate the forecast performance of various streamflow scale the model may not perform well in low flow seasons what s more each component of the original low flow is forecasted separately it may bring some cumulative errors similar results can be obtained for cuntan and yichang stations the performance of the aeemd ann model is better than that of other models from may to september for cuntan station and from april to october for yichang station but poorer than conventional models in other months respectively as the sar 1 model has much better performance than the other models in dry seasons and the aeemd ann model is quite suitable in flood seasons we recommend to combine these two models to improve the forecast accuracy for ertan and cuntan stations the aeemd ann model is used from may to september and the sar 1 model is used from october to april for yichang station the aeemd ann model is used from april to october and the sar 1 model is used from november to march fig 9 shows that the forecast accuracy in both flood and dry seasons can be significantly improved table 7 shows that compared with the aeemd ann model the r and ns values are improved from 0 961 and 0 912 to 0 975 and 0 948 while the rmse mare and mae values are reduced from 378 m3 s 24 and 259 m3 s to 290 m3 s 9 and 155 m3 s for ertan station the r and ns values are improved from 0 966 and 0 933 to 0 982 and 0 963 while the rmse mare and mae values are reduced from 2019 m3 s 19 and 1470 m3 s to 1502 m3 s 10 and 1039 m3 s for cuntan station the r and ns values are improved from 0 967 and 0 930 to 0 978 and 0 956 while the rmse mare and mae values are reduced from 2210 m3 s 18 and 1632 m3 s to 1760 m3 s 10 and 1203 m3 s for yichang station respectively 4 conclusions this study improves the decomposition ensemble framework of eemd based middle and long term runoff forecast models and proposes an adaptive forecast experiment eemd is used to decompose the original time series into several sub series and ann is used to forecast each sub series unlike the conventional forecast experiment the decomposition and forecast models can be updated adaptively as long as new runoff information is added the proposed model is applied to forecast the 1 month ahead streamflow of ertan cuntan and yichang stations in china and the results are compared with that obtained by ann anfis svm and sar 1 models the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 as the hindcast experiment uses future information to forecast the current runoff it may create an illusion of high performance in addition as the decomposition results change with the length of the series the decomposition and forecast models should be updated as long as new information is added rather than be fixed in the calibration period 2 the aeemd ann model can significantly improve forecast accuracy in flood seasons but it is not as good as ann anfis svm and sar 1 models in dry seasons 3 the sar 1 models can well characterize the autocorrelation of runoff thus resulting in an obviously better performance than other models in dry seasons therefore it is recommended to combine sar 1 and aeemd ann models to forecast monthly runoff in yangtze river basin where the aeemd ann model is used in flood seasons and the sar 1 model is used in dry seasons respectively as a result the five performance evaluation indexes i e r ns rmse mare and mae in ertan cuntan and yichang stations can be improved significantly theoretically the sub series with different frequencies should have physical meanings we will try to combine regional geographical features and meteorological and climatic features to explain the physical meanings of each sub series in future studies on the other hand it remains a challenge to prolong the forecast leading time and how the forecast performance vary over leading time also needs to be elucidated acknowledgement this paper was jointly supported by the national key research and development

6920,it remains a challenge to obtain an accurate middle and long term runoff forecast especially in flood seasons the forecast performance can be improved using ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd to produce cleaner signals as model inputs in many eemd based forecast models the entire time series are decomposed into several sub series and each sub series is divided into calibration and validation datasets and forecasted by some common models such as artificial neural network ann and finally an ensemble forecast is obtained by summing the forecasted results of each sub series in such a decomposition ensemble framework some future information is used and thus it is a hindcast experiment attempts have also been made to propose a real forecast experiment which however often cannot be able to adapt to the non stationary changes in runoff due to the lack of adaptive ability therefore this study tries to improve the decomposition ensemble framework and propose an adaptive middle and long term runoff forecast model especially for flood seasons unlike a hindcast experiment it does not use any future information and unlike conventional forecast experiments its decomposition and forecast models are adjusted adaptively as long as new runoff information is added eemd is used to decompose the original time series and ann is used to forecast each sub series hence the name an adaptive eemd ann aeemd ann model this model is applied to forecast the 1 month ahead streamflow of three stations in china and the results show that the aeemd ann model can improve forecast accuracy in flood seasons but it is not as good as ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis support vector machine svm and seasonal first order autoregressive sar 1 models in dry seasons while the conventional forecast models especially the sar 1 models are more suitable in dry season therefore it is recommended to use sar 1 model in dry season and aeemd ann model in flood season to forecast the monthly runoff in yangtze river basin keywords middle and long term runoff forecast runoff time series ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd artificial neural network ann non stationary adaptive forecast 1 introduction hydrological forecast is of significant importance for planning and managing water resources if the forecasted leading time is longer than the maximal confluence time of the basin and three days but shorter than one year it is belongs to middle and long term hydrological forecast tang et al 2008 an accurate middle and long term runoff forecast is important for hydrologists and water resource managers to maximize water use potential over long periods in the last decades many non linear data driven models such as artificial neural network ann humphrey et al 2016 shiri and ki si 2010 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis ashrafi et al 2017 nayak et al 2004 genetic programming gp kisi and cimen 2011 mehr et al 2013 ravansalar et al 2017 support vector machine svm asefa et al 2006 huang et al 2014 kisi and cimen 2011 and support vector regression svr liu et al 2014 yaseen et al 2016 have been proposed for middle and long term runoff forecast however despite a large body of literature on the performance of these models chua and wong 2011 he et al 2014 lohani et al 2012 valipour et al 2013 wang et al 2009 no definite conclusion has been made as to which model performs best in middle and long term runoff forecast ann is the most widely used in the hydrological fields due to its powerful parallel processing good fault tolerance and the ability to approximate virtually any function up to an arbitrary degree of accuracy a comprehensive review of the applications of ann to hydrology can be found in tanty and desmukh 2015 in spite of the good performance of ann there is still room to improve its forecast accuracy the non linear and non stationary natural runoff series can be regarded as a quasi periodic signal which can be contaminated by various noise signals at different flow levels wu et al 2009a there is compelling evidence that the performance of forecast models can be improved by using signal decomposition techniques to produce cleaner signals as model inputs based on this idea much work has been done to improve the forecast accuracy of ann for example partal and kişi 2007 developed a wavelet neuro fuzzy model to forecast precipitation and in the next year they developed a wavelet ann model to forecast daily suspended sediment load partal and cigizoglu 2008 their results showed that such hybrid models were significantly better than the single neuro fuzzy or ann models wu et al 2009a coupled three data preprocessing techniques including moving average ma singular spectrum analysis ssa and wavelet multi resolution analysis wmra with ann to improve its forecast accuracy of daily flow in the last few years hybrid models of wavelet transform wt and ann have been widely used for forecast of daily flow adamowski and sun 2010 flood kasiviswanathan et al 2016 tiwari and chatterjee 2010 hydro meteorological time series signals yu et al 2013 and daily water level seo et al 2015 in general most conventional decomposition techniques perform well only when the data satisfies some assumptions for example wt is a mathematical tool for non stationary data processing but the data are required to be linear niu et al 2016 however the hydrological time series rainfall and runoff processes are not only non stationary but non linear karthikeyan and kumar 2013 wang et al 2015a in addition some information such as the decomposition level and mother wavelets should be predetermined in wt wu et al 2009a b another decomposition method empirical mode decomposition emd proposed by huang et al 1998 has also been widely used in hydrology recently an important advantage of emd over other decomposition approaches is its complete self adaptiveness it is empirical intuitive direct and adaptive requiring no predetermined basis functions sang et al 2014 another important advantage of emd is its very local ability both in physical and frequency space which makes it especially suitable for nonlinear and non stationary time series huang et al 1998 huang and wu 2008 based on the principle of decomposition and ensemble emd and its improved version such as ensemble emd eemd are widely coupled with data driven forecast models for runoff forecast napolitano et al 2011 wang et al 2015a b rainfall forecast ouyang et al 2016 wang et al 2013 and period identification of hydrologic time series sang et al 2012 emd based forecast models are subject to some common shortcomings huang et al 2014 partal and cigizoglu 2008 santos and silva 2014 wei et al 2012 in these studies the forecast is based on a decomposition ensemble framework the entire time series are first decomposed into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions imfs and one residue series and then each imf and the residue are divided into calibration and validation datasets to build forecast models and finally the ensemble forecast of the original time series is obtained by summing the forecast results of imfs and the residue in this situation some future information which is actually unknown at the present moment is used in the modeling system which thus does not represent the actual conditions zhang et al 2015 pointed out that the decomposition ensemble framework acted as a hindcast experiment and then proposed a forecast experiment in which the time series in the calibration period were first decomposed and then that in the validation period were appended into the calibration period one by one and forecasted using the decomposition and forecast models of the calibration period however the decomposition results may vary with the length of the time series and thus the use of predefined decomposition model in the calibration period may bring about significant errors in addition the non linear and non stationary nature of the runoff time series can limit the generalization ability of the predetermined forecast model in the calibration period therefore the decomposition model as well as the forecast model should be updated with the introduction of new data in summary in order to improve the performance of emd family based forecast models 1 future information must not be used in the decomposition ensemble framework and 2 both decomposition and forecast models should be highly adaptive to achieve these two goals this study attempts to improve the decomposition ensemble framework and then propose an adaptive forecast experiment a hybrid eemd ann model is developed in which eemd is used as the decomposition model and ann is used as the forecast model a hindcast experiment and an adaptive forecast experiment are conducted and compared in each experiment the hybrid models are used to model and forecast the 1 month ahead streamflow of the three stations in the yangtze river basin of china the forecast results are compared with that obtained by ann anfis svm and seasonal first order autoregressive sar 1 models the next section introduces the proposed method the case study is introduced in section 3 and conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 eemd the eemd is an enhancement of emd which is an empirical intuitive direct and self adaptive data processing method for non linear and non stationary time series huang et al 1998 huang and wu 2008 the aim of the emd is to decompose the original time series into a finite and small number of oscillatory modes each oscillatory mode can be referred to as an intrinsic mode function imf if it satisfies the following two conditions 1 the function has the same number of extrema and zero crossings or differs at most by one and 2 the function is symmetric with respect to local zero mean emd can self adaptively decompose a time series into a finite number of imfs and one residue by a continuously shifting process which can be briefly described as follows step 1 input the original signal x t step 2 connect all local maxima and minima by a cubic spline interpolation and generate an upper envelope e max t and a lower envelope e min t step 3 compute the envelop mean m t using eq 1 1 m t e max t e min t 2 step 4 calculate the difference between x t and m t as c t 2 c t x t m t step 5 check whether or not c t is an imf according to the two conditions mentioned above if c t is an imf go to step 6 otherwise let x t c t and repeat steps 1 4 until c t is an imf step 6 calculate the residue r t x t c t if the residue r t becomes a monotonic function or at most has one local extreme point the whole decomposition is completed otherwise let x t r t and repeat steps 1 5 however it is important to note that 1 a single imf may consist of several signals with very different scales and 2 a signal of a specific scale may occur in different imfs a mode mixing problem may occur in either case and as a consequence the decomposed time series obtained by emd may be unable to characterize the original time series to overcome this problem eemd is proposed huang and wu 2008 by adding white noise eemd establishes a uniform reference background in the time frequency space so that the signals of different scales are automatically projected onto proper scales of reference huang and wu 2008 wang et al 2015a the steps of eemd are as follows step 1 input the original signal x 0 t step 2 given the amplitude of the white noise ε and the number of realizations i and initialize the number of realizations i 1 step 3 generate the white noise n i t and reconstruct the signal using eq 3 3 x i t x i 1 t n i t step 4 decompose x i t into n imfs c j i t j 1 2 n and one residue r i t using emd where x i t j 1 n c j i t r i t step 5 if the maximum number of realizations is achieved go to step 6 otherwise i i 1 and return to step 3 step 6 calculate the final imfs using eq 4 4 c j t 1 i i 1 i c j i t the original signal x 0 t can be decomposed into n imfs and one residue 5 x 0 t j 1 n c j t r t where c j t is the jth imf and r t is the residue which can be calculated using eq 5 2 2 ann ann is a mathematical model that attempts to simulate the structure and functionalities of biological neural networks rojas 1996 simon 1994 it has been widely used in the last decades due to its powerful ability to identify the complex non linear relationships between input output pairs among many different types of ann the back propagation neural network bpnn has been proven to be a very powerful tool for many engineering problems because of its simple and easily implemented architecture govindaraju and rao 2000 in this study bpnn is used to forecast runoff time series in the bpnn a node receives an input signal processes the signal using an activation function and outputs a signal to other interconnected nodes fig 1 shows the data transmission process in a three layered bpnn consisting of an input layer with m nodes a hidden layer with p nodes and an output layer with q nodes for the ith node in the hidden layer the input hin i is 6 hin i j 1 m w ij x j b 1 i its output hout i is 7 hout i ϕ hin i ϕ j 1 m w ij x j b 1 i similarly the input of the k th node in the output layer oin k is 8 oin k i 1 p w ki hout i b 2 k its output y k is 9 y k ψ oin k ψ i 1 p w ki hout i b 2 k ψ i 1 p w ki ϕ j 1 m w ij x j b 1 i b 2 k where w ij is the weight value between node i of the hidden layer and node j of the input layer w ki is the weight value between node k of the output layer and node i of the hidden layer b 1 i and b 2 k are the threshold values of node i in the hidden layer and node k in the output layer and ϕ and ψ are the activation functions in the hidden and output layers respectively in this study tangent sigmoid and linear activation functions are chosen as the activation functions of the hidden and output layers respectively the levenberg marquardt methodology which is more powerful than conventional gradient descent techniques hagan and menhaj 1994 is used to adjust the weights and threshold values of the neural network 2 3 eemd ann model a problem with ann and other linear and nonlinear forecast models is that they are not able to handle non stationary data in order to cope with the non stationary problem of the streamflow an eemd ann hybrid model is built where eemd is used to decompose the original time series into several sub series and ann is used to build forecast model for each sub series sub series obtained by eemd are relatively stationary and can provide information about the original data structure and its periodicity therefore the performance of the forecast models are expected to be improved by giving useful information on various resolution levels the eemd ann model is based on the decomposition ensemble framework which includes three stages 1 decompose runoff time series into a collection of imfs and a residue using eemd 2 forecast each sub series by its unique ann model and 3 obtain the final forecast by summing the outputs of all ann models according to whether or not future runoff series are considered in the decomposition models two experiments based on the eemd ann model are set which are referred to as the hindcast experiment napolitano et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 and the adaptive forecast experiment respectively for the purpose of distinction the adaptive forecast experiment is referred to as adaptive eemd ann aeemd ann model due to its adaptive ability 2 3 1 hindcast experiment fig 2 shows the framework of the hindcast experiment including step 1 decompose the entire original runoff time series q t into n imfs and one residue using eemd and divide the entire period into the calibration and validation periods step 2 develop ann models for each sub series of the calibration period with different previous lags as inputs and select the final ann model using rmse see eq 11 minimization criteria step 3 use the selected ann models to forecast imfs and the residue step 4 obtain the final forecast of the calibration period q cali f by summing the outputs of all ann models step 5 save the selected ann models step 6 apply the ann models to forecast sub series in the validation period and obtain the final forecast of the validation period q vali f by summing the outputs of all ann models as the hindcast experiment decomposes the series in the calibration and the validation periods simultaneously it considers the runoff information which is not happening at the moment to develop forecast models therefore it is not real forecast 2 3 2 adaptive forecast experiment to overcome the drawback of hindcast experiment zhang et al 2015 proposed a forecast experiment as shown in fig 3 its steps are similar to that of the hindcast experiment except in steps 1 5 and 6 in step 1 the entire runoff time series are divided into the calibration and validation periods and the data number in the validation period is initialized to k 1 and only the runoff time series in the calibration period are decomposed in step 5 not only the ann models but the decomposition model in the calibration period should be saved for use in the validation period in step 6 the kth data in the validation period q vali k is appended to the calibration period and then the saved decomposition and forecast models are used to decompose the data into n 1 sub series and forecast each series for 1 period ahead and thus the forecast results of the kth data in the validation period q vali k f are obtained if k m where m is the number of the data in the validation period stop and output q vali f otherwise repeat step 6 in the forecast experiment the decomposition and forecast models are predetermined in the calibration period and kept unchanged in the validation period in fact as the data in the validation period are appended the use of predetermined decomposition model may bring about significant errors as shown in fig 6 in addition the non linear and non stationary nature of the runoff time series can limit the generalization ability of the predetermined forecast model in the calibration period therefore the decomposition model as well as the forecast model should be updated as long as new runoff information is added thus we propose an adaptive forecast experiment fig 4 whose steps are as follows step 1 divide the entire data into the calibration period q cali and the validation period q vali and initialize the data number in the validation period k 1 step 2 decompose q cali into n imfs and one residue using eemd step 3 set ann models with different previous lags as inputs and select the final ann model using rmse minimization criteria for each sub series of the calibration period step 4 obtain q cali f by summing the outputs of all selected ann models step 5 save the selected ann models to forecast each sub series for 1 period ahead and q vali k f is obtained by summing the forecasted sub series step 6 if k m stop and output q vali f otherwise let k k 1 and append q vali k into the calibration data then repeat steps 2 to 6 the adaptive forecast experiment can adapt to the non stationary characteristics of the original time series from the two aspects on the one hand as mentioned above the eemd based decomposition techniques can process the non stationary signal into relatively stationary ones on the other hand compared with the conventional forecast experiment the decomposition and forecast models are highly self adaptive and can be updated if only there is new streamflow information 2 4 model performance evaluation nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns root mean squared error rmse

i o and q i f are the observed and forecasted runoff at time i q o and q f are the mean of the observed and forecasted runoff respectively the best fit between observed and forecasted values would have ns 1 r 1 rmse 0 mare 0 and mae 0 the closer the ns and r values are to 1 and the rmse mare and mae values are to 0 the better the performance of the forecast model would be 3 case study 3 1 study area and data the yangtze river originated from the tanggula mountain in the tibetan plateau china has an annual outflow of 960 billion m3 into the east china sea the yangtze river basin see fig 5 is the third largest river basin in the world covering a total of about 1 08 10 7 square kilometers accounting for 18 8 of the chinese land area it flows through the eastern central and western economic zones of china the most developed regions in china to efficiently utilize water resources in the yangtze river many reservoirs have been constructed a famous example of which is the three gorges reservoir tgr the largest water conservancy project in the world the middle and long term runoff forecast is of practical significance for the joint regulation of these reservoirs and rational allocation and utilization of water resources in this study three stations ertan yichang and cuntan stations in the yangtze river basin were selected to verify the aeemd ann model the ertan station is on the yalong river an important tributary of the yangtze river the cuntan and yichang stations are on the main stream of the yangtze river the runoff series of ertan and cuntan stations cover a period of 708 months 59 years from january 1954 to december 2012 and january 1950 to december 2008 respectively while that of yichang station cover a period of 744 months 62 years from january 1950 to december 2011 each data series is divided into a calibration dataset and a validation dataset the data series of the last 9 years act as the validation dataset for ertan station while that of the last 10 years act as the validation dataset for yichang and cuntan stations respectively 3 2 model development to verify the aeemd ann model four popular forecast models including ann anfis svm and sar 1 models which directly employ original series to generate model input output pairs are also developed 3 2 1 ann model bpnn is used in this study and the following seven combinations of input data are considered correspondingly we develop seven ann models with different inputs i qt 1 ii qt 1 qt 2 iii qt 1 qt 2 qt 3 iv qt 1 qt 2 qt 3 qt 4 v qt 1 qt 2 qt 3 qt 4 qt 5 vi qt 1 qt 2 qt 3 qt 4 qt 5 qt 6 vii qt 1 qt 2 qt 3 qt 4 qt 5 qt 6 qt 7 where qt 1 qt 2 qt 3 qt 4 qt 5 qt 6 and qt 7 represent the runoff at time t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 t 6 and t 7 respectively the number of nodes in the input layer is equal to the number of input variables while that in the output layer is 1 the trial and error method is used to determine the optimal number of hidden nodes for the seven ann models 3 2 2 eemd ann model for the eemd model the realization number i is set to 100 and the amplitude of white noise ε is set to 0 2 times the standard deviation of that of the sample data suggested by wu and huang 2005 the original runoff series are decomposed into a finite number of sub series and a unique ann model is developed for each sub series assuming that the original time series is decomposed into m sub series thus m ann models are needed for the adaptive forecast experiment the decomposition and forecast models are updated as long as new runoff information is added for example there are a total of 120 months in the validation set for the yichang station and thus 120 decomposition models and 120 m 7 ann models are needed it is time consuming if the number of hidden nodes for each ann model is determined by trial and error method thus the number of hidden nodes for each sub series period and input is assumed to be the same in this study then the number of hidden nodes from one to twenty for the eemd ann model is tried in this study the results show that a good fitting performance can be obtained with nine hidden nodes and thus the number of hidden nodes is set to nine for both eemd ann and aeemd ann it should be noted that the time consuming problem of adaptive forecast experiment exists only in our research stage in order to verify our models we set a long validation period however due to the leading time is one period ahead we just need to forecast the runoff of the next period in the real forecast stage meanwhile the middle and long term runoff forecast does not require a real time computation therefore the time consuming problem in the research stage does not limit its practical application and we can even develop more refined models without any assumptions in the real forecast stage 3 2 3 anfis model a subtractive clustering based anfis model rantala and koivisto 2002 is used to overcome the shortcomings of conventional anfis model that the number of control rules increases rapidly as the number of fuzzy variables increases subtractive clustering is used to determine the number of rules and antecedent membership functions and the linear least squares estimation is used to determine the consequent equation of each rule more details about the anfis algorithm and its hybrid learning algorithm can be found in jang 1993 3 2 4 svm model the least squares support vector machine ls svm proposed by suykens and vandewalle 1999 is used in this study because it can alleviate the computational burden of svm the radius basis function rbf is selected as the kernel function and penalty parameters and kernel function s parameters for svm are determined using the grid search algorithm with cross validation the ls svm toolbox is available on http www esat kuleuven be sista lssvmlab just like the ann model the seven combinations of input data are also considered in eemd ann anfis and svm models and the final model is selected using rmse minimization criteria 3 2 5 sar 1 model to characterize the nonstationary properties and the periodic dependence structure of the seasonal hydrologic time series the seasonal first order autoregressive sar 1 models are also developed the parameters of sar 1 models are determined by the least square method 3 3 results and discussion 3 3 1 decomposition results using eemd in previous forecast experiments the runoff series in the validation period are processed using the decomposition model saved in the calibration period however it is found that the decomposition results may differ significantly depending on the length of the series for example fig 6 shows the decomposition results of ertan station for the period 1954 2004 fig 6 a and 1954 2012 fig 6 b respectively the original runoff series are decomposed into a total of nine components including eight imfs and one residue with different frequencies and amplitudes it is noted that although imf7 imf8 and the residue have similar frequencies their amplitudes are quite different sometimes a great difference in the length of the series can even lead to different numbers of imfs therefore the decomposition model should be updated adaptively rather than be fixed in the calibration period and the same is true for the forecast model on the one hand the generation ability of the forecast model is very limited on the other hand the forecast model determined in the calibration period may be totally inappropriate for the data in the validation period thus we propose an adaptive forecast experiment in which the decomposition and forecast models are updated as long as new runoff information is added and one time period ahead forecast can be obtained at each run of the model which is completely in line with the actual forecast situation 3 3 2 hindcast experiment results in the hindcast experiment the entire time series are decomposed into several imfs and one residue and then each sub series is divided into a calibration period and a validation period the calibration dataset is used to build ann forecast model and the validation dataset is used to test the forecast model the final forecast performance is shown in table 1 the r and ns values are high and rmse mare and mae values are low thus indicating good performance in the two periods however the hindcast experiment is not a real forecast experiment as it uses future runoff information therefore it creates an illusion of high performance in both calibration and validation periods it is too early to conclude that eemd based hybrid model is suitable for middle and long term runoff forecast just based on the hindcast experiment results just for an example table 2 shows the forecast performance of imfs and the residue at ertan station of the hindcast experiment except the imf1 which has the highest frequency see fig 6 b other imfs are well forecasted as the original series are decomposed layer by layer the frequencies of the sub series are reduced gradually with obvious periodic processes see fig 6 b correspondingly the forecast performance of imfs is improved gradually resulting in an increase in the r and ns values and a decrease in the rmse mare and mae values the results are consistent with the motivation that we use the decomposition ensemble framework to build a forecast model the decomposition process can generate cleaner inputs for ann models thus improving the forecast performance 3 3 3 adaptive forecast experiment results the flowchart of the adaptive forecast experiment is much different from convention forecast experiments based on the following three considerations we do not pay much attention to the forecast performance of the calibration period in this study the forecast performance of the validation period is more important than that of the calibration period as the calibration period is used to train the forecast model its performance is evaluated using the data involved in modeling however the validation data set is not considered in building the forecast model and thus the performance of validation period can represent the real application effect usually if a model performs well in the calibration period but poorly in the validation period it is more likely to have poor generalization ability on the contrary the model is considered acceptable if it performs well in the validation period but poorly in the calidation period the concept of calibration and validation period in the adaptive forecast experiment is different from that in the convention forecast models the decomposition and forecast models are updated gradually and thus the calibration period will change constantly for example when we forecast the runoff at time t all runoff data before time t is included in the calibration dataset and used to build the forecast model which will be used to forecast the runoff at time t as the forecast continues the data in the validation set are appended into the calibration set gradually therefore the performance of the calibration period is always changing for the adaptive forecast experiment we do not care about the forecast performance of the calibration period in the calibration period the data is decomposed simultaneously which means that the decomposition and forecast results at time t are influenced by the runoff after time t thus the calibration period does not output the real forecast and it is a hindcast experiment the forecast performance of the hindcast experiment has been verified in section 3 3 2 therefore in the following sections we just show the forecast results of the validation period table 3 shows the validation performance of svm anfis ann sar 1 and eemd ann in adaptive forecast experiments at ertan cuntan and yichang stations in general no significant difference is noted in the validation performance among svm anfis ann and sar 1 models however the performance can be improved significantly by using the aeemd ann model the ns and r values are higher than that of general models thus indicating that the aeemd ann model results in a better agreement between forecasted and observed runoff while the rmse and mae values are lower than that of general models indicating lower average forecast errors however the mare value of the aeemd ann model is higher than that of the sar 1 model at ertan station and that of the ann and sar 1 models at cuntan station respectively which can be attributed to the fact that the aeemd ann model is not suitable in dry season see tables 4 6 and fig 7 the runoff in dry season is relatively low and thus even a small deviation will lead to a large relative error fig 7 shows the final forecast results in the validation period using aeemd ann and ann models clearly the aeemd ann model has much higher forecast accuracy than the ann model in flood season and both appearance time and peak scale can be well forecasted by the aeemd ann model fig 8 shows the scatter plot of forecasted and observed peaks of the three stations using aeemd ann and ann models respectively the forecasted peaks of the aeemd ann model are much closer to the observed ones and can be well fitted by linear regression equations y 1 22 x 437 y 0 94 x 2687 and y 1 09 x 388 which can be applied to modify forecasted peaks unlike the aeemd ann model the scatter points of ann models are ill organized indicating much lower forecast accuracy for the ann model it should be noted that the peak points of the aeemd ann model are generally above the line of y x indicating that the forecasted peaks are lower than the observed ones this phenomenon may come from the limitation of our method unlike some seasonal forecast models the continuous runoff time series are used to develop an aeemd ann model the model is used both in low normal and high flow seasons in order to improve the overall forecast performance the model may not perform well in some extreme points the forecasted peak flow may lower than the real one while the forecasted low flow may higher than the real one rmse mare and mae are used to evaluate the forecast accuracy in each month see tables 4 6 the dry seasons of the yangtze river basin are from november to march while the flood seasons are from april to october it is clear that the aeemd ann model is very suitable for runoff forecast in flood seasons but not as effective as conventional forecast models in dry seasons for ertan station the aeemd ann model outperforms other models examined in this study in the period from may to september but it is less accurate than one or more conventional models in others months there is no significant difference in the performance among ann anfis and svm models in dry seasons however it is noted that the performance of the sar 1 model in dry seasons is obviously better than that of other models the runoff in flood seasons in the yangtze river basin is mainly controlled by rainfall with high uncertainty while that in dry seasons is mainly recharged by groundwater and melt water with lower uncertainty therefore the autocorrelation is high in dry seasons but low in flood season the sar 1 models can well characterize the autocorrelation of runoff in dry seasons thus resulting in a high performance unlike the sar 1 models the entire continuous runoff time series are used to develop an aeemd ann forecast model in order to coordinate the forecast performance of various streamflow scale the model may not perform well in low flow seasons what s more each component of the original low flow is forecasted separately it may bring some cumulative errors similar results can be obtained for cuntan and yichang stations the performance of the aeemd ann model is better than that of other models from may to september for cuntan station and from april to october for yichang station but poorer than conventional models in other months respectively as the sar 1 model has much better performance than the other models in dry seasons and the aeemd ann model is quite suitable in flood seasons we recommend to combine these two models to improve the forecast accuracy for ertan and cuntan stations the aeemd ann model is used from may to september and the sar 1 model is used from october to april for yichang station the aeemd ann model is used from april to october and the sar 1 model is used from november to march fig 9 shows that the forecast accuracy in both flood and dry seasons can be significantly improved table 7 shows that compared with the aeemd ann model the r and ns values are improved from 0 961 and 0 912 to 0 975 and 0 948 while the rmse mare and mae values are reduced from 378 m3 s 24 and 259 m3 s to 290 m3 s 9 and 155 m3 s for ertan station the r and ns values are improved from 0 966 and 0 933 to 0 982 and 0 963 while the rmse mare and mae values are reduced from 2019 m3 s 19 and 1470 m3 s to 1502 m3 s 10 and 1039 m3 s for cuntan station the r and ns values are improved from 0 967 and 0 930 to 0 978 and 0 956 while the rmse mare and mae values are reduced from 2210 m3 s 18 and 1632 m3 s to 1760 m3 s 10 and 1203 m3 s for yichang station respectively 4 conclusions this study improves the decomposition ensemble framework of eemd based middle and long term runoff forecast models and proposes an adaptive forecast experiment eemd is used to decompose the original time series into several sub series and ann is used to forecast each sub series unlike the conventional forecast experiment the decomposition and forecast models can be updated adaptively as long as new runoff information is added the proposed model is applied to forecast the 1 month ahead streamflow of ertan cuntan and yichang stations in china and the results are compared with that obtained by ann anfis svm and sar 1 models the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 as the hindcast experiment uses future information to forecast the current runoff it may create an illusion of high performance in addition as the decomposition results change with the length of the series the decomposition and forecast models should be updated as long as new information is added rather than be fixed in the calibration period 2 the aeemd ann model can significantly improve forecast accuracy in flood seasons but it is not as good as ann anfis svm and sar 1 models in dry seasons 3 the sar 1 models can well characterize the autocorrelation of runoff thus resulting in an obviously better performance than other models in dry seasons therefore it is recommended to combine sar 1 and aeemd ann models to forecast monthly runoff in yangtze river basin where the aeemd ann model is used in flood seasons and the sar 1 model is used in dry seasons respectively as a result the five performance evaluation indexes i e r ns rmse mare and mae in ertan cuntan and yichang stations can be improved significantly theoretically the sub series with different frequencies should have physical meanings we will try to combine regional geographical features and meteorological and climatic features to explain the physical meanings of each sub series in future studies on the other hand it remains a challenge to prolong the forecast leading time and how the forecast performance vary over leading time also needs to be elucidated acknowledgement this paper was jointly supported by the national key research and development

6921,sewer overflow is a priority concern for many cities owing to the high density of buildings and populations constructing new storage tanks in urban areas is getting more and more difficult therefore this paper proposes a novel inter catchment wastewater transfer icwt method for sewer overflow mitigation the icwt method aims at redistributing the spatial mismatched sewer flow according to the treatment capacity of wastewater treatment plant wwtp three tasks are involved in the development of icwt first test the effectiveness of icwt second study how to properly redistribute inflow to the wwtp third the operation of icwt highly depends on inflow to the wwtp to support the management of icwt it is imperative to construct a flow rate prediction model a hydraulic model is used for task 1 and 2 individual and combined effects of the storage tank and icwt on sewer overflow are investigated the simulation results show that less overflow is obtained in considering the deficiencies of hydraulic model one of the most promising deep learning techniques long short term memory lstm is employed to undertake task 3 experiments demonstrated that lstm could be of great use in predicting sewer flow keywords inter catchment wastewater transfer sewer overflow long short term memory deep learning 1 introduction sewer overflow refers to a condition in which untreated sewage is discharged directly into the environment from sewer outlets or bypass structures of the wastewater treatment plant wwtp when the sewage volume exceeds the capacity of the sewer system or wwtp more frequent sewer overflow can be expected with the increased impermeable surface extreme rainfall events and urbanization consequently better ways of mitigating sewer overflow will be required storage units such as retention basins or storage tanks are the most straightforward solution to reduce sewer overflow however constructing new storage units in metropolitan cities can be a complicated and costly task the locations and sizes of storage units are limited by densely populated urban space and need to be selected appropriately constructing storage units require significant investment besides the disruption to residences and businesses due to construction works cause social and economic cost ganora et al 2017 ngo et al 2016 the drawbacks of constructing new storage units have motivated the research for cost effective methods for mitigating sewer overflow these alternative approaches mainly focus on aggregating the spatial and temporal dynamic free space of the sewer system thus maximizing the capacity of the sewer system with minimum construction works several studies have been conducted to explore the in line storage capacities of sewer systems rather than construct new storage facilities darsono et al 2007 grum et al 2011 garofalo et al 2017 the in line storage control solution aims at exploiting the full storage capacity of the sewer system through regulating gates pumps and weirs for example in a less overloaded conduit a moveable weir could accumulate storm water temporarily by increasing the weir height during a rainfall event this approach could efficiently reduce infrastructure investments similarly sewer overflow can be mitigated by operating existing storage tanks proactively lee et al 2017 investigated a novel pump operating method for the storage tank on urban flood control in daerim sewer network seoul korea the operating method considers both the storage tank and sewer conduit it implements two monitoring nodes one in the storage tank and the other one in sewer conduit the pumps in a storage tank will proactively discharge reserved volume until the water level of the conduit rises up to the maximum level this method lets the existed storage tank accommodate to unprecedented flow rates and reduce flood successfully owing to the high density of urbanized areas in modern cities it is difficult to construct storage units or separate sewer systems in some developed cities deep tunnel systems have been used as an alternative solution the deep tunnel could temporally transport storm water and sewage during heavy rainfall events thereby reducing downstream peak flows in a recent case study in guangzhou city china engineers found that the deep tunnel could improve the flood control and drainage capacities of the basin successfully wu et al 2016 it can be summarized from the above literature that recently proposed methods for improving sewer management mainly emphasizes on intelligent control of existing sewer devices maximum utilization of sewer storage capacity or exploits the underground space summarizing previous studies a novel inter catchment wastewater transfer icwt method is proposed in this paper the idea of icwt is inspired by the concept of inter basin water transfer ibwt ibwt refers to transfer water from basins having sufficient water donor basin to basins facing water shortages receiving basin the purpose of ibwt is to counterpoise the uneven distribution of water resources and imbalanced water demand in different basins ibwt could create a win win situation by utilizing the differences of flow regime in different basins wang et al 2015 yevjevich 2001 since the 20 th century in order to meet growing residential commercial and agricultural demand many large scale ibwt projects have been proposed such as the south north water transfer project which aims to transfer 44 8 billion cubic meters of water annually from the yangtze river in southern china to the north this study generalizes the concept of ibwt to allocate inflow to wwtps in different catchments the icwt method takes both the sewer systems and wwtps into consideration most developed cities have more than one wwtps vrebos et al 2014 each of wwtps receives sewage collected from the sewer systems of the associated catchments these sewer systems and catchments have different behaviors against rainfall events the wwtps also have different treatment capabilities a catchment with a more overflowed wwtp can be regarded as the donor basin on the contrary a catchment with a less overflowed wwtp can be regarded as the receiving basin the essence of icwt is to address the spatial mismatch between sewer flow and wwtp treatment capacities in different catchments the development of the proposed icwt solution is a complex task in general there are three tasks in this study first the effectiveness of icwt method should be tested and compared with traditional solutions such as construct new storage tank task 1 second control rules should be derived to ensure adequate redistribution of the sewage stream task 2 third the operation of icwt involves a series of sewer control structures and highly depends on the flow information of its associated catchment it is imperative to forecast inflow to the wwtp thus providing sufficient response time and enhancing icwt control task 3 liu et al 2016 chen et al 2014 duchesne et al 2001 in this study the hydraulic model is used for task 1 and 2 hydraulic models are the most common tools in terms of design and test sewer control autixier et al 2014 lucas et al 2015 seggelke et al 2005 hydraulic models can supply high quality information about the sewer system s behavior and give insight into the effects of different control strategies chiang et al 2010 so that the output of hydraulic models is suitable for hydraulic planning and design however hydraulic models require complete knowledge of sewer systems and rainfall patterns it can only provide sewer hydraulic information based on current or previous rainfall events additionally the calibration of hydraulic models requires adjusting many parameters carrying out simulations by using hydraulic models demands manual operation for a large sewer system the hydraulic model also needs long computational time these features make hydraulic models limited adequate for application in task 3 el din et al 2002 to predict sewer flow and enable real time operation task 3 deep learning is among the top methods unlike hydraulic models which adopt hydrological and hydraulic principles deep learning avoids sophisticated theories by making data driven predictions through learning from data as a breakthrough of artificial neural network deep learning has solved problems that have resisted artificial intelligence for decades one exciting news of deep learning is google deepmind s alphago silver et al 2016 beat the world s best human go game player ke jie in 2017 a deep learning technique that has made revolutionary strides in the sequential data modeling domain is the long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the latest google translation system powered by lstm has vastly improved the translation quality brought service nearly to the level of human translators google 2016 the information contained in language is a kind of sequential data when undertaking translation tasks the correct word to use depends on the context and the other words in the sentence or even paragraph time series data such as the inflow to the wwtp is also a kind of typical sequential data lstm has shown its superior performance for prediction of traffic time series ma et al 2015 and has been adopted by uber for extreme event ride requests forecasting laptev et al 2017 however to the best of the author s knowledge there are very few studies about the application of lstm in the water recourse related domain given the success of the lstm reported by both academia and industry the effectiveness of lstm need to be investigated in this paper lstm was employed to construct a model for wwtp inflow prediction to support the management of icwt combining the advantages of hydraulic models and machine learning deep learning methods is a trend in nowadays research yu et al 2013 chiang et al 2010 darsono et al 2007 the present work aims at describing a systematic sewer system management approach using icwt in order to improve the whole system behavior with minimal construction and looking at the efficiency of lstm on flow prediction the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the first part is a general description about study area hydraulic model and lstm the second part is simulation results for different control scenarios based on the hydraulic model the third part presents the prediction efficiency of the lstm conclusion and future envision are discussed at the end of this paper 2 method and materials 2 1 description of case study area and the proposed icwt scheme drammen is located in the southeast of norway with more than 150 000 inhabitants drammen is the fourth largest city in norway and the largest city and capital in buskerud county the catchment area of drammen s sewer system is around 15 km2 and the total length of the sewer system is approximately 500 km there are two wwtps in drammen the muusøya wwtp and the solumstrand wwtp fig 1 is an overview of the drammen city the traditional city center distributes along the drammen fjord there are two major catchments on the north bank of the drammen fjord the muusøya catchment and the bragernes catchment the curve in fig 1 a indicating the boundary of these two catchments the muusøya wwtp treat sewage collected from the muusøya catchment fig 1 b wastewater aggregated from the bragernes catchment is transported by the søren lemmich pump station fig 1 c from the north bank to the strømsø catchment which is on the south bank of drammen fjord afterward sewage stream merges with wastewater collected from the konnerud catchment and the kobbervikdalen catchment and finally discharged to the solumstrand wwtp to reduce overflow from the sewer system and the wwtps the government of the drammen city launched an innovative project regnbyge 3 m the ultimate goal of the regnbyge 3 m project is to integrates intelligent monitoring modeling and control solutions manage sewer system and wwtp in a holistic way the capacities of the sewer system and wwtps are unevenly distributed in different catchments of drammen more than 80 of sewer system in the muusøya catchment are combined sewer while combined sewer in the sewer system associated with solumstrand wwtp only accounts for less than 50 for muusøya wwtp the designed treatment capacity is 33 000 pe population equivalents the dimensioning flow qdim is 780 m3 h and the maximum flow qmax is 1200 m3 h the solumstrand wwtp is the major wwtp in drammen with a designed treatment capacity of 130 000 pe the qdim and qmax is 2000 m3 h and 4000 m3 h respectively moreover as a part of the traditional city center the muusøya catchment has a denser population than the rest of catchments because of combined sewer lower wwtp capacity and higher population density the muusøya wwtp is suffering from the severe overflow in the current phase the drammen municipality is planning to construct a storage tank to reduce overflow from the muusøya wwtp due to the high density of buildings there is very limited space for constructing storage tanks in the muusøya catchment suggested by experts the landfalloverløpet was selected as the appropriate location for the storage tank but the maximum dimension of the storage tank is restricted to 20 000 m3 which is insufficient to deal with the current overflow situation the icwt is proposed in order to compensate insufficient capacity of the storage tank the purpose of the icwt schemes is to convey part of the wwtp inflow from the muusøya wwtp to the solumstrand wwtp 2 2 the regnbyge no sewer monitoring system to monitor the sewer system in real time as well as provide data for model construction and calibration a web based sewer monitoring system called regnbyge no was developed at the beginning of the regnbyge 3m project the regnbyge no sewer monitoring system is comprised of water level sensors velocity sensors nivus gmbh germany and rain gauges deployed all around the drammen city the data collected by these sensors are transmitted to the data center of the rosim as a spatial database was designed to manage the collected data and ease the process of searching and editing data the collected data is visualized by a web based geographic information system gis which supplies a user friendly way to check the real time and historical information fig 2 is the screenshot of the regnbyge no sewer monitoring system please note that the flow shown in the user interface is calculated according to water level velocity and the pipe shapes 2 3 hydraulic model to test the effectiveness of icwt and derive proper control rules task 1 and 2 a full detailed hydraulic model with 9113 pipes 9094 manholes 129 weirs 78 pumps and 39 outlets is developed fig 3 is the hydraulic model for the drammen sewer system the sewer hydraulic model used in this study is rosie rosie is an arcgis additional application for planning sizing and modeling of water distribution and sewerage systems developed by rosim as the rosie software maintains the interface and all the functions of arcgis while using the mouse dhi as the computational engine to simulate the sewer system the runoff consists of two major components the fast response component frc and the slow response component src the frc is the direct response from rainfall which is calculated by the time area t a curve method in rosie runoff model a is selected in this study the src is the runoff generated gradually from the previous hydrological processes and accumulated as interflow and baseflow the rosie use the rainfall dependent infiltration rdi method to calculate src the pipe hydrodynamic hd flow is simulated by one dimension free surface saint venant continuity and momentum equations the mouse real time control rtc module is used to simulate sewer control in the mouse rtc module the operation of control structures such as pumps moveable weirs or orifices are designed by a curve that provides the relationship between water level h and water flow q there are two types of weirs available in rosie one type of weir define it as a structure that connects two sewer nodes and the other type of weir diverts sewage out of the system once the sewage level in the pipe exceeds the weir crest level sewer overflow is calculated by summarizing discharges from the latter type of weirs using the hd model 2 4 lstm this study employs a novel neural network architecture lstm to undertake task 3 inflow prediction for the muusøya wwtp the neural network is usually comprised of input layer hidden layer and output layer parameters that connect input values with hidden neurons as well as link hidden neurons with outputs called weights in the most widely used feedforward neural network ffnn the ffnn first computes a weighted sum of its input values and weights 1 s i 1 n w i x i b then the weighted sum s is fed into the hidden layer the hidden layer is made up of a number of hidden neurons which contain an activation function the hidden neurons transfer weighted sum s into output by using the activation function such as the sigmoid function 2 f s 1 1 e s in the above equations w i represents the weights x i is the input values b is the bias the lstm is a special type of recurrent neural network rnn fig 4 a is a schematic of the elman rnn elman 1990 which is one of the earliest rnn architecture rnn feeds not only the weighted sum of inputs and weights but also the states of the hidden neurons at the previous time steps into hidden neurons at the present time step as shown in fig 4 a the hidden neuron output at time step t is calculated by the equation 3 h t f w h h t 1 w i x t b where h t is state of the hidden neuron at the time step t h t 1 is state of the hidden neuron at the time step t 1 w i and w h are weights between input values and hidden neurons and between hidden neurons respectively f is the activation function usually neural network are trained by using the back propagation bp method bp use chain rule of differentiation to calculate the gradients of the error corresponding to the weights in ffnn bp propagates the error between predicted and observed values backward to the hidden layer then to the weights the neural network reduces differences between observed and predicted values through adjusting the weights the training of rnn uses an extended version of bp also known as backpropagation through time bptt bptt adjust w i and w h during training it means the chain rule of differentiation not only along the direction of hidden layer and input weights w i but also along previous time steps when using the bptt method because the error of derivation accumulates through time it will be extremely hard to learn and tune the parameters of the earlier layers because the gradient going through the network either gets very small and vanish or get very large and explode this is commonly known as the vanishing and exploding gradient problem different from rnn the lstm use a memory cell and three gates to control information in the hidden neuron the function of forget gate is to reset memory cell the input gate permits inputs to modify the memory cell state the output gate allows or obstructs the memory cell state from influencing other neurons the memory cell can impede outside interference which further allows the lstm to learn time series with long spans fig 4 b shows the hidden unit of lstm the i f and o in fig 4 denote the input forget and output gate the c and c represent the memory cell state and the new memory cell state the mathematical representation of lstm is written in the following equations input gate 4 i t σ g w i x t u i h t 1 v i c t 1 b i forget gate 5 f t σ g w f x t u f h t 1 v f c t 1 b f output gate 6 o t σ g w o x t u o h t 1 v o c t 1 b o cell state 7 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 8 c t σ c w c x t u c h t 1 b c output vector 9 h t o t σ h c t where x t is the input vector w u v and b are parameters for weights and bias represents the scalar product of two vectors σ g is the sigmoid function σ h and σ c are the hyperbolic tangent function for a given input z the output of the hyperbolic tangent function is 10 f z e z e z e z e z in this study the lstm is implemented using keras the docker toolbox is used to setup a development environment to let different deep learning software and libraries coexist and function correctly the jupyter notebook is used as the programming interface keras is a python based high level deep learning library it is running on top of tensorflow or theano tensorflow is used as the backend of keras in this study tensorflow is an open source deep learning software released by google in 2015 other python based machine learning libraries includes pandas numpy scikit learn and matplotlib are also used specifically pandas and numpy are used to load the dataset as the data frame and prepare the raw data in the format of the desired array scikit learn is used for model selection and preprocessing such as tuning parameters and data normalization matplotlib is used for visualization 2 5 model performance criteria three

historical flow data obtained from the regnbyge no sewer monitoring system is used to validate the hydraulic model fig 5 shows the hydrographs of the hydraulic model outputs versus the recorded values at five monitoring sites the recorded values cover both dry weather season and wet weather season it clearly indicates that the flow rate simulated by the hydraulic model is consistent with the real values table 1 is the model performance criteria of the hydraulic model all the criteria show acceptable values results displayed in fig 5 and table 1 confirm the high reliability of the hydraulic model simulations the calibrated model is then used in the following scenario analyses 3 2 scenario simulations of the hydraulic model the observed precipitation in 2014 with a temporal resolution of 1 min is used for the hydraulic simulation the simulation runs continuously from jan 01 2014 to dec 31 2014 as a baseline scenario against different control scenarios the total overflow volume of the drammen sewer system for the baseline scenario is 2 096 668 m3 table 2 shows the simulated overflow volume through weirs associated to the muusøya wwtp under the baseline scenario the 507 landfall is the major bypass structure of the muusøya wwtp which is the weir that takes away most of the peak flows to the muusøya wwtp the simulation result illustrates that weirs relate to the muusøya wwtp contribute 22 7 of the total overflow as the baseline scenario simulation indicates implement overflow control solutions towards the muusøya wwtp could bring the most immediate and significant result table 3 is simulated overflow volume in every month of 2014 one can observe that the overflow volume is significantly higher during the rainy season of drammen from june to august in order to test the feasibility of icwt and compare its efficiency with the storage tank seven control scenarios are designed table 4 gives a description of different control scenarios the main goal of the control is to 1 reduce the total overflow 2 reduce overflow from the muusøya wwtp and 3 avoid bringing extra burden to the solumstrand wwtp in the control scenarios the distribution of sewage is determined according to the principal of the greedy algorithm greedy algorithm refers to for the solution to a problem builds up a solution step by step always taking the action that gets the most immediate benefit at the next step local optimal solution within the specified constraints step by step rather than considering the global optimum cormen 2009 according to the principal of the greedy algorithm the control structures such as pump first maximum inflow to muusøya wwtp during peak flow events as it is the easiest way to deal with peak flow if the influent flow rate exceeds the maximum designed treatment capacity of the muusøya wwtp the exceeded volume is drained to the storage tank except scenario 4 which activate icwt directly if the storage tank is still insufficient to dealing with the inflow for scenario 5 7 the icwt is activated to divert sewage to the adjacent brageners catchment the impact of the different control scenarios on the total overflow is investigated fig 6 displays the reduction of total overflow volume compare with the baseline scenario table 5 lists the percentage of total overflow reduction of control scenarios compare with the baseline scenario as expected no matter only use storage tank or applying the icwt all seven control scenarios reduced overflow volume compare with the baseline scenario there is a clear tradeoff between storage tank sizes and overflow volume with the total overflow decreasing as the storage tank size increases with the smallest storage tank dimension the total overflow of scenario 1 is close to the baseline scenario the relative percentage is only 1 20 which indicates that the effect of scenario 1 is not distinct when the storage tank is built with the maximum available size of 20000 m3 scenario 3 the overflow reduction is 258 895 m3 a reduction of 12 35 the storage tank is less efficient compared with icwt as shown in fig 6 in scenario 1 and scenario 2 using a storage tank with a volume of 1000 m3 and 5000 m3 the volume of reduced overflow is less than only implementing the icwt scenario 4 scenario 4 with only icwt implemented gives an overflow reduction of 120 504 m3 5 75 less than the total overflow volume of the baseline scenario icwt enhances the capability of the storage tank dramatically overflow reduction of scenario 1 and scenario 2 increase from 25 146 m3 and 95 412 m3 to 141 741 m3 scenario 5 and 201 011 m3 scenario 6 respectively scenario 7 yields the highest overflow reduction i e a reduction of 15 51 nevertheless it should be noticed that using a storage tank of 5000 m3 only one fourth of the maximum dimension used by scenario 7 scenario 6 achieves over half the effect of scenario 7 i e 9 6 although implementing storage tank and icwt resulted in significant reduction of total overflow one obvious concern for icwt is whether it will bring extra burden to the solumstrand wwtp the volume of overflow from the bypass structures of the two wwtps under different scenarios is listed in table 6 the overflow from the bypass structure of muusøya wwtp is reduced substantially for the solumstrand wwtp the impact of icwt is almost negligible table7 is the total overflow volume of different control scenarios from march to november it can be seen that the overflow reduction is most significant during the rainy season of drammen 3 3 lstm the hydraulic simulations of the eight scenarios clearly demonstrate the viability of icwt however since these hydraulic simulations are based on perfect foreknowledge of the rainfall events they cannot be implemented for the actual real time purpose to achieve successful control of the storage tank and icwt the overflow control facilities should open close timely in order to redistribute wwtp inflow for the better operation of the storage tank and icwt it is essential to anticipate the future wwtp inflow thus enhancing decision making and giving enough response time for the operation to overcome the aforementioned disadvantages of hydraulic model and traditional neural network lstm is employed to predict inflow to the muusøya wwtp the training data for lstm development were collected from jan 1 2014 to dec 31 2014 with a temporal resolution of 1 min the raw data have over 500 000 records to validate the generalization ability of the proposed lstm algorithm the raw data are divided into two subsets training set and testing set data from the first 75 is used for training and the remaining 25 is used for testing the difference between training and testing is regularization mechanisms which is used as penalize to limit overfitting are turned off during the testing stage table 8 is summarized statistics of the training data considering technical details of the pump operation the proposed models aim at predicting flow rate in the next hour based on the flow rate and rainfall in the past hour during dry weather the flow rate is stable and the pump can be operated at a lower frequency while during wet weather it is essential to predicate flow rate with a higher resolution to fulfill pump operation requirements the raw data is resampled to frequencies of 10 min 15 min half hour and one hour models with corresponding frequencies are developed there are primarily four modes of lstm application karpathy 2016 the one to one mode such as image classification have one input image and one output image label the one to many mode generates many outputs using one input e g image captioning which takes an image and outputs a sentence of words the many to one mode receive sequence input and output one label e g sentiment analysis where a given sentence is classified as expressing positive or negative sentiment the many to many mode or sequence to sequence abbreviated as seq2seq is the method for machine translation or chat robot with a sentence in one language as input and a sentence in the target language as output the one hour frequency model is defined as a one to one problem i e predicting flow rate of the next hour by using the values from the previous hour lstm models with other three frequencies are defined as a seq2seq problem zaytar et al 2016 e g for the 10 min frequency data the model uses the values of the past 6 steps to predict the next 6 steps several state of the art techniques such as dropout and rmsprop are used to optimize the lstm dropout hinton et al 2012 is a simple but effective way to increase the generalization ability of neural network traditional neural network training usually uses the ensemble method to prevent overfitting but it could significantly increase cpu consumption the key idea of dropout is temporary discard part of units either hidden neurons or visible inputs from the neural network during training dropout generates a number of different thinned networks during training and in the testing stage a single un thinned network is used srivastava et al 2014 rmsprop is an unpublished adaptive learning rate method proposed by geoff hinton in lecture 6e of his coursera course rmsprop utilizes the magnitude of recent gradients to normalize the gradients and keeps a moving average over the root mean squared gradients for each weight rmsprop also divides the learning rate by an exponentially decaying average of squared gradients through trial and error experiments the final lstm architecture used in this paper has three hidden layers with 10 lstm units in each hidden layer dropout layer is implemented between hidden layers after ascertaining the optimum structure of lstm the model is used to predict the inflow to the muusøya wwtp furthermore the lstm is compared with two of the most widely used machine learning models in the water resource field ffnn and support vector regression svr to make a fair comparison the ffnn remains the same deep structure with lstm the kernels and parameters of svr are confirmed using the grid search method the optimal svr used in this study is an rbf kernel svr with a gamma value of 0 5 and c value of 5 table 9 presents the model performance the results imply that lstm outperforms ffnn and svr lstm produces a high nse value close to 0 95 high r2 value higher than 0 93 and low rmse value around 0 02 the values of the three criteria indicate that the lstm has the ability to predict highly nonlinear and variable time series such as wwtp inflow to illustrate the performance of the developed lstm ffnn and svr models in a more intuitive way hydrographs of ground truth gt versus forecasted flow from nov 7 2014 to nov 12 2014 are drawn in fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 that lstm is capable of predicting the inflow to the muusøya wwtp in spite of significant variations in flow rate during these days the lstm is able to capture the major trends and peaks of observations while the ffnn model underestimates the peak value it also can be observed that for the periods of rainfall the lstm anticipate two increases in flow rate timely while the svr presents a time delay problem 4 discussion and conclusion the increase of urbanization and extreme rainfall events are inducing more frequent sewer overflow at the same time the treatment capacity of wwtp also

predictions for sewer system management lstm can be a powerful tool for managers or engineers of the sewer system who can take advantage of the prediction to improve their decision making intelligent urban infrastructures will become the backbone of future cities sensors actuators and algorithms are integrating together to enhance important infrastructures such as sewer system or wwtp there are many possible scenarios to complement urban infrastructure control with deep learning in recent years deep learning methods such as lstm are gaining more and more successes in many industries however the sophisticated mathematical knowledge and programming skill behind deep learning limit its application in the water resource field even so the potential power of deep learning still fascinating and more studies about absorbing deep learning into the water resource field is necessary acknowledgements this work has been supported by the regnbyge 3m project grant number 234974 which is granted by

6921,sewer overflow is a priority concern for many cities owing to the high density of buildings and populations constructing new storage tanks in urban areas is getting more and more difficult therefore this paper proposes a novel inter catchment wastewater transfer icwt method for sewer overflow mitigation the icwt method aims at redistributing the spatial mismatched sewer flow according to the treatment capacity of wastewater treatment plant wwtp three tasks are involved in the development of icwt first test the effectiveness of icwt second study how to properly redistribute inflow to the wwtp third the operation of icwt highly depends on inflow to the wwtp to support the management of icwt it is imperative to construct a flow rate prediction model a hydraulic model is used for task 1 and 2 individual and combined effects of the storage tank and icwt on sewer overflow are investigated the simulation results show that less overflow is obtained in considering the deficiencies of hydraulic model one of the most promising deep learning techniques long short term memory lstm is employed to undertake task 3 experiments demonstrated that lstm could be of great use in predicting sewer flow keywords inter catchment wastewater transfer sewer overflow long short term memory deep learning 1 introduction sewer overflow refers to a condition in which untreated sewage is discharged directly into the environment from sewer outlets or bypass structures of the wastewater treatment plant wwtp when the sewage volume exceeds the capacity of the sewer system or wwtp more frequent sewer overflow can be expected with the increased impermeable surface extreme rainfall events and urbanization consequently better ways of mitigating sewer overflow will be required storage units such as retention basins or storage tanks are the most straightforward solution to reduce sewer overflow however constructing new storage units in metropolitan cities can be a complicated and costly task the locations and sizes of storage units are limited by densely populated urban space and need to be selected appropriately constructing storage units require significant investment besides the disruption to residences and businesses due to construction works cause social and economic cost ganora et al 2017 ngo et al 2016 the drawbacks of constructing new storage units have motivated the research for cost effective methods for mitigating sewer overflow these alternative approaches mainly focus on aggregating the spatial and temporal dynamic free space of the sewer system thus maximizing the capacity of the sewer system with minimum construction works several studies have been conducted to explore the in line storage capacities of sewer systems rather than construct new storage facilities darsono et al 2007 grum et al 2011 garofalo et al 2017 the in line storage control solution aims at exploiting the full storage capacity of the sewer system through regulating gates pumps and weirs for example in a less overloaded conduit a moveable weir could accumulate storm water temporarily by increasing the weir height during a rainfall event this approach could efficiently reduce infrastructure investments similarly sewer overflow can be mitigated by operating existing storage tanks proactively lee et al 2017 investigated a novel pump operating method for the storage tank on urban flood control in daerim sewer network seoul korea the operating method considers both the storage tank and sewer conduit it implements two monitoring nodes one in the storage tank and the other one in sewer conduit the pumps in a storage tank will proactively discharge reserved volume until the water level of the conduit rises up to the maximum level this method lets the existed storage tank accommodate to unprecedented flow rates and reduce flood successfully owing to the high density of urbanized areas in modern cities it is difficult to construct storage units or separate sewer systems in some developed cities deep tunnel systems have been used as an alternative solution the deep tunnel could temporally transport storm water and sewage during heavy rainfall events thereby reducing downstream peak flows in a recent case study in guangzhou city china engineers found that the deep tunnel could improve the flood control and drainage capacities of the basin successfully wu et al 2016 it can be summarized from the above literature that recently proposed methods for improving sewer management mainly emphasizes on intelligent control of existing sewer devices maximum utilization of sewer storage capacity or exploits the underground space summarizing previous studies a novel inter catchment wastewater transfer icwt method is proposed in this paper the idea of icwt is inspired by the concept of inter basin water transfer ibwt ibwt refers to transfer water from basins having sufficient water donor basin to basins facing water shortages receiving basin the purpose of ibwt is to counterpoise the uneven distribution of water resources and imbalanced water demand in different basins ibwt could create a win win situation by utilizing the differences of flow regime in different basins wang et al 2015 yevjevich 2001 since the 20 th century in order to meet growing residential commercial and agricultural demand many large scale ibwt projects have been proposed such as the south north water transfer project which aims to transfer 44 8 billion cubic meters of water annually from the yangtze river in southern china to the north this study generalizes the concept of ibwt to allocate inflow to wwtps in different catchments the icwt method takes both the sewer systems and wwtps into consideration most developed cities have more than one wwtps vrebos et al 2014 each of wwtps receives sewage collected from the sewer systems of the associated catchments these sewer systems and catchments have different behaviors against rainfall events the wwtps also have different treatment capabilities a catchment with a more overflowed wwtp can be regarded as the donor basin on the contrary a catchment with a less overflowed wwtp can be regarded as the receiving basin the essence of icwt is to address the spatial mismatch between sewer flow and wwtp treatment capacities in different catchments the development of the proposed icwt solution is a complex task in general there are three tasks in this study first the effectiveness of icwt method should be tested and compared with traditional solutions such as construct new storage tank task 1 second control rules should be derived to ensure adequate redistribution of the sewage stream task 2 third the operation of icwt involves a series of sewer control structures and highly depends on the flow information of its associated catchment it is imperative to forecast inflow to the wwtp thus providing sufficient response time and enhancing icwt control task 3 liu et al 2016 chen et al 2014 duchesne et al 2001 in this study the hydraulic model is used for task 1 and 2 hydraulic models are the most common tools in terms of design and test sewer control autixier et al 2014 lucas et al 2015 seggelke et al 2005 hydraulic models can supply high quality information about the sewer system s behavior and give insight into the effects of different control strategies chiang et al 2010 so that the output of hydraulic models is suitable for hydraulic planning and design however hydraulic models require complete knowledge of sewer systems and rainfall patterns it can only provide sewer hydraulic information based on current or previous rainfall events additionally the calibration of hydraulic models requires adjusting many parameters carrying out simulations by using hydraulic models demands manual operation for a large sewer system the hydraulic model also needs long computational time these features make hydraulic models limited adequate for application in task 3 el din et al 2002 to predict sewer flow and enable real time operation task 3 deep learning is among the top methods unlike hydraulic models which adopt hydrological and hydraulic principles deep learning avoids sophisticated theories by making data driven predictions through learning from data as a breakthrough of artificial neural network deep learning has solved problems that have resisted artificial intelligence for decades one exciting news of deep learning is google deepmind s alphago silver et al 2016 beat the world s best human go game player ke jie in 2017 a deep learning technique that has made revolutionary strides in the sequential data modeling domain is the long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the latest google translation system powered by lstm has vastly improved the translation quality brought service nearly to the level of human translators google 2016 the information contained in language is a kind of sequential data when undertaking translation tasks the correct word to use depends on the context and the other words in the sentence or even paragraph time series data such as the inflow to the wwtp is also a kind of typical sequential data lstm has shown its superior performance for prediction of traffic time series ma et al 2015 and has been adopted by uber for extreme event ride requests forecasting laptev et al 2017 however to the best of the author s knowledge there are very few studies about the application of lstm in the water recourse related domain given the success of the lstm reported by both academia and industry the effectiveness of lstm need to be investigated in this paper lstm was employed to construct a model for wwtp inflow prediction to support the management of icwt combining the advantages of hydraulic models and machine learning deep learning methods is a trend in nowadays research yu et al 2013 chiang et al 2010 darsono et al 2007 the present work aims at describing a systematic sewer system management approach using icwt in order to improve the whole system behavior with minimal construction and looking at the efficiency of lstm on flow prediction the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the first part is a general description about study area hydraulic model and lstm the second part is simulation results for different control scenarios based on the hydraulic model the third part presents the prediction efficiency of the lstm conclusion and future envision are discussed at the end of this paper 2 method and materials 2 1 description of case study area and the proposed icwt scheme drammen is located in the southeast of norway with more than 150 000 inhabitants drammen is the fourth largest city in norway and the largest city and capital in buskerud county the catchment area of drammen s sewer system is around 15 km2 and the total length of the sewer system is approximately 500 km there are two wwtps in drammen the muusøya wwtp and the solumstrand wwtp fig 1 is an overview of the drammen city the traditional city center distributes along the drammen fjord there are two major catchments on the north bank of the drammen fjord the muusøya catchment and the bragernes catchment the curve in fig 1 a indicating the boundary of these two catchments the muusøya wwtp treat sewage collected from the muusøya catchment fig 1 b wastewater aggregated from the bragernes catchment is transported by the søren lemmich pump station fig 1 c from the north bank to the strømsø catchment which is on the south bank of drammen fjord afterward sewage stream merges with wastewater collected from the konnerud catchment and the kobbervikdalen catchment and finally discharged to the solumstrand wwtp to reduce overflow from the sewer system and the wwtps the government of the drammen city launched an innovative project regnbyge 3 m the ultimate goal of the regnbyge 3 m project is to integrates intelligent monitoring modeling and control solutions manage sewer system and wwtp in a holistic way the capacities of the sewer system and wwtps are unevenly distributed in different catchments of drammen more than 80 of sewer system in the muusøya catchment are combined sewer while combined sewer in the sewer system associated with solumstrand wwtp only accounts for less than 50 for muusøya wwtp the designed treatment capacity is 33 000 pe population equivalents the dimensioning flow qdim is 780 m3 h and the maximum flow qmax is 1200 m3 h the solumstrand wwtp is the major wwtp in drammen with a designed treatment capacity of 130 000 pe the qdim and qmax is 2000 m3 h and 4000 m3 h respectively moreover as a part of the traditional city center the muusøya catchment has a denser population than the rest of catchments because of combined sewer lower wwtp capacity and higher population density the muusøya wwtp is suffering from the severe overflow in the current phase the drammen municipality is planning to construct a storage tank to reduce overflow from the muusøya wwtp due to the high density of buildings there is very limited space for constructing storage tanks in the muusøya catchment suggested by experts the landfalloverløpet was selected as the appropriate location for the storage tank but the maximum dimension of the storage tank is restricted to 20 000 m3 which is insufficient to deal with the current overflow situation the icwt is proposed in order to compensate insufficient capacity of the storage tank the purpose of the icwt schemes is to convey part of the wwtp inflow from the muusøya wwtp to the solumstrand wwtp 2 2 the regnbyge no sewer monitoring system to monitor the sewer system in real time as well as provide data for model construction and calibration a web based sewer monitoring system called regnbyge no was developed at the beginning of the regnbyge 3m project the regnbyge no sewer monitoring system is comprised of water level sensors velocity sensors nivus gmbh germany and rain gauges deployed all around the drammen city the data collected by these sensors are transmitted to the data center of the rosim as a spatial database was designed to manage the collected data and ease the process of searching and editing data the collected data is visualized by a web based geographic information system gis which supplies a user friendly way to check the real time and historical information fig 2 is the screenshot of the regnbyge no sewer monitoring system please note that the flow shown in the user interface is calculated according to water level velocity and the pipe shapes 2 3 hydraulic model to test the effectiveness of icwt and derive proper control rules task 1 and 2 a full detailed hydraulic model with 9113 pipes 9094 manholes 129 weirs 78 pumps and 39 outlets is developed fig 3 is the hydraulic model for the drammen sewer system the sewer hydraulic model used in this study is rosie rosie is an arcgis additional application for planning sizing and modeling of water distribution and sewerage systems developed by rosim as the rosie software maintains the interface and all the functions of arcgis while using the mouse dhi as the computational engine to simulate the sewer system the runoff consists of two major components the fast response component frc and the slow response component src the frc is the direct response from rainfall which is calculated by the time area t a curve method in rosie runoff model a is selected in this study the src is the runoff generated gradually from the previous hydrological processes and accumulated as interflow and baseflow the rosie use the rainfall dependent infiltration rdi method to calculate src the pipe hydrodynamic hd flow is simulated by one dimension free surface saint venant continuity and momentum equations the mouse real time control rtc module is used to simulate sewer control in the mouse rtc module the operation of control structures such as pumps moveable weirs or orifices are designed by a curve that provides the relationship between water level h and water flow q there are two types of weirs available in rosie one type of weir define it as a structure that connects two sewer nodes and the other type of weir diverts sewage out of the system once the sewage level in the pipe exceeds the weir crest level sewer overflow is calculated by summarizing discharges from the latter type of weirs using the hd model 2 4 lstm this study employs a novel neural network architecture lstm to undertake task 3 inflow prediction for the muusøya wwtp the neural network is usually comprised of input layer hidden layer and output layer parameters that connect input values with hidden neurons as well as link hidden neurons with outputs called weights in the most widely used feedforward neural network ffnn the ffnn first computes a weighted sum of its input values and weights 1 s i 1 n w i x i b then the weighted sum s is fed into the hidden layer the hidden layer is made up of a number of hidden neurons which contain an activation function the hidden neurons transfer weighted sum s into output by using the activation function such as the sigmoid function 2 f s 1 1 e s in the above equations w i represents the weights x i is the input values b is the bias the lstm is a special type of recurrent neural network rnn fig 4 a is a schematic of the elman rnn elman 1990 which is one of the earliest rnn architecture rnn feeds not only the weighted sum of inputs and weights but also the states of the hidden neurons at the previous time steps into hidden neurons at the present time step as shown in fig 4 a the hidden neuron output at time step t is calculated by the equation 3 h t f w h h t 1 w i x t b where h t is state of the hidden neuron at the time step t h t 1 is state of the hidden neuron at the time step t 1 w i and w h are weights between input values and hidden neurons and between hidden neurons respectively f is the activation function usually neural network are trained by using the back propagation bp method bp use chain rule of differentiation to calculate the gradients of the error corresponding to the weights in ffnn bp propagates the error between predicted and observed values backward to the hidden layer then to the weights the neural network reduces differences between observed and predicted values through adjusting the weights the training of rnn uses an extended version of bp also known as backpropagation through time bptt bptt adjust w i and w h during training it means the chain rule of differentiation not only along the direction of hidden layer and input weights w i but also along previous time steps when using the bptt method because the error of derivation accumulates through time it will be extremely hard to learn and tune the parameters of the earlier layers because the gradient going through the network either gets very small and vanish or get very large and explode this is commonly known as the vanishing and exploding gradient problem different from rnn the lstm use a memory cell and three gates to control information in the hidden neuron the function of forget gate is to reset memory cell the input gate permits inputs to modify the memory cell state the output gate allows or obstructs the memory cell state from influencing other neurons the memory cell can impede outside interference which further allows the lstm to learn time series with long spans fig 4 b shows the hidden unit of lstm the i f and o in fig 4 denote the input forget and output gate the c and c represent the memory cell state and the new memory cell state the mathematical representation of lstm is written in the following equations input gate 4 i t σ g w i x t u i h t 1 v i c t 1 b i forget gate 5 f t σ g w f x t u f h t 1 v f c t 1 b f output gate 6 o t σ g w o x t u o h t 1 v o c t 1 b o cell state 7 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 8 c t σ c w c x t u c h t 1 b c output vector 9 h t o t σ h c t where x t is the input vector w u v and b are parameters for weights and bias represents the scalar product of two vectors σ g is the sigmoid function σ h and σ c are the hyperbolic tangent function for a given input z the output of the hyperbolic tangent function is 10 f z e z e z e z e z in this study the lstm is implemented using keras the docker toolbox is used to setup a development environment to let different deep learning software and libraries coexist and function correctly the jupyter notebook is used as the programming interface keras is a python based high level deep learning library it is running on top of tensorflow or theano tensorflow is used as the backend of keras in this study tensorflow is an open source deep learning software released by google in 2015 other python based machine learning libraries includes pandas numpy scikit learn and matplotlib are also used specifically pandas and numpy are used to load the dataset as the data frame and prepare the raw data in the format of the desired array scikit learn is used for model selection and preprocessing such as tuning parameters and data normalization matplotlib is used for visualization 2 5 model performance criteria three

historical flow data obtained from the regnbyge no sewer monitoring system is used to validate the hydraulic model fig 5 shows the hydrographs of the hydraulic model outputs versus the recorded values at five monitoring sites the recorded values cover both dry weather season and wet weather season it clearly indicates that the flow rate simulated by the hydraulic model is consistent with the real values table 1 is the model performance criteria of the hydraulic model all the criteria show acceptable values results displayed in fig 5 and table 1 confirm the high reliability of the hydraulic model simulations the calibrated model is then used in the following scenario analyses 3 2 scenario simulations of the hydraulic model the observed precipitation in 2014 with a temporal resolution of 1 min is used for the hydraulic simulation the simulation runs continuously from jan 01 2014 to dec 31 2014 as a baseline scenario against different control scenarios the total overflow volume of the drammen sewer system for the baseline scenario is 2 096 668 m3 table 2 shows the simulated overflow volume through weirs associated to the muusøya wwtp under the baseline scenario the 507 landfall is the major bypass structure of the muusøya wwtp which is the weir that takes away most of the peak flows to the muusøya wwtp the simulation result illustrates that weirs relate to the muusøya wwtp contribute 22 7 of the total overflow as the baseline scenario simulation indicates implement overflow control solutions towards the muusøya wwtp could bring the most immediate and significant result table 3 is simulated overflow volume in every month of 2014 one can observe that the overflow volume is significantly higher during the rainy season of drammen from june to august in order to test the feasibility of icwt and compare its efficiency with the storage tank seven control scenarios are designed table 4 gives a description of different control scenarios the main goal of the control is to 1 reduce the total overflow 2 reduce overflow from the muusøya wwtp and 3 avoid bringing extra burden to the solumstrand wwtp in the control scenarios the distribution of sewage is determined according to the principal of the greedy algorithm greedy algorithm refers to for the solution to a problem builds up a solution step by step always taking the action that gets the most immediate benefit at the next step local optimal solution within the specified constraints step by step rather than considering the global optimum cormen 2009 according to the principal of the greedy algorithm the control structures such as pump first maximum inflow to muusøya wwtp during peak flow events as it is the easiest way to deal with peak flow if the influent flow rate exceeds the maximum designed treatment capacity of the muusøya wwtp the exceeded volume is drained to the storage tank except scenario 4 which activate icwt directly if the storage tank is still insufficient to dealing with the inflow for scenario 5 7 the icwt is activated to divert sewage to the adjacent brageners catchment the impact of the different control scenarios on the total overflow is investigated fig 6 displays the reduction of total overflow volume compare with the baseline scenario table 5 lists the percentage of total overflow reduction of control scenarios compare with the baseline scenario as expected no matter only use storage tank or applying the icwt all seven control scenarios reduced overflow volume compare with the baseline scenario there is a clear tradeoff between storage tank sizes and overflow volume with the total overflow decreasing as the storage tank size increases with the smallest storage tank dimension the total overflow of scenario 1 is close to the baseline scenario the relative percentage is only 1 20 which indicates that the effect of scenario 1 is not distinct when the storage tank is built with the maximum available size of 20000 m3 scenario 3 the overflow reduction is 258 895 m3 a reduction of 12 35 the storage tank is less efficient compared with icwt as shown in fig 6 in scenario 1 and scenario 2 using a storage tank with a volume of 1000 m3 and 5000 m3 the volume of reduced overflow is less than only implementing the icwt scenario 4 scenario 4 with only icwt implemented gives an overflow reduction of 120 504 m3 5 75 less than the total overflow volume of the baseline scenario icwt enhances the capability of the storage tank dramatically overflow reduction of scenario 1 and scenario 2 increase from 25 146 m3 and 95 412 m3 to 141 741 m3 scenario 5 and 201 011 m3 scenario 6 respectively scenario 7 yields the highest overflow reduction i e a reduction of 15 51 nevertheless it should be noticed that using a storage tank of 5000 m3 only one fourth of the maximum dimension used by scenario 7 scenario 6 achieves over half the effect of scenario 7 i e 9 6 although implementing storage tank and icwt resulted in significant reduction of total overflow one obvious concern for icwt is whether it will bring extra burden to the solumstrand wwtp the volume of overflow from the bypass structures of the two wwtps under different scenarios is listed in table 6 the overflow from the bypass structure of muusøya wwtp is reduced substantially for the solumstrand wwtp the impact of icwt is almost negligible table7 is the total overflow volume of different control scenarios from march to november it can be seen that the overflow reduction is most significant during the rainy season of drammen 3 3 lstm the hydraulic simulations of the eight scenarios clearly demonstrate the viability of icwt however since these hydraulic simulations are based on perfect foreknowledge of the rainfall events they cannot be implemented for the actual real time purpose to achieve successful control of the storage tank and icwt the overflow control facilities should open close timely in order to redistribute wwtp inflow for the better operation of the storage tank and icwt it is essential to anticipate the future wwtp inflow thus enhancing decision making and giving enough response time for the operation to overcome the aforementioned disadvantages of hydraulic model and traditional neural network lstm is employed to predict inflow to the muusøya wwtp the training data for lstm development were collected from jan 1 2014 to dec 31 2014 with a temporal resolution of 1 min the raw data have over 500 000 records to validate the generalization ability of the proposed lstm algorithm the raw data are divided into two subsets training set and testing set data from the first 75 is used for training and the remaining 25 is used for testing the difference between training and testing is regularization mechanisms which is used as penalize to limit overfitting are turned off during the testing stage table 8 is summarized statistics of the training data considering technical details of the pump operation the proposed models aim at predicting flow rate in the next hour based on the flow rate and rainfall in the past hour during dry weather the flow rate is stable and the pump can be operated at a lower frequency while during wet weather it is essential to predicate flow rate with a higher resolution to fulfill pump operation requirements the raw data is resampled to frequencies of 10 min 15 min half hour and one hour models with corresponding frequencies are developed there are primarily four modes of lstm application karpathy 2016 the one to one mode such as image classification have one input image and one output image label the one to many mode generates many outputs using one input e g image captioning which takes an image and outputs a sentence of words the many to one mode receive sequence input and output one label e g sentiment analysis where a given sentence is classified as expressing positive or negative sentiment the many to many mode or sequence to sequence abbreviated as seq2seq is the method for machine translation or chat robot with a sentence in one language as input and a sentence in the target language as output the one hour frequency model is defined as a one to one problem i e predicting flow rate of the next hour by using the values from the previous hour lstm models with other three frequencies are defined as a seq2seq problem zaytar et al 2016 e g for the 10 min frequency data the model uses the values of the past 6 steps to predict the next 6 steps several state of the art techniques such as dropout and rmsprop are used to optimize the lstm dropout hinton et al 2012 is a simple but effective way to increase the generalization ability of neural network traditional neural network training usually uses the ensemble method to prevent overfitting but it could significantly increase cpu consumption the key idea of dropout is temporary discard part of units either hidden neurons or visible inputs from the neural network during training dropout generates a number of different thinned networks during training and in the testing stage a single un thinned network is used srivastava et al 2014 rmsprop is an unpublished adaptive learning rate method proposed by geoff hinton in lecture 6e of his coursera course rmsprop utilizes the magnitude of recent gradients to normalize the gradients and keeps a moving average over the root mean squared gradients for each weight rmsprop also divides the learning rate by an exponentially decaying average of squared gradients through trial and error experiments the final lstm architecture used in this paper has three hidden layers with 10 lstm units in each hidden layer dropout layer is implemented between hidden layers after ascertaining the optimum structure of lstm the model is used to predict the inflow to the muusøya wwtp furthermore the lstm is compared with two of the most widely used machine learning models in the water resource field ffnn and support vector regression svr to make a fair comparison the ffnn remains the same deep structure with lstm the kernels and parameters of svr are confirmed using the grid search method the optimal svr used in this study is an rbf kernel svr with a gamma value of 0 5 and c value of 5 table 9 presents the model performance the results imply that lstm outperforms ffnn and svr lstm produces a high nse value close to 0 95 high r2 value higher than 0 93 and low rmse value around 0 02 the values of the three criteria indicate that the lstm has the ability to predict highly nonlinear and variable time series such as wwtp inflow to illustrate the performance of the developed lstm ffnn and svr models in a more intuitive way hydrographs of ground truth gt versus forecasted flow from nov 7 2014 to nov 12 2014 are drawn in fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 that lstm is capable of predicting the inflow to the muusøya wwtp in spite of significant variations in flow rate during these days the lstm is able to capture the major trends and peaks of observations while the ffnn model underestimates the peak value it also can be observed that for the periods of rainfall the lstm anticipate two increases in flow rate timely while the svr presents a time delay problem 4 discussion and conclusion the increase of urbanization and extreme rainfall events are inducing more frequent sewer overflow at the same time the treatment capacity of wwtp also seriously affected efficient sewer management measures have to be applied to mitigate sewer overflow for existing sewer system although storage tank could supply a straightforward solution for overflow reduction their locations and dimensions are highly constrained in densely populated cities alternative solutions should be investigated this paper describes a novel icwt solution the effectiveness of icwt is evaluated by a case study for a real sewer system in drammen norway the hydraulic behaviors of the sewer system with different control scenarios are assessed using hydraulic model annual long simulations of eight scenarios show that the icwt could provide extra benefits for overflow mitigation this study also demonstrates that lstm is able to provide precise time series predictions for sewer system management lstm can be a powerful tool for managers or engineers of the sewer system who can take advantage of the prediction to improve their decision making intelligent urban infrastructures will become the backbone of future cities sensors actuators and algorithms are integrating together to enhance important infrastructures such as sewer system or wwtp there are many possible scenarios to complement urban infrastructure control with deep learning in recent years deep learning methods such as lstm are gaining more and more successes in many industries however the sophisticated mathematical knowledge and programming skill behind deep learning limit its application in the water resource field even so the potential power of deep learning still fascinating and more studies about absorbing deep learning into the water resource field is necessary acknowledgements this work has been supported by the regnbyge 3m project grant number 234974 which is granted by

6922,climate change will modify the availability of groundwater resources in the future thus the evaluation of average aquifer recharge from precipitation and its uncertainty becomes a key subject in determining suitable countrywide water policies the confident prediction of renewable groundwater resources requires an accurate evaluation of aquifer recharge over time and space especially in large territories with varied conditions for aquifer recharge such as continental spain this study asses impacts of future potential climatic change scenarios on distributed net aquifer recharge nar from precipitation over continental spain for this the used method 1 generates future time series of climatic variables precipitation temperature spatially distributed over the territory for potential aquifer recharge par and 2 simulates them within previously calibrated spatial par or nar recharge models from the available historical information to provide distributed par or nar time series the information employed comes from the spain02 project for the historical climatic data from alcalá and custodio 2014 2015 for the historical spatial nar and from the cordex eu project 2013 regional climate models rcms simulations for the future climate scenarios a distributed empirical precipitation recharge model is defined by using a regular 10km 10km grid and assuming that precipitation p and temperature t are the most important climatic variables determining par while their spatiotemporal variabilities determine the impacts of future potential climatic scenarios on renewable groundwater resources potential plausible pictures of future climate scenarios are defined by combining information coming from different rcms and general circulation models gcms downscaling techniques and ensemble hypothesis these scenarios were simulated within the used precipitation recharge model to estimate impacts on nar the results show that global mean nar decreases by 12 on average over continental spain over 99 8 of the territory a variable degree of recharge reduction is obtained the reduction is quite heterogeneously distributed in line with the variety of conditions for aquifer recharge over continental spain the standard deviation of annual mean nar will increase by 8 on average in the future the dependence of these changes regarding potential explanatory variables such as elevation and latitude was also analysed keywords aquifer recharge climate change scenarios hydrological impacts continental spain 1 introduction the evaluation of aquifer recharge from precipitation is essential to make a quantitative evaluation of renewable groundwater resources required to implement appropriate countrywide water policies freeze and cherry 1979 national ground water association 2004 potential and net aquifer recharge can be evaluated from a hydrological point of view potential aquifer recharge par refers to the fraction of precipitation p that infiltrates into the soil and percolates below the root zone it is expected to be greater than net aquifer recharge nar de vries and simmers 2002 andreu et al 2011 españa et al 2013 which is the fraction of recharge that reaches the water table after some delay smoothing out the variability inherent to precipitation events lerner et al 1990 batelaan and de smedt 2007 note that precipitation events include all the atmospheric water phases reaching the land surface such as rain snow dew fog etc for the purpose of assessing renewable groundwater resources the nar fraction is what matters alcalá and custodio 2014 aquifer recharge evaluation is a complex task subjected to significant uncertainties inferred by governing weather and physical variables as well as the choosing of appropriate techniques to cover different physical processes determining recharge milly and eagleson 1987 de vries and simmers 2002 clark et al 2011 aquifer recharge varies over space and time so the nar timing may vary from daily to weekly when the water table is shallow andreu et al 2011 to monthly to yearly in areas having a thick vadose zone alcalá et al 2011 for example the snow melting seasonal cycles may determine recharge rates and timing in mountainous areas simpson et al 1972 winograd et al 1998 earman et al 2006 the complexity of aquifer recharge evaluation increases when we intend to estimate potential impacts of long term climate variability aquifer recharge may be subjected to variation due to global driving forces such as climate change and local human actions such as land use transitions and this adds to the overall uncertainty in planning future evaluations under different climate scenarios the main statistics mean and standard deviation of natural recharge from precipitation over a long enough period should not change substantially unless they were influenced by climate or land use changes the steady behaviour of the cited main statistics declines when there is evidence of climate change milly et al 2008 pulido velázquez et al 2015 due to this complexity in evaluating aquifer recharge and taking into account that its direct measure is often unreliable over large spatial scales several techniques have been developed to evaluate aquifer recharge at different temporal and spatial scales ranging widely in complexity and cost lerner et al 1990 scanlon et al 2002 recharge estimates can be classified according to the hydrological zone to which recharge refers soil vadose zone and saturated zone and the technique employed physical tracer numerical modelling and empirical lerner et al 1990 scanlon et al 2002 2006 coes et al 2007 mcmahon et al 2011 on aquifer or catchment scales water balance techniques applied in the soil and in the vadose zone provide par estimates while tracer techniques hydrodynamic methods based on darcy s law and groundwater numerical models applied in the saturated zone provide nar estimates lerner et al 1990 batelaan and de smedt 2007 alcalá and custodio 2014 for large scale applications geographical information system gis can be coupled with lumped and distributed hydrological models to determine the spatial distribution of par or nar barthel 2006 minor et al 2007 batelaan and de smedt 2007 pulido velázquez et al 2015 several examples combine different techniques to establish the different timing of par and nar associated to the use of different techniques at different spatial scales nolan et al 2007 coes et al 2007 alcalá et al 2011 mcmahon et al 2011 the choice of one of these techniques depends on the objective of the study and the available data lerner et al 1990 scanlon et al 2002 islam et al 2016 in this paper the selection was based on the available distributed historical information about climatic variables spain02 project herrera et al 2016 for par and existing databases for nar alcalá and custodio 2015 in continental spain we will propose to apply an empirical modeling approach to assess yearly recharge for future potential climate scenarios in large scale areas such as continental spain the impact of climate change scenarios on groundwater is a topic that has produced a continuous interest in the research community since 1990s cf vaccaro 1992 edmunds and gaye 1994 bouraoui et al 1999 eckhardt and ulbrich 2003 chen et al 2004 scibek and allen 2006 jyrkama and sykes 2007 in recent years the number and relevance of the studies has shown a sharp increase cf di matteo et al 2011 green et al 2011 treidel et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 kløve et al 2014 cotterman et al 2017 di matteo et al 2017 gemitzi et al 2017 huang et al 2017 kidd 2017 mcintyre 2017 regarding the spatial scale most of the studies assessed the impacts of climate change on a specific groundwater flow system dragoni and sukhija 2008 molina et al 2013 pulido velazquez et al 2015 while a few encompassed regional groundwater flow systems impacts on groundwater were considered in some basin scale studies e g pulido velazquez et al 2011 herrmann et al 2016 escriva bou et al 2017 as well as for countries polemio 2016 or entire continents earman and dettinger 2011 panwar and chakrapani 2013 adhikari et al 2015 hartmann et al 2015 in this paper we propose a new systematic method to assess yearly impacts of future potential climate change scenarios on net aquifer recharge nar in large scale areas future potential climate scenarios are generated with a non equifeasible ensemble of downscaling projections coming from different rcms simulations these scenarios are propagated with a new distributed empirical recharge model to estimate nar from climatic fields it has been applied in continental spain an extensive and varied territory where no previous research work of this type has been performed the results which intend to be indicators of potential future plausible scenarios are obtained under a set of hypotheses that are listed and discussed within the paper this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the case study and available data section 3 presents the method used to assess potential impacts of future climatic scenarios on nar section 3 1 defines an empirical precipitation recharge model to simulate hydrological impacts from climatic variables p t section 3 2 describes the generation of future potential climatic scenarios section 3 3 describes the assessment of climate change impacts by simulating future potential climatic scenarios within a previously calibrated recharge model section 4 shows the results and discusses them finally section 5 presents the main conclusions 2 materials description of the case study and available data 2 1 case study continental spain continental spain lying between latitudes 36 and 44 n fig 1 occupies most 493 519 km2 of the iberian peninsula the rest belonging to continental portugal a large proportion of the territory is occupied by the relatively high elevation plains mesetas which lie at about 900 m a s l in the northern half of the country and about 700 m a s l in the southern half the mountain ranges that enclose them may exceed 2500 m of elevation the mesetas are characterised by a continental climate mimam 2000 which means hot dry summers and cold relatively wet winter spring seasons due to its varied geology continental spain has many relatively small yet high yielding aquifers the most important aquifers lie in plio quaternary sedimentary formations in the large river valleys and the quite extensive but compartmentalized triassic to tertiary carbonate massifs fig 1 the former consist of groundwater bodies surrounded by mountain ranges small alluvial and piedmont units and deltaic formations on infilled estuaries in coastal areas carbonate massifs are common occurring in quite extensive but compartmentalised areas along the northern eastern and southern mountain ranges igme 1993 in addition the weathered and fissured granite and palaeozoic shale formations in the northern southern and north eastern mountain ranges contain small aquifers of local significance the wide lithological orographic edaphic and climatic diversity of continental spain gives rise to a wide range of conditions for net aquifer recharge nar alcalá and custodio 2014 2015 2 2 historical climatic data for the period 1976 2005 historical climatic precipitation and temperature time series were taken from the spain02 project herrera et al 2016 which includes a large database of meteorological data covering continental spain precipitation p and temperature t show significant spatial heterogeneity due to the very different climatic conditions fig 2 mean p ranges from 2000 mm year 1 in the northern mountainous areas to about 500 600 mm year 1 over the northern meseta and 380 500 mm year 1 in the southern meseta fig 2a in the semiarid south eastern coastal areas and north eastern inland areas p is around 300 mm year 1 or less and sometimes as low as 180 mm year 1 mimam 2000 precipitation occurs mainly in late autumn and winter november to march associated with the circulation of cold air masses from the north atlantic ocean and deep pressure lows that travel eastwards and generate an inflow of air masses from the subtropical atlantic ocean trigo et al 2004 the eastern coast of spain may also receive precipitation from humid air masses over the western mediterranean sea especially in late summer and autumn which generally do not penetrate far inland martín vide and lópez bustins 2006 the annual mean t varies from 4 6 to 21 1 c fig 2b with minimums in january and maximums in august the daily t amplitude on a year may be as high as 50 c in the southern meseta and river valleys there is a pronounced gradient of t with elevation in mountain areas thus favouring the seasonal snow melting contribution to surface and groundwater bodies mimam 2000 2 3 historical recharge data the cmb method was recently used for determining spatial mean nar from precipitation and its uncertainty over continental spain by assuming long term steady conditions of the cmb variables atmospheric chloride bulk deposition chloride export flux by runoff and recharge water chloride content alcalá and custodio 2014 2015 other sources of natural recharge such as groundwater transferences among aquifers external runoff contribution and snow melting coming from others areas were not considered alcalá and custodio 2014 2015 alcalá and custodio 2014 2015 analysed the influence of hydraulic properties permeability and aquifer storage of different aquifer lithologies on nar estimates for local usage the hydrological meaning and reliability of distributed nar was determined by comparing them with local assumed trustable nar values the cmb variables were regionalised using ordinary kriging at the same 4976 nodes of a 10 km 10 km grid to estimate a mean nar value in each grid node two main sources of uncertainty affecting recharge induced by the inherent natural variability of the variables and from mapping of the cmb variables were identified and estimated alcalá and custodio 2014 while uncertainty from mapping may be reduced with better data coverage the part of the natural uncertainty inferred by the variable length of yearly data series was corrected by comparing them to existing long time series a data correction procedure was implemented to improve mean annual nar and its natural uncertainty deduced from variable length data series alcalá and custodio 2015 the critical balance period to reach comparable steady cmb averages and uncertainties was defined as around 10 years this period coincides with the decadal global climatic cycles acting over the iberian peninsula with imperfect 5 year positive and negative phases that follow the north atlantic oscillation trend hurrell 1995 trigo et al 2004 taking into account that 1 a minimum 10 year balance period is needed for reliable steady evaluations and 2 the cmb databases covered preferably the period 1994 2007 the historical 1996 2005 period covering a 10 year long nao climatic cycle with two successive 5 year long dry and wet phases was selected corrected cmb averages and natural uncertainties were regionalised mean annual nar varied from 14 to 813 mm year 1 with 90 ranging from 35 to 300 mm year 1 fig 3 a and the standard deviation of mean annual nar varied from 4 to 281 mm year 1 fig 3b 2 4 climatic model simulation data control and future scenarios several series of climatic data generated with different climatic model simulations performed in the cordex eu project 2013 were employed the most pessimistic emission scenario of the project representative concentration pathways 8 5 rcp8 5 was selected the simulations selected include results from five rcms cclm4 8 17 rca4 hirham5 racmo22e and wrf331f nested inside four different general circulation models gcm as shown in table 1 dimensionless spatial monthly mean relative differences between the control simulation and the historical p time series for an average year over the reference period 1976 2005 were obtained by means of an equi feasible ensemble of all rcms simulations fig 4 the relative difference distribution is negatively biased overall with a central set of values in the 0 7 range and extreme values of 0 87 in august and 1 33 in may except for october with a slightly positive average relative difference all months show negative differences which justifies applying some correction to the time series obtained from the rcms simulations the negative differences reach 0 4 in march in the northern half of the territory but not until july and august in southern and south eastern highlands areas characterised by dry continental and semiarid climates with evidence of active desertification martínez valderrama et al 2016 the summary of the spatial distribution of the mean impacts of climate change on p is represented using the dimensionless monthly relative differences between future 2016 2045 and control 1976 2005 time series by assuming equi feasible ensembles of all rcms simulations fig 5 the relative difference distribution is positively biased overall with central values in the 0 1 range and extreme values of 0 44 in june and 0 2 in october except for january with a slightly positive average relative difference each month shows negative or close to average differences with a very heterogeneous distribution the negative relative differences decrease to below 0 1 in spring and summer april to august in the southern and south western highlands 3 methods the methodology used to assess impacts of future potential climatic change scenarios on aquifer recharge nar from precipitation over continental spain is described in three steps 1 definition of an empirical distributed precipitation recharge model 2 generation of future potential time series of climatic variables p t spatially distributed over the territory and 3 assessment of future hydrological impacts on aquifer recharge 3 1 precipitation recharge model a distributed empirical precipitation recharge model is defined by using the 10 km 10 km grid to generate nar series from climate series in each grid cell the model instead of assessing recharge series by using exclusively p which is an approximation commonly applied kirn et al 2017 for example applying an infiltration coefficient to p is defined from the historical par time series estimated as difference in p and actual evapotranspiration aet time series pr recharge time series hereafter taking the positive relationship of temperature t and aet into account arora 2002 gerrits et al 2009 changes in t will determine the available non evaporative fraction of p available for aquifer recharge other factors susceptible to control aet in the future are not considered for instance evaporation is expected to increase with warming temperatures while transpiration may actually decline in some cases if the warming results from increased co2 due to co2 fertilization bazzaz and sombroek 1996 ward et al 1999 green et al 2007 and the vegetation cover transitions toward a more degraded condidion as expected in the western mediterranean region martínez valderrama 2018 and other mid terrestrial latitudes sun et al 2017 on the other hand warming climate can shift multiple days per year of snowfall to rain potentially altering recharge different non global empirical models could be applied to estimate the historical aet from p and t time series e g turc 1954 1961 coutagne 1954 budyko 1974 amongst others as described in beven 2007 arora 2002 gerrits et al 2009 and españa et al 2013 in this study the turc 1954 1961 model in which annual aet depends on annual t and p is applied in each grid cell as 1 aet p 0 9 p 2 l 2 where aet and p are in mmyear 1 and l 300 25 t 0 05 t 3 is a dimensionless parameter function of annual t the nar series are obtained in each cell by applying a model whose target is to produce a perturbation of the historical pr series to obtain a new series whose mean and standard deviation is equal to the nar series the model is defined with a correction function that is calibrated forcing that the perturbation of the historical pr series produces a new series whose mean and standard deviation is equal to the historical nar series data provided by alcalá and custodio 2014 the calibrated function will be applied to correct future pr series to obtain future nar series assuming that the bias correction or correction function will not change in the future the procedure involves the next steps 1 average change of mean and standard deviation of the pr and nar series for the same historical period 2 δ μ μ nar μ pr μ pr and δ σ σ nar σ pr σ pr where δ μ is the change in mean and δ σ is the change in standard deviation 2 standardization of the pr series historical and future 3 prn i pr i p r σ pr 3 generation of nar series from pr series 4 nar i σ c prn i μ c where 5 μ c μ pr 1 δ μ and σ c σ pr 1 δ σ when eq 4 is applied to the historical pr series the generated nar series have the same mean and standard deviation to the historical nar series of data provided by alcalá and custodio 2014 if it is applied to the future pr series future nar series will be obtained assuming that the bias remain invariant in the future the nar model was calibrated using pr recharge time series from historical climatic data section 2 2 and historical nar data from the cmb method section 2 3 for the period 1996 2005 two different hypotheses are assumed regarding the length of the pr recharge time series used to calibrate the precipitation recharge model the transformation function 1 the same period of recharge time series 1996 2005 called mod 1996 2005 or 2 a longer historical period 1976 2005 called mod 1976 2005 this hypothesis assumes that the statistics mean and standard deviation of nar time series from the cmb method for the period 1996 2005 and par time series generated from a longer historical period 1976 2005 do not differ substantially and can be considered identical this assumption is supported by assuming steady state conditions of the mean and standard deviation of the balance variables determining the historical recharge when simulating the period 1976 2005 with both mod 1976 2005 and mod 1996 2005 models the distributed mean annual recharge was 139 mm and 144 4 mm respectively thus the relative difference was less than 4 on average fig 6 the maps show a quite similar spatial distribution despite the mod 1976 2005 providing a slightly more smoothed estimate with lower maximum values 3 2 generation of future potential climatic scenarios we introduce a method to generate potential future short term horizon 2016 2045 climatic scenarios from the historical data 1976 2005 and the available climatic models simulations performed in the cordex eu project 2013 taking the uncertainty linked to these future scenarios into account for this a multi criteria analysis of the time series obtained by applying different correction techniques bias correction and delta change for downscaling the values obtained with the climatic model simulations was performed to identify the best fits to the historical data assuming equifeasible members or non equifeasible members see christensen and lettenmaier 2007 lopez et al 2009 pulido velázquez et al 2015 different ensembles of the obtained time series are used to achieve more representative future potential climate scenarios for assessing impacts on aquifer recharge 3 2 1 application of downscaling techniques bias correction and delta change approaches future scenarios of climatic variables for distributed par or nar over a territory have usually been generated by applying statistical downscaling techniques to the outputs of climatic models control and future scenarios and taking the values of these variables in the historical period into account rcms provide dynamic approaches with a spatial resolution of tens of kilometres they are nested inside general circulation models that have coarser spatial resolution hundreds of km of grid side in most cases the statistics of the series generated by rcms showed a bias regarding the real values and appropriate downscaling techniques are required to analyse impacts at the groundwater flow system scale depending on the problem several downscaling techniques of varying complexity and accuracy correction of first and second order moments regression approach quantile mapping etc were applied by assuming different conceptual approaches such as bias correction and delta change techniques räisänen and räty 2012 bias correction techniques aim to define a perturbation of the control time series to force some of their statistics closer to the historical ones they assume that the bias between statistics of the model and data will remain invariant in the future e g haerter et al 2011 watanabe et al 2012 stigter et al 2014 the delta change techniques assume that the rcms provide good assessments of the relative changes in the statistic between present and future but they do not thoroughly assess the absolute values they use the relative difference in the statistic of future and control simulations to perform a perturbation of the historical time series in accordance with these estimated changes e g pulido velazquez et al 2011 2015 räisänen and räty 2012 however the spatio temporal resolution between the historical and the control time series from rcms often differs usually the spatial resolution of historical datasets is greater than the spatial resolution of the rcms dataset so the transformations of both bias correction and delta change techniques indirectly produce downscaling approximations to the system the spatial resolution of the rcms is increased through the historical series in the case study this is the reason they are commonly known as downscaling transformations in this research two downscaling approaches were used correction of first and second order moments for both bias correction and delta change techniques these were applied to all the rcms simulations described in section 2 2 table 1 3 2 2 multi criteria analysis of the main statistic a multi criteria analysis analogous to those described in pulido velazquez et al 2011 escriva bou et al 2017 was used to identify the rcms simulations that provide the best approximation to the main statistics mean standard deviation of the historical time series it aims to identify the best rcms in terms of goodness of fit of the statistics of the control series to the historical ones to assess it we define an error index es see eq 6 that is applied to the main statistics mean and standard deviation for each rcm and climatic variable precipitation and temperature 6 es 1 n n s c s h s h 2 where es is the error of the considered statistic n is the length of the statistical time series c is the control simulation and h is the historical table 2 shows eliminated and non eliminated rcms after assessing es it in each cell we estimate the mean lumped value for our case study continental spain which will be employed to perform the multicriteria analysis it intends to find models that were inferior to others in terms of fitting the historical dataset dominated solutions in the terminology of multi objective analyses the models are then compared and those ones that were worse than any other model in all the statistics i e strictly dominated are the inferior one it has been also applied to identify the best combination of models and bias correction techniques in terms of goodness of fit of the corrected control scenarios to the basic statistics of the historical time series due to the fact that most combinations of models and bias correction techniques provide good approximations to the first and second moments a relative error threshold percentage difference with respect to the historical statistics was defined only significant differences were used to decide when a corrected control is worse than other ones table 3 shows the inferior and non inferior combinations of models and bias correction techniques for a 3 threshold of the mean relative error 3 2 3 prediction ensembles to define more representative future climatic scenarios four options to define more representative future scenarios by applying different ensembles of the potential scenarios deduced from the available climatic models were considered two ensemble scenarios were considered by combining as equifeasible members all the future series corresponding to different rcms simulations generated by bias correction e1 or delta change e2 two other options were defined by combining only the non inferior models using the 3 threshold e3 in bias correction approach or the non inferior combinations of model and correction technique e4 delta change techniques by assuming that the inferior ones are untrusted despite the temporal series being different the two equi feasible ensembles e1 applying bias correction techniques and e2 applying delta change techniques produced identical future mean temperature maps fig 7 there are very small differences in mean values between the equi feasible projections and the two other alternatives in terms of precipitation there are very small differences between the two equi feasible ensembles e1 and e2 due to a reduced number of negative values appearing in some cells when correcting using the second moment approach fig 8 larger differences appear between the mean values of these equi feasible predictions and the two other alternatives although they are not significant therefore the sensitivity of the means of climatic variables to the hypothesis assumed to define the ensemble is quite low 3 3 assessment of future climate impacts on aquifer recharge the analysis of climate change impacts required to simulate various climatic scenarios ei within the precipitation recharge models defined in section 3 2 the results obtained are summarised and discussed in next section note that other variables affecting recharge such as soil properties vegetation patterns and land use are considered steady despite there being expected to change according to global climate driving forces and new human actions on a local scale that will be induced by adaptation to climate and water resource availability martínez valderrama et al 2016 2018 how these variables will change through time over the territory is not considered in this paper 4 results and discussion 4 1 future aquifer recharge scenarios eight potential future mean nar scenarios for the period 2011 2045 were obtained by combining future potential climatic scenarios defined by the four ensemble options e1 e2 e3 and e4 and two precipitation recharge models mod 1976 2005 and mod 1996 2005 fig 9 as pointed out for the historical time series the results obtained with the mod 1976 2005 are slightly smoother with lower maximum values than those ones obtained with the mod 1996 2005 as shown in the maps and graphs in fig 9 note that significant differences in the temporal evolution of the annual future recharge time series are found when the assumed hypothesis are used scenarios e1 and e3 obtained by applying bias correction are similar to each other scenarios e2 and e4 obtained by using the delta change perturbation technique the recharge models used do not introduce large differences into the annual time series distribution despite the mod 1976 2005 produces slightly more smoothed result with lower extreme values the year to year distribution of recharge values for scenarios e2 and e4 is similar to that obtained by using the historical time series though the mean value is slightly lower this is due to the fact that the delta change technique e2 and e4 perturbs the historical time series while the bias correction technique perturbs the future time series from the rcms nevertheless in statistical terms both the mean and the median values of the aggregate nar for the various scenarios and recharge models applied do not differ substantially varying in the 98 5 106 9 mm year 1 and 120 8 128 3 mm year 1 ranges respectively the spatial distribution of mean nar for each of the four scenarios is also quite similar fig 9 the sensitivity of the mean nar and its distribution using both perturbation techniques bias or delta change and the ensemble hypothesis of the models equi feasible or not is low this is in agreement with what is observed by generating the future scenarios of p and t the sensitivity of p and t maps to the recharge model employed i e the transformation adopted is also quite low this is also expected given the small differences in mean in the simulations of the historical scenarios a summary of basic statistics of governing variables p t and r for the historical period and future projections is included in table 4 the absolute differences of mean values between historical and future nar time series obtained for the various scenarios oscillate between 11 5 and 22 8 mm year 1 fig 10 these figures highlight the differences between results obtained by using the various scenarios and recharge models in terms of the means and medians the differences are small thus indicating that both time series are normally distributed and suitable for statistical comparisons the model is more sensitive to which recharge model is applied differences of 4 6 mm year 1 and 3 8 mm year 1 in the mean and median respectively than to the ensemble type differences of 2 8 mm year 1 and 2 6 mm year 1 in the mean and median respectively there is intermediate sensitivity to the rescaling technique differences of 3 9 mm year 1 and 3 8 mm year 1 in the mean and median respectively with respect to the extremes of mean p maps the differences are small but the results are somewhat more sensitive to the rescaling correction technique bias or delta change than to the ensemble hypothesis equi feasible or not or the recharge model applied mod 1976 2005 and mod 1996 2005 although this representation of absolute change also highlights that differences were almost unappreciable for the entire recharge dataset the spatial distribution and statistics of values table 4 are very similar in all cases represented as far as standard deviation goes fig 11 the ensemble scenarios are sensitive to the downscaling technique bias or delta change however the sensitivity both to the recharge model and the ensemble hypothesis equi feasible or not is low the results that would be obtained by using an equi feasible ensemble of the eight scenarios in terms of mean nar standard deviation and relative variation of the future mean nar compared to the historical ones are showed in fig 12 one can see that although a small reduction in mean nar is expected over 99 8 of continental spain there are two small north eastern 600 km2 and eastern 100 km2 areas of the territory where a small increase is expected a largest reduction in mean nar in the centre and south east of the territory is expected dropping 28 in some areas only 6 6 of continental spain corresponds to reductions of more than 20 in mean nar nevertheless 52 3 of the territory would suffer mean nar reductions between 10 and 20 while the reduction would be between 0 and 10 over 40 9 of the territory in the case of the standard deviation on mean nar an increment of 41 on average is expected over 71 5 of the territory being particularly marked in localized southern areas with 36 7 of this area showing more than 50 increase there would also be a significant reduction in the standard deviation in northern areas with 6 9 of this area showing reductions greater than 30 finally relationships between the dimensionless relative differences in mean and standard deviation of mean nar and some possible explanatory variables elevation latitude is showed in fig 13 a poor linear correlation coefficient between relative differences and elevation is found despite some general trends are observed for instance the range in relative differences in standard deviation of mean nar decreases in the 0 3 0 range as elevation increases especially above 1700 m a s l in the main mountains ranges while the standard deviation decreases at higher elevations at lower elevations 0 200 ma s l a greater dispersion of the relative differences in standard deviation in the 0 3 0 8 range is found the linear correlation coefficient between the relative differences and latitude is higher of 0 30 for the mean and 0 56 for the standard deviation the relative differences in the mean nar increase with elevation while the relative differences in standard deviation of mean nar decrease with elevation other relationships with longitude were analyzed but finding none these analyses are omitted this work is the first one that assesses potential impacts of climate change on aquifer recharge in continental spain the limitations uncertainties and usefulness of the results are discussed below 4 2 limitations assumptions uncertainties and usefulness of the results the assumption of hypothesis and simplifications to apply the method presented in this work introduces different kinds of uncertainty which propagate in the final results the more relevant hypotheses have been grouped into the two main methodological steps used as follows 1 generation of future potential climatic scenarios total precipitation was used instead of differencing between rainfall and snowfall although most of continental spain receive snowfall rarely if ever there are some areas in pyrenees and sierra nevada ranges that receive significant snowfall a great uncertainty in those areas is expected because snowmelt acts as a more efficient recharge agent than rainfall simpson et al 1972 winograd et al 1998 earman et al 2006 and warming climate can shift multiple days per year of snowfall to rain potentially altering recharge the research focus on the analysis of future short term horizon 2016 2045 other future horizons such as mid term and long term scenarios have not been considered for those mid term and long term scenarios due to they are further away in time we will expect to have higher impacts on nar there should be also higher uncertainties for them only the most severe ipcc scenario was analysed rcp 8 5 to assess the most pessimistic potential impacts on nar in the future short term scenario the impacts of other potential future scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 on nar should be less intensive two downscaling approaches correction of first and second order moments under two different hypotheses bias correction and delta change techniques were applied to generate future climatic series in accordance with rcms simulations note that depending on the problem and the target solution several downscaling techniques of varying complexity and accuracy correction of first and second order moments regression approach quantile mapping etc can be applied by assuming different conceptual approaches such as bias correction and delta change techniques räisänen and räty 2012 by combining both approaches we cover a wider range of solutions assessing the potential impacts of climate change giving a better picture of the potential variability of the solutions potential plausible pictures of future climate scenarios are defined by combining information coming from different regional climatic models rcms and general circulation models gcms the ensembles coalesce and consolidate the results of individual climate projections thus allowing for more robust climate projections that are more representative than those based on a single model spanish meteorologial agency aemet 2009 two different hypotheses equifeasible members or non equifeasible members were applied to define ensembles of the obtained future series for each rcm they help to achieve more representative future potential climate scenarios for assessing impacts on aquifer recharge 2 hydrological propagation of the climatic impact simulation of future climatic scenarios with a precipitation recharge model a simple empirical precipitation recharge model has been adopted whose inputs are p and aet being the outputs nar time series we have not tested other hydrological models for example based on a more physically based or detailed representation of the processes involved in the hydrological balance eg snowmelt processes and the geological structures we assume that precipitation p and temperature t are the variables determining nar and their spatiotemporal variability determines the impacts of future potential climatic scenarios on renewable groundwater resources we do not consider the changes in other variables affecting recharge such as soil properties vegetation patterns and land use they are considered steady despite there being expected to change according to global climate driving forces and new human actions on a local scale that will be induced by human adaptation to climate and water resource availability martínez valderrama et al 2016 the assess of these adaptation strategies developed to reduce the impacts on aquifer recharge is out of the scope of this research work we assume that the climatic fields p and t taken from the spain02 project herrera et al 2016 and used as inputs of our model are good enough to approximate the historical climate an assessment of the validation of some spanish datasets including spain02 was recently carried out by quintana seguí et al 2017 the spain02 dataset has already been employed in many research studies escriva bou et al 2017 pardo igurquiza et al 2017 the turc s model 1954 1961 was applied to estimate aet its results depend on mean annual t and p different non global empirical models could be applied to assess the historical aet from t and p time series the applications of different methods would allow to assess uncertainties in this variable the nar series obtained by applying the chloride mass balance cmb method alcalá and custodio 2014 2015 were used to calibrate the recharge model the mean and standard deviation of the historical nar for the period 1996 2005 were assumed representative of the steady state condition despite no longer than 40 year time series of the cmb variables are available in continental spain to draw definitive conclusions alcalá and custodio 2014 2015 the spatial resolution of the model a regular 10 km 10 km grid is quite coarse because input data used to define the model were not available for smaller cells evertheless it allows to obtain a first approach to identify areas where more detailed analyses should be performed the results will be obtained under a set of hypotheses and they are only indicators of potential plausible scenarios that may happen nevertheless they give us an idea of the potential intensity of the climate change impacts under the most pessimistic emissions scenario in the analysed domain in a future short term horizon 2016 2045 in spite of the uncertainties the results also allow us to identify areas where the impact of climate change will be stronger in these regions there is the need for carrying out specific further research using different detailed conceptual tools etc to provide a more detailed assessment of future values and uncertainties 5 conclusions this work is the first one that assesses future potential impacts of climate change on aquifer recharge in continental spain a methodology is presented and used to estimate net aquifer recharge nar over a regular 10 km 10 km grid in two steps 1 generation of future potential climatic scenarios and 2 hydrological propagation of the climatic impact by simulating future climatic scenarios with a precipitation recharge model the results which are obtained assuming different hypotheses in each methodological step are only indicators of potential plausible scenarios that may happen they estimate the potential intensity of the climate change impacts for the horizon 2016 2045 under the most pessimistic emissions scenario a reduction of mean nar around 12 on average over continental spain is deduced a variable degree of nar reduction over 99 8 of the territory is estimated the reduction is quite heterogeneously distributed in line with the variety of conditions for aquifer recharge over continental spain the estimated standard deviation of mean nar would increase by 8 on average in this future scenario in spite of the uncertainties the results are also useful to identify areas where the impact of climate change will be stronger in these regions we will need to perform more specific further research using different detailed conceptual tools etc to provide a more detailed assessment of future values and uncertainties the dependence of these changes regarding typical potential explanatory variables such as elevation and latitude was also analyzed more significant relationships were found for the standard deviation that for the mean nar values the magnitude and range of standard deviation decrease at higher elevations and lower latitudes acknowledgments this research work was partially supported by the gesinhimpadapt project

6922,climate change will modify the availability of groundwater resources in the future thus the evaluation of average aquifer recharge from precipitation and its uncertainty becomes a key subject in determining suitable countrywide water policies the confident prediction of renewable groundwater resources requires an accurate evaluation of aquifer recharge over time and space especially in large territories with varied conditions for aquifer recharge such as continental spain this study asses impacts of future potential climatic change scenarios on distributed net aquifer recharge nar from precipitation over continental spain for this the used method 1 generates future time series of climatic variables precipitation temperature spatially distributed over the territory for potential aquifer recharge par and 2 simulates them within previously calibrated spatial par or nar recharge models from the available historical information to provide distributed par or nar time series the information employed comes from the spain02 project for the historical climatic data from alcalá and custodio 2014 2015 for the historical spatial nar and from the cordex eu project 2013 regional climate models rcms simulations for the future climate scenarios a distributed empirical precipitation recharge model is defined by using a regular 10km 10km grid and assuming that precipitation p and temperature t are the most important climatic variables determining par while their spatiotemporal variabilities determine the impacts of future potential climatic scenarios on renewable groundwater resources potential plausible pictures of future climate scenarios are defined by combining information coming from different rcms and general circulation models gcms downscaling techniques and ensemble hypothesis these scenarios were simulated within the used precipitation recharge model to estimate impacts on nar the results show that global mean nar decreases by 12 on average over continental spain over 99 8 of the territory a variable degree of recharge reduction is obtained the reduction is quite heterogeneously distributed in line with the variety of conditions for aquifer recharge over continental spain the standard deviation of annual mean nar will increase by 8 on average in the future the dependence of these changes regarding potential explanatory variables such as elevation and latitude was also analysed keywords aquifer recharge climate change scenarios hydrological impacts continental spain 1 introduction the evaluation of aquifer recharge from precipitation is essential to make a quantitative evaluation of renewable groundwater resources required to implement appropriate countrywide water policies freeze and cherry 1979 national ground water association 2004 potential and net aquifer recharge can be evaluated from a hydrological point of view potential aquifer recharge par refers to the fraction of precipitation p that infiltrates into the soil and percolates below the root zone it is expected to be greater than net aquifer recharge nar de vries and simmers 2002 andreu et al 2011 españa et al 2013 which is the fraction of recharge that reaches the water table after some delay smoothing out the variability inherent to precipitation events lerner et al 1990 batelaan and de smedt 2007 note that precipitation events include all the atmospheric water phases reaching the land surface such as rain snow dew fog etc for the purpose of assessing renewable groundwater resources the nar fraction is what matters alcalá and custodio 2014 aquifer recharge evaluation is a complex task subjected to significant uncertainties inferred by governing weather and physical variables as well as the choosing of appropriate techniques to cover different physical processes determining recharge milly and eagleson 1987 de vries and simmers 2002 clark et al 2011 aquifer recharge varies over space and time so the nar timing may vary from daily to weekly when the water table is shallow andreu et al 2011 to monthly to yearly in areas having a thick vadose zone alcalá et al 2011 for example the snow melting seasonal cycles may determine recharge rates and timing in mountainous areas simpson et al 1972 winograd et al 1998 earman et al 2006 the complexity of aquifer recharge evaluation increases when we intend to estimate potential impacts of long term climate variability aquifer recharge may be subjected to variation due to global driving forces such as climate change and local human actions such as land use transitions and this adds to the overall uncertainty in planning future evaluations under different climate scenarios the main statistics mean and standard deviation of natural recharge from precipitation over a long enough period should not change substantially unless they were influenced by climate or land use changes the steady behaviour of the cited main statistics declines when there is evidence of climate change milly et al 2008 pulido velázquez et al 2015 due to this complexity in evaluating aquifer recharge and taking into account that its direct measure is often unreliable over large spatial scales several techniques have been developed to evaluate aquifer recharge at different temporal and spatial scales ranging widely in complexity and cost lerner et al 1990 scanlon et al 2002 recharge estimates can be classified according to the hydrological zone to which recharge refers soil vadose zone and saturated zone and the technique employed physical tracer numerical modelling and empirical lerner et al 1990 scanlon et al 2002 2006 coes et al 2007 mcmahon et al 2011 on aquifer or catchment scales water balance techniques applied in the soil and in the vadose zone provide par estimates while tracer techniques hydrodynamic methods based on darcy s law and groundwater numerical models applied in the saturated zone provide nar estimates lerner et al 1990 batelaan and de smedt 2007 alcalá and custodio 2014 for large scale applications geographical information system gis can be coupled with lumped and distributed hydrological models to determine the spatial distribution of par or nar barthel 2006 minor et al 2007 batelaan and de smedt 2007 pulido velázquez et al 2015 several examples combine different techniques to establish the different timing of par and nar associated to the use of different techniques at different spatial scales nolan et al 2007 coes et al 2007 alcalá et al 2011 mcmahon et al 2011 the choice of one of these techniques depends on the objective of the study and the available data lerner et al 1990 scanlon et al 2002 islam et al 2016 in this paper the selection was based on the available distributed historical information about climatic variables spain02 project herrera et al 2016 for par and existing databases for nar alcalá and custodio 2015 in continental spain we will propose to apply an empirical modeling approach to assess yearly recharge for future potential climate scenarios in large scale areas such as continental spain the impact of climate change scenarios on groundwater is a topic that has produced a continuous interest in the research community since 1990s cf vaccaro 1992 edmunds and gaye 1994 bouraoui et al 1999 eckhardt and ulbrich 2003 chen et al 2004 scibek and allen 2006 jyrkama and sykes 2007 in recent years the number and relevance of the studies has shown a sharp increase cf di matteo et al 2011 green et al 2011 treidel et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 kløve et al 2014 cotterman et al 2017 di matteo et al 2017 gemitzi et al 2017 huang et al 2017 kidd 2017 mcintyre 2017 regarding the spatial scale most of the studies assessed the impacts of climate change on a specific groundwater flow system dragoni and sukhija 2008 molina et al 2013 pulido velazquez et al 2015 while a few encompassed regional groundwater flow systems impacts on groundwater were considered in some basin scale studies e g pulido velazquez et al 2011 herrmann et al 2016 escriva bou et al 2017 as well as for countries polemio 2016 or entire continents earman and dettinger 2011 panwar and chakrapani 2013 adhikari et al 2015 hartmann et al 2015 in this paper we propose a new systematic method to assess yearly impacts of future potential climate change scenarios on net aquifer recharge nar in large scale areas future potential climate scenarios are generated with a non equifeasible ensemble of downscaling projections coming from different rcms simulations these scenarios are propagated with a new distributed empirical recharge model to estimate nar from climatic fields it has been applied in continental spain an extensive and varied territory where no previous research work of this type has been performed the results which intend to be indicators of potential future plausible scenarios are obtained under a set of hypotheses that are listed and discussed within the paper this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the case study and available data section 3 presents the method used to assess potential impacts of future climatic scenarios on nar section 3 1 defines an empirical precipitation recharge model to simulate hydrological impacts from climatic variables p t section 3 2 describes the generation of future potential climatic scenarios section 3 3 describes the assessment of climate change impacts by simulating future potential climatic scenarios within a previously calibrated recharge model section 4 shows the results and discusses them finally section 5 presents the main conclusions 2 materials description of the case study and available data 2 1 case study continental spain continental spain lying between latitudes 36 and 44 n fig 1 occupies most 493 519 km2 of the iberian peninsula the rest belonging to continental portugal a large proportion of the territory is occupied by the relatively high elevation plains mesetas which lie at about 900 m a s l in the northern half of the country and about 700 m a s l in the southern half the mountain ranges that enclose them may exceed 2500 m of elevation the mesetas are characterised by a continental climate mimam 2000 which means hot dry summers and cold relatively wet winter spring seasons due to its varied geology continental spain has many relatively small yet high yielding aquifers the most important aquifers lie in plio quaternary sedimentary formations in the large river valleys and the quite extensive but compartmentalized triassic to tertiary carbonate massifs fig 1 the former consist of groundwater bodies surrounded by mountain ranges small alluvial and piedmont units and deltaic formations on infilled estuaries in coastal areas carbonate massifs are common occurring in quite extensive but compartmentalised areas along the northern eastern and southern mountain ranges igme 1993 in addition the weathered and fissured granite and palaeozoic shale formations in the northern southern and north eastern mountain ranges contain small aquifers of local significance the wide lithological orographic edaphic and climatic diversity of continental spain gives rise to a wide range of conditions for net aquifer recharge nar alcalá and custodio 2014 2015 2 2 historical climatic data for the period 1976 2005 historical climatic precipitation and temperature time series were taken from the spain02 project herrera et al 2016 which includes a large database of meteorological data covering continental spain precipitation p and temperature t show significant spatial heterogeneity due to the very different climatic conditions fig 2 mean p ranges from 2000 mm year 1 in the northern mountainous areas to about 500 600 mm year 1 over the northern meseta and 380 500 mm year 1 in the southern meseta fig 2a in the semiarid south eastern coastal areas and north eastern inland areas p is around 300 mm year 1 or less and sometimes as low as 180 mm year 1 mimam 2000 precipitation occurs mainly in late autumn and winter november to march associated with the circulation of cold air masses from the north atlantic ocean and deep pressure lows that travel eastwards and generate an inflow of air masses from the subtropical atlantic ocean trigo et al 2004 the eastern coast of spain may also receive precipitation from humid air masses over the western mediterranean sea especially in late summer and autumn which generally do not penetrate far inland martín vide and lópez bustins 2006 the annual mean t varies from 4 6 to 21 1 c fig 2b with minimums in january and maximums in august the daily t amplitude on a year may be as high as 50 c in the southern meseta and river valleys there is a pronounced gradient of t with elevation in mountain areas thus favouring the seasonal snow melting contribution to surface and groundwater bodies mimam 2000 2 3 historical recharge data the cmb method was recently used for determining spatial mean nar from precipitation and its uncertainty over continental spain by assuming long term steady conditions of the cmb variables atmospheric chloride bulk deposition chloride export flux by runoff and recharge water chloride content alcalá and custodio 2014 2015 other sources of natural recharge such as groundwater transferences among aquifers external runoff contribution and snow melting coming from others areas were not considered alcalá and custodio 2014 2015 alcalá and custodio 2014 2015 analysed the influence of hydraulic properties permeability and aquifer storage of different aquifer lithologies on nar estimates for local usage the hydrological meaning and reliability of distributed nar was determined by comparing them with local assumed trustable nar values the cmb variables were regionalised using ordinary kriging at the same 4976 nodes of a 10 km 10 km grid to estimate a mean nar value in each grid node two main sources of uncertainty affecting recharge induced by the inherent natural variability of the variables and from mapping of the cmb variables were identified and estimated alcalá and custodio 2014 while uncertainty from mapping may be reduced with better data coverage the part of the natural uncertainty inferred by the variable length of yearly data series was corrected by comparing them to existing long time series a data correction procedure was implemented to improve mean annual nar and its natural uncertainty deduced from variable length data series alcalá and custodio 2015 the critical balance period to reach comparable steady cmb averages and uncertainties was defined as around 10 years this period coincides with the decadal global climatic cycles acting over the iberian peninsula with imperfect 5 year positive and negative phases that follow the north atlantic oscillation trend hurrell 1995 trigo et al 2004 taking into account that 1 a minimum 10 year balance period is needed for reliable steady evaluations and 2 the cmb databases covered preferably the period 1994 2007 the historical 1996 2005 period covering a 10 year long nao climatic cycle with two successive 5 year long dry and wet phases was selected corrected cmb averages and natural uncertainties were regionalised mean annual nar varied from 14 to 813 mm year 1 with 90 ranging from 35 to 300 mm year 1 fig 3 a and the standard deviation of mean annual nar varied from 4 to 281 mm year 1 fig 3b 2 4 climatic model simulation data control and future scenarios several series of climatic data generated with different climatic model simulations performed in the cordex eu project 2013 were employed the most pessimistic emission scenario of the project representative concentration pathways 8 5 rcp8 5 was selected the simulations selected include results from five rcms cclm4 8 17 rca4 hirham5 racmo22e and wrf331f nested inside four different general circulation models gcm as shown in table 1 dimensionless spatial monthly mean relative differences between the control simulation and the historical p time series for an average year over the reference period 1976 2005 were obtained by means of an equi feasible ensemble of all rcms simulations fig 4 the relative difference distribution is negatively biased overall with a central set of values in the 0 7 range and extreme values of 0 87 in august and 1 33 in may except for october with a slightly positive average relative difference all months show negative differences which justifies applying some correction to the time series obtained from the rcms simulations the negative differences reach 0 4 in march in the northern half of the territory but not until july and august in southern and south eastern highlands areas characterised by dry continental and semiarid climates with evidence of active desertification martínez valderrama et al 2016 the summary of the spatial distribution of the mean impacts of climate change on p is represented using the dimensionless monthly relative differences between future 2016 2045 and control 1976 2005 time series by assuming equi feasible ensembles of all rcms simulations fig 5 the relative difference distribution is positively biased overall with central values in the 0 1 range and extreme values of 0 44 in june and 0 2 in october except for january with a slightly positive average relative difference each month shows negative or close to average differences with a very heterogeneous distribution the negative relative differences decrease to below 0 1 in spring and summer april to august in the southern and south western highlands 3 methods the methodology used to assess impacts of future potential climatic change scenarios on aquifer recharge nar from precipitation over continental spain is described in three steps 1 definition of an empirical distributed precipitation recharge model 2 generation of future potential time series of climatic variables p t spatially distributed over the territory and 3 assessment of future hydrological impacts on aquifer recharge 3 1 precipitation recharge model a distributed empirical precipitation recharge model is defined by using the 10 km 10 km grid to generate nar series from climate series in each grid cell the model instead of assessing recharge series by using exclusively p which is an approximation commonly applied kirn et al 2017 for example applying an infiltration coefficient to p is defined from the historical par time series estimated as difference in p and actual evapotranspiration aet time series pr recharge time series hereafter taking the positive relationship of temperature t and aet into account arora 2002 gerrits et al 2009 changes in t will determine the available non evaporative fraction of p available for aquifer recharge other factors susceptible to control aet in the future are not considered for instance evaporation is expected to increase with warming temperatures while transpiration may actually decline in some cases if the warming results from increased co2 due to co2 fertilization bazzaz and sombroek 1996 ward et al 1999 green et al 2007 and the vegetation cover transitions toward a more degraded condidion as expected in the western mediterranean region martínez valderrama 2018 and other mid terrestrial latitudes sun et al 2017 on the other hand warming climate can shift multiple days per year of snowfall to rain potentially altering recharge different non global empirical models could be applied to estimate the historical aet from p and t time series e g turc 1954 1961 coutagne 1954 budyko 1974 amongst others as described in beven 2007 arora 2002 gerrits et al 2009 and españa et al 2013 in this study the turc 1954 1961 model in which annual aet depends on annual t and p is applied in each grid cell as 1 aet p 0 9 p 2 l 2 where aet and p are in mmyear 1 and l 300 25 t 0 05 t 3 is a dimensionless parameter function of annual t the nar series are obtained in each cell by applying a model whose target is to produce a perturbation of the historical pr series to obtain a new series whose mean and standard deviation is equal to the nar series the model is defined with a correction function that is calibrated forcing that the perturbation of the historical pr series produces a new series whose mean and standard deviation is equal to the historical nar series data provided by alcalá and custodio 2014 the calibrated function will be applied to correct future pr series to obtain future nar series assuming that the bias correction or correction function will not change in the future the procedure involves the next steps 1 average change of mean and standard deviation of the pr and nar series for the same historical period 2 δ μ μ nar μ pr μ pr and δ σ σ nar σ pr σ pr where δ μ is the change in mean and δ σ is the change in standard deviation 2 standardization of the pr series historical and future 3 prn i pr i p r σ pr 3 generation of nar series from pr series 4 nar i σ c prn i μ c where 5 μ c μ pr 1 δ μ and σ c σ pr 1 δ σ when eq 4 is applied to the historical pr series the generated nar series have the same mean and standard deviation to the historical nar series of data provided by alcalá and custodio 2014 if it is applied to the future pr series future nar series will be obtained assuming that the bias remain invariant in the future the nar model was calibrated using pr recharge time series from historical climatic data section 2 2 and historical nar data from the cmb method section 2 3 for the period 1996 2005 two different hypotheses are assumed regarding the length of the pr recharge time series used to calibrate the precipitation recharge model the transformation function 1 the same period of recharge time series 1996 2005 called mod 1996 2005 or 2 a longer historical period 1976 2005 called mod 1976 2005 this hypothesis assumes that the statistics mean and standard deviation of nar time series from the cmb method for the period 1996 2005 and par time series generated from a longer historical period 1976 2005 do not differ substantially and can be considered identical this assumption is supported by assuming steady state conditions of the mean and standard deviation of the balance variables determining the historical recharge when simulating the period 1976 2005 with both mod 1976 2005 and mod 1996 2005 models the distributed mean annual recharge was 139 mm and 144 4 mm respectively thus the relative difference was less than 4 on average fig 6 the maps show a quite similar spatial distribution despite the mod 1976 2005 providing a slightly more smoothed estimate with lower maximum values 3 2 generation of future potential climatic scenarios we introduce a method to generate potential future short term horizon 2016 2045 climatic scenarios from the historical data 1976 2005 and the available climatic models simulations performed in the cordex eu project 2013 taking the uncertainty linked to these future scenarios into account for this a multi criteria analysis of the time series obtained by applying different correction techniques bias correction and delta change for downscaling the values obtained with the climatic model simulations was performed to identify the best fits to the historical data assuming equifeasible members or non equifeasible members see christensen and lettenmaier 2007 lopez et al 2009 pulido velázquez et al 2015 different ensembles of the obtained time series are used to achieve more representative future potential climate scenarios for assessing impacts on aquifer recharge 3 2 1 application of downscaling techniques bias correction and delta change approaches future scenarios of climatic variables for distributed par or nar over a territory have usually been generated by applying statistical downscaling techniques to the outputs of climatic models control and future scenarios and taking the values of these variables in the historical period into account rcms provide dynamic approaches with a spatial resolution of tens of kilometres they are nested inside general circulation models that have coarser spatial resolution hundreds of km of grid side in most cases the statistics of the series generated by rcms showed a bias regarding the real values and appropriate downscaling techniques are required to analyse impacts at the groundwater flow system scale depending on the problem several downscaling techniques of varying complexity and accuracy correction of first and second order moments regression approach quantile mapping etc were applied by assuming different conceptual approaches such as bias correction and delta change techniques räisänen and räty 2012 bias correction techniques aim to define a perturbation of the control time series to force some of their statistics closer to the historical ones they assume that the bias between statistics of the model and data will remain invariant in the future e g haerter et al 2011 watanabe et al 2012 stigter et al 2014 the delta change techniques assume that the rcms provide good assessments of the relative changes in the statistic between present and future but they do not thoroughly assess the absolute values they use the relative difference in the statistic of future and control simulations to perform a perturbation of the historical time series in accordance with these estimated changes e g pulido velazquez et al 2011 2015 räisänen and räty 2012 however the spatio temporal resolution between the historical and the control time series from rcms often differs usually the spatial resolution of historical datasets is greater than the spatial resolution of the rcms dataset so the transformations of both bias correction and delta change techniques indirectly produce downscaling approximations to the system the spatial resolution of the rcms is increased through the historical series in the case study this is the reason they are commonly known as downscaling transformations in this research two downscaling approaches were used correction of first and second order moments for both bias correction and delta change techniques these were applied to all the rcms simulations described in section 2 2 table 1 3 2 2 multi criteria analysis of the main statistic a multi criteria analysis analogous to those described in pulido velazquez et al 2011 escriva bou et al 2017 was used to identify the rcms simulations that provide the best approximation to the main statistics mean standard deviation of the historical time series it aims to identify the best rcms in terms of goodness of fit of the statistics of the control series to the historical ones to assess it we define an error index es see eq 6 that is applied to the main statistics mean and standard deviation for each rcm and climatic variable precipitation and temperature 6 es 1 n n s c s h s h 2 where es is the error of the considered statistic n is the length of the statistical time series c is the control simulation and h is the historical table 2 shows eliminated and non eliminated rcms after assessing es it in each cell we estimate the mean lumped value for our case study continental spain which will be employed to perform the multicriteria analysis it intends to find models that were inferior to others in terms of fitting the historical dataset dominated solutions in the terminology of multi objective analyses the models are then compared and those ones that were worse than any other model in all the statistics i e strictly dominated are the inferior one it has been also applied to identify the best combination of models and bias correction techniques in terms of goodness of fit of the corrected control scenarios to the basic statistics of the historical time series due to the fact that most combinations of models and bias correction techniques provide good approximations to the first and second moments a relative error threshold percentage difference with respect to the historical statistics was defined only significant differences were used to decide when a corrected control is worse than other ones table 3 shows the inferior and non inferior combinations of models and bias correction techniques for a 3 threshold of the mean relative error 3 2 3 prediction ensembles to define more representative future climatic scenarios four options to define more representative future scenarios by applying different ensembles of the potential scenarios deduced from the available climatic models were considered two ensemble scenarios were considered by combining as equifeasible members all the future series corresponding to different rcms simulations generated by bias correction e1 or delta change e2 two other options were defined by combining only the non inferior models using the 3 threshold e3 in bias correction approach or the non inferior combinations of model and correction technique e4 delta change techniques by assuming that the inferior ones are untrusted despite the temporal series being different the two equi feasible ensembles e1 applying bias correction techniques and e2 applying delta change techniques produced identical future mean temperature maps fig 7 there are very small differences in mean values between the equi feasible projections and the two other alternatives in terms of precipitation there are very small differences between the two equi feasible ensembles e1 and e2 due to a reduced number of negative values appearing in some cells when correcting using the second moment approach fig 8 larger differences appear between the mean values of these equi feasible predictions and the two other alternatives although they are not significant therefore the sensitivity of the means of climatic variables to the hypothesis assumed to define the ensemble is quite low 3 3 assessment of future climate impacts on aquifer recharge the analysis of climate change impacts required to simulate various climatic scenarios ei within the precipitation recharge models defined in section 3 2 the results obtained are summarised and discussed in next section note that other variables affecting recharge such as soil properties vegetation patterns and land use are considered steady despite there being expected to change according to global climate driving forces and new human actions on a local scale that will be induced by adaptation to climate and water resource availability martínez valderrama et al 2016 2018 how these variables will change through time over the territory is not considered in this paper 4 results and discussion 4 1 future aquifer recharge scenarios eight potential future mean nar scenarios for the period 2011 2045 were obtained by combining future potential climatic scenarios defined by the four ensemble options e1 e2 e3 and e4 and two precipitation recharge models mod 1976 2005 and mod 1996 2005 fig 9 as pointed out for the historical time series the results obtained with the mod 1976 2005 are slightly smoother with lower maximum values than those ones obtained with the mod 1996 2005 as shown in the maps and graphs in fig 9 note that significant differences in the temporal evolution of the annual future recharge time series are found when the assumed hypothesis are used scenarios e1 and e3 obtained by applying bias correction are similar to each other scenarios e2 and e4 obtained by using the delta change perturbation technique the recharge models used do not introduce large differences into the annual time series distribution despite the mod 1976 2005 produces slightly more smoothed result with lower extreme values the year to year distribution of recharge values for scenarios e2 and e4 is similar to that obtained by using the historical time series though the mean value is slightly lower this is due to the fact that the delta change technique e2 and e4 perturbs the historical time series while the bias correction technique perturbs the future time series from the rcms nevertheless in statistical terms both the mean and the median values of the aggregate nar for the various scenarios and recharge models applied do not differ substantially varying in the 98 5 106 9 mm year 1 and 120 8 128 3 mm year 1 ranges respectively the spatial distribution of mean nar for each of the four scenarios is also quite similar fig 9 the sensitivity of the mean nar and its distribution using both perturbation techniques bias or delta change and the ensemble hypothesis of the models equi feasible or not is low this is in agreement with what is observed by generating the future scenarios of p and t the sensitivity of p and t maps to the recharge model employed i e the transformation adopted is also quite low this is also expected given the small differences in mean in the simulations of the historical scenarios a summary of basic statistics of governing variables p t and r for the historical period and future projections is included in table 4 the absolute differences of mean values between historical and future nar time series obtained for the various scenarios oscillate between 11 5 and 22 8 mm year 1 fig 10 these figures highlight the differences between results obtained by using the various scenarios and recharge models in terms of the means and medians the differences are small thus indicating that both time series are normally distributed and suitable for statistical comparisons the model is more sensitive to which recharge model is applied differences of 4 6 mm year 1 and 3 8 mm year 1 in the mean and median respectively than to the ensemble type differences of 2 8 mm year 1 and 2 6 mm year 1 in the mean and median respectively there is intermediate sensitivity to the rescaling technique differences of 3 9 mm year 1 and 3 8 mm year 1 in the mean and median respectively with respect to the extremes of mean p maps the differences are small but the results are somewhat more sensitive to the rescaling correction technique bias or delta change than to the ensemble hypothesis equi feasible or not or the recharge model applied mod 1976 2005 and mod 1996 2005 although this representation of absolute change also highlights that differences were almost unappreciable for the entire recharge dataset the spatial distribution and statistics of values table 4 are very similar in all cases represented as far as standard deviation goes fig 11 the ensemble scenarios are sensitive to the downscaling technique bias or delta change however the sensitivity both to the recharge model and the ensemble hypothesis equi feasible or not is low the results that would be obtained by using an equi feasible ensemble of the eight scenarios in terms of mean nar standard deviation and relative variation of the future mean nar compared to the historical ones are showed in fig 12 one can see that although a small reduction in mean nar is expected over 99 8 of continental spain there are two small north eastern 600 km2 and eastern 100 km2 areas of the territory where a small increase is expected a largest reduction in mean nar in the centre and south east of the territory is expected dropping 28 in some areas only 6 6 of continental spain corresponds to reductions of more than 20 in mean nar nevertheless 52 3 of the territory would suffer mean nar reductions between 10 and 20 while the reduction would be between 0 and 10 over 40 9 of the territory in the case of the standard deviation on mean nar an increment of 41 on average is expected over 71 5 of the territory being particularly marked in localized southern areas with 36 7 of this area showing more than 50 increase there would also be a significant reduction in the standard deviation in northern areas with 6 9 of this area showing reductions greater than 30 finally relationships between the dimensionless relative differences in mean and standard deviation of mean nar and some possible explanatory variables elevation latitude is showed in fig 13 a poor linear correlation coefficient between relative differences and elevation is found despite some general trends are observed for instance the range in relative differences in standard deviation of mean nar decreases in the 0 3 0 range as elevation increases especially above 1700 m a s l in the main mountains ranges while the standard deviation decreases at higher elevations at lower elevations 0 200 ma s l a greater dispersion of the relative differences in standard deviation in the 0 3 0 8 range is found the linear correlation coefficient between the relative differences and latitude is higher of 0 30 for the mean and 0 56 for the standard deviation the relative differences in the mean nar increase with elevation while the relative differences in standard deviation of mean nar decrease with elevation other relationships with longitude were analyzed but finding none these analyses are omitted this work is the first one that assesses potential impacts of climate change on aquifer recharge in continental spain the limitations uncertainties and usefulness of the results are discussed below 4 2 limitations assumptions uncertainties and usefulness of the results the assumption of hypothesis and simplifications to apply the method presented in this work introduces different kinds of uncertainty which propagate in the final results the more relevant hypotheses have been grouped into the two main methodological steps used as follows 1 generation of future potential climatic scenarios total precipitation was used instead of differencing between rainfall and snowfall although most of continental spain receive snowfall rarely if ever there are some areas in pyrenees and sierra nevada ranges that receive significant snowfall a great uncertainty in those areas is expected because snowmelt acts as a more efficient recharge agent than rainfall simpson et al 1972 winograd et al 1998 earman et al 2006 and warming climate can shift multiple days per year of snowfall to rain potentially altering recharge the research focus on the analysis of future short term horizon 2016 2045 other future horizons such as mid term and long term scenarios have not been considered for those mid term and long term scenarios due to they are further away in time we will expect to have higher impacts on nar there should be also higher uncertainties for them only the most severe ipcc scenario was analysed rcp 8 5 to assess the most pessimistic potential impacts on nar in the future short term scenario the impacts of other potential future scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 on nar should be less intensive two downscaling approaches correction of first and second order moments under two different hypotheses bias correction and delta change techniques were applied to generate future climatic series in accordance with rcms simulations note that depending on the problem and the target solution several downscaling techniques of varying complexity and accuracy correction of first and second order moments regression approach quantile mapping etc can be applied by assuming different conceptual approaches such as bias correction and delta change techniques räisänen and räty 2012 by combining both approaches we cover a wider range of solutions assessing the potential impacts of climate change giving a better picture of the potential variability of the solutions potential plausible pictures of future climate scenarios are defined by combining information coming from different regional climatic models rcms and general circulation models gcms the ensembles coalesce and consolidate the results of individual climate projections thus allowing for more robust climate projections that are more representative than those based on a single model spanish meteorologial agency aemet 2009 two different hypotheses equifeasible members or non equifeasible members were applied to define ensembles of the obtained future series for each rcm they help to achieve more representative future potential climate scenarios for assessing impacts on aquifer recharge 2 hydrological propagation of the climatic impact simulation of future climatic scenarios with a precipitation recharge model a simple empirical precipitation recharge model has been adopted whose inputs are p and aet being the outputs nar time series we have not tested other hydrological models for example based on a more physically based or detailed representation of the processes involved in the hydrological balance eg snowmelt processes and the geological structures we assume that precipitation p and temperature t are the variables determining nar and their spatiotemporal variability determines the impacts of future potential climatic scenarios on renewable groundwater resources we do not consider the changes in other variables affecting recharge such as soil properties vegetation patterns and land use they are considered steady despite there being expected to change according to global climate driving forces and new human actions on a local scale that will be induced by human adaptation to climate and water resource availability martínez valderrama et al 2016 the assess of these adaptation strategies developed to reduce the impacts on aquifer recharge is out of the scope of this research work we assume that the climatic fields p and t taken from the spain02 project herrera et al 2016 and used as inputs of our model are good enough to approximate the historical climate an assessment of the validation of some spanish datasets including spain02 was recently carried out by quintana seguí et al 2017 the spain02 dataset has already been employed in many research studies escriva bou et al 2017 pardo igurquiza et al 2017 the turc s model 1954 1961 was applied to estimate aet its results depend on mean annual t and p different non global empirical models could be applied to assess the historical aet from t and p time series the applications of different methods would allow to assess uncertainties in this variable the nar series obtained by applying the chloride mass balance cmb method alcalá and custodio 2014 2015 were used to calibrate the recharge model the mean and standard deviation of the historical nar for the period 1996 2005 were assumed representative of the steady state condition despite no longer than 40 year time series of the cmb variables are available in continental spain to draw definitive conclusions alcalá and custodio 2014 2015 the spatial resolution of the model a regular 10 km 10 km grid is quite coarse because input data used to define the model were not available for smaller cells evertheless it allows to obtain a first approach to identify areas where more detailed analyses should be performed the results will be obtained under a set of hypotheses and they are only indicators of potential plausible scenarios that may happen nevertheless they give us an idea of the potential intensity of the climate change impacts under the most pessimistic emissions scenario in the analysed domain in a future short term horizon 2016 2045 in spite of the uncertainties the results also allow us to identify areas where the impact of climate change will be stronger in these regions there is the need for carrying out specific further research using different detailed conceptual tools etc to provide a more detailed assessment of future values and uncertainties 5 conclusions this work is the first one that assesses future potential impacts of climate change on aquifer recharge in continental spain a methodology is presented and used to estimate net aquifer recharge nar over a regular 10 km 10 km grid in two steps 1 generation of future potential climatic scenarios and 2 hydrological propagation of the climatic impact by simulating future climatic scenarios with a precipitation recharge model the results which are obtained assuming different hypotheses in each methodological step are only indicators of potential plausible scenarios that may happen they estimate the potential intensity of the climate change impacts for the horizon 2016 2045 under the most pessimistic emissions scenario a reduction of mean nar around 12 on average over continental spain is deduced a variable degree of nar reduction over 99 8 of the territory is estimated the reduction is quite heterogeneously distributed in line with the variety of conditions for aquifer recharge over continental spain the estimated standard deviation of mean nar would increase by 8 on average in this future scenario in spite of the uncertainties the results are also useful to identify areas where the impact of climate change will be stronger in these regions we will need to perform more specific further research using different detailed conceptual tools etc to provide a more detailed assessment of future values and uncertainties the dependence of these changes regarding typical potential explanatory variables such as elevation and latitude was also analyzed more significant relationships were found for the standard deviation that for the mean nar values the magnitude and range of standard deviation decrease at higher elevations and lower latitudes acknowledgments this research work was partially supported by the gesinhimpadapt project

6923,conjunctive water management involves the combined use of groundwater surface water and or additional sources of water to achieve public policy and management goals conjunctive water management enables greater water supply security and stability helps adaptation to climate variation and uncertainty and reduces depletion and degradation of water resources there are many opportunities to benefit from improved conjunctive water management if institutional and political barriers can be overcome this article provides the first comprehensive assessments of progress towards conjunctive water management on a continental scale across the australian states and territories and suggests an innovative approach towards overcoming barriers to integration conditions for the implementation of conjunctive water management have only been partially met by the australian states there has been progress towards integrated groundwater and surface water accounting and planning but there is still little systematic attempt to plan and manage surface water and groundwater storage and use at a regional scale over time current policies effectively subsidise surface water storage and aquifer storage and recovery entitlements are not in place in some jurisdictions a new paradigm of conjunctive water management is required involving systematic consideration of the beneficial integration of groundwater surface water and other water sources in water plans and projects transition to conjunctive water management can be promoted by networks including change agents bridging organisations and water management institutions supported by strong leadership from governments keywords conjunctive water management groundwater surface water storage transition 1 introduction in many parts of the world water resources are under pressure from economic and population growth and climate change demand for water is projected to grow by more than 40 by 2050 by 2025 an estimated 1 8billion people will live in countries or regions in which water is scarce and two thirds of the world s population could be living in conditions in which the supply of clean water does not meet the demand un 2015 in recent decades the use of groundwater has been increasing around the world in response to the rising demands for drinking water supplies and food production for a growing global population today groundwater is estimated globally to provide 36 of potable water 42 of water for irrigated agriculture and 24 of direct industrial water supply groundwater supplies are diminishing with an estimated 20 of the world s aquifers being over exploited leading to serious consequences such as water shortages land subsidence and saltwater intrusion in coastal areas gleeson et al 2012 in order to sustain groundwater use careful management to conserve aquifers is required together with exploitation of opportunities for enhanced groundwater recharge taylor et al 2013 coordinated management of groundwater and surface water in combination otherwise referred to as conjunctive water management can bring a number of benefits including enhanced water availability security and water quality better management of impacts of water use and greater capacity to adapt to climatic variation and uncertainty conjunctive water management aims to make the best use of multiple water sources including surface water groundwater recycled stormwater and wastewater at the scale of river basins and aquifers gggfa 2015b alley 2016 conjunctive water management exploits the complementary properties of groundwater and surface water surface water flows are visible but surface water supply is often highly variable when groundwater is accessible and of suitable quality it is a stable and reliable source of supply and aquifer storage avoids evaporative losses national water commission 2014b conjunctive water management can increase water supply security and stability by making the best spatial and temporal use of different water sources and storage this includes using surplus surface water and recycled water to recharge aquifers and drawing water from aquifer storage when surface water is scarce it can also lead to better timing of irrigation water delivery by compensating for shortfalls in water availability at critical times for crops and water dependent ecosystems evans and evans 2012 conjunctive water management can improve water quality by mixing different water sources and combining water treatment with enhanced recharge to achieve specified water quality targets groundwater systems can be used to stabilise water quality leach or dilute pollutants control seawater intrusion while surface water can be used to freshen saline aquifers conjunctive water management can account for and address the cross impacts of groundwater and surface water use on connected resources and the environment this can counteract waterlogging and salination excessive river flow depletion drying wetlands and aquifer exploitation winter et al 1998 sophocleous 2002 evans 2007 if impacts cannot be avoided conjunctive water management can reduce the impact by transferring or sharing impacts across systems and deferring impact through time or distributing them over a wider area conjunctive water management can also help adaptation to climatic variation and uncertainty by means of supply diversification underground storage and water transfers halstead and o shea 1989 agrawal 2008 aquifers can be used to store dam overflows and floods and smooth daily variation in urban water demand and seasonal variation in irrigation demand despite its obvious advantages conjunctive groundwater and surface water management has not realised its potential while the physical conditions for broadscale conjunctive water management exist in many parts of the world there are significant institutional and political barriers gggfa 2015a national water commission 2011 2014a there is a continuing emphasis on supply driven surface water investments and lack of recognition of the structural importance of groundwater investment in conjunctive water resource management institutional barriers include gaps and inconsistencies in the structure of water entitlements and the slow development of integrated water resource plans and measures to address overallocation of water resources there are gaps in information about groundwater surface water interactions evans 2007 moench 2004 many impacts from these interactions are long term and overlooked by policy making in short term political cycles resistance by some stakeholders to change and split responsibility for groundwater and surface water development and management present further challenges ross 2012 there are few comprehensive studies of institutional and political issues related to conjunctive water management in 1996 the us environment protection agency funded a comparative institutional analysis of conjunctive water management in arizona colorado and california blomquist et al 2004 this study showed the substantial influence of water entitlements operational rules and management organisations on conjunctive water management the managing connected waters project funded by the australian research council and the natural heritage trust aimed to provide a co ordinated approach to groundwater and surface water management including institutional and communication issues fullagar 2004 brodie et al 2007 1 http www connectedwater gov au framework institutional arrangements html accessed 28 january 2012 1 recently conjunctive water management has been affirmed as a key principle of international groundwater management by the groundwater governance global framework for action gggfa 2015a b and other international and australian policy papers have proposed key issues and principles for conjunctive water management world bank 2006 evans and evans 2012 skm 2011 this article contributes to the literature on the implementation of conjunctive water management by means of the first assessment of progress towards conjunctive water management at a continental scale across the australian states and territories the article also introduces an innovative approach to overcome barriers to conjunctive water management drawing on insights from literature on water management transitions the choice of australia for this study is supported by the potential for conjunctive water management to address water supply variability and scarcity challenges coupled with the observation that groundwater and surface water generally continue to be managed separately and there are few strategic conjunctive water management initiatives or projects the assessment is based on an analysis of australian and state government legal and policy documents reports and water plans consultant reports academic papers and media reports which the author carried out in 2013 on behalf of the national water commission national water commission 2014b the author also draws on responses to semi structured interviews with government water managers consultants academics and water users representatives which he carried out in 2009 during his phd research on conjunctive water management in the murray darling basin the remainder of this article is structured as follows firstly a framework for analysing the performance of conjunctive water management is presented building on australian and international policy studies skm 2011 evans and evans 2012 gggfa 2015b key prerequisites for conjunctive water management include clearly defined legislative and policy objectives groundwater and surface water entitlements integrated water planning and coordinated management arrangements secondly the performance of conjunctive water management in the australian states and territories is assessed based on this framework comparison between australia and examples from the western usa are included to place the australian experience in an international context thirdly progress achieved on conjunctive water management and challenges are assessed and priorities and steps are suggested for speeding the transition to beneficial conjunctive management of water resources 2 framework for the assessment of the integration of groundwater and surface water management 2 1 definition and scope of conjunctive water management 2 1 1 definition conjunctive water management can be defined as the combined use of groundwater surface water and or additional sources of water to achieve public policy and management goals there is a strong case for conjunctive management of groundwater and surface water under two conditions 1 groundwater and surface water resources are connected surface water infiltrates to groundwater or groundwater flows into surface water this means that the use of surface water will impact on groundwater and its users and vice versa 2 the use of groundwater or surface water has impacts across other resources and their users these cross impacts may occur whether or not groundwater and surface water resources are connected for example if groundwater or surface water is depleted the demand for other water resources is likely to increase the connections between groundwater and surface water resources and the extent of groundwater surface water use impacts vary substantially within a given water management region groundwater and surface water resources are separated geographically or by impermeable confining layers of clay or rock therefore the strength and timeframes of connections vary substantially and are not well understood evans 2007 moench 2004 important distinctions can be made between regulated perennial and unregulated ephemeral rivers and alluvial and fractured rock aquifers skm 2011 in addition some aquifers contain non renewable fossil groundwater which can be depleted like mineral resources the impacts of groundwater and surface water uses across other water resources and their users are also highly variable these include impacts on the quantity and quality of water resources and on connected environmental assets and services for example groundwater pumping can reduce streamflow and surface water availability while surface water use can reduce groundwater recharge groundwater can be polluted by agricultural chemicals heavy metals pharmaceuticals and other contaminants carried by surface water surface water can be polluted by saline or contaminated groundwater socio economic impacts vary substantially between regions according to the number of people and economic sectors dependent on groundwater and surface water the intensity of resource use and the risks of pollution created by human activity conflicts over water use present political problems in some heavily exploited resources in the southern half of australia while there are opportunities for development in areas where resources are lightly exploited especially in the northern half of the continent gggfa 2015a national water commission 2014a the case for conjunctive water management is strongest when connections are strong and rapid skm 2011 but the general application of conjunctive water management on a precautionary basis is justified by gaps in information and uncertainties about cross impacts of groundwater and surface water use and the fact that many of these impacts do not appear for many years 2 1 2 conjunctive water use and conjunctive water management a distinction can be made between conjunctive water use and conjunctive water management conjunctive water use refers to coordinated use by water users for specific purposes for example irrigation municipal use or mining private water users generally aim to maximise water use efficiency and rarely take account of broader social objectives conjunctive water management refers to coordinated management of groundwater and surface water to optimise use of resources to meet broad social objectives such as the supply of enough water of sufficient quality to meet municipal agricultural industrial and environmental requirements while some social benefits have been achieved by private conjunctive water use such as that developed in many irrigation districts private groundwater users are more likely to organise themselves to manage issues with an immediate impact on their production and the resource such as new wells well depth and seasonal timing they are unlikely to take action to manage impacts of pumping that emerge in distant locations or in the longer term such as remote impacts on streamflow declining water tables and drying wetlands schlager 2007 irrigation managers aim to maximise irrigation water use efficiency and often neglect the associated reductions in groundwater recharge coordinated conjunctive water management by private users and public authorities can ensure that cross resource impacts of groundwater and surface water use are fully accounted for and managed this requires cross sectoral and cross agency coordination of water resources land uses and the environment at multiple spatial and time scales and administrative levels this goes beyond what has been achieved by private conjunctive water users foster and van steenbergen 2011 2 1 3 additional sources of water for conjunctive water management when the term conjunctive water management was introduced it referred to surface water and groundwater more recently additional sources of water have been introduced including desalinated water recycled stormwater and wastewater from sewage treatment plants and industrial processes dillon et al 2012 these additional sources are available for human agricultural or industrial use after appropriate treatment the definition of conjunctive water management can be broadened to include conjunctive use of groundwater or surface water with one of these additional sources of water when they are combined with either surface water or groundwater before further use conjunctive management of groundwater surface water and additional sources includes combination of recycled or desalinated water with other surface water as well as underground storage treatment and recovery of recycled water managed aquifer recharge and aquifer storage and recovery if one of these additional sources is supplied directly for human consumption or agricultural use after treatment without being combined with groundwater or surface water this cannot be counted as conjunctive water management since there is only one source of water involved 2 1 4 bluewater and greenwater the availability of water for plant growth and food production can be divided into the blue water in aquifers rivers and lakes and the green water in soil moisture falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 the scope of conjunctive water management can be further expanded to include land and water management practices that encourage infiltration soil moisture retention and aquifer recharge such as slowing the passage of water in the landscape increasing vegetative cover and modifying diversionary structures national water commission 2014b the data collected for this article is insufficient to include soil moisture in the analysis of conjunctive water management this is an important task for future research 2 2 framework for assessing conjunctive water management in australia the 2004 national water initiative established a national system of managing surface and groundwater resources for rural and urban use coag 2004 the nwi para 23x further states that the connectivity between groundwater and surface water should be recognised and connected systems should be managed together the water act 2007 s 20b provides for the integrated management of basin water resources and the establishment and enforcement of environmentally sustainable limits of the quantities of groundwater and surface water that may be taken from a basin water resources the physical preconditions for broadscale conjunctive water management and water banking exist in many parts of australia and there is significant community support rawluk et al 2013 although there is varied public acceptance of different water sources such as recycled water and rainwater hurlimann and dolnicar 2016 while conjunctive water use including groundwater surface water substitution and use of groundwater as a buffer has been widely practised by irrigators progress towards conjunctive management of connected groundwater and surface water systems has been limited there have been some small and medium sized aquifer recharge projects around urban centres but relatively few examples of catchment scale conjunctive water management and very few large scale recharge and recovery projects interventions to promote conjunctive water management can be broadly divided into policies and regulations administered by water managers field based land and water practices and technology based infrastructure the first category includes permitting systems for water users and restrictions on water use substitution of groundwater and surface water foregoing use of a water resource in return for a benefit carryover of water use entitlements water banking and surface water groundwater trading the second category includes land and water management practices that encourage soil moisture retention and aquifer recharge by slowing the passage of water in the landscape increasing vegetative cover channelling water to areas with high recharge protecting recharge areas and encouraging water infiltration through leaky ditches and channels the third category includes dams water transfer projects aquifer storage and recovery river bank storage water treatment plants and seawater intrusion barriers national water commission 2014b gggfa 2015a several authors have investigated the conditions for conjunctive water management in australia skm 2006 2011 and internationally evans and evans 2012 dillon et al 2012 gggfa 2015b eight conditions for the implementation of conjunctive water management can be derived from this previous work these conditions are summarised in table 1 and explained in the following paragraphs a clear statement of the objective of conjunctive water management in legislation is a strong incentive for conjunctive water management policy statements provide direction but a legislated objective creates a legal obligation to implement conjunctive water management independent from policy changes legal provisions for conjunctive water management should take account of the objectives of related national policies and programs such as energy food security and climate change effective conjunctive water management also requires policies and regulations that promote assessment of groundwater and surface water supply and storage options match resources with requirements and enable interchange between groundwater and surface water supply and storage evans and evans 2012 surface water and groundwater connectivity can be classified and assessed in terms of the type and extent of the connection and the time lag between abstractions and impact most groundwater and surface water abstractions affect other resources and or the environment the national water initiative requires an assessment of the connectivity between surface including overland flow and groundwater systems national water commission 2011 because of the wide range of connections between groundwater and surface water resources context specific assessment of the impacts of the use of groundwater and surface water and related opportunities and risks is required in order to calculate sustainable groundwater and surface water use limits skm 2011 this assessment requires a water balance that reflects the whole hydrological cycle and avoids double counting of water available for allocation from connected surface water and groundwater resources for example leakage from irrigation channels and groundwater discharges which become base flow should not be allocated to both groundwater and surface water users evans and evans 2012 evans 2007 key factors that affect sustainable groundwater and surface water use limits include rainfall aquifer recharge and discharge rates and storage conditions water quality environmental requirements legal constraints socio economic conditions and intergenerational equity while sustainable use limits can be objectively assessed there are significant scientific uncertainties and use limits are often disputed by stakeholders reflecting their different preferences this has led to the development of concepts such as consensus yield pierce et al 2013 and acceptable yield richardson et al 2011 which include linked processes of scientific assessment coupled with stakeholder negotiation to set sustainable use limits comprehensive well defined and secure legal entitlements provide authority to use water and incentives to invest in collective water management ostrom 2005 bruns et al 2005 schlager and ostrom distinguish five different entitlements related to common pool resources such as a water resource access to a resource use of a resource management of a resource exclusion of others from a resource and transfer of an entitlement to use a resource to another owner schlager and ostrom 1992 entitlements to store water in a surface water storage or an aquifer and then to extract it for use or transfer are also required to enable conjunctive water management decisions on the issue of entitlements to access use store and exchange gw and sw need to take account of possible economic social and environmental impacts across the connection skm 2011 groundwater and surface water plans including clearly specified transparent and measurable objectives and rules for water access use storage and transfer provide direction for conjunctive water management and confidence for participants in a conjunctive use system these plans need to enable extended banking of water in aquifers and extraction when it is required when groundwater and surface water resources are connected rules for surface water users need to take account of extent and timing of impacts on groundwater and the environment and vice versa national water commission 2011 skm 2011 rules and their administration should be sufficiently flexible to respond to variations in water availability socio economic and political conditions and new knowledge pahl wostl 2007 water markets and trading developed within an appropriate institutional framework and coupled with comprehensive water planning has increased farm production assisted irrigators adaptation to climate risks and helped to deliver improved environmental outcomes grafton et al 2016 groundwater surface water trading can also lead to increased efficiency in principle groundwater to surface water trading can enable water to be transferred to the uses which give the best value for money groundwater surface water trade is relatively uncomplicated when the resources are highly connected and connections are rapid such as shallow alluvial aquifers underneath rivers in such cases groundwater and surface water can be managed as one resource skm 2011 in other cases it is more complicated to set rules for groundwater surface water trade because connections between groundwater and surface water are less strong more delayed or not well understood environmental impacts are uncertain or groundwater and surface water have different properties e g salinity and pollution in addition plans often cover large areas within which groundwater surface water connections vary substantially fragmentation of roles and responsibilities for conjunctive water management is a major obstacle to good management world bank 2006 conjunctive water management requires effective coordination between groundwater and surface water policy planning and management across multiple geographical and administrative scales coordination is also needed between water management and other related activities including land management energy and spatial planning turral and fullagar 2007 ross and martinez santos 2010 management of surface water and groundwater can be integrated within one agency or coordinated between several agencies including government departments and a basin management organisation providing that groundwater and surface water managers work together and coordinate their activities participation by groundwater and surface water users in decision making is necessary to ensure that users understand each other have the opportunity to identify and make tradeoffs and craft mutually acceptable solutions taking account of relevant information and uncertainties emerson et al 2012 participation in water management planning encourages support for plan implementation from groundwater and surface water users sabatier et al 2005 a participatory culture of education demonstration and capacity building between governments groundwater and surface water users enables integrated water use targeted at socially desired outcomes evans and evans 2012 letcher et al 2007 metering and monitoring of key variables such as water levels in reservoirs and aquifers water abstractions water uses and water quality are important to provide feedback about the performance of conjunctive water management allow ongoing iteration and also to enable the enforcement of water plans and rules ostrom 2005 gggfa 2015a groundwater and surface water monitoring should be coordinated in a single program evans and evans 2012 while this framework and conditions give general guidance for the assessment of conjunctive water management the wide variety of hydrogeological socio economic and political settings mean that there is no single template or formula that will provide for conjunctive water management in all places the relative quantity quality accessibility and connectivity of groundwater and surface water resources varies substantially and cross impacts of groundwater and surface water use range from large and immediate to small and long term in the following section the performance of conjunctive water management in australia is assessed with reference to the conditions for conjunctive water management set out in table 1 3 assessment of conjunctive water management in five australian states and the northern territory the main results of a comparative assessment of conjunctive water management in the five largest australian states new south wales queensland south australia victoria western australia and the northern territory are summarised in table 2 2 this assessment was carried out by the author for the national water commission in 2013 and updated using the commissions fourth biennial assessment of the nwr in 2014 this assessment is based on review of a large number of state policy documents and plans which are not referenced individually in this article 2 an assessment of the availability of information for decision makers stakeholder participation and metering and monitoring is also provided further explanation is provided in the following paragraphs tasmania and the australian capital territory are excluded because they are relatively small and marginal cases tasmania had no groundwater plans when the data collection for this analysis was completed in 2013 whereas in the act legislation requires groundwater and surface water to be considered and managed as one resource 3 1 integration of groundwater and surface water planning and management in legislation and policy under australia s federal system of government the states and territories have the primary right to own or control and use water lucy 2008 the objectives of new south wales and victorian legislation and the western australian state water plan specifically refer to the integration of groundwater and surface water management these references encourage conjunctive water management in the other jurisdictions policy and legislation does not specifically refer to the integration of groundwater and surface water management in most jurisdictions the declaration of water management areas and determination of their boundaries is left to the discretion of the responsible minister or administrator the water act 2007 and the 2008 murray darling basin intergovernmental agreement provide specific direction towards conjunctive water management this provides impetus for further integration in the next generation of state and territory water plans water legislation and policy in all of the jurisdictions gives substantial discretion to ministers and agencies in the determination of sustainable use limits priorities for water allocation and priorities and timetables for water planning ministerial and agency discretion concerning high level intervention coupled with pragmatic planning processes can have advantages in dealing with uncertainty and the unexpected but can lead to concerns about a lack of procedural fairness gardner et al 2009 3 2 assessment of groundwater and surface water resources and establishment of sustainable use limits all jurisdictions have developed technical approaches to assess connected groundwater and surface water resources and to establish

movements are comparatively well understood but there are still major shortfalls in information about groundwater quantity quality and dynamics and the connections between groundwater and surface water national water commission 2011 catchment scale models of water resources are a relatively recent phenomenon groundwater and surface water models are usually separate there are few integrated models and in any case it is difficult to model groundwater surface water connections rassam et al 2008 some phenomena are not usually accounted for in models or water balances such as the effects of surface water groundwater interactions and the impacts of farm dams afforestation and irrigation recharge despite technical advances in the assessment of connected groundwater and surface water resources groundwater and surface water use limits are set separately 3 methods used by the jurisdictions are summarised in the national water commission s second biennial assessment of progress in implementation of the nwi http archive nwc gov au library topic assessments ba 2009 p 67 68 accessed 27 june 2013 3 in most jurisdictions sustainable use limits for surface water are determined using an estimate of the total water resource or total divertible resource less environmental water requirements in the murray darling basin current surface water sustainable use limits are based on the 1995 murray darling basin cap from 2019 new sustainable use limits will be implemented to be consistent with the limits set in the 2012 murray darling basin plan this plan also sets limits on groundwater use which take account of estimated rainfall recharge to groundwater base flow through flow discharge and groundwater dependent ecosystems were considered in setting these limits 3 3 entitlements to access store and use groundwater and surface water entitlements and rules for conjunctive water management can be divided into four categories access use storage and exchange each source of water requires clearly defined secure entitlements and rules to enable sustainable and efficient operation at the same time flexible implementation of water entitlements and rules is needed to allow for changes in knowledge and unforeseen climatic extremes droughts and floods in the murray darling basin flexible surface water allocations are achieved by providing entitlement holders with seasonally or annually adjustable shares of their water entitlements groundwater entitlement holders and surface water licence holders in other regions are generally allocated a volumetric amount of water that may be reduced at the discretion of the minister or other relevant authority in response to emergencies australian jurisdictions have established tradable groundwater and surface water use entitlements for most water resources apart from western australia and the northern territory these have legislated security by contrast individual groundwater and surface water storage entitlements have not been established surface water storage and distribution services are supplied at very low cost to users with no accounting for evaporative losses these losses are substantial for example it is estimated they amount to 3000gl year in the murray darling basin almost 30 of the average sustainable diversion limit sdl in the murray darling basin plan and more than the amount of water that had to be recovered from users to achieve the sdl in dry parts of the basin losses can be expected to be greater long term mean evaporation from reservoirs in texas is estimated at 7500 gl year equivalent to 61 of total agricultural water use or 126 of total municipal water use in the state during 2010 wurbs and ayala 2014 there is little incentive for water users to consider underground storage and there are very few large scale underground storage projects in australia in addition to the lack of storage entitlements there are significant gaps and exemptions in the water entitlement and allocation frameworks in the australian jurisdictions stock and domestic use is not included in the water allocation framework and capture of overland flows is not fully regulated mining forestry and other industrial water use is regulated separately with an emphasis on water quality rather than water quantity impacts there has been some progress in regulating water use by forestry in south will australia victoria and tasmania and more limited progress towards establishing water access entitlements for the mining sector 3 4 integrated groundwater and surface water plans australian jurisdictions have made considerable progress in developing water plans that take account of significant connectivity between groundwater and surface water but there are noticeable differences between groundwater and surface water plans most surface water plans across the australian jurisdictions find that connectivity does not exist or is not a significant issue by contrast most groundwater plans recognise that connectivity exists and many include measures to address it most surface water plans do not include any assessment of impacts of surface water diversions on groundwater recharge or measures to deal with these impacts detailed assessments and in some cases partial assessments are accompanied by rules to manage cross impacts there are a large variety of rules and rule settings established to deal with specific conditions and objectives in different water planning areas these rules include various types of pumping limits cease to pump and well spacing rules joint management arrangements low flow by pass roll over triggers and targets examples are set out in table 3 in the first generation of water plans groundwater and surface water plans were generally separate since the nwi in 2004 some jurisdictions have rationalised and or combined new groundwater and surface water plans in regional water resource planning envelopes which cover multiple groundwater and surface water resources examples include macro plans in new south wales and amalgamated water plans in south australia in victoria regional sustainable water strategies have been prepared including the integrated consideration of groundwater and surface water resources some catchment plans have been amalgamated although victoria has completed only one conjunctive water plan at the catchment scale queensland water resources plans did not initially include groundwater but base flow management and groundwater rules are being integrated into resource operational plans and will be progressively incorporated into water resource plans a small number of plans in western australia and the northern territory include both groundwater and surface water 3 5 exchange and trading of groundwater and surface water groundwater and surface water trading can offer opportunities to improve spatial and temporal allocation of water two way surface water groundwater trading is feasible in connected systems especially where resources are highly connected and connections rapid these conditions only apply in a limited number of settings more generally gaps in knowledge about surface water groundwater connections and risks of adverse long term impacts have led australian water managers to take a cautious approach to groundwater surface water trading for example moving water rights from an aquifer to a river could decrease river flows in the short term but this could be offset by increased baseflow in the long term moving river entitlements to an aquifer would benefit some groundwater users but increased groundwater use might adversely affect existing groundwater users and third parties in addition it is complicated to determine rules of exchange between groundwater and surface water entitlements with different characteristics agt hamstead and baldwin 2011 there are very few recorded cases of groundwater and surface water trading in australia water allocation could also be improved by groundwater and surface water storage markets surface water use entitlements based on shares of reservoir storage capacity and inflows of reservoir are being trialled in australia hughes 2013 3 6 management of groundwater and surface water centralised in one organisation australian jurisdictions have relatively centralised water planning and management systems at the highest level groundwater and surface water is managed together at lower levels groundwater and surface water management is separated while the primary authority for water management is usually a single minister supported by a single lead government agency conjunctive water management typically involves multilevel governance interactions between a large number of individuals groups organisations and institutions including governments decisions are the product of complex cycles of interaction in which the participants have varying degrees of influence but no single one is dominant connell et al 2007 surface water issues generally dominate the water policy agenda which has led to a surface water centric management rather than strategic management of groundwater and surface water ross 2012 groundwater issues receive less priority and groundwater is often under represented and understaffed new south wales queensland western australia and the northern territory centralise management and planning authority and state departments develop both policy and detailed local plans in victoria and south australia the state governments set overall objectives and state departments provide a policy and planning framework within which regional and local water management bodies develop detailed local plans and rules 3 7 stakeholder participation in decision making each jurisdiction has statutory consultation mechanisms in water planning but consultation often appears more symbolic than real although participative modelling assessment and planning methods are rated highly by stakeholders less collaborative methods of participation such as information giving and allowing written submissions are often preferred by authorities because they are safer and more easily managed tan et al 2012 in some instances consultation takes place after policy changes have been made in other instances high level interventions overtake collaborative processes without taking account of stakeholder views bowmer 2003 the initial top down consultation on the murray darling basin plan resulted in widespread protests gross 2011 and community support for the plan was only obtained after a much more prolonged consultative process the western australian system of examining alternative management options and the northern territory system of consultation to define priority uses offer innovative collaborative management processes 3 8 groundwater and surface water metering and monitoring the use of surface water is generally measured and monitored by water supply agencies and in some cases by industrial users abs 2015 monitoring groundwater use presents more problems because unlike surface water irrigation water is supplied to users through a regulated system there are a large number of wells mostly on private farms groundwater use is not monitored as systematically as surface water gaps in monitoring and measurement lead to gaps in data required to develop and run models kelly et al 2007 metering of water use has been introduced in regulated river systems and all of the jurisdictions but metering of unregulated surface water systems and groundwater is not standardised the quality of metering and the frequency with which meters are read vary widely the council of australian governments has developed a national framework for non urban water metering to establish a national standard council of australian governments 2010 in new south wales most of the regulated river systems and about 50 of groundwater extraction is metered victoria has over 50 000 metered extraction sites and extensive modernisation is underway queensland is progressively introducing metering while south australia is taking a risk based approach to the implementation of the new standards national water commission 2011 in summary there is much scope for further development and use of conjunctive water management in australia queensland new south wales victoria have established key elements of national water initiative nwi compliant systems but face challenges in integrating previously separate groundwater and surface water entitlement and allocation systems western australia and northern territory are still in the process of establishing a nwi compliant water entitlement system accounting for impacts of groundwater pumping on streamflow has improved but there has been less progress on accounting for the impacts of surface water diversions on recharge there is still little or no systematic attempt to plan and manage groundwater and surface water use and storage at a regional scale over time and aquifer storage and recovery entitlements have not been established water for petroleum and gas mining and forestry is generally managed separately from and not well integrated with the national water management system 4 progress towards conjunctive water management in the western usa the potential of conjunctive water management and managed aquifer recharge is illustrated by the development of these techniques in california and arizona which also illustrates the potential of conjunctive water management and managed aquifer recharge under various institutional settings conjunctive water management in california is the result of multiple initiatives over many years mainly involving water users and municipal governments in arizona conjunctive water management has been driven primarily by an innovative state government aquifer recharge program conjunctive water management activities consist mainly of aquifer recharge and storage of excess or unused portions of arizona s allotment of colorado river water which is conveyed by the central arizona project cap canal sugg et al 2016 conjunctive water management in california is supported by water imported through the central valley project and the state water project canals and aqueducts which have shifted water sources from mostly groundwater use to integrated use of surface water 70 during wet periods and groundwater 70 during droughts scanlan et al 2016 since 2002 1 5 billion has been spent on integrated regional water management activities initiated by 48 regional water management groups cdwr 2016 recently the california department of water resources cdwr and the association of california water agencies conducted a survey that recorded 89 integrated management programs across the state cdwr 2015 conjunctive water management methods vary in coastal areas such as los angeles county and orange county surface water and treated wastewater are injected into aquifers for aquifer replenishment and water banking and to provide a barrier to seawater intrusion drewes 2009 in other districts conjunctive management is used for flood control drought relief and local and statewide water supply reliability improvement cdwr 2014 these investments have been given a further boost by the us 7 12 billion authorised by the california legislature in 2014 for state water supply infrastructure including surface and groundwater storage and water recycling ballotpedia 2016 conjunctive water management and managed aquifer recharge in the central valley has reversed previously declining groundwater level trends of up to 2 5m per year scanlan et al 2016 and enabled some recovery of aquifer levels the scale of integrated water use and aquifer storage facilities in california are much bigger than their australian counterparts in orange county california one water bank holds around 300 gl a year enough for the annual household use of 2 3 million people dillon et al 2009 the semitropic water storage district in central california holds up to 2000 gl for its members integrated water use in arizona accounts for about 25 of central arizona project canal deliveries from the colorado river and has helped stabilize and reverse long term groundwater storage losses in terms of volume arizona s recharge efforts are extensive with about 5000 gl of colorado river water in state surface water and effluent having been stored in the states aquifers megdal et al 2014 impacts of integrated water use and managed aquifer recharge in arizona can be seen from comparisons of recent rising groundwater level trends in the active management areas 0 1 0 5m per year in comparison with declining trends 0 5 1 3m per year in irrigated areas that lack access to surface water to support integrated use or managed aquifer recharge mar flexibility translates to resilience by expanding the portfolio of water sources in the southwestern us and increasing the options provided by water transportation infrastructure allowing water trading among users conjunctive water management and mar enhances system resilience to drought scanlan et al 2016 5 speeding the transition to conjunctive water management conjunctive water management involves integrated use storage and exchange of different sources of water australia faces a number of challenges in making the transition to conjunctive water management these challenges are very similar to those faced in transitions in other sectors institutional fragmentation lack of common vision undefined organisational responsibilities regulatory disincentives and lack of offsetting incentives poor organisational commitment technological path dependency perceived high risks of new technologies poor community capacity to meaningfully participate and lack of experience with facilitating integrated management processes farrelly and brown 2011 loorbach and rotmans 2010 transition management offers one framework to help understand what is required to shift from separate management of groundwater and surface water to integrated management transition management has been proposed as a tool for achieving transformative change in governance loorbach 2007 van de brugge and van raak 2007 case studies illustrate how transitional management involves an adaptive co evolutionary process involving frontrunners or agents who develop new approaches and technologies a transition arena in which a network of frontrunners can develop a common vision and process and a space or niche inside existing governance arrangements through which innovative changes are promoted transitions often meet resistance from the existing regime and a favourable context for change is a key to transition management loorbach and rotmans 2010 transition management in the water sector can be illustrated by a detailed study of the evolution of stormwater management in melbourne australia between the 1960 and 2010 brown et al 2013 in this case study a small group of frontrunners from across government private community and scientific sectors facilitated a broader and more diverse actor network that steered this transition over decades the establishment of networked bridging organisations that facilitated collaboration across government agencies water managers scientists and knowledge brokers was also crucial in forming alliances that supported transition in practices across the city there was no single cause effect relationship nor one dominant intervention or action that shifted the urban stormwater management regime rather new narratives emerged from interaction between frontrunners and their networks which influenced scientific thinking and on the ground experiments these led to new institutional structures and enabling administrative tools each these dimensions is equally important in explaining the evolution of sustainable stormwater management high level leadership is a further important enabling factor for transition the integration of environmental considerations into broader policy considerations requires high level leadership and cultural change as well as new institutional structures and networks ross and dovers 2008 high level policy entrepreneurs play a key role in initiating and driving water transitions huitema and meijerink 2010 and high level leadership is also important in creating a supportive environment for change huntjens et al 2010 the above discussion suggests that a change of paradigm to conjunctive water management can be promoted by six key elements network of frontrunners or change agents bridging organisations that will facilitate collaboration between change agents and other water policy organisations operational managers water users scientists and knowledge brokers arenas where change agents and other stakeholders can collaborate experiments and pilot projects in conjunctive water use storage and exchange high level leadership both to initiate change and to create a supportive environment for change mechanisms for evaluation learning and feedback at two levels among the front runners and among the general policy community there are already a significant number of projects for conjunctive water management especially in the driest states south australia and western australia and in the cities of perth and adelaide the western australian water corporation has set a target for perth of 30 of recycling of all metropolitan wastewater by 2030 and 60 recycling by 2060 western australia water corporation 2009 south australia has a target of 60gl of recycled stormwater and 75gl of treated wastewater for non human consumption by 2050 government of south australia 2009 victoria has established a policy framework for aquifer recharge some trials are being carried out around melbourne and conjunctive water management has been practised in a few catchments in queensland such as the burdekin and lockyer valley these developments have been assisted by bridging organisations and networks in australia at various scales at the national scale the australian water recycling centre has promoted national awareness of opportunities for water recycling and promoted a national program of managed aquifer recharge and storm water use options marsuo pilot studies at the municipal scale the cities of adelaide and perth have taken a leading role in aquifer recharge while these organisations and networks have been successful across urban areas such as adelaide and perth there is an opportunity for national or state based organisations to act as an arena for the discussion and development of broadscale conjunctive water use and storage options include the murray darling basin authority and state water corporations there are two significant barriers to the further development of conjunctive water use and storage the limited amount of surplus water for underground storage experiments and the so called hydro illogical cycle in many parts of australia and throughout the murray darling basin groundwater and surface water is fully allocated in order to obtain water for underground storage water users usually have to purchase water at market rates when stored in aquifers the water becomes the subject to carryover provisions which generally allow three years of storage or less moreover water can be obtained most easily and cheaply for underground storage during wet years but in these years farmers are focused on maximising production and the enthusiasm for investment in new sources of water supply and storage is at its lowest point yet this is the best time to replenish groundwater banks so that they will be available during the next dry period new visions of conjunctive water management through time championed by front running organisations and high level political and bureaucratic leaders coupled with broadscale conjunctive water management pilot projects will be needed to overcome these barriers 6 conclusions this review of progress towards conjunctive water management in australia reveals some progress in conjunctive use of water resources but little progress on integrated dam and aquifer storage or trading between groundwater and surface water there are major opportunities for conjunctive water management using underground water banking and managed aquifer recharge developments in the western usa indicate the potential of conjunctive water management and opportunities for groundwater and surface water trading could be further explored a new paradigm of conjunctive water management and storage is required this involves the systematic consideration of the opportunities for beneficial integration of groundwater and surface water use and storage in all new water plans and development projects involving significant use of water resources two key policy and institutional conditions are missing in australia and need to be put in place guaranteed recovery of water stored underground and extended carryover arrangements to allow long term underground storage there are already some front running organisations and networks driving the adoption of new sources of water supply and aquifer storage in australian cities generally there is no parallel transition towards conjunctive water management in rural areas the deadline for preparation of the next generation of water plans in the murray darling basin is not until 2019 and investments in water resource development and storage in northern australia are under consideration these scheduled developments in the mdb and northern australia provide significant opportunities to re design water plans to take full account of the opportunities for conjunctive use of groundwater surface water and recycled water over wet and dry climatic cycles leadership from the council of australian governments is required to lead national efforts towards integrated water resource use and management because responsibilities for managing water allocation and water quality are divided between many agencies in the australian government and state jurisdictions support from water managers irrigation associations and water corporations is also crucial the last national meeting on conjunctive water management in australia was held in 2004 a renewed national discussion would consolidate the advances with water recycling and aquifer storage and recovery that have been made in urban areas and encourage investors and governments to initiate pilot studies and further experiments in broadscale conjunctive water use 
6923,conjunctive water management involves the combined use of groundwater surface water and or additional sources of water to achieve public policy and management goals conjunctive water management enables greater water supply security and stability helps adaptation to climate variation and uncertainty and reduces depletion and degradation of water resources there are many opportunities to benefit from improved conjunctive water management if institutional and political barriers can be overcome this article provides the first comprehensive assessments of progress towards conjunctive water management on a continental scale across the australian states and territories and suggests an innovative approach towards overcoming barriers to integration conditions for the implementation of conjunctive water management have only been partially met by the australian states there has been progress towards integrated groundwater and surface water accounting and planning but there is still little systematic attempt to plan and manage surface water and groundwater storage and use at a regional scale over time current policies effectively subsidise surface water storage and aquifer storage and recovery entitlements are not in place in some jurisdictions a new paradigm of conjunctive water management is required involving systematic consideration of the beneficial integration of groundwater surface water and other water sources in water plans and projects transition to conjunctive water management can be promoted by networks including change agents bridging organisations and water management institutions supported by strong leadership from governments keywords conjunctive water management groundwater surface water storage transition 1 introduction in many parts of the world water resources are under pressure from economic and population growth and climate change demand for water is projected to grow by more than 40 by 2050 by 2025 an estimated 1 8billion people will live in countries or regions in which water is scarce and two thirds of the world s population could be living in conditions in which the supply of clean water does not meet the demand un 2015 in recent decades the use of groundwater has been increasing around the world in response to the rising demands for drinking water supplies and food production for a growing global population today groundwater is estimated globally to provide 36 of potable water 42 of water for irrigated agriculture and 24 of direct industrial water supply groundwater supplies are diminishing with an estimated 20 of the world s aquifers being over exploited leading to serious consequences such as water shortages land subsidence and saltwater intrusion in coastal areas gleeson et al 2012 in order to sustain groundwater use careful management to conserve aquifers is required together with exploitation of opportunities for enhanced groundwater recharge taylor et al 2013 coordinated management of groundwater and surface water in combination otherwise referred to as conjunctive water management can bring a number of benefits including enhanced water availability security and water quality better management of impacts of water use and greater capacity to adapt to climatic variation and uncertainty conjunctive water management aims to make the best use of multiple water sources including surface water groundwater recycled stormwater and wastewater at the scale of river basins and aquifers gggfa 2015b alley 2016 conjunctive water management exploits the complementary properties of groundwater and surface water surface water flows are visible but surface water supply is often highly variable when groundwater is accessible and of suitable quality it is a stable and reliable source of supply and aquifer storage avoids evaporative losses national water commission 2014b conjunctive water management can increase water supply security and stability by making the best spatial and temporal use of different water sources and storage this includes using surplus surface water and recycled water to recharge aquifers and drawing water from aquifer storage when surface water is scarce it can also lead to better timing of irrigation water delivery by compensating for shortfalls in water availability at critical times for crops and water dependent ecosystems evans and evans 2012 conjunctive water management can improve water quality by mixing different water sources and combining water treatment with enhanced recharge to achieve specified water quality targets groundwater systems can be used to stabilise water quality leach or dilute pollutants control seawater intrusion while surface water can be used to freshen saline aquifers conjunctive water management can account for and address the cross impacts of groundwater and surface water use on connected resources and the environment this can counteract waterlogging and salination excessive river flow depletion drying wetlands and aquifer exploitation winter et al 1998 sophocleous 2002 evans 2007 if impacts cannot be avoided conjunctive water management can reduce the impact by transferring or sharing impacts across systems and deferring impact through time or distributing them over a wider area conjunctive water management can also help adaptation to climatic variation and uncertainty by means of supply diversification underground storage and water transfers halstead and o shea 1989 agrawal 2008 aquifers can be used to store dam overflows and floods and smooth daily variation in urban water demand and seasonal variation in irrigation demand despite its obvious advantages conjunctive groundwater and surface water management has not realised its potential while the physical conditions for broadscale conjunctive water management exist in many parts of the world there are significant institutional and political barriers gggfa 2015a national water commission 2011 2014a there is a continuing emphasis on supply driven surface water investments and lack of recognition of the structural importance of groundwater investment in conjunctive water resource management institutional barriers include gaps and inconsistencies in the structure of water entitlements and the slow development of integrated water resource plans and measures to address overallocation of water resources there are gaps in information about groundwater surface water interactions evans 2007 moench 2004 many impacts from these interactions are long term and overlooked by policy making in short term political cycles resistance by some stakeholders to change and split responsibility for groundwater and surface water development and management present further challenges ross 2012 there are few comprehensive studies of institutional and political issues related to conjunctive water management in 1996 the us environment protection agency funded a comparative institutional analysis of conjunctive water management in arizona colorado and california blomquist et al 2004 this study showed the substantial influence of water entitlements operational rules and management organisations on conjunctive water management the managing connected waters project funded by the australian research council and the natural heritage trust aimed to provide a co ordinated approach to groundwater and surface water management including institutional and communication issues fullagar 2004 brodie et al 2007 1 http www connectedwater gov au framework institutional arrangements html accessed 28 january 2012 1 recently conjunctive water management has been affirmed as a key principle of international groundwater management by the groundwater governance global framework for action gggfa 2015a b and other international and australian policy papers have proposed key issues and principles for conjunctive water management world bank 2006 evans and evans 2012 skm 2011 this article contributes to the literature on the implementation of conjunctive water management by means of the first assessment of progress towards conjunctive water management at a continental scale across the australian states and territories the article also introduces an innovative approach to overcome barriers to conjunctive water management drawing on insights from literature on water management transitions the choice of australia for this study is supported by the potential for conjunctive water management to address water supply variability and scarcity challenges coupled with the observation that groundwater and surface water generally continue to be managed separately and there are few strategic conjunctive water management initiatives or projects the assessment is based on an analysis of australian and state government legal and policy documents reports and water plans consultant reports academic papers and media reports which the author carried out in 2013 on behalf of the national water commission national water commission 2014b the author also draws on responses to semi structured interviews with government water managers consultants academics and water users representatives which he carried out in 2009 during his phd research on conjunctive water management in the murray darling basin the remainder of this article is structured as follows firstly a framework for analysing the performance of conjunctive water management is presented building on australian and international policy studies skm 2011 evans and evans 2012 gggfa 2015b key prerequisites for conjunctive water management include clearly defined legislative and policy objectives groundwater and surface water entitlements integrated water planning and coordinated management arrangements secondly the performance of conjunctive water management in the australian states and territories is assessed based on this framework comparison between australia and examples from the western usa are included to place the australian experience in an international context thirdly progress achieved on conjunctive water management and challenges are assessed and priorities and steps are suggested for speeding the transition to beneficial conjunctive management of water resources 2 framework for the assessment of the integration of groundwater and surface water management 2 1 definition and scope of conjunctive water management 2 1 1 definition conjunctive water management can be defined as the combined use of groundwater surface water and or additional sources of water to achieve public policy and management goals there is a strong case for conjunctive management of groundwater and surface water under two conditions 1 groundwater and surface water resources are connected surface water infiltrates to groundwater or groundwater flows into surface water this means that the use of surface water will impact on groundwater and its users and vice versa 2 the use of groundwater or surface water has impacts across other resources and their users these cross impacts may occur whether or not groundwater and surface water resources are connected for example if groundwater or surface water is depleted the demand for other water resources is likely to increase the connections between groundwater and surface water resources and the extent of groundwater surface water use impacts vary substantially within a given water management region groundwater and surface water resources are separated geographically or by impermeable confining layers of clay or rock therefore the strength and timeframes of connections vary substantially and are not well understood evans 2007 moench 2004 important distinctions can be made between regulated perennial and unregulated ephemeral rivers and alluvial and fractured rock aquifers skm 2011 in addition some aquifers contain non renewable fossil groundwater which can be depleted like mineral resources the impacts of groundwater and surface water uses across other water resources and their users are also highly variable these include impacts on the quantity and quality of water resources and on connected environmental assets and services for example groundwater pumping can reduce streamflow and surface water availability while surface water use can reduce groundwater recharge groundwater can be polluted by agricultural chemicals heavy metals pharmaceuticals and other contaminants carried by surface water surface water can be polluted by saline or contaminated groundwater socio economic impacts vary substantially between regions according to the number of people and economic sectors dependent on groundwater and surface water the intensity of resource use and the risks of pollution created by human activity conflicts over water use present political problems in some heavily exploited resources in the southern half of australia while there are opportunities for development in areas where resources are lightly exploited especially in the northern half of the continent gggfa 2015a national water commission 2014a the case for conjunctive water management is strongest when connections are strong and rapid skm 2011 but the general application of conjunctive water management on a precautionary basis is justified by gaps in information and uncertainties about cross impacts of groundwater and surface water use and the fact that many of these impacts do not appear for many years 2 1 2 conjunctive water use and conjunctive water management a distinction can be made between conjunctive water use and conjunctive water management conjunctive water use refers to coordinated use by water users for specific purposes for example irrigation municipal use or mining private water users generally aim to maximise water use efficiency and rarely take account of broader social objectives conjunctive water management refers to coordinated management of groundwater and surface water to optimise use of resources to meet broad social objectives such as the supply of enough water of sufficient quality to meet municipal agricultural industrial and environmental requirements while some social benefits have been achieved by private conjunctive water use such as that developed in many irrigation districts private groundwater users are more likely to organise themselves to manage issues with an immediate impact on their production and the resource such as new wells well depth and seasonal timing they are unlikely to take action to manage impacts of pumping that emerge in distant locations or in the longer term such as remote impacts on streamflow declining water tables and drying wetlands schlager 2007 irrigation managers aim to maximise irrigation water use efficiency and often neglect the associated reductions in groundwater recharge coordinated conjunctive water management by private users and public authorities can ensure that cross resource impacts of groundwater and surface water use are fully accounted for and managed this requires cross sectoral and cross agency coordination of water resources land uses and the environment at multiple spatial and time scales and administrative levels this goes beyond what has been achieved by private conjunctive water users foster and van steenbergen 2011 2 1 3 additional sources of water for conjunctive water management when the term conjunctive water management was introduced it referred to surface water and groundwater more recently additional sources of water have been introduced including desalinated water recycled stormwater and wastewater from sewage treatment plants and industrial processes dillon et al 2012 these additional sources are available for human agricultural or industrial use after appropriate treatment the definition of conjunctive water management can be broadened to include conjunctive use of groundwater or surface water with one of these additional sources of water when they are combined with either surface water or groundwater before further use conjunctive management of groundwater surface water and additional sources includes combination of recycled or desalinated water with other surface water as well as underground storage treatment and recovery of recycled water managed aquifer recharge and aquifer storage and recovery if one of these additional sources is supplied directly for human consumption or agricultural use after treatment without being combined with groundwater or surface water this cannot be counted as conjunctive water management since there is only one source of water involved 2 1 4 bluewater and greenwater the availability of water for plant growth and food production can be divided into the blue water in aquifers rivers and lakes and the green water in soil moisture falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 the scope of conjunctive water management can be further expanded to include land and water management practices that encourage infiltration soil moisture retention and aquifer recharge such as slowing the passage of water in the landscape increasing vegetative cover and modifying diversionary structures national water commission 2014b the data collected for this article is insufficient to include soil moisture in the analysis of conjunctive water management this is an important task for future research 2 2 framework for assessing conjunctive water management in australia the 2004 national water initiative established a national system of managing surface and groundwater resources for rural and urban use coag 2004 the nwi para 23x further states that the connectivity between groundwater and surface water should be recognised and connected systems should be managed together the water act 2007 s 20b provides for the integrated management of basin water resources and the establishment and enforcement of environmentally sustainable limits of the quantities of groundwater and surface water that may be taken from a basin water resources the physical preconditions for broadscale conjunctive water management and water banking exist in many parts of australia and there is significant community support rawluk et al 2013 although there is varied public acceptance of different water sources such as recycled water and rainwater hurlimann and dolnicar 2016 while conjunctive water use including groundwater surface water substitution and use of groundwater as a buffer has been widely practised by irrigators progress towards conjunctive management of connected groundwater and surface water systems has been limited there have been some small and medium sized aquifer recharge projects around urban centres but relatively few examples of catchment scale conjunctive water management and very few large scale recharge and recovery projects interventions to promote conjunctive water management can be broadly divided into policies and regulations administered by water managers field based land and water practices and technology based infrastructure the first category includes permitting systems for water users and restrictions on water use substitution of groundwater and surface water foregoing use of a water resource in return for a benefit carryover of water use entitlements water banking and surface water groundwater trading the second category includes land and water management practices that encourage soil moisture retention and aquifer recharge by slowing the passage of water in the landscape increasing vegetative cover channelling water to areas with high recharge protecting recharge areas and encouraging water infiltration through leaky ditches and channels the third category includes dams water transfer projects aquifer storage and recovery river bank storage water treatment plants and seawater intrusion barriers national water commission 2014b gggfa 2015a several authors have investigated the conditions for conjunctive water management in australia skm 2006 2011 and internationally evans and evans 2012 dillon et al 2012 gggfa 2015b eight conditions for the implementation of conjunctive water management can be derived from this previous work these conditions are summarised in table 1 and explained in the following paragraphs a clear statement of the objective of conjunctive water management in legislation is a strong incentive for conjunctive water management policy statements provide direction but a legislated objective creates a legal obligation to implement conjunctive water management independent from policy changes legal provisions for conjunctive water management should take account of the objectives of related national policies and programs such as energy food security and climate change effective conjunctive water management also requires policies and regulations that promote assessment of groundwater and surface water supply and storage options match resources with requirements and enable interchange between groundwater and surface water supply and storage evans and evans 2012 surface water and groundwater connectivity can be classified and assessed in terms of the type and extent of the connection and the time lag between abstractions and impact most groundwater and surface water abstractions affect other resources and or the environment the national water initiative requires an assessment of the connectivity between surface including overland flow and groundwater systems national water commission 2011 because of the wide range of connections between groundwater and surface water resources context specific assessment of the impacts of the use of groundwater and surface water and related opportunities and risks is required in order to calculate sustainable groundwater and surface water use limits skm 2011 this assessment requires a water balance that reflects the whole hydrological cycle and avoids double counting of water available for allocation from connected surface water and groundwater resources for example leakage from irrigation channels and groundwater discharges which become base flow should not be allocated to both groundwater and surface water users evans and evans 2012 evans 2007 key factors that affect sustainable groundwater and surface water use limits include rainfall aquifer recharge and discharge rates and storage conditions water quality environmental requirements legal constraints socio economic conditions and intergenerational equity while sustainable use limits can be objectively assessed there are significant scientific uncertainties and use limits are often disputed by stakeholders reflecting their different preferences this has led to the development of concepts such as consensus yield pierce et al 2013 and acceptable yield richardson et al 2011 which include linked processes of scientific assessment coupled with stakeholder negotiation to set sustainable use limits comprehensive well defined and secure legal entitlements provide authority to use water and incentives to invest in collective water management ostrom 2005 bruns et al 2005 schlager and ostrom distinguish five different entitlements related to common pool resources such as a water resource access to a resource use of a resource management of a resource exclusion of others from a resource and transfer of an entitlement to use a resource to another owner schlager and ostrom 1992 entitlements to store water in a surface water storage or an aquifer and then to extract it for use or transfer are also required to enable conjunctive water management decisions on the issue of entitlements to access use store and exchange gw and sw need to take account of possible economic social and environmental impacts across the connection skm 2011 groundwater and surface water plans including clearly specified transparent and measurable objectives and rules for water access use storage and transfer provide direction for conjunctive water management and confidence for participants in a conjunctive use system these plans need to enable extended banking of water in aquifers and extraction when it is required when groundwater and surface water resources are connected rules for surface water users need to take account of extent and timing of impacts on groundwater and the environment and vice versa national water commission 2011 skm 2011 rules and their administration should be sufficiently flexible to respond to variations in water availability socio economic and political conditions and new knowledge pahl wostl 2007 water markets and trading developed within an appropriate institutional framework and coupled with comprehensive water planning has increased farm production assisted irrigators adaptation to climate risks and helped to deliver improved environmental outcomes grafton et al 2016 groundwater surface water trading can also lead to increased efficiency in principle groundwater to surface water trading can enable water to be transferred to the uses which give the best value for money groundwater surface water trade is relatively uncomplicated when the resources are highly connected and connections are rapid such as shallow alluvial aquifers underneath rivers in such cases groundwater and surface water can be managed as one resource skm 2011 in other cases it is more complicated to set rules for groundwater surface water trade because connections between groundwater and surface water are less strong more delayed or not well understood environmental impacts are uncertain or groundwater and surface water have different properties e g salinity and pollution in addition plans often cover large areas within which groundwater surface water connections vary substantially fragmentation of roles and responsibilities for conjunctive water management is a major obstacle to good management world bank 2006 conjunctive water management requires effective coordination between groundwater and surface water policy planning and management across multiple geographical and administrative scales coordination is also needed between water management and other related activities including land management energy and spatial planning turral and fullagar 2007 ross and martinez santos 2010 management of surface water and groundwater can be integrated within one agency or coordinated between several agencies including government departments and a basin management organisation providing that groundwater and surface water managers work together and coordinate their activities participation by groundwater and surface water users in decision making is necessary to ensure that users understand each other have the opportunity to identify and make tradeoffs and craft mutually acceptable solutions taking account of relevant information and uncertainties emerson et al 2012 participation in water management planning encourages support for plan implementation from groundwater and surface water users sabatier et al 2005 a participatory culture of education demonstration and capacity building between governments groundwater and surface water users enables integrated water use targeted at socially desired outcomes evans and evans 2012 letcher et al 2007 metering and monitoring of key variables such as water levels in reservoirs and aquifers water abstractions water uses and water quality are important to provide feedback about the performance of conjunctive water management allow ongoing iteration and also to enable the enforcement of water plans and rules ostrom 2005 gggfa 2015a groundwater and surface water monitoring should be coordinated in a single program evans and evans 2012 while this framework and conditions give general guidance for the assessment of conjunctive water management the wide variety of hydrogeological socio economic and political settings mean that there is no single template or formula that will provide for conjunctive water management in all places the relative quantity quality accessibility and connectivity of groundwater and surface water resources varies substantially and cross impacts of groundwater and surface water use range from large and immediate to small and long term in the following section the performance of conjunctive water management in australia is assessed with reference to the conditions for conjunctive water management set out in table 1 3 assessment of conjunctive water management in five australian states and the northern territory the main results of a comparative assessment of conjunctive water management in the five largest australian states new south wales queensland south australia victoria western australia and the northern territory are summarised in table 2 2 this assessment was carried out by the author for the national water commission in 2013 and updated using the commissions fourth biennial assessment of the nwr in 2014 this assessment is based on review of a large number of state policy documents and plans which are not referenced individually in this article 2 an assessment of the availability of information for decision makers stakeholder participation and metering and monitoring is also provided further explanation is provided in the following paragraphs tasmania and the australian capital territory are excluded because they are relatively small and marginal cases tasmania had no groundwater plans when the data collection for this analysis was completed in 2013 whereas in the act legislation requires groundwater and surface water to be considered and managed as one resource 3 1 integration of groundwater and surface water planning and management in legislation and policy under australia s federal system of government the states and territories have the primary right to own or control and use water lucy 2008 the objectives of new south wales and victorian legislation and the western australian state water plan specifically refer to the integration of groundwater and surface water management these references encourage conjunctive water management in the other jurisdictions policy and legislation does not specifically refer to the integration of groundwater and surface water management in most jurisdictions the declaration of water management areas and determination of their boundaries is left to the discretion of the responsible minister or administrator the water act 2007 and the 2008 murray darling basin intergovernmental agreement provide specific direction towards conjunctive water management this provides impetus for further integration in the next generation of state and territory water plans water legislation and policy in all of the jurisdictions gives substantial discretion to ministers and agencies in the determination of sustainable use limits priorities for water allocation and priorities and timetables for water planning ministerial and agency discretion concerning high level intervention coupled with pragmatic planning processes can have advantages in dealing with uncertainty and the unexpected but can lead to concerns about a lack of procedural fairness gardner et al 2009 3 2 assessment of groundwater and surface water resources and establishment of sustainable use limits all jurisdictions have developed technical approaches to assess connected groundwater and surface water resources and to establish sustainable use limits based on the classification and analysis of water resources the degree of connectivity cross impacts of use and timing of impacts the main surface water resources and their movements are comparatively well understood but there are still major shortfalls in information about groundwater quantity quality and dynamics and the connections between groundwater and surface water national water commission 2011 catchment scale models of water resources are a relatively recent phenomenon groundwater and surface water models are usually separate there are few integrated models and in any case it is difficult to model groundwater surface water connections rassam et al 2008 some phenomena are not usually accounted for in models or water balances such as the effects of surface water groundwater interactions and the impacts of farm dams afforestation and irrigation recharge despite technical advances in the assessment of connected groundwater and surface water resources groundwater and surface water use limits are set separately 3 methods used by the jurisdictions are summarised in the national water commission s second biennial assessment of progress in implementation of the nwi http archive nwc gov au library topic assessments ba 2009 p 67 68 accessed 27 june 2013 3 in most jurisdictions sustainable use limits for surface water are determined using an estimate of the total water resource or total divertible resource less environmental water requirements in the murray darling basin current surface water sustainable use limits are based on the 1995 murray darling basin cap from 2019 new sustainable use limits will be implemented to be consistent with the limits set in the 2012 murray darling basin plan this plan also sets limits on groundwater use which take account of estimated rainfall recharge to groundwater base flow through flow discharge and groundwater dependent ecosystems were considered in setting these limits 3 3 entitlements to access store and use groundwater and surface water entitlements and rules for conjunctive water management can be divided into four categories access use storage and exchange each source of water requires clearly defined secure entitlements and rules to enable sustainable and efficient operation at the same time flexible implementation of water entitlements and rules is needed to allow for changes in knowledge and unforeseen climatic extremes droughts and floods in the murray darling basin flexible surface water allocations are achieved by providing entitlement holders with seasonally or annually adjustable shares of their water entitlements groundwater entitlement holders and surface water licence holders in other regions are generally allocated a volumetric amount of water that may be reduced at the discretion of the minister or other relevant authority in response to emergencies australian jurisdictions have established tradable groundwater and surface water use entitlements for most water resources apart from western australia and the northern territory these have legislated security by contrast individual groundwater and surface water storage entitlements have not been established surface water storage and distribution services are supplied at very low cost to users with no accounting for evaporative losses these losses are substantial for example it is estimated they amount to 3000gl year in the murray darling basin almost 30 of the average sustainable diversion limit sdl in the murray darling basin plan and more than the amount of water that had to be recovered from users to achieve the sdl in dry parts of the basin losses can be expected to be greater long term mean evaporation from reservoirs in texas is estimated at 7500 gl year equivalent to 61 of total agricultural water use or 126 of total municipal water use in the state during 2010 wurbs and ayala 2014 there is little incentive for water users to consider underground storage and there are very few large scale underground storage projects in australia in addition to the lack of storage entitlements there are significant gaps and exemptions in the water entitlement and allocation frameworks in the australian jurisdictions stock and domestic use is not included in the water allocation framework and capture of overland flows is not fully regulated mining forestry and other industrial water use is regulated separately with an emphasis on water quality rather than water quantity impacts there has been some progress in regulating water use by forestry in south will australia victoria and tasmania and more limited progress towards establishing water access entitlements for the mining sector 3 4 integrated groundwater and surface water plans australian jurisdictions have made considerable progress in developing water plans that take account of significant connectivity between groundwater and surface water but there are noticeable differences between groundwater and surface water plans most surface water plans across the australian jurisdictions find that connectivity does not exist or is not a significant issue by contrast most groundwater plans recognise that connectivity exists and many include measures to address it most surface water plans do not include any assessment of impacts of surface water diversions on groundwater recharge or measures to deal with these impacts detailed assessments and in some cases partial assessments are accompanied by rules to manage cross impacts there are a large variety of rules and rule settings established to deal with specific conditions and objectives in different water planning areas these rules include various types of pumping limits cease to pump and well spacing rules joint management arrangements low flow by pass roll over triggers and targets examples are set out in table 3 in the first generation of water plans groundwater and surface water plans were generally separate since the nwi in 2004 some jurisdictions have rationalised and or combined new groundwater and surface water plans in regional water resource planning envelopes which cover multiple groundwater and surface water resources examples include macro plans in new south wales and amalgamated water plans in south australia in victoria regional sustainable water strategies have been prepared including the integrated consideration of groundwater and surface water resources some catchment plans have been amalgamated although victoria has completed only one conjunctive water plan at the catchment scale queensland water resources plans did not initially include groundwater but base flow management and groundwater rules are being integrated into resource operational plans and will be progressively incorporated into water resource plans a small number of plans in western australia and the northern territory include both groundwater and surface water 3 5 exchange and trading of groundwater and surface water groundwater and surface water trading can offer opportunities to improve spatial and temporal allocation of water two way surface water groundwater trading is feasible in connected systems especially where resources are highly connected and connections rapid these conditions only apply in a limited number of settings more generally gaps in knowledge about surface water groundwater connections and risks of adverse long term impacts have led australian water managers to take a cautious approach to groundwater surface water trading for example moving water rights from an aquifer to a river could decrease river flows in the short term but this could be offset by increased baseflow in the long term moving river entitlements to an aquifer would benefit some groundwater users but increased groundwater use might adversely affect existing groundwater users and third parties in addition it is complicated to determine rules of exchange between groundwater and surface water entitlements with different characteristics agt hamstead and baldwin 2011 there are very few recorded cases of groundwater and surface water trading in australia water allocation could also be improved by groundwater and surface water storage markets surface water use entitlements based on shares of reservoir storage capacity and inflows of reservoir are being trialled in australia hughes 2013 3 6 management of groundwater and surface water centralised in one organisation australian jurisdictions have relatively centralised water planning and management systems at the highest level groundwater and surface water is managed together at lower levels groundwater and surface water management is separated while the primary authority for water management is usually a single minister supported by a single lead government agency conjunctive water management typically involves multilevel governance interactions between a large number of individuals groups organisations and institutions including governments decisions are the product of complex cycles of interaction in which the participants have varying degrees of influence but no single one is dominant connell et al 2007 surface water issues generally dominate the water policy agenda which has led to a surface water centric management rather than strategic management of groundwater and surface water ross 2012 groundwater issues receive less priority and groundwater is often under represented and understaffed new south wales queensland western australia and the northern territory centralise management and planning authority and state departments develop both policy and detailed local plans in victoria and south australia the state governments set overall objectives and state departments provide a policy and planning framework within which regional and local water management bodies develop detailed local plans and rules 3 7 stakeholder participation in decision making each jurisdiction has statutory consultation mechanisms in water planning but consultation often appears more symbolic than real although participative modelling assessment and planning methods are rated highly by stakeholders less collaborative methods of participation such as information giving and allowing written submissions are often preferred by authorities because they are safer and more easily managed tan et al 2012 in some instances consultation takes place after policy changes have been made in other instances high level interventions overtake collaborative processes without taking account of stakeholder views bowmer 2003 the initial top down consultation on the murray darling basin plan resulted in widespread protests gross 2011 and community support for the plan was only obtained after a much more prolonged consultative process the western australian system of examining alternative management options and the northern territory system of consultation to define priority uses offer innovative collaborative management processes 3 8 groundwater and surface water metering and monitoring the use of surface water is generally measured and monitored by water supply agencies and in some cases by industrial users abs 2015 monitoring groundwater use presents more problems because unlike surface water irrigation water is supplied to users through a regulated system there are a large number of wells mostly on private farms groundwater use is not monitored as systematically as surface water gaps in monitoring and measurement lead to gaps in data required to develop and run models kelly et al 2007 metering of water use has been introduced in regulated river systems and all of the jurisdictions but metering of unregulated surface water systems and groundwater is not standardised the quality of metering and the frequency with which meters are read vary widely the council of australian governments has developed a national framework for non urban water metering to establish a national standard council of australian governments 2010 in new south wales most of the regulated river systems and about 50 of groundwater extraction is metered victoria has over 50 000 metered extraction sites and extensive modernisation is underway queensland is progressively introducing metering while south australia is taking a risk based approach to the implementation of the new standards national water commission 2011 in summary there is much scope for further development and use of conjunctive water management in australia queensland new south wales victoria have established key elements of national water initiative nwi compliant systems but face challenges in integrating previously separate groundwater and surface water entitlement and allocation systems western australia and northern territory are still in the process of establishing a nwi compliant water entitlement system accounting for impacts of groundwater pumping on streamflow has improved but there has been less progress on accounting for the impacts of surface water diversions on recharge there is still little or no systematic attempt to plan and manage groundwater and surface water use and storage at a regional scale over time and aquifer storage and recovery entitlements have not been established water for petroleum and gas mining and forestry is generally managed separately from and not well integrated with the national water management system 4 progress towards conjunctive water management in the western usa the potential of conjunctive water management and managed aquifer recharge is illustrated by the development of these techniques in california and arizona which also illustrates the potential of conjunctive water management and managed aquifer recharge under various institutional settings conjunctive water management in california is the result of multiple initiatives over many years mainly involving water users and municipal governments in arizona conjunctive water management has been driven primarily by an innovative state government aquifer recharge program conjunctive water management activities consist mainly of aquifer recharge and storage of excess or unused portions of arizona s allotment of colorado river water which is conveyed by the central arizona project cap canal sugg et al 2016 conjunctive water management in california is supported by water imported through the central valley project and the state water project canals and aqueducts which have shifted water sources from mostly groundwater use to integrated use of surface water 70 during wet periods and groundwater 70 during droughts scanlan et al 2016 since 2002 1 5 billion has been spent on integrated regional water management activities initiated by 48 regional water management groups cdwr 2016 recently the california department of water resources cdwr and the association of california water agencies conducted a survey that recorded 89 integrated management programs across the state cdwr 2015 conjunctive water management methods vary in coastal areas such as los angeles county and orange county surface water and treated wastewater are injected into aquifers for aquifer replenishment and water banking and to provide a barrier to seawater intrusion drewes 2009 in other districts conjunctive management is used for flood control drought relief and local and statewide water supply reliability improvement cdwr 2014 these investments have been given a further boost by the us 7 12 billion authorised by the california legislature in 2014 for state water supply infrastructure including surface and groundwater storage and water recycling ballotpedia 2016 conjunctive water management and managed aquifer recharge in the central valley has reversed previously declining groundwater level trends of up to 2 5m per year scanlan et al 2016 and enabled some recovery of aquifer levels the scale of integrated water use and aquifer storage facilities in california are much bigger than their australian counterparts in orange county california one water bank holds around 300 gl a year enough for the annual household use of 2 3 million people dillon et al 2009 the semitropic water storage district in central california holds up to 2000 gl for its members integrated water use in arizona accounts for about 25 of central arizona project canal deliveries from the colorado river and has helped stabilize and reverse long term groundwater storage losses in terms of volume arizona s recharge efforts are extensive with about 5000 gl of colorado river water in state surface water and effluent having been stored in the states aquifers megdal et al 2014 impacts of integrated water use and managed aquifer recharge in arizona can be seen from comparisons of recent rising groundwater level trends in the active management areas 0 1 0 5m per year in comparison with declining trends 0 5 1 3m per year in irrigated areas that lack access to surface water to support integrated use or managed aquifer recharge mar flexibility translates to resilience by expanding the portfolio of water sources in the southwestern us and increasing the options provided by water transportation infrastructure allowing water trading among users conjunctive water management and mar enhances system resilience to drought scanlan et al 2016 5 speeding the transition to conjunctive water management conjunctive water management involves integrated use storage and exchange of different sources of water australia faces a number of challenges in making the transition to conjunctive water management these challenges are very similar to those faced in transitions in other sectors institutional fragmentation lack of common vision undefined organisational responsibilities regulatory disincentives and lack of offsetting incentives poor organisational commitment technological path dependency perceived high risks of new technologies poor community capacity to meaningfully participate and lack of experience with facilitating integrated management processes farrelly and brown 2011 loorbach and rotmans 2010 transition management offers one framework to help understand what is required to shift from separate management of groundwater and surface water to integrated management transition management has been proposed as a tool for achieving transformative change in governance loorbach 2007 van de brugge and van raak 2007 case studies illustrate how transitional management involves an adaptive co evolutionary process involving frontrunners or agents who develop new approaches and technologies a transition arena in which a network of frontrunners can develop a common vision and process and a space or niche inside existing governance arrangements through which innovative changes are promoted transitions often meet resistance from the existing regime and a favourable context for change is a key to transition management loorbach and rotmans 2010 transition management in the water sector can be illustrated by a detailed study of the evolution of stormwater management in melbourne australia between the 1960 and 2010 brown et al 2013 in this case study a small group of frontrunners from across government private community and scientific sectors facilitated a broader and more diverse actor network that steered this transition over decades the establishment of networked bridging organisations that facilitated collaboration across government agencies water managers scientists and knowledge brokers was also crucial in forming alliances that supported transition in practices across the city there was no single cause effect relationship nor one dominant intervention or action that shifted the urban stormwater management regime rather new narratives emerged from interaction between frontrunners and their networks which influenced scientific thinking and on the ground experiments these led to new institutional structures and enabling administrative tools each these dimensions is equally important in explaining the evolution of sustainable stormwater management high level leadership is a further important enabling factor for transition the integration of environmental considerations into broader policy considerations requires high level leadership and cultural change as well as new institutional structures and networks ross and dovers 2008 high level policy entrepreneurs play a key role in initiating and driving water transitions huitema and meijerink 2010 and high level leadership is also important in creating a supportive environment for change huntjens et al 2010 the above discussion suggests that a change of paradigm to conjunctive water management can be promoted by six key elements network of frontrunners or change agents bridging organisations that will facilitate collaboration between change agents and other water policy organisations operational managers water users scientists and knowledge brokers arenas where change agents and other stakeholders can collaborate experiments and pilot projects in conjunctive water use storage and exchange high level leadership both to initiate change and to create a supportive environment for change mechanisms for evaluation learning and feedback at two levels among the front runners and among the general policy community there are already a significant number of projects for conjunctive water management especially in the driest states south australia and western australia and in the cities of perth and adelaide the western australian water corporation has set a target for perth of 30 of recycling of all metropolitan wastewater by 2030 and 60 recycling by 2060 western australia water corporation 2009 south australia has a target of 60gl of recycled stormwater and 75gl of treated wastewater for non human consumption by 2050 government of south australia 2009 victoria has established a policy framework for aquifer recharge some trials are being carried out around melbourne and conjunctive water management has been practised in a few catchments in queensland such as the burdekin and lockyer valley these developments have been assisted by bridging organisations and networks in australia at various scales at the national scale the australian water recycling centre has promoted national awareness of opportunities for water recycling and promoted a national program of managed aquifer recharge and storm water use options marsuo pilot studies at the municipal scale the cities of adelaide and perth have taken a leading role in aquifer recharge while these organisations and networks have been successful across urban areas such as adelaide and perth there is an opportunity for national or state based organisations to act as an arena for the discussion and development of broadscale conjunctive water use and storage options include the murray darling basin authority and state water corporations there are two significant barriers to the further development of conjunctive water use and storage the limited amount of surplus water for underground storage experiments and the so called hydro illogical cycle in many parts of australia and throughout the murray darling basin groundwater and surface water is fully allocated in order to obtain water for underground storage water users usually have to purchase water at market rates when stored in aquifers the water becomes the subject to carryover provisions which generally allow three years of storage or less moreover water can be obtained most easily and cheaply for underground storage during wet years but in these years farmers are focused on maximising production and the enthusiasm for investment in new sources of water supply and storage is at its lowest point yet this is the best time to replenish groundwater banks so that they will be available during the next dry period new visions of conjunctive water management through time championed by front running organisations and high level political and bureaucratic leaders coupled with broadscale conjunctive water management pilot projects will be needed to overcome these barriers 6 conclusions this review of progress towards conjunctive water management in australia reveals some progress in conjunctive use of water resources but little progress on integrated dam and aquifer storage or trading between groundwater and surface water there are major opportunities for conjunctive water management using underground water banking and managed aquifer recharge developments in the western usa indicate the potential of conjunctive water management and opportunities for groundwater and surface water trading could be further explored a new paradigm of conjunctive water management and storage is required this involves the systematic consideration of the opportunities for beneficial integration of groundwater and surface water use and storage in all new water plans and development projects involving significant use of water resources two key policy and institutional conditions are missing in australia and need to be put in place guaranteed recovery of water stored underground and extended carryover arrangements to allow long term underground storage there are already some front running organisations and networks driving the adoption of new sources of water supply and aquifer storage in australian cities generally there is no parallel transition towards conjunctive water management in rural areas the deadline for preparation of the next generation of water plans in the murray darling basin is not until 2019 and investments in water resource development and storage in northern australia are under consideration these scheduled developments in the mdb and northern australia provide significant opportunities to re design water plans to take full account of the opportunities for conjunctive use of groundwater surface water and recycled water over wet and dry climatic cycles leadership from the council of australian governments is required to lead national efforts towards integrated water resource use and management because responsibilities for managing water allocation and water quality are divided between many agencies in the australian government and state jurisdictions support from water managers irrigation associations and water corporations is also crucial the last national meeting on conjunctive water management in australia was held in 2004 a renewed national discussion would consolidate the advances with water recycling and aquifer storage and recovery that have been made in urban areas and encourage investors and governments to initiate pilot studies and further experiments in broadscale conjunctive water use 
6924,a framework to derive high resolution long term meteorological forcing for hydrologic models from mesoscale atmospheric reanalysis products is presented including topographic and cloud corrections and a new physical parameterization of near surface wind fields the methodology is applied to downscale 3 hourly north american regional reanalysis narr fields originally at 32km spacing to 1km and hourly resolution for a seven year period 2007 2013 over the integrated precipitation and hydrology experiment 2014 iphex2014 domain with the focus on the southern appalachian mountains sam in the se us evaluation of the adjusted downscaled products was conducted against flux tower observations in the iphex domain at high elevations the root mean squared errors rmses of atmospheric pressure decreased from 44 71 to 2 78hpa and the rmses of near surface temperature improved by 1k up to 5k in winter in addition rmses decreased by as much as 100 for near surface winds 10m above ground at all tower locations and by 25 30w m2 for shortwave radiation at low elevations using the uncalibrated duke coupled surface groundwater hydrology model dchm the value and utility of the downscaled products for hydrologic offline simulations are demonstrated through comparative analysis of the sensitivity of water and energy budgets in mountain watersheds for four water years 2007 10 2011 09 including a severe drought and several flood events cloud and topographic corrections applied to incoming solar radiation result in hourly net radiation changes ranging from 200 to 500wm 2 at

keywords atmospheric forcing downscaling hydrologic modeling complex topography surface energy budget 1 introduction numerical weather prediction nwp reanalysis products that result from optimal merging of model and observations using data assimilation techniques such as atmospheric pressure incoming radiation shortwave solar radiation and longwave thermal radiation and air temperature wind velocity and specific humidity in the boundary layer are widely used as a source of atmospheric forcing for hydrological modeling studies however significant biases and also physical inconsistencies in reanalysis products have been reported in the literature especially in topographically complex regions berg et al 2003 decker et al 2012 kumar and merwade 2011 maurer et al 2001 roads and betts 2000 wang and zeng 2012 zhao et al 2008 forced with incorrect meteorology hydrological models cannot produce reasonable and realistic simulations of the surface water and energy budgets furthermore model calibration using incorrect meteorological forcing can lead to unphysical parameter estimates and unrealistic model behavior for long term simulations errors can be further amplified when there is a large scale gap between the spatial resolution of mesoscale reanalysis products typically tens of kilometers and the spatial resolution of hydrological models necessary in mountainous regions e g 1km therefore selecting an appropriate downscaling methodology to bridge the resolution gap while preserving key physical constraints is critical to hydrologic modeling studies simple methodologies like bias correction of reanalysis data and in particular precipitation can significantly improve the simulations of fluxes in high resolution hydrologic models compared to observations berg et al

an elevation correction method to downscale era interim air temperature data in complex terrain using vertical lapse rates derived from different pressure levels and demonstrated that using dynamic lapse rates significantly improved the downscaling performance compared to using the standard fixed lapse rate schomburg et al 2010 proposed an alternative approach to downscale atmospheric model output using bilinear interpolation and local empirical relationships among surface properties topography and the mean values and anomalies of atmospheric near surface variables simulated by the same models in the region of interest that is the modeled hydroclimate this approach implies a priori calibration of the relationships between surface properties and near surface atmospheric variables to capture their variability at the desired spatial resolution the calibrated relationships depend on the atmospheric model and the specific model configuration and thus cannot be transferred or applied

originally at 32km spatial resolution and 3 hourly temporal resolution mesinger et al 2006 including radiation fluxes atmospheric temperature atmospheric pressure wind velocity and specific humidity at 10m above ground abg the precipitation forcing is obtained from the ncep emc 4km gridded data grib stage iv dataset downscaled to 1km using multifractal methods nogueira and barros 2014a 2015 whereas high quality long term mesoscale resolution reanalysis products such as narr will not be available outside of the us the methodology is applicable to nwp and rcm regional climate model simulations generally the impetus to derive these data sets in preparation for iphex2014 was to provide consistent forcing for hydrologic models at high temporal resolution including operational hydrologic forecasting in regions of complex terrain generally and the southern appalachian mountains in particular barros et al 2014 tao et al 2016 http iphex pratt duke edu therefore a deliberate effort was made to capture the diurnal cycle as well as seasonal and inter annual variability consistent with regional hydroclimate the iphex spatial domain spans four macro scale river basins of interest with headwaters in the southern appalachians fig 1 the upper tennessee river basin utrb the savannah river basin svrb the catawba santee river basin csrb and the yadkin pee dee river basin ypdrb further information can be found in the iphex2014 science plan barros et al 2014 the final data set consisting of 7years of corrected and downscaled atmospheric forcing data 2007 2013 at hourly time scales and 1km resolution is publicly available from duke university libraries see table 1 quality landscape attributes at consistent spatial and temporal resolution to specify hydrologic model parameters were also produced and made publicly available tao and barros 2014b the present manuscript is organized as follows section 2 describes the key elements of the methodology the downscaled products are evaluated in section 3 and the impact of the corrected atmospheric forcing products on hydrologic simulations is discussed in section 4 section 5 provides a summary of the work 2 downscaling methodology and corrections 2 1 synopsis the dynamic lapse rates were derived from the narr atmospheric temperature profiles using the isobaric levels closest to the narr terrain and the local terrain at 1km and then were applied to correct atmospheric temperature first followed by air pressure specific humidity and longwave radiation section 2 2 to downscale the wind velocity from the narr coarse resolution to 1km the friction velocity is downscaled using a new parameterization based on an heuristic relationship between the geostrophic drag coefficients and the rossby number suggested by lettau 1959 and the surface wind speed was adjusted subsequently using the downscaled friction velocity as well as surface roughness length at high spatial resolution section 2 3 accurate real time hourly and even more frequent shortwave radiation at high spatial resolution is essential for hydrological applications because radiative forcing drives water transfers and energy fluxes and modulates the efficiency of photosynthesis narr 3 hourly downward shortwave sw radiation shows large bias especially in topographically complex regions pinker et al 2003 schroeder et al 2009 to downscale the narr incoming shortwave radiation to high spatial resolution for this study cloud and topographic effects are accounted for in real time to capture the rapid evolution of cloud systems within the complex topography and microclimates of the sam inner region this requires the implementation of special corrections for downward shortwave radiation through dynamical adjustment including both cloudiness and topographic effects section 2 4 the nldas 2 primary forcing data mitchell et al 2004 xia et al 2012a 2012b includes bias corrected narr downward shortwave radiation using a ratio based bias correction method at monthly time scales berg et al 2003 in their approach the bias ratio was calculated between the monthly mean diurnal cycle of downward shortwave radiation from the gewex continental scale international project gcip surface radiation budget srb dataset pinker et al 2003 and the narr monthly mean values and then applied to correct hourly narr radiation linearly interpolated in time from the 3 hourly narr data here the bias corrections are estimated at daily time scales instead of using monthly means the methodology follows dubayah and loechel 1997 and relies on the gcip srb datase 1 the gcip srb data can be obtained from http www atmos umd edu srb gcip 1 hereafter referred to as gsrb for retrieving shortwave atmospheric transmittance and real time cloudiness patterns the corrections account for regional cloud patterns cast shadow caused by sun blocking terrain topographic self shadow and the reflected shortwave radiation from the surrounding terrain note that after july 2010 the gsrb dataset was discontinued after which time narr cloud patterns are used to correct incoming shortwave radiation and this necessarily has an impact on the quality of corrections finally the narr products rely heavily on data assimilation mesinger et al 2006 of multiple types of observations including remote sensing consideration of scale dependent scaling of atmospheric variables introduced through data assimilation e g sun and barros 2010 and or due to the specific model configuration and implementation e g nogueira and barros 2014b is out of the scope of this work 2 2 elevation corrections narr terrain at 32km grid spacing is analogous to a smooth envelope of the high resolution topography at 1km resolution fig 1a and b with elevation differences between the narr terrain and the local digital elevation model dem as large as 1064m along the ridge lines of the pigeon river basin therefore the 3 hourly atmospheric pressure air temperature and specific humidity 10m above ground abg and downward longwave radiation at the surface must be corrected for topographic discrepancies first for this purpose the original narr fields including the narr terrain were bi linearly interpolated to a 1km grid and the elevation differences between the narr terrain and the local 1km dem sampled from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm data 2 http srtm csi cgiar org selection inputcoord asp 2 at 90m spatial resolution were determined next the atmospheric pressure specific humidity and downward longwave radiation were corrected sequentially high resolution elevation corrections topographic adjustments require dynamic lapse rates for adjusting atmospheric temperature the lapse rate was calculated from the narr atmospheric temperature profile at low isobaric levels 1000mb to 800mb for each pixel 1km grid element at each time step 3 hourly instead of using narr terrain as the reference level the two closest geometric heights converted from the geopotential heights corresponding to the narr terrain and the local dem were utilized to calculate the lapse rate in the atmospheric surface layer the latter is used in turn to adjust atmospheric temperature from the narr to the local dem at 1km fig 2 provides the flowchart describing all intermediate steps in the elevation correction algorithm at location s and time t the adjusted atmospheric temperature is calculated by 1 t adj t s t narr t s γ t s δ z where t adj is the adjusted atmospheric temperature k 10m abg based on the local terrain at 1km tnarr is the original narr atmospheric temperature k 10m abg γ is the dynamic lapse rate k km and δz is the elevation difference between the narr terrain and the dem data at 1km the lapse rate γ depends on the atmospheric conditions time of day and location fig 3 shows an example of lapse rate estimates derived using the elevation correction in fig 3a the 900hpa height the closest level to the narr terrain and the 925hpa height the closest level to the srtm dem were selected to estimate the lapse rate γ 3 28k km that is quite different from the standard value 6 5k km as expected in fig 3b the srtm dem is much higher than the narr terrain and the heights and temperatures at 875hpa and 900hpa were selected to estimate the lapse rate γ 7 91k km fig 3c demonstrates the application of the elevation correction to the narr atmospheric temperature along the transect marked in fig 1b starting in the tennessee valley and crossing the blue ridge mountains into the coastal plains the adjusted surface air temperature fields are very different from the original narr values in the mountains up to 6k as shown in fig 3c not surprisingly the differences in temperature are not very large in the smooth and low elevation topography of the piedmont and the coastal plain due to the small elevation differences between the narr terrain and the dem the adjustments for air pressure specific humidity 10m abg and downward longwave radiation at the surface follow strictly the procedure described by cosgrove et al 2003 and can be found also in the corresponding iphex2014 technical report by tao and barros 2014c 2 3 wind adjustment for the wind adjustment we first begin by adjusting the friction velocity based on the dependence of the geostrophic drag coefficient on surface roughness lettau 1959 two spatial scales of interest are considered the geostrophic synoptic scale l that depends on the pressure gradient force and the coriolis acceleration and the mesoscale l that depends on the regional topography i e the roughness length at the scale of interest the geostrophic drag coefficient at a scale l can be expressed as c g u l u g where ul is the surface layer friction velocity at scale l and ug is the geostrophic wind it is assumed implicitly that the ageostrophic component of the total wind can be neglected and thus u ug based on balloon measurements lettau 1959 proposed an empirical relationship between the geostrophic drag coefficient and the rossby number r o as follows 2 c g 0 16 r o 0 09 and r o u g f z 0 l where f is the coriolis acceleration and z 0 l is the roughness length at scale l the rossby number is the ratio of the pressure gradient force that drives the geostrophic wind and the coriolis force at the scale of interest by replacing ro in eq 2 the following identity is obtained 3 0 16 u g 0 91 u l f z 0 l 0 09 assuming that the geostrophic wind u g component of the total wind is the same at the narr resolution scale l 32km and at the local scale l 1km the relationship between the friction velocity at the two scales can be expressed as 4 u l f z 0 l 0 09 u l f z 0 l 0 09 rearranging the terms above the friction velocity at scale ι can be estimated from the friction velocity at scale l 5 u l u l z 0 l z 0 l 0 09 the roughness length z0 l at scale l is obtained from narr parameters and the friction velocity u l is retrieved from the narr s wind speeds at 10m and 30m abg using the classical logarithm law approximation of the low level wind speed profile in the boundary layer the adjusted 10m abg wind speed at scale l is expressed finally as 6 u l u l k log 10 d z 0 l where k is the von kármán constant 0 41 and the roughness length z0 l and the displacement height d depend on the land cover at the same spatial scale 1km this parameterization of friction velocity based on physical scaling arguments aims to capture mesoscale wind shear effects the dynamics of airflow in complex terrain including blocking and channelization effects ridge valley circulations or organized convection which require physically based modeling of atmospheric flows at the relevant scales are therefore not represented 2 4 topographic and cloudiness correction of downward incoming shortwave radiation the correction technique includes four distinctly important steps summarized in fig 4 2 4 1 preprocessing 2 4 2 preparation for auxiliary input parameters 2 4 3 cloudiness correction and 2 4 4 topographic correction 2 4 1 preprocessing the preprocessing mainly involves re projecting all radiative fluxes to utm 17n wgs84 coordinates followed by bi linearly interpolation to 1km resolution after the spatial interpolation the narr sw data are then interpolated in time from 3 hourly to hourly resolution based on the real time local solar zenith angle this step is similar to cosgrove et al 2003 but their temporal interpolation method using the solar zenith angle cannot be applied for cloudy conditions instead a two step modified temporal interpolation is developed to fit a smooth diurnal cycle estimator that preserves the total daily energy swtot using the original 3 hourly narr sw radiation sw i narr i 1 8 weighted by the mean cosine of the hourly solar zenith angle for each three hour period i e cos φ i 1 3 j 1 3 cos φ ij to yield the adjusted local mean three hourly swi radiation 7 sw i sw tot sw i narr cos φ i i 1 8 sw i narr cos φ i the local hourly swij radiation is subsequently interpolated from the 3 hourly adjusted narr swi radiation as follows 8 sw ij sw i cos φ ij j 1 3 cos φ ij where i varies from 1 to 8 8 is the total daily number of 3 h intervals in the narr data and j varies from 1 to 3 indicating the j th hour within each 3 h interval by incorporating the sw i narr term the hourly shortwave radiation depends on the local solar zenith angle and also on the modification of incoming shortwave radiation due to clouds in narr after the temporal interpolation is complete the cloudiness and topographic corrections are applied to the hourly incoming shortwave radiation eq 8 2 4 2 preparation for auxiliary input parameters the shortwave transmittance parameter partitions direct and diffuse radiation transmittance was calculated using the ratio of the hourly downward solar radiation at the surface to the incoming solar radiation at the top of atmosphere toa calculated using grsb data when available and from narr otherwise the derived transmittance is considered representative of cloudy atmospheric conditions when the solar zenith angle is less than 55 in reality highly non linear relationships exist between transmittance and the cosine solar zenith angle over the full range of solar zenith angles depending on heterogeneous cloud distributions the gsrb product does not provide data for early morning and late afternoon for lower values of the cosine of the solar zenith angle i e solar zenith angles larger than 70 cosgrove et al 2003 consequently a filling strategy was implemented based on the assumption that the cosine of the solar zenith angle can be approximated to the first order by the shortwave transmittance chavez 1996 this approximation works best at dawn or dusk when the incoming solar radiation is also very small the filling steps implemented are as follows 1 the downward solar radiation at the top of atmosphere and at the surface is used to estimate the transmittance 2 missing values are replaced with the nearest non missing transmittance multiplied by the ratio of cosine of the solar zenith angle for the pixel where data are missing to the cosine of the solar zenith angle in the nearest neighbor pixel 3 temporal filling was performed for the transmittance in early morning and late afternoon using the closest available data e g using transmittance at 9am to fill the missing data in 6am 8am also based on the ratio of cosine of the solar zenith angles and 4 to account for the variability both in space and time the final transmittance at a given location and time is the average of spatially and temporally filled transmittance if there are missing data over a large region only temporal filling is conducted and the temporally filled transmittance is the final transmittance in addition to determining atmospheric transmittance other auxiliary input parameters such as the sky view factor the terrain configuration factor the hourly local illumination angle and the actual surface albedo must be defined prior to applying the topographic correction for shortwave radiation albedo influences the reflected radiation from the surrounding terrain and the local illumination angle affects the direct radiation received at a slope the albedo exhibits large spatial and temporal variability depending on land cover type i e forest cropland or bare ground and hydrometeorological conditions dry wet with the amplitude of the diurnal cycle determined by the local fraction of diffuse skylight the actual albedo of the land surface is a weighted average of the black sky albedo bsa and the white sky albedo wsa the weighting coefficient is the fraction of diffuse skylight depending on solar zenith angle optical depth local aerosol type etc schaaf et al 2002 hourly bsa and wsa were calculated using solar zenith angle and the brdf bidirectional reflectance distribution function model parameters provided by the modis product mcd43b1 as per tao and barros 2014b the local illumination angle plays an important role for quantifying the effects of self shadowing and reducing the incoming direct irradiance when the sun is below the local horizon of the slope the cosine of the local illumination angle shows large spatial variability in regions of complex terrain due to the relative position of the sun and the local terrain slope besides topography the diurnal variability and seasonal variability in the local illumination angle are determined by the altitude and azimuth of the sun the sky view factor represents the total portion of unobstructed sky visible on a slope in all directions with a value of unity indicating that the sky is unobstructed and zero meaning the sky is completely obstructed by surrounding topography i e the sky view factor is very small at the bottom of a narrow valley because the surrounding terrain blocks diffuse radiation the terrain configuration factor at a pixel location is the fraction of the hemispheric view that receives reflected radiation from the surrounding terrain a terrain configuration factor of unity means that only terrain is visible the methodology to calculate the sky view factor and terrain correction factor is presented in the topographic correction section 2 4 4 below 2 4 3 cloudiness correction in clear sky conditions topographic effects dominate the spatial variability of incoming solar radiation for cloudy conditions the cloudiness pattern ultimately determines the spatial distribution of the solar radiation in order to account for real time cloudiness patterns the probability density functions pdfs of both the spatial gsrb solar radiation and the narr shortwave radiation are calculated first and then the pdf of the narr shortwave radiation is matched to that of the gsrb data by calculating a histogram index at each pixel λ i j r max s r s i j r max s r min s where r s i j is the gsrb solar radiation at pixel i j and r max s and r min s are the maximum and minimum values of the spatial gsrb solar radiation at the present time respectively the regional cloudiness pattern λ i j is mapped into a position at the histogram scale using the histogram index λ i j the narr sw radiation is reshuffled by matching its pdf to the gsrb s pdf such that r i j r max λ i j r max r min where r i j is the narr sw radiation accounting for the cloudiness pattern and r max and r min are the maximum and minimum values of the spatial narr sw radiation at the current time as it can be seen from fig 5 panel c 2 exhibits the exact same pdf shape as the spatial pdf of gsrb in b 2 thus the same cloudiness pattern as the gsrb data c 1 versus b 1 while maintaining the original range of narr sw radiation c 2 over the region 2 4 4 topographic correction the topographic correction is applied after the cloudiness correction c as indicated by the work flow in fig 4 the topographic solar radiation model and the topographic correction used in this study were developed originally by dozier 1980 and dozier and frew 1990 from the simulated total incoming radiation at sea level an elevation correction is required before applying the topographic correction to solar radiation in the original model however the narr incoming shortwave radiation is already at the narr terrain elevation thus the elevation correction was not implemented despite elevation differences between the narr terrain elevation and the digital elevation model dem at 1km resolution we assume that the elevation effects caused by this difference are negligible compared to other topographic effects such as blocking of the incoming radiation and or radiation reflection by the surrounding terrain especially in regions of complex terrain such as the southern appalachian mountains the theoretical basis of the topographic radiation correction is described briefly next the total incoming solar radiation consist of three components the diffuse irradiance from the sky direct irradiance from the sun and diffuse and direct irradiance from nearby terrain dubayah and paul 1995 the total downward shortwave radiation can be expressed as 9 sw tot i j f i j v d i j δ cos θ i j b i j c t i j f i j where f i j is the incoming diffuse irradiance f i j is the upwelling terrain reflected flux and b i j is the direct beam irradiance v d i j is the sky view factor and c t i j is the terrain configuration factor δ is a binary shadowing mask set equal to either 1 or 0 depending on the shadow caused by nearby terrain blocking the sun cast shadowing and cos θ i j is the cosine of the local solar illumination angle indicating whether the sun is below or above the local horizon caused by the slope itself self shadowing calculated as cos θ i j cos θ 0 cos s sin θ 0 sin s cos ϕ 0 a where θ 0 is solar zenith angle and ϕ 0 is solar azimuth angle s and a are slope magnitude and aspect the original algorithm performs the topographic correction based on the incoming atmospheric radiation after atmospheric attenuation noted as i in fig 6 whereas the narr estimates of direct beam irradiance b at the surface already account for the solar illumination angle on the basis of the narr terrain the topographic adjustment consists of multiplying b by the scaled cosine of solar illumination angle cos θ s defined as the ratio of the cosine of solar illumination angle on the 1km dem to that on the narr terrain as illustrated in fig 6 to perform the topographic correction the cloudiness corrected narr hourly total incoming shortwave radiation is partitioned into direct beam irradiance b i j and diffuse irradiance f i j using the shortwave atmospheric transmittance diffuse and direct radiation fluxes are affected by the terrain in different ways the upwelling reflected radiation from the surrounding terrain f i j is estimated as follows 10 f i j r i j f i j 1 v d i j cos θ o b i j where r i j is the surface reflectance albedo the sky view and terrain configuration factors respectively vd and ct are calculated using the image processing workbench software ipw frew 1990 based on high resolution elevation data see fig 7 for vd and ct in the iphex domain the original methodology can be found in dubayah and paul 1995 and dubayah and loechel 1997 the sky view factor vd is given by 11 v d 1 2 π 0 2 π cos s sin 2 h ϕ sin s cos ϕ a h ϕ sin h ϕ cos h ϕ d ϕ where s and a are slope magnitude and aspect and hϕ is the zenith angle with regard to the local horizon in view direction ϕ for simplicity the location pixel subscripts i j are not used in eq 11 but all relevant variables are calculated on a pixel basis in open areas the sky view factor v d is large but is small at the bottom of narrow valleys where the sky is partially obstructed fig 7 left panel the terrain configuration factor c t i j estimates the fraction of the surrounding terrain that is visible from location i j and varies from 0 only sky visible to 1 only terrain visible 12 c t 1 cos s 2 v d thus the product c t i j f i j is the radiation received at point i j that is reflected by the surrounding visible terrain generally the smaller the terrain configuration factor ct the larger the sky view factor vd fig 7 3 results and evaluation the downscaled atmospheric forcing datasets were evaluated against available flux tower observations table 2 in the se us and compared against the nldas 2 primary forcing data at the same location for reference the objective is twofold 1 to show that the downscaling and corrections applied do introduce physically based improvements in regions of complex topography that are not represented at narr resolution and 2 to show that the downscaling methodology improves or it does not degrade the narr fields elsewhere away from the mountains the spatial scale of flux tower observations varies in time and depends highly on the height and location of the tower land form land use class and land cover heterogeneity surrounding the towers and regional weather conditions that determine lagrangian transport and mixing thus the multi year tower observations are used to evaluate the model s ability to capture the local hydrometeorological regime in the statistical mean sense the number of flux towers in complex terrain is small us chr us wbw and dkepl table 2 and only dkepl is located at high elevation in the sam 3 1 elevation correction and wind adjustment selected results of the adjusted downscaled and corrected and the original narr atmospheric pressure and temperature fig 8 and wind speed fig 9 are used here to examine spatial variability with a focus on the diurnal cycle the specific humidity and downward longwave radiation data exhibit similar behavior and are not shown here one should be mindful of the differences in spatial scales among the various products 32km for narr 12 5km for nldas 2 and 1km for the downscaled iphex data the adjusted fields in figs 8 and 9 vary over a wide range of magnitude compared with the original fields in regions of complex terrain specifically in the appalachian plateaus and the blue ridge including the pigeon river basin fig 1c the largest variability in the adjusted narr fields is in atmospheric pressure with strong contrasts between ridges and valleys as expected fig 8 left panel note that nldas 2 forcing fields were corrected for the elevation effects based on nldas topography which is quite coarse for this region generally the adjustments of atmospheric pressure and near surface air temperature specific humidity and downward longwave radiation are much smaller along ridge lines than in the valleys and exhibit strong temporal variability at seasonal and diurnal scales not shown for example the differences between adjusted atmospheric temperature and the original narr values are much larger in the winter than in the summer fig 8 bottom right panel fig 9 shows spatial wind fields at different hours of the day on march 1 2009 unlike other atmospheric forcing fields the spatial variability in wind speed depends primarily on surface roughness length and displacement height parameters which are specified according to land cover type and not on topography explicitly because the physical parameterization used here cannot explicitly resolve mesoscale circulations in complex terrain below the narr nominal resolution as pointed out in section 2 3 although the adjusted friction velocity shows larger values than the original friction velocity not shown the downscaled wind speed is systematically lower than the original narr due to the impact of increased spatial resolution on the specification of displacement height based on land cover class e g large blue areas in the bottom row in fig 9 the largest difference between the friction velocity and wind speed before and after adjustment is in urban areas where the effective roughness length is large about 2 5m the flux tower observations from the ameriflux network and the duke tower in the southern appalachians marked in fig 1c are used next for independent evaluation at local point scales scatter plots of original narr adjusted narr as well as nldas 2 data against the tower observations are presented in fig 10 a and the associated root mean squared errors rmses are summarized in table 3 overall the adjusted narr fields show better agreement or at least as good as the original narr though nldas 2 outperforms narr with or without adjustment at times in the case of air temperature at low elevations note that the three towers in duke forest us dk1 us dk2 us dk3 see fig 1c are very close together though in fields with distinct land cover and thus rmse differences can be interpreted as a measure indicative of spatial uncertainty the rmse of the adjusted atmospheric pressure at dkepl is reduced from 44 71hpa to 2 78hpa with small surface pressure differences for other towers because of the small elevation differences in the piedmont and elsewhere away from complex topography fig 1c and table 2 time series of surface pressure air temperature and wind speed at us chr fig 10b and dkepl fig 10c illustrate the robustness of the narr adjustments from daily to inter annual scales over the period 2007 2011 the downscaled specific humidity and wind speed outperform other estimates i e the original narr and nldas 2 at all towers at all times despite limitations pointed out earlier the proposed wind scaling relationship works well at the mesoscales tested here this is an important result with far reaching implications for the calculation of surface heat fluxes and especially evapotranspiration rates the adjusted radiation fluxes show improvement at all ameriflux towers cloud and topographic corrections applied to incoming shortwave radiation result in significant improvements with large rmse decreases of 25 30w m2 at low elevation towers and about 1 3 of this value at dkepl table 3 these results are explored in further detail next 3 2 topographic and cloudiness correction of shortwave radiation the cloudiness and topographic corrections were dynamically applied to the regional radiation at hourly scale with aid of time invariant auxiliary parameters shortwave transmittance surface albedo and the cosine of the local illumination angle as described in section 2 4 figs 11 and 12 show the intermediate results after performing the cloudiness and topographic correction for cloudy and clear sky conditions respectively the clear sky and cloudy foggy conditions were confirmed by review of archived webcam pictures panel 11 a in fig 11 both the gsrb solar radiation panel 11 h and the derived atmospheric transmissivity panel 11 c vary strongly with cloud cover see the corresponding goes visible image in panel 11 b but the cloud pattern in the original narr panel 11 f must be corrected panel 11 g panel 11 i in fig 11 shows the final radiation results after both cloudiness and topographic corrections note the very good agreement with the gsrb data and goes imagery with regard to the cloudiness patterns in fig 12 the gsrb radiation data and the transmissivity exhibit uniform distributions except for the cloud band in the southwest corner green bands in panels 12 c and 12 h the cosine of the solar illumination angle mainly affects the direct radiation component thus in cloudy conditions the direct radiation component is very small especially in the mountains where the illumination effects are large panels 11g 1 and 11i 1 and the topographic effects are not apparent in the final radiation estimates in other words the cloudiness correction dominates over the topographic correction for cloudy and partially cloudy conditions by contrast for clear sky conditions the topographic effects are apparent in the mountains displaying complex spatial variability in the southern appalachians as shown in panel 12i 1 and thus the topographic corrections dominate the spatial variability in the total shortwave radiation the final corrected radiation shows the effect of the small band of clouds in the southwest corner while capturing realistic topographic variability the diurnal and seasonal cycles of downscaled and corrected narr shortwave radiation as well as the original narr and nldas2 shortwave radiation are shown in fig 13 at a particular time the difference between the shortwave radiation before and after corrections can be as large as 500w m2 e g the example shown for a day in june the topographic effects are apparent in winter especially in the early morning or late afternoon in the blue ridge and appalachian plateaus regions fig 1c fig 13 but the cloudiness correction is dominant overall for instance there is partial cloud cover in the se us at noon on dec 15 in 2009 in both the nldas2 and original narr downward shortwave radiation however the goes visible imagery 3 the image at noon is missing but the images at 1500 and 2100 utc are available from http www sat dundee ac uk geobrowse 3 displays uniform cloud coverage i e 100 thick cloud cover after correction the adjusted narr shortwave radiation field consists of uniformly lower values compared to the original data as it should generally both the original narr and nldas 2 fields overestimate the incoming shortwave radiation compared to the tower observations fig 10 the adjusted narr shortwave shows the best agreement with the tower observations everywhere table 3 except at dkepl this can be attributed in part to the fact that the gsrb product was discontinued in mid 2010 whereas the tower observations are only available from 2009 onwards and thus the period of higher quality cloud corrections is very short in addition the notional physical scale gap at high elevations in complex topography is very large due to unresolved mesoscale processes in narr the original and adjusted radiation represent average values of otherwise heterogeneous fields over significantly different areas 1000km2 and 1km2 respectively and thus discrepancies with regard to the tower observations point to field scale are expected this artifact is further enhanced by the persistence of small scale low level fog and clouds that are not detected from satellite at mid day in winter when fog is present at dkepl e g wilson and barros 2014 the narr based estimates consistently overestimate shortwave radiation 4 water and energy budget impacts hydrologic modeling application the utility of the downscaled atmospheric forcing datasets for hydrological applications is demonstrated for 4 continuous water year simulations 2007 oct to 2011 sep in the pigeon river basin prb area 1823 km2 fig 1c a tributary of the upper tennessee river

accommodate complex outer boundary the lack of radar observations and long term raingauges impairs the quality of the rainfall products downscaled or not in the inner region of the sam e g tao et al

products and the stage iv tf rainfall product is used with the corrected downscaled narr products nogueira and barros 2014a 4 1 hydrologic model implementation the dchm implementation used in this study is similar to tao et al 2016 soil properties and other hydrologic parameters are the same as in tao and barros 2013 2014a and 2014b and landscape attributes including radiative properties and land use and land cover were specified according to tao and barros 2014b and all are available from http iphex pratt duke edu for sensitivity analysis the dchm was driven separately by the original and the corrected downscaled atmospheric forcing from narr and hourly precipitation from the iphex2014 data sets as described above back to back spin up like simulations consisting of repeated 4 year simulations using the same atmospheric forcing and initial soil moisture and water table conditions equal to the values at the end of the preceding 4 year iteration were conducted until differences between two successive 4 year streamflow simulations were less than 1 over the 4 year simulation period up to ten repetitions or 40years the performance of the uncalibrated dchm was evaluated for

improvements in the rainfall between stage iv bi and stage iv tf as discussed by nogueira and barros 2014a and 2015 where the stage iv product is of higher quality across the prb i e eastern and western slopes of the sam at low elevations the nse increases are in the 10 30 range tao and barros 2014b nogueira and barros 2014a 2015 which is nevertheless a large improvement in hydrologic modeling performance skill without calibration especially considering the hourly temporal resolution and the multi year simulations the higher nse scores encompassing both response to large storms and

14 top four rows differences in surface pressure up to 35hpa and air temperature up to 5k reflect the difference between the dchm topography and the narr terrain in the ccb the changes are small for specific humidity since these data are essentially interpolated bi linearly from the original narr fields without further correction by contrast the differences in near surface wind are very large and vary widely from day to day depending on synoptic conditions negative signs in the model energy fluxes indicate that the flux is leaving the land surface to the atmosphere i e upward fluxes thus negative differences adj ori mean that the absolute magnitude of energy fluxes using the adjusted downscaled forcing is larger than using the original narr forcing fields two bottom rows generally the absolute magnitudes of both sensible and latent heat fluxes are larger using original fields with positive differences i e bias mostly during daytime up to 300w m2 and 100w m2 for sensible and latent heat fluxes respectively fig 14 left column bottom two rows interestingly days with large differences in surface winds do not necessarily correspond to the days with the largest differences in surface fluxes fig 14 left for weak and moderate wind conditions in the first two weeks of september 2009 inspection of the radiative fluxes fig 14 center reveals that the primary forcing behind day to day variations in the surface energy fluxes is the incoming shortwave radiation when the winds pick up in the second half of the month due to changes in synoptic weather conditions there is a strong impact on sensible heat fluxes 300wm 2 even as the changes in shortwave radiation are modest 50wm 2 further despite complex topography the area averaged radiation fluxes are very similar not shown from one prb sub catchment to another at high elevations in the inner sam ridgeline clouds strongly affect the diurnal cycle of incoming shortwave radiation wilson and barros 2014 2015 which are not resolved in the original narr data and thus the adjusted incoming shortwave radiation fluxes using gsrb data are lower than the original values except for two clear days sep 2 and 3 the net radiation calculated from the original radiation forcing as shown in the 5th row in 5 central column results in larger temperature increases in the top soil layer 6th row which in turn affects the sensible heat flux as shown in the left column 5th row as well as the latent heat flux bottom row depending on soil moisture conditions large latent heat flux differences on september 19 contrasting with very small differences on september 21 spatial distributions of simulated sensible heat flux latent heat flux and net radiation fields using original atmospheric forcing and the adjusted narr fields are shown at mid day across the prb for cloudy and clear sky conditions in figs 15 and 16 respectively for the cloudy scenario on sep 1 previously discussed in section 3 2 fig 11 cloud covers most of the basin and thus the adjusted incoming solar radiation is much lower than the original narr values up to 331w m2 on average leading to large discrepancies in sensible heat flux up to 297w m2 for the clear sky scenario on sep 2 the total net radiation flux net shortwave plus net longwave exhibits wide spatial variability with large values at high elevations and relatively low values at low elevations as expected fig 16 latent heat fluxes display strong spatial organization with clearly demarcation of high elevation areas with shallow soils where evapotranspiration is limited by soil moisture and low elevation areas with deep soils stronger gradients under cloudy conditions fig 15 are consistent with larger differences in surface temperature this sensitivity analysis highlights the importance of accurate estimates of incoming solar radiation and net radiation in mountainous regions where foggy and cloudy conditions are persistent features that can introduce large differences in surface fluxes e g wilson and barros 2015 this is essential to capture the spatial variability of microclimates and complex eco hydrology in the sam and elsewhere 5 summary and discussion high resolution 1km hourly atmospheric forcing datasets including 10m abg air temperature air pressure wind velocity specific humidity downward shortwave and longwave radiation were developed for the iphex2014 domain based on the narr products originally at 32km spatial resolution and 3 h temporal resolution for a seven year period 2007 2013 over the southeast us see table 1 for data access information the elevation correction was applied to the narr air temperature air pressure specific humidity and downward longwave radiation and dynamic lapse rates were derived from the estimated atmospheric temperature profiles friction velocity was adjusted based on a relationship between the geostrophic drag coefficients and the rossby number which was used subsequently to estimate wind velocity at high spatial resolution downward shortwave radiation data were first interpolated to hourly time intervals using a temporal interpolation method based on the solar zenith angle as well as the diurnal cycle of narr cloudiness real time cloudiness patterns derived from the gsrb dataset were used to correct cloudy effects for narr shortwave radiation by matching the spatial pdf of narr data to that of the gsrb data and topographic effects were incorporated based on a well established topographic solar radiation model nevertheless unquantified uncertainty in the cloud corrections is expected at different times and locations due to the lack of high resolution observations generally as well as well documented weaknesses in the simulation of clouds in atmospheric models e g wilson and barros 2015 a comprehensive evaluation of the adjusted downscaled narr products would require a dense network of ground based measurements to capture the spatial and temporal variability of cloud cover water and energy fluxes in complex terrain because such observing system does not exist the evaluation scope is therefore limited to existing observations and we take advantage of long records to demonstrate robust long term behavior sensitivity analysis of long duration hydrologic simulations was used to examine the impact of atmospheric forcing on the various terms of the surface water and energy budget equations which are nonlinearly related overall as expected the adjusted downscaled atmospheric forcing datasets exhibit larger spatial variability compared to the original narr fields consistent with the 1 32 spatial scale ratio the comparison among the atmospheric forcing data and flux tower observations in the region ameriflux and dkepl reveals that the adjustments to the narr fields result in improvements on the order of 50 100 for near surface winds everywhere 10 s hpa for surface pressure as well as large differences in air temperature up to 6k at high elevations a decrease of 25 30w m2 in the rsmes of shortwave radiation estimates at low elevation flux towers amounts to approximately 10 of monthly net radiation in the warm season and thus is a very significant contribution toward reducing the uncertainty in the surface energy budget further simulations with a fully distributed coupled surface groundwater hydrologic model dchm using both the original and adjusted downscaled atmospheric forcing from narr exhibit large sensitivity to atmospheric forcing of various terms in the surface water and energy budgets with differences in peak latent sensible and net radiation fluxes of 100 s of w m2 at mid day in the warm season concurrent changes in air temperature incoming shortwave radiation and wind speed impact nonlinearly sensible heat fluxes and latent heat fluxes 3 1 ratio with the latter being constrained by soil moisture controls of evapotranspiration especially at high elevations though hydrologic sensitivity will vary from one location to another depending on regional climate and physiography these results highlight the importance of atmospheric forcing in hydrologic predictability and therefore the need for appropriate downscaling and correction

6924,a framework to derive high resolution long term meteorological forcing for hydrologic models from mesoscale atmospheric reanalysis products is presented including topographic and cloud corrections and a new physical parameterization of near surface wind fields the methodology is applied to downscale 3 hourly north american regional reanalysis narr fields originally at 32km spacing to 1km and hourly resolution for a seven year period 2007 2013 over the integrated precipitation and hydrology experiment 2014 iphex2014 domain with the focus on the southern appalachian mountains sam in the se us evaluation of the adjusted downscaled products was conducted against flux tower observations in the iphex domain at high elevations the root mean squared errors rmses of atmospheric pressure decreased from 44 71 to 2 78hpa and the rmses of near surface temperature improved by 1k up to 5k in winter in addition rmses decreased by as much as 100 for near surface winds 10m above ground at all tower locations and by 25 30w m2 for shortwave radiation at low elevations using the uncalibrated duke coupled surface groundwater hydrology model dchm the value and utility of the downscaled products for hydrologic offline simulations are demonstrated through comparative analysis of the sensitivity of water and energy budgets in mountain watersheds for four water years 2007 10 2011 09 including a severe drought and several flood events cloud and topographic corrections applied to incoming solar radiation result in hourly net radiation changes ranging from 200 to 500wm 2 at mid day for clear sky and cloudy conditions respectively improvements in shortwave radiation and near surface wind speed estimates have the highest impact on evapotranspiration and soil surface temperature wind speed differences of 2 10m s translate into basin averaged differences mid day surface fluxes up to 300wm 2 and 100wm 2 in the inner sam for sensible and latent heat respectively keywords atmospheric forcing downscaling hydrologic modeling complex topography surface energy budget 1 introduction numerical weather prediction nwp reanalysis products that result from optimal merging of model and observations using data assimilation techniques such as atmospheric pressure incoming radiation shortwave solar radiation and longwave thermal radiation and air temperature wind velocity and specific humidity in the boundary layer are widely used as a source of atmospheric forcing for hydrological modeling studies however significant biases and also physical inconsistencies in reanalysis products have been reported in the literature especially in topographically complex regions berg et al 2003 decker et al 2012 kumar and merwade 2011 maurer et al 2001 roads and betts 2000 wang and zeng 2012 zhao et al 2008 forced with incorrect meteorology hydrological models cannot produce reasonable and realistic simulations of the surface water and energy budgets furthermore model calibration using incorrect meteorological forcing can lead to unphysical parameter estimates and unrealistic model behavior for long term simulations errors can be further amplified when there is a large scale gap between the spatial resolution of mesoscale reanalysis products typically tens of kilometers and the spatial resolution of hydrological models necessary in mountainous regions e g 1km therefore selecting an appropriate downscaling methodology to bridge the resolution gap while preserving key physical constraints is critical to hydrologic modeling studies simple methodologies like bias correction of reanalysis data and in particular precipitation can significantly improve the simulations of fluxes in high resolution hydrologic models compared to observations berg et al 2003 hay and clark 2003 lenters et al 2000 berg et al 2003 reported that the implementation of a physically based bias reduction scheme to air temperature dew point temperature surface pressure

sets such as the north american land data assimilation system nldas land surface models lsms at 0 125 resolution 12 5km a valuable resource widely used by the broad community for nldas cosgrove et al

in china and reported average reductions of 43 6 in the standard deviation of summertime surface temperature bias compared against observations in mountainous regions recently gao et al 2012 applied an elevation correction method to downscale era interim air temperature data in complex terrain using vertical lapse rates derived from different pressure levels and demonstrated that using dynamic lapse rates significantly improved the downscaling performance compared to using the standard fixed lapse rate schomburg et al 2010 proposed an alternative approach to downscale atmospheric model output using bilinear interpolation and local empirical relationships among surface properties topography and the mean values and anomalies of atmospheric near surface variables simulated by the same models in the region of interest that is the modeled hydroclimate this approach implies a priori calibration of the relationships between surface properties and near surface atmospheric variables to capture their variability at the desired spatial resolution the calibrated relationships depend on the atmospheric model and the specific model configuration and thus cannot be transferred or applied generally in this manuscript we present the development of high resolution atmospheric forcing datasets for hydrological modeling 1km hourly from the north american regional reanalysis narr products originally at 32km spatial resolution and 3 hourly temporal resolution mesinger et al 2006 including radiation fluxes atmospheric temperature atmospheric pressure wind velocity and specific humidity at 10m above ground abg the precipitation forcing is obtained from the ncep emc 4km gridded data grib stage iv dataset downscaled to 1km using multifractal methods nogueira and barros 2014a 2015 whereas high quality long term mesoscale resolution reanalysis products such as narr will not be available outside of the us the methodology is applicable to nwp and rcm regional climate model simulations generally the impetus to derive these data sets in preparation for iphex2014 was to provide consistent forcing for hydrologic models at high temporal resolution including operational hydrologic forecasting in regions of complex terrain generally and the southern appalachian mountains in particular barros et al 2014 tao et al 2016 http iphex pratt duke edu therefore a deliberate effort was made to capture the diurnal cycle as well as seasonal and inter annual variability consistent with regional hydroclimate the iphex spatial domain spans four macro scale river basins of interest with headwaters in the southern appalachians fig 1 the upper tennessee river basin utrb the savannah river basin svrb the catawba santee river basin csrb and the yadkin pee dee river basin ypdrb further information can be found in the iphex2014 science plan barros et al 2014 the final data set consisting of 7years of corrected and downscaled atmospheric forcing data 2007 2013 at hourly time scales and 1km resolution is publicly available from duke university libraries see table 1 quality landscape attributes at consistent spatial and temporal resolution to specify hydrologic model parameters were also produced and made publicly available tao and barros 2014b the present manuscript is organized as follows section 2 describes the key elements of the methodology the downscaled products are evaluated in section 3 and the impact of the corrected atmospheric forcing products on hydrologic simulations is discussed in section 4 section 5 provides a summary of the work 2 downscaling methodology and corrections 2 1 synopsis the dynamic lapse rates were derived from the narr atmospheric temperature profiles using the isobaric levels closest to the narr terrain and the local terrain at 1km and then were applied to correct atmospheric temperature first followed by air pressure specific humidity and longwave radiation section 2 2 to downscale the wind velocity from the narr coarse resolution to 1km the friction velocity is downscaled using a new parameterization based on an heuristic relationship between the geostrophic drag coefficients and the rossby number suggested by lettau 1959 and the surface wind speed was adjusted subsequently using the downscaled friction velocity as well as surface roughness length at high spatial resolution section 2 3 accurate real time hourly and even more frequent shortwave radiation at high spatial resolution is essential for hydrological applications because radiative forcing drives water transfers and energy fluxes and modulates the efficiency of photosynthesis narr 3 hourly downward shortwave sw radiation shows large bias especially in topographically complex regions pinker et al 2003 schroeder et al 2009 to downscale the narr incoming shortwave radiation to high spatial resolution for this study cloud and topographic effects are accounted for in real time to capture the rapid evolution of cloud systems within the complex topography and microclimates of the sam inner region this requires the implementation of special corrections for downward shortwave radiation through dynamical adjustment including both cloudiness and topographic effects section 2 4 the nldas 2 primary forcing data mitchell et al 2004 xia et al 2012a 2012b includes bias corrected narr downward shortwave radiation using a ratio based bias correction method at monthly time scales berg et al 2003 in their approach the bias ratio was calculated between the monthly mean diurnal cycle of downward shortwave radiation from the gewex continental scale international project gcip surface radiation budget srb dataset pinker et al 2003 and the narr monthly mean values and then applied to correct hourly narr radiation linearly interpolated in time from the 3 hourly narr data here the bias corrections are estimated at daily time scales instead of using monthly means the methodology follows dubayah and loechel 1997 and relies on the gcip srb datase 1 the gcip srb data can be obtained from http www atmos umd edu srb gcip 1 hereafter referred to as gsrb for retrieving shortwave atmospheric transmittance and real time cloudiness patterns the corrections account for regional cloud patterns cast shadow caused by sun blocking terrain topographic self shadow and the reflected shortwave radiation from the surrounding terrain note that after july 2010 the gsrb dataset was discontinued after which time narr cloud patterns are used to correct incoming shortwave radiation and this necessarily has an impact on the quality of corrections finally the narr products rely heavily on data assimilation mesinger et al 2006 of multiple types of observations including remote sensing consideration of scale dependent scaling of atmospheric variables introduced through data assimilation e g sun and barros 2010 and or due to the specific model configuration and implementation e g nogueira and barros 2014b is out of the scope of this work 2 2 elevation corrections narr terrain at 32km grid spacing is analogous to a smooth envelope of the high resolution topography at 1km resolution fig 1a and b with elevation differences between the narr terrain and the local digital elevation model dem as large as 1064m along the ridge lines of the pigeon river basin therefore the 3 hourly atmospheric pressure air temperature and specific humidity 10m above ground abg and downward longwave radiation at the surface must be corrected for topographic discrepancies first for this purpose the original narr fields including the narr terrain were bi linearly interpolated to a 1km grid and the elevation differences between the narr terrain and the local 1km dem sampled from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm data 2 http srtm csi cgiar org selection inputcoord asp 2 at 90m spatial resolution were determined next the atmospheric pressure specific humidity and downward longwave radiation were corrected sequentially high resolution elevation corrections topographic adjustments require dynamic lapse rates for adjusting atmospheric temperature the lapse rate was calculated from the narr atmospheric temperature profile at low isobaric levels 1000mb to 800mb for each pixel 1km grid element at each time step 3 hourly instead of using narr terrain as the reference level the two closest geometric heights converted from the geopotential heights corresponding to the narr terrain and the local dem were utilized to calculate the lapse rate in the atmospheric surface layer the latter is used in turn to adjust atmospheric temperature from the narr to the local dem at 1km fig 2 provides the flowchart describing all intermediate steps in the elevation correction algorithm at location s and time t the adjusted atmospheric temperature is calculated by 1 t adj t s t narr t s γ t s δ z where t adj is the adjusted atmospheric temperature k 10m abg based on the local terrain at 1km tnarr is the original narr atmospheric temperature k 10m abg γ is the dynamic lapse rate k km and δz is the elevation difference between the narr terrain and the dem data at 1km the lapse rate γ depends on the atmospheric conditions time of day and location fig 3 shows an example of lapse rate estimates derived using the elevation correction in fig 3a the 900hpa height the closest level to the narr terrain and the 925hpa height the closest level to the srtm dem were selected to estimate the lapse rate γ 3 28k km that is quite different from the standard value 6 5k km as expected in fig 3b the srtm dem is much higher than the narr terrain and the heights and temperatures at 875hpa and 900hpa were selected to estimate the lapse rate γ 7 91k km fig 3c demonstrates the application of the elevation correction to the narr atmospheric temperature along the transect marked in fig 1b starting in the tennessee valley and crossing the blue ridge mountains into the coastal plains the adjusted surface air temperature fields are very different from the original narr values in the mountains up to 6k as shown in fig 3c not surprisingly the differences in temperature are not very large in the smooth and low elevation topography of the piedmont and the coastal plain due to the small elevation differences between the narr terrain and the dem the adjustments for air pressure specific humidity 10m abg and downward longwave radiation at the surface follow strictly the procedure described by cosgrove et al 2003 and can be found also in the corresponding iphex2014 technical report by tao and barros 2014c 2 3 wind adjustment for the wind adjustment we first begin by adjusting the friction velocity based on the dependence of the geostrophic drag coefficient on surface roughness lettau 1959 two spatial scales of interest are considered the geostrophic synoptic scale l that depends on the pressure gradient force and the coriolis acceleration and the mesoscale l that depends on the regional topography i e the roughness length at the scale of interest the geostrophic drag coefficient at a scale l can be expressed as c g u l u g where ul is the surface layer friction velocity at scale l and ug is the geostrophic wind it is assumed implicitly that the ageostrophic component of the total wind can be neglected and thus u ug based on balloon measurements lettau 1959 proposed an empirical relationship between the geostrophic drag coefficient and the rossby number r o as follows 2 c g 0 16 r o 0 09 and r o u g f z 0 l where f is the coriolis acceleration and z 0 l is the roughness length at scale l the rossby number is the ratio of the pressure gradient force that drives the geostrophic wind and the coriolis force at the scale of interest by replacing ro in eq 2 the following identity is obtained 3 0 16 u g 0 91 u l f z 0 l 0 09 assuming that the geostrophic wind u g component of the total wind is the same at the narr resolution scale l 32km and at the local scale l 1km the relationship between the friction velocity at the two scales can be expressed as 4 u l f z 0 l 0 09 u l f z 0 l 0 09 rearranging the terms above the friction velocity at scale ι can be estimated from the friction velocity at scale l 5 u l u l z 0 l z 0 l 0 09 the roughness length z0 l at scale l is obtained from narr parameters and the friction velocity u l is retrieved from the narr s wind speeds at 10m and 30m abg using the classical logarithm law approximation of the low level wind speed profile in the boundary layer the adjusted 10m abg wind speed at scale l is expressed finally as 6 u l u l k log 10 d z 0 l where k is the von kármán constant 0 41 and the roughness length z0 l and the displacement height d depend on the land cover at the same spatial scale 1km this parameterization of friction velocity based on physical scaling arguments aims to capture mesoscale wind shear effects the dynamics of airflow in complex terrain including blocking and channelization effects ridge valley circulations or organized convection which require physically based modeling of atmospheric flows at the relevant scales are therefore not represented 2 4 topographic and cloudiness correction of downward incoming shortwave radiation the correction technique includes four distinctly important steps summarized in fig 4 2 4 1 preprocessing 2 4 2 preparation for auxiliary input parameters 2 4 3 cloudiness correction and 2 4 4 topographic correction 2 4 1 preprocessing the preprocessing mainly involves re projecting all radiative fluxes to utm 17n wgs84 coordinates followed by bi linearly interpolation to 1km resolution after the spatial interpolation the narr sw data are then interpolated in time from 3 hourly to hourly resolution based on the real time local solar zenith angle this step is similar to cosgrove et al 2003 but their temporal interpolation method using the solar zenith angle cannot be applied for cloudy conditions instead a two step modified temporal interpolation is developed to fit a smooth diurnal cycle estimator that preserves the total daily energy swtot using the original 3 hourly narr sw radiation sw i narr i 1 8 weighted by the mean cosine of the hourly solar zenith angle for each three hour period i e cos φ i 1 3 j 1 3 cos φ ij to yield the adjusted local mean three hourly swi radiation 7 sw i sw tot sw i narr cos φ i i 1 8 sw i narr cos φ i the local hourly swij radiation is subsequently interpolated from the 3 hourly adjusted narr swi radiation as follows 8 sw ij sw i cos φ ij j 1 3 cos φ ij where i varies from 1 to 8 8 is the total daily number of 3 h intervals in the narr data and j varies from 1 to 3 indicating the j th hour within each 3 h interval by incorporating the sw i narr term the hourly shortwave radiation depends on the local solar zenith angle and also on the modification of incoming shortwave radiation due to clouds in narr after the temporal interpolation is complete the cloudiness and topographic corrections are applied to the hourly incoming shortwave radiation eq 8 2 4 2 preparation for auxiliary input parameters the shortwave transmittance parameter partitions direct and diffuse radiation transmittance was calculated using the ratio of the hourly downward solar radiation at the surface to the incoming solar radiation at the top of atmosphere toa calculated using grsb data when available and from narr otherwise the derived transmittance is considered representative of cloudy atmospheric conditions when the solar zenith angle is less than 55 in reality highly non linear relationships exist between transmittance and the cosine solar zenith angle over the full range of solar zenith angles depending on heterogeneous cloud distributions the gsrb product does not provide data for early morning and late afternoon for lower values of the cosine of the solar zenith angle i e solar zenith angles larger than 70 cosgrove et al 2003 consequently a filling strategy was implemented based on the assumption that the cosine of the solar zenith angle can be approximated to the first order by the shortwave transmittance chavez 1996 this approximation works best at dawn or dusk when the incoming solar radiation is also very small the filling steps implemented are as follows 1 the downward solar radiation at the top of atmosphere and at the surface is used to estimate the transmittance 2 missing values are replaced with the nearest non missing transmittance multiplied by the ratio of cosine of the solar zenith angle for the pixel where data are missing to the cosine of the solar zenith angle in the nearest neighbor pixel 3 temporal filling was performed for the transmittance in early morning and late afternoon using the closest available data e g using transmittance at 9am to fill the missing data in 6am 8am also based on the ratio of cosine of the solar zenith angles and 4 to account for the variability both in space and time the final transmittance at a given location and time is the average of spatially and temporally filled transmittance if there are missing data over a large region only temporal filling is conducted and the temporally filled transmittance is the final transmittance in addition to determining atmospheric transmittance other auxiliary input parameters such as the sky view factor the terrain configuration factor the hourly local illumination angle and the actual surface albedo must be defined prior to applying the topographic correction for shortwave radiation albedo influences the reflected radiation from the surrounding terrain and the local illumination angle affects the direct radiation received at a slope the albedo exhibits large spatial and temporal variability depending on land cover type i e forest cropland or bare ground and hydrometeorological conditions dry wet with the amplitude of the diurnal cycle determined by the local fraction of diffuse skylight the actual albedo of the land surface is a weighted average of the black sky albedo bsa and the white sky albedo wsa the weighting coefficient is the fraction of diffuse skylight depending on solar zenith angle optical depth local aerosol type etc schaaf et al 2002 hourly bsa and wsa were calculated using solar zenith angle and the brdf bidirectional reflectance distribution function model parameters provided by the modis product mcd43b1 as per tao and barros 2014b the local illumination angle plays an important role for quantifying the effects of self shadowing and reducing the incoming direct irradiance when the sun is below the local horizon of the slope the cosine of the local illumination angle shows large spatial variability in regions of complex terrain due to the relative position of the sun and the local terrain slope besides topography the diurnal variability and seasonal variability in the local illumination angle are determined by the altitude and azimuth of the sun the sky view factor represents the total portion of unobstructed sky visible on a slope in all directions with a value of unity indicating that the sky is unobstructed and zero meaning the sky is completely obstructed by surrounding topography i e the sky view factor is very small at the bottom of a narrow valley because the surrounding terrain blocks diffuse radiation the terrain configuration factor at a pixel location is the fraction of the hemispheric view that receives reflected radiation from the surrounding terrain a terrain configuration factor of unity means that only terrain is visible the methodology to calculate the sky view factor and terrain correction factor is presented in the topographic correction section 2 4 4 below 2 4 3 cloudiness correction in clear sky conditions topographic effects dominate the spatial variability of incoming solar radiation for cloudy conditions the cloudiness pattern ultimately determines the spatial distribution of the solar radiation in order to account for real time cloudiness patterns the probability density functions pdfs of both the spatial gsrb solar radiation and the narr shortwave radiation are calculated first and then the pdf of the narr shortwave radiation is matched to that of the gsrb data by calculating a histogram index at each pixel λ i j r max s r s i j r max s r min s where r s i j is the gsrb solar radiation at pixel i j and r max s and r min s are the maximum and minimum values of the spatial gsrb solar radiation at the present time respectively the regional cloudiness pattern λ i j is mapped into a position at the histogram scale using the histogram index λ i j the narr sw radiation is reshuffled by matching its pdf to the gsrb s pdf such that r i j r max λ i j r max r min where r i j is the narr sw radiation accounting for the cloudiness pattern and r max and r min are the maximum and minimum values of the spatial narr sw radiation at the current time as it can be seen from fig 5 panel c 2 exhibits the exact same pdf shape as the spatial pdf of gsrb in b 2 thus the same cloudiness pattern as the gsrb data c 1 versus b 1 while maintaining the original range of narr sw radiation c 2 over the region 2 4 4 topographic correction the topographic correction is applied after the cloudiness correction c as indicated by the work flow in fig 4 the topographic solar radiation model and the topographic correction used in this study were developed originally by dozier 1980 and dozier and frew 1990 from the simulated total incoming radiation at sea level an elevation correction is required before applying the topographic correction to solar radiation in the original model however the narr incoming shortwave radiation is already at the narr terrain elevation thus the elevation correction was not implemented despite elevation differences between the narr terrain elevation and the digital elevation model dem at 1km resolution we assume that the elevation effects caused by this difference are negligible compared to other topographic effects such as blocking of the incoming radiation and or radiation reflection by the surrounding terrain especially in regions of complex terrain such as the southern appalachian mountains the theoretical basis of the topographic radiation correction is described briefly next the total incoming solar radiation consist of three components the diffuse irradiance from the sky direct irradiance from the sun and diffuse and direct irradiance from nearby terrain dubayah and paul 1995 the total downward shortwave radiation can be expressed as 9 sw tot i j f i j v d i j δ cos θ i j b i j c t i j f i j where f i j is the incoming diffuse irradiance f i j is the upwelling terrain reflected flux and b i j is the direct beam irradiance v d i j is the sky view factor and c t i j is the terrain configuration factor δ is a binary shadowing mask set equal to either 1 or 0 depending on the shadow caused by nearby terrain blocking the sun cast shadowing and cos θ i j is the cosine of the local solar illumination angle indicating whether the sun is below or above the local horizon caused by the slope itself self shadowing calculated as cos θ i j cos θ 0 cos s sin θ 0 sin s cos ϕ 0 a where θ 0 is solar zenith angle and ϕ 0 is solar azimuth angle s and a are slope magnitude and aspect the original algorithm performs the topographic correction based on the incoming atmospheric radiation after atmospheric attenuation noted as i in fig 6 whereas the narr estimates of direct beam irradiance b at the surface already account for the solar illumination angle on the basis of the narr terrain the topographic adjustment consists of multiplying b by the scaled cosine of solar illumination angle cos θ s defined as the ratio of the cosine of solar illumination angle on the 1km dem to that on the narr terrain as illustrated in fig 6 to perform the topographic correction the cloudiness corrected narr hourly total incoming shortwave radiation is partitioned into direct beam irradiance b i j and diffuse irradiance f i j using the shortwave atmospheric transmittance diffuse and direct radiation fluxes are affected by the terrain in different ways the upwelling reflected radiation from the surrounding terrain f i j is estimated as follows 10 f i j r i j f i j 1 v d i j cos θ o b i j where r i j is the surface reflectance albedo the sky view and terrain configuration factors respectively vd and ct are calculated using the image processing workbench software ipw frew 1990 based on high resolution elevation data see fig 7 for vd and ct in the iphex domain the original methodology can be found in dubayah and paul 1995 and dubayah and loechel 1997 the sky view factor vd is given by 11 v d 1 2 π 0 2 π cos s sin 2 h ϕ sin s cos ϕ a h ϕ sin h ϕ cos h ϕ d ϕ where s and a are slope magnitude and aspect and hϕ is the zenith angle with regard to the local horizon in view direction ϕ for simplicity the location pixel subscripts i j are not used in eq 11 but all relevant variables are calculated on a pixel basis in open areas the sky view factor v d is large but is small at the bottom of narrow valleys where the sky is partially obstructed fig 7 left panel the terrain configuration factor c t i j estimates the fraction of the surrounding terrain that is visible from location i j and varies from 0 only sky visible to 1 only terrain visible 12 c t 1 cos s 2 v d thus the product c t i j f i j is the radiation received at point i j that is reflected by the surrounding visible terrain generally the smaller the terrain configuration factor ct the larger the sky view factor vd fig 7 3 results and evaluation the downscaled atmospheric forcing datasets were evaluated against available flux tower observations table 2 in the se us and compared against the nldas 2 primary forcing data at the same location for reference the objective is twofold 1 to show that the downscaling and corrections applied do introduce physically based improvements in regions of complex topography that are not represented at narr resolution and 2 to show that the downscaling methodology improves or it does not degrade the narr fields elsewhere away from the mountains the spatial scale of flux tower observations varies in time and depends highly on the height and location of the tower land form land use class and land cover heterogeneity surrounding the towers and regional weather conditions that determine lagrangian transport and mixing thus the multi year tower observations are used to evaluate the model s ability to capture the local hydrometeorological regime in the statistical mean sense the number of flux towers in complex terrain is small us chr us wbw and dkepl table 2 and only dkepl is located at high elevation in the sam 3 1 elevation correction and wind adjustment selected results of the adjusted downscaled and corrected and the original narr atmospheric pressure and temperature fig 8 and wind speed fig 9 are used here to examine spatial variability with a focus on the diurnal cycle the specific humidity and downward longwave radiation data exhibit similar behavior and are not shown here one should be mindful of the differences in spatial scales among the various products 32km for narr 12 5km for nldas 2 and 1km for the downscaled iphex data the adjusted fields in figs 8 and 9 vary over a wide range of magnitude compared with the original fields in regions of complex terrain specifically in the appalachian plateaus and the blue ridge including the pigeon river basin fig 1c the largest variability in the adjusted narr fields is in atmospheric pressure with strong contrasts between ridges and valleys as expected fig 8 left panel note that nldas 2 forcing fields were corrected for the elevation effects based on nldas topography which is quite coarse for this region generally the adjustments of atmospheric pressure and near surface air temperature specific humidity and downward longwave radiation are much smaller along ridge lines than in the valleys and exhibit strong temporal variability at seasonal and diurnal scales not shown for example the differences between adjusted atmospheric temperature and the original narr values are much larger in the winter than in the summer fig 8 bottom right panel fig 9 shows spatial wind fields at different hours of the day on march 1 2009 unlike other atmospheric forcing fields the spatial variability in wind speed depends primarily on surface roughness length and displacement height parameters which are specified according to land cover type and not on topography explicitly because the physical parameterization used here cannot explicitly resolve mesoscale circulations in complex terrain below the narr nominal resolution as pointed out in section 2 3 although the adjusted friction velocity shows larger values than the original friction velocity not shown the downscaled wind speed is systematically lower than the original narr due to the impact of increased spatial resolution on the specification of displacement height based on land cover class e g large blue areas in the bottom row in fig 9 the largest difference between the friction velocity and wind speed before and after adjustment is in urban areas where the effective roughness length is large about 2 5m the flux tower observations from the ameriflux network and the duke tower in the southern appalachians marked in fig 1c are used next for independent evaluation at local point scales scatter plots of original narr adjusted narr as well as nldas 2 data against the tower observations are presented in fig 10 a and the associated root mean squared errors rmses are summarized in table 3 overall the adjusted narr fields show better agreement or at least as good as the original narr though nldas 2 outperforms narr with or without adjustment at times in the case of air temperature at low elevations note that the three towers in duke forest us dk1 us dk2 us dk3 see fig 1c are very close together though in fields with distinct land cover and thus rmse differences can be interpreted as a measure indicative of spatial uncertainty the rmse of the adjusted atmospheric pressure at dkepl is reduced from 44 71hpa to 2 78hpa with small surface pressure differences for other towers because of the small elevation differences in the piedmont and elsewhere away from complex topography fig 1c and table 2 time series of surface pressure air temperature and wind speed at us chr fig 10b and dkepl fig 10c illustrate the robustness of the narr adjustments from daily to inter annual scales over the period 2007 2011 the downscaled specific humidity and wind speed outperform other estimates i e the original narr and nldas 2 at all towers at all times despite limitations pointed out earlier the proposed wind scaling relationship works well at the mesoscales tested here this is an important result with far reaching implications for the calculation of surface heat fluxes and especially evapotranspiration rates the adjusted radiation fluxes show improvement at all ameriflux towers cloud and topographic corrections applied to incoming shortwave radiation result in significant improvements with large rmse decreases of 25 30w m2 at low elevation towers and about 1 3 of this value at dkepl table 3 these results are explored in further detail next 3 2 topographic and cloudiness correction of shortwave radiation the cloudiness and topographic corrections were dynamically applied to the regional radiation at hourly scale with aid of time invariant auxiliary parameters shortwave transmittance surface albedo and the cosine of the local illumination angle as described in section 2 4 figs 11 and 12 show the intermediate results after performing the cloudiness and topographic correction for cloudy and clear sky conditions respectively the clear sky and cloudy foggy conditions were confirmed by review of archived webcam pictures panel 11 a in fig 11 both the gsrb solar radiation panel 11 h and the derived atmospheric transmissivity panel 11 c vary strongly with cloud cover see the corresponding goes visible image in panel 11 b but the cloud pattern in the original narr panel 11 f must be corrected panel 11 g panel 11 i in fig 11 shows the final radiation results after both cloudiness and topographic corrections note the very good agreement with the gsrb data and goes imagery with regard to the cloudiness patterns in fig 12 the gsrb radiation data and the transmissivity exhibit uniform distributions except for the cloud band in the southwest corner green bands in panels 12 c and 12 h the cosine of the solar illumination angle mainly affects the direct radiation component thus in cloudy conditions the direct radiation component is very small especially in the mountains where the illumination effects are large panels 11g 1 and 11i 1 and the topographic effects are not apparent in the final radiation estimates in other words the cloudiness correction dominates over the topographic correction for cloudy and partially cloudy conditions by contrast for clear sky conditions the topographic effects are apparent in the mountains displaying complex spatial variability in the southern appalachians as shown in panel 12i 1 and thus the topographic corrections dominate the spatial variability in the total shortwave radiation the final corrected radiation shows the effect of the small band of clouds in the southwest corner while capturing realistic topographic variability the diurnal and seasonal cycles of downscaled and corrected narr shortwave radiation as well as the original narr and nldas2 shortwave radiation are shown in fig 13 at a particular time the difference between the shortwave radiation before and after corrections can be as large as 500w m2 e g the example shown for a day in june the topographic effects are apparent in winter especially in the early morning or late afternoon in the blue ridge and appalachian plateaus regions fig 1c fig 13 but the cloudiness correction is dominant overall for instance there is partial cloud cover in the se us at noon on dec 15 in 2009 in both the nldas2 and original narr downward shortwave radiation however the goes visible imagery 3 the image at noon is missing but the images at 1500 and 2100 utc are available from http www sat dundee ac uk geobrowse 3 displays uniform cloud coverage i e 100 thick cloud cover after correction the adjusted narr shortwave radiation field consists of uniformly lower values compared to the original data as it should generally both the original narr and nldas 2 fields overestimate the incoming shortwave radiation compared to the tower observations fig 10 the adjusted narr shortwave shows the best agreement with the tower observations everywhere table 3 except at dkepl this can be attributed in part to the fact that the gsrb product was discontinued in mid 2010 whereas the tower observations are only available from 2009 onwards and thus the period of higher quality cloud corrections is very short in addition the notional physical scale gap at high elevations in complex topography is very large due to unresolved mesoscale processes in narr the original and adjusted radiation represent average values of otherwise heterogeneous fields over significantly different areas 1000km2 and 1km2 respectively and thus discrepancies with regard to the tower observations point to field scale are expected this artifact is further enhanced by the persistence of small scale low level fog and clouds that are not detected from satellite at mid day in winter when fog is present at dkepl e g wilson and barros 2014 the narr based estimates consistently overestimate shortwave radiation 4 water and energy budget impacts hydrologic modeling application the utility of the downscaled atmospheric forcing datasets for hydrological applications is demonstrated for 4 continuous water year simulations 2007 oct to 2011 sep in the pigeon river basin prb area 1823 km2 fig 1c a tributary of the upper tennessee river basin using the spatially distributed duke coupled surface groundwater hydrology model dchm formerly 3d lshm tao et al 2016 tao and barros 2014a tao and barros 2013 yildiz and barros 2007 for reference the area of the prb is smaller than two narr grid elements each 1024 km2 and there are two thousand grid elements in the dchm grid for the prb larger area than actual basin area to accommodate complex outer boundary the lack of radar observations and long term raingauges impairs the quality of the rainfall products downscaled or not in the inner region of the sam e g tao et al 2016 nogueira and barros 2015 instead of narr rainfall the national stage iv 4 http www emc ncep noaa gov mmb ylin pcpanl stage4 4 quantitative precipitation estimates qpe combining radar and raingauge observations are used instead the stage iv qpe data available at 4km resolution were downscaled to 1km resolution via bilinear interpolation stage iv bi and using a transient multifractal ensemble approach stage iv tf as described by nogueira and barros 2015 the stage iv bi rainfall product is used for the simulations with the bi linearly interpolated original narr atmospheric forcing products and the stage iv tf rainfall product is used with the corrected downscaled narr products nogueira and barros 2014a 4 1 hydrologic model implementation the dchm implementation used in this study is similar to tao et al 2016 soil properties and other hydrologic parameters are the same as in tao and barros 2013 2014a and 2014b and landscape attributes including radiative properties and land use and land cover were specified according to tao and barros 2014b and all are available from http iphex pratt duke edu for sensitivity analysis the dchm was driven separately by the original and the corrected downscaled atmospheric forcing from narr and hourly precipitation from the iphex2014 data sets as described above back to back spin up like simulations consisting of repeated 4 year simulations using the same atmospheric forcing and initial soil moisture and water table conditions equal to the values at the end of the preceding 4 year iteration were conducted until differences between two successive 4 year streamflow simulations were less than 1 over the 4 year simulation period up to ten repetitions or 40years the performance of the uncalibrated dchm was evaluated for several small basins within the prb tao et al 2016 tao and barros 2014b including the cataloochee creek basin ccb area 127km2 that is used here for illustrative purposes as representative of headwater catchments in the sam tao and barros 2013 2014a and 2014b the ccb delineated in fig 14 right panel is nestled in the inner region of the southern appalachian mountains sam spanning 1127m of elevation difference and it is one of only 50 watersheds in the united states geological survey usgs national hydrologic benchmark network mast and turk 1999 improvements in the dchm simulations for the prb and the ccb in particular reflect the benefit of using the adjusted downscaled atmospheric forcing including the stage iv tf rainfall 4 2 sensitivity analysis the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 5 nse 1 t 1

improvements in the rainfall between stage iv bi and stage iv tf as discussed by nogueira and barros 2014a and 2015 where the stage iv product is of higher quality across the prb i e eastern and western slopes of the sam at low elevations the nse increases are in the 10 30 range tao and barros 2014b nogueira and barros 2014a 2015 which is nevertheless a large improvement in hydrologic modeling performance skill without calibration especially considering the hourly temporal resolution and the multi year simulations the higher nse scores encompassing both response to large storms and periods of low flows and therefore they also reflect improvements in simulated soil moisture in response to improved rainfall forcing in the prb e g tao and barros 2013 area averaged hourly surface energy flux differences between dchm simulations using the adjusted and the original narr atmospheric forcing during september of 2009 6 nb this month is selected to follow discussion regarding shortwave radiation adjustments section 3 2 fig 11 6 are shown in fig 14 for the ccb the ccb nse improved from 0 21 to 0 48 for this month but by less than 5 in prb sub catchments where the quality of original rainfall products is good nse 0 7 tao and barros 2014b the relevant forcing fields including air pressure air temperature specific humidity and wind velocity are shown in the left column fig 14 top four rows differences in surface pressure up to 35hpa and air temperature up to 5k reflect the difference between the dchm topography and the narr terrain in the ccb the changes are small for specific humidity since these data are essentially interpolated bi linearly from the original narr fields without further correction by contrast the differences in near surface wind are very large and vary widely from day to day depending on synoptic conditions negative signs in the model energy fluxes indicate that the flux is leaving the land surface to the atmosphere i e upward fluxes thus negative differences adj ori mean that the absolute magnitude of energy fluxes using the adjusted downscaled forcing is larger than using the original narr forcing fields two bottom rows generally the absolute magnitudes of both sensible and latent heat fluxes are larger using original fields with positive differences i e bias mostly during daytime up to 300w m2 and 100w m2 for sensible and latent heat fluxes respectively fig 14 left column bottom two rows interestingly days with large differences in surface winds do not necessarily correspond to the days with the largest differences in surface fluxes fig 14 left for weak and moderate wind conditions in the first two weeks of september 2009 inspection of the radiative fluxes fig 14 center reveals that the primary forcing behind day to day variations in the surface energy fluxes is the incoming shortwave radiation when the winds pick up in the second half of the month due to changes in synoptic weather conditions there is a strong impact on sensible heat fluxes 300wm 2 even as the changes in shortwave radiation are modest 50wm 2 further despite complex topography the area averaged radiation fluxes are very similar not shown from one prb sub catchment to another at high elevations in the inner sam ridgeline clouds strongly affect the diurnal cycle of incoming shortwave radiation wilson and barros 2014 2015 which are not resolved in the original narr data and thus the adjusted incoming shortwave radiation fluxes using gsrb data are lower than the original values except for two clear days sep 2 and 3 the net radiation calculated from the original radiation forcing as shown in the 5th row in 5 central column results in larger temperature increases in the top soil layer 6th row which in turn affects the sensible heat flux as shown in the left column 5th row as well as the latent heat flux bottom row depending on soil moisture conditions large latent heat flux differences on september 19 contrasting with very small differences on september 21 spatial distributions of simulated sensible heat flux latent heat flux and net radiation fields using original atmospheric forcing and the adjusted narr fields are shown at mid day across the prb for cloudy and clear sky conditions in figs 15 and 16 respectively for the cloudy scenario on sep 1 previously discussed in section 3 2 fig 11 cloud covers most of the basin and thus the adjusted incoming solar radiation is much lower than the original narr values up to 331w m2 on average leading to large discrepancies in sensible heat flux up to 297w m2 for the clear sky scenario on sep 2 the total net radiation flux net shortwave plus net longwave exhibits wide spatial variability with large values at high elevations and relatively low values at low elevations as expected fig 16 latent heat fluxes display strong spatial organization with clearly demarcation of high elevation areas with shallow soils where evapotranspiration is limited by soil moisture and low elevation areas with deep soils stronger gradients under cloudy conditions fig 15 are consistent with larger differences in surface temperature this sensitivity analysis highlights the importance of accurate estimates of incoming solar radiation and net radiation in mountainous regions where foggy and cloudy conditions are persistent features that can introduce large differences in surface fluxes e g wilson and barros 2015 this is essential to capture the spatial variability of microclimates and complex eco hydrology in the sam and elsewhere 5 summary and discussion high resolution 1km hourly atmospheric forcing datasets including 10m abg air temperature air pressure wind velocity specific humidity downward shortwave and longwave radiation were developed for the iphex2014 domain based on the narr products originally at 32km spatial resolution and 3 h temporal resolution for a seven year period 2007 2013 over the southeast us see table 1 for data access information the elevation correction was applied to the narr air temperature air pressure specific humidity and downward longwave radiation and dynamic lapse rates were derived from the estimated atmospheric temperature profiles friction velocity was adjusted based on a relationship between the geostrophic drag coefficients and the rossby number which was used subsequently to estimate wind velocity at high spatial resolution downward shortwave radiation data were first interpolated to hourly time intervals using a temporal interpolation method based on the solar zenith angle as well as the diurnal cycle of narr cloudiness real time cloudiness patterns derived from the gsrb dataset were used to correct cloudy effects for narr shortwave radiation by matching the spatial pdf of narr data to that of the gsrb data and topographic effects were incorporated based on a well established topographic solar radiation model nevertheless unquantified uncertainty in the cloud corrections is expected at different times and locations due to the lack of high resolution observations generally as well as well documented weaknesses in the simulation of clouds in atmospheric models e g wilson and barros 2015 a comprehensive evaluation of the adjusted downscaled narr products would require a dense network of ground based measurements to capture the spatial and temporal variability of cloud cover water and energy fluxes in complex terrain because such observing system does not exist the evaluation scope is therefore limited to existing observations and we take advantage of long records to demonstrate robust long term behavior sensitivity analysis of long duration hydrologic simulations was used to examine the impact of atmospheric forcing on the various terms of the surface water and energy budget equations which are nonlinearly related overall as expected the adjusted downscaled atmospheric forcing datasets exhibit larger spatial variability compared to the original narr fields consistent with the 1 32 spatial scale ratio the comparison among the atmospheric forcing data and flux tower observations in the region ameriflux and dkepl reveals that the adjustments to the narr fields result in improvements on the order of 50 100 for near surface winds everywhere 10 s hpa for surface pressure as well as large differences in air temperature up to 6k at high elevations a decrease of 25 30w m2 in the rsmes of shortwave radiation estimates at low elevation flux towers amounts to approximately 10 of monthly net radiation in the warm season and thus is a very significant contribution toward reducing the uncertainty in the surface energy budget further simulations with a fully distributed coupled surface groundwater hydrologic model dchm using both the original and adjusted downscaled atmospheric forcing from narr exhibit large sensitivity to atmospheric forcing of various terms in the surface water and energy budgets with differences in peak latent sensible and net radiation fluxes of 100 s of w m2 at mid day in the warm season concurrent changes in air temperature incoming shortwave radiation and wind speed impact nonlinearly sensible heat fluxes and latent heat fluxes 3 1 ratio with the latter being constrained by soil moisture controls of evapotranspiration especially at high elevations though hydrologic sensitivity will vary from one location to another depending on regional climate and physiography these results highlight the importance of atmospheric forcing in hydrologic predictability and therefore the need for appropriate downscaling and correction
