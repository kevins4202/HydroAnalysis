obstacles were also modeled it was found that a non newtonian fluid rather strongly reduces the maximum shock the pressure value of the water flow keywords mud flow dam break flow modeling non newtonian fluid vof method piso algorithm 1 introduction the dam break problem is one of the most devastating floods in the history of the modern world intensive snow melting heavy rains as well as human factors such as carelessness can lead to a dam break which in turn can lead to flooding and destruction of neighboring settlements despite the fact that there has been a lot of research on the destruction of the dam this phenomenon remains one of the most important problems in the field of hydraulic engineering because of its danger to human society therefore dam breakthrough is a classic problem of great engineering importance chanson 2006 this problem is also acute in the republic of kazakhstan there have been similar natural disasters which resulted in the death of many local residents for example in 2010 the dam break of the kyzylagash reservoir in the almaty region killed 43 people hundreds were injured about a thousand people had to be evacuated from flooded places in the summer of 1921 heavy rains fell in almaty and intensive melting of snow and glaciers began in the mountainous areas because of these natural leashes along the river small almatinka the mudflow reached actually the center of the city within 5 h a significant part of alma ata was turned into ruins and covered with a mud mass more than 500 people were killed because of such acutely pressing issues it is very important to investigate all aspects of the dam break problem the scientific value of dam breakthrough has long been recognized as an idealized problem for evaluation and testing for a number of theories and approaches both in mathematics and in physics wang et al 2000 in most past studies dam failure was considered as a collapse of water and only a few of them were in mixtures of particles with water spinewine and zech 2007 razavitoosi et al 2014 with the advancement of computing technology numerical methods have become an excellent research tool in various fields for example the popular numerical method for tracking and locating a free surface the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 based on eulerian meshes and made it possible to simulate free surface deformations using such numerical methods many works were done to describe the flow behavior after the dam was broken in paper issakhov and imanberdiyeva 2019 a realistic model of a dam break above a fixed bed with different reliefs was presented also using the vof method issakhov et al 2018 issakhov and zhandaulet 2020 dam breaks were modeled for various forms of obstacles in paper ying et al 2009 developed a reliable and accurate numerical model based on a conservative form using the finite volume method fvm on unstructured triangular grids for flows with broken sections that can flow over difficult terrain also there are studies related to the use of rans equations which include turbulence models quecedo et al 2005 shigematsu et al 2004 abdolmaleki et al 2004 an improved sph approach to solving three dimensional free surface problems was demonstrated in paper xu 2016 where three complex numerical problems were modeled 1 three dimensional dam break to a vertical wall 2 an obstacle with a cubic shape and 3 an obstacle with a cylindrical shape which compared with the available numerical data and experimental data the numerical code developed in paper celis et al 2017 based on the finite difference method fdm showed good results of destruction and splashing when the dam is broken in paper li and yu 2019 a flood wave caused by a dam break acting on the vertical lower wall of the channel which was numerically investigated using vof and ls level set models where it was shown that vof model has an excellent ability to work with interface modeling especially with the waves destruction and the deformation of the free surface with a large amplitude compared with the ls model in paper yang et al 2018 presents a complete understanding of the water flow spreading process when a dam is broken through with varied depths of water downstream above a fixed bed however it is necessary to appreciate that in actual situations the flow at a dam break cannot contains only of water and frequently consists some admixtures and solid particles stones when the dam is broken the impurities perform a very significant role since the admixture transferring will have another movement pattern in this case the admixture could be characterized as a non newtonian flow the flow can be determined as a dense fluid flow and impurities in which direct interactions between impurities are the dominant feature that defines the flow nature intense flows that arise during the dam break and often cause sediment transport and morphological evolution which in turn contributes to the change in flows interactive processes of flow sediment transport and morphological evolution are a hierarchy of considerable physical problems interest in the fields of hydraulics and geomorphology a good understanding of these processes is important not only from an application point of view but also for effective flood risk management and the environmental well being of the region frey and church 2009 the dam destruction flows above a fixed impermeable layer were investigated in papers marsooli and wu 2014 issakhov et al 2018 kleefsman et al 2005 but with intensive flows the lower layer of the flow can be mobile therefore this flow may shift or transport to this bottom layer such as sand mud clay etc the process may bring to the transportation of enormous amounts of sediment which brings to a large scale change in the downstream region morphology and dramatically increases the damage to the environment and city infrastructure also due to friction inertial effects and pulse exchanges the lower layer can significantly affect the development of the flood wave therefore it is very significant to consider the geomorphological process of destruction and transfer of lower sediments the sediment transportation could not simply be produced by the model of newtonian fluid gotoh et al 2000 consequently a non newtonian model is necessary in order to be able to simulate the stress dependent phase viscosity thus it is important to accurately simulate the geomorphological changes associated with dam break flows the flow behavior in the fixed conditions and moving layers vary considerably and tightly influence the free surface deformation and the flood wave propagation therefore it is high theoretical and practical concern to study the flow types lauber and hager 1998 janosi et al 2004 in paper papanicolaou et al 2008 provide insights into future trends and needs regarding sediment transport and hydrodynamic models at the end of the last century attention to the effects of sediments was primarily focused on quasi analytical solutions fraccarollo and capart 2002 and then using numerical models including shallow water two layer models swartenbroekx et al 2013 leal et al 2010 li et al 2013 the bilayer models have been significantly improved in terms of the sediment transport description from partial connection between sediment and flow to full connection in paper evangelista et al 2013 the computational values are compared with various sets of laboratory measurement values in fixed statements and moving layers with various materials of the layer in order to verify the accuracy of the simulation in a wide range of cases in paper marsooli and wu 2015 a model of shallow water exner representing the dam break process was used this paper analyzes the ability of the classical model of shallow water to model a complex sediment transfer process the dam break flow caused by the partial dam break in a abruptly expanded region above the moving bed is simulated in this paper the model was used to simulate two laboratory tests hosseinzadeh tabrizi and ghaeini hessaroeyeh 2018 numerical simulations have been widely used as a reliable tool for studying various dam break flows above a moving bed gu et al 2018 yu et al 2019a yu et al 2019b marsooli and wu 2015 van emelen et al 2015 the 1d shallow water equations based on the fvm was used zhang and duan 2011 the modification of the 2d shallow water equations in combination with the sediment transfer equation to study the moving layer and an unstructured finite volume algorithm was used to solve the basic equations xia et al 2010 the dam break of pure non newtonian liquids such as liquid gel and clay was investigated in papers chambon et al 2009 ancey and cochard 2009 considering non newtonian fluids really allows for a better exploration of native complex natural flows such as impurity and mudflow flows than consisting only newtonian fluids such as water in paper li and zhao 2018 a dam breakthrough was taken into account as a fracture problem for a particles and a fluid mixture which was numerically studied using the cfd dem method for two non newtonian fluids based on measurement values the simulation results were carefully compared to several control cases including a water mixture and particles a dry granular system as well as three pure liquids herschel bulkley liquid bingham liquid and water the results of this work displayed that non newtonian fluids can decrease the particles kinetic energy during early stage of disruption in paper lin and chen 2013 investigated the number of particles effect on the flows behavior and momentum on the flow structure the flow rate increased with decreasing concentration while the impulse decreased the results of this work lin and chen 2013 showed that the friction coefficient has an obvious effect on the flow however the parameters considered in this study were limited and only the forward position of the mixture flow was compared to investigate their effects in previous studies related to dam break flows the effect of the moving lower layer was not shown in detail because sediments are very viscous they can affect flow in general their coefficients of friction and elastic recovery can affect the flow behavior due to the interaction between the fluids the focus of this work is on the dam destruction consisting of mud and water which is a non newtonian fluid coussot 1995 mudflow frequently happens after soil saturation due to rapid snow melt or due to rainfall the debris and mud flows occur on mountainous or steep slope regions detailed flow control permits us to distinguish three various wave development stages the transport phase the decline phase and the inertia phase hogg and pritchard 2004 hogg and woods 2001 at each of three stages various physical mechanisms dominate at various times based on a numerical approach this study aims to provide new results of numerical calculation of pressure peaks value during a dam break taking into account the mud flow more specifically this paper discusses the value of maximum pressure relative to different forms of obstacles numerical simulation was performed using vof using the ansys fluent 2 mathematical model in this study it was considered an incompressible flow consisting of three phases the deposition phase impurities air and water the equations that control the flow are simply incompressible navier stokes equations 1 u j x j 0 2 u i t u i u j x j g 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ x j τ μ t 3 χ t u j χ x

equations are sampled on a fixed cartesian grid using the fvm approximation for spatial discretization second order upwind was used whereas for temporal order first order the piso algorithm pressure implicit with splitting of operators was used as a numerical method for solving the navier stokes equation issa 1986 issakhov 2015a b issakhov 2015 2015 2016 issakhov and mashenkova 2019 this is an expansion of the simple algorithm used to solve the navier stokes equation issakhov and omarova 2020 issakhov and zhandaulet 2019 the piso algorithm is a procedure for finding the pressure and velocity for the rans equations which was firstly designed for non iterative computation of an unsteady compressible flow but also was successfully adjusted to steady problem the piso algorithm contains overall three stages first prediction stage and other two corrector stages and is constructed to supply mass conservation using predictor corrector stages 4 verification of the mathematical model 4 1 problem 1 the initial stage of the dam break the study of the flow impact was carried out taking into account the dam break in which the water flow column created by the destruction of the dam faces a vertical obstacle therefore improving the description of this particular flow of exposure is of great interest for verification of the 3d model it was used experimental dam break data from the marin netherlands marine research institute kleefsman et al 2005 this measurement could be considered as a simple model of water flow the geometry of the experiment is shown in fig 1 a large tank 3 22 0 993 1 0 m is used with an open roof in one part of the tank water with a volume of 0 67 m3 is held by the shutter when the shutter instantly rises by releasing a mass a water flow is created that moves due to gravitational forces a box representing a scale model of an obstacle with a size of 0 403 0 161 0 161 m was located in the tank the obstacle was covered with pressure sensors p1 p3 p5 p7 and two water level detectors h2 h4 the interaction of intensive water flows with the structure is a key problem in hydraulic oceanic and coastal construction this interaction is presented in fig 2 which includes a very fast impulsive force i e a stroke followed by a more stationary stage the obtained computational values from the vof model as shown in fig 3 the obtained computational values from the developed model show acceptable accuracy compared with experimental data fig 4 shows snapshots of numerical results for the total flow at time points of 0 4 and 0 56 s compared with experimental values kleefsman et al 2005 an unstructured mesh was used to modeling the test problem for numerical study a computational grid with a size of 563 932 was applied and the maximum and minimum cell sizes are 0 035 m and 0 0035 m respectively fig 1 for test problem the following types of boundary conditions were used for right left front back bottom and obstacle faces walls for top face pressure outlet moreover fig 2a shows the computational values of pressure distributions compared with the data from the laboratory measurement kleefsman et al 2005 for various computational grid sizes at point p1 as could be observed from the figure by using a different computational grid sizes min 5 mm and max 50 mm min 2 mm and max 20 mm min 1 5 mm and max 20 mm min 3 5 mm and max 35 mm the pressure distribution fully characterizes the experimental values but the first pressure peak value is not faithfully simulated only by using a mesh size min 3 5 mm and max 35 mm the pressure distribution fully characterizes the measurement and adequately simulates the pressure peak as can be displayed from fig 2 at the moment when the wave hits an obstacle the pressure distribution on the surface of this obstacle is well described using modeling this figure shows the pressure distribution at points p1 and p3 at the box front as well as at the box top at points p5 and p7 the positions of the detectors are marked in fig 1 the shock pressure magnitude is the same for both the values from the simulation and the measurement values at point p1 the lowest point on the box kleefsman et al 2005 at the moment when the backward wave hits the obstacle again approximately 4 7 s it is also well described using modeling fig 2 in the lower part of fig 2 where diagrams of pressure distribution over time are shown in the upper part of the box there is a clear variation between the computational results of simulation and measurement values kleefsman et al 2005 this anomalous pressure distribution appears each times in the form of bursts which can be seen at all control points p1 p3 p5 p7 fig 2 at the identical moment approximately 1 3 s the appearance of the pressure peaks is due to the fact that small droplets of water after a given impact on an obstacle fall into empty computational cells cells which are not filled with liquid that are completely surrounded by cells filled with a liquid and the empty computational cells cells which are not filled with liquid change to cells with a liquid in one time interval this intermittent change brings to the appearance of an anomalous peak pressure value in the whole pressure field from this figure it could be noticed that there is a well match between the simulation snapshots and the measurement snapshots when the water falls into the box for the first time at 0 4 s in the second figure the measurement values and computational values are presented for 0 56 s from this picture it can be illustrated the shape of the water free surface which goes around an obstacle and goes a little forward the simulation vales are in well convention with measurement data kleefsman et al 2005 the global water behavior is the same and the impact peak of pressure is in well coincidence particularly in the lower part of the obstacle 4 2 problem 2 the dam break flow above the movable layer of sediment in order to verify the proposed model in this section the model was applied to the control test of the dam break flow above the moving sediment layer the laboratory measurement spinewine and zech 2007 included a water tank separated by valves in the middle and the bottom of the tank is covered with a layer of mobile sediments the experimental area has a height of 0 7 m and a total length of 6 m that is 3 0 m on both sides of the central gate simulating an idealized dam the width of the channel was set to 25 cm along the entire length of the channel the water depth of this experiment is 35 cm as shown in fig 5 in this measurement homogeneous coarse sand with a density of 2683 kg m3 and polyvinyl chloride with a density of 1580 kg m3 were used as the bottom layer 4 2 1 numerical setup a structured mesh was used to modeling the test problem for computational simulation a computational grid with a size of 60 000 has been used and uniform quadrilateral the cell sizes have been 0 01 m for test problem the following types of boundary conditions were used for right left bottom faces walls for top face pressure outlet 4 2 2 grid independence study fig 7 a b c shows the computational values of free surface profiles compared with the measurement data spinewine and zech 2007 for various computational grid sizes at various times t 0 25 0 5 0 75 s as could be observed from the figure by using a different computational grid sizes h 0 02 m h 0 01 m and h 0 005 m the free surface profiles completely characterizes the experimental values only by using a mesh size h 0 01 m the free surface profiles completely characterizes the measurement and adequately simulates the flow characteristics 4 2 3 numerical results from the simulation snapshots of fig 6 it could be concluded that a significant amount of precipitation is being destroyed by the dam break flow this in turn leads to sediment loss changing the flow depth ultimately in the viscous phase the flow becomes dominant and is slowed down by friction due to the presence of coarse sand the flow at breakthrough slows down and leads to sediment transport and decreases also the proposed model has been compared with the results of other authors ran et al 2015 moreover fig 6 shows the simulation and experiment images spinewine and zech 2007 when a dam is broken through with geomorphological changes at various points t 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 s comparisons in fig 7 showed that the calculated free surface profiles are in good coincidence with the measurement values spinewine and zech 2007 and the computational values of other authors ran et al 2015 and the anomalous sawtooth forms appearance was caused to the circumstance that during the water interface movement air bubbles form in the water and applied the computational method did not manage with an unoccupied isolated cell which was surrounded by water cells the air bubbles themselves take place by the progressing wave impacts the front part of the dam walls and starts to lifting and when the water goes down into the dam walls isolated and empty cells are formed in general in fig 8 from the obtained results it can be seen that the observed flood wave differs from typical dam failure waves over fixed beds showing that the very presence of a moving bed greatly affects the transport of water flow the results showed that obtained profiles of the free surface during the dam break flow above the moving bed softens the fall of the water column compared to the dam break flow above the fixed rigid layer this is due to the fact that the transfer process of the lower layer reduces the energy flow thus the presence of a moving layer increased the area of the buffer zone and consequently reduced the flow rate 5 numerical study of dam breaks with mudflow for various forms of obstacle to estimate the pressure distribution on the surface of a dam with mudflow during a dam break a moving mud layer was added to the second measurement kleefsman et al 2005 as shown in fig 9 the moving layer consisted of homogeneous sand with a density of 2683 kg m3 in our model the sediment phase was referred as a non newtonian fluid the effective viscosity for a non newtonian fluid was defined by using equation 7 fig 9 shows that the three dimensional computing area consists of length width and height with dimensions of 3 22 m 0 993 m 1 0 m as in the second experiment the original water column is formed with a length width and height with dimensions of 1 228 m 0 993 m 0 55 m respectively a moving layer with different heights 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 05 m is laid between the water column and the obstacle which has a size of 1 167 m the air occupies the remaining space fig 10 shows the pressure distribution profiles on pressure gauges p1 p3 p5 p7 of the obstacle surface with mud flow during the dam break for various deposition heights for this model figs 11 13 are represented by snapshots of numerical results at time 0 4 and 0 56 s with mudflow at the dam break for various sediment heights the liquid column extends to the opposite wall and as can be seen from all the figures the deposition front moves more slowly than the water front figs 11 13 show that due to the presence of the mud deposit the free surface movement of the water begins to slow down and as the mud deposit height increases this movement becomes slower since the water free surface is mixed with gravity deposits and becomes more viscous this leads to a general inhibition of all impurities from the presented pressure profiles in fig 10 it can be noted that at all control points the maximum pressure value decreases due to mud deposits the decrease in pressure value is the result of a decrease in flow rate the effect of viscous clay deposition is qualitatively confirmed from the results shown in fig 10 where it could be observed a decrease in the maximum shock pressure for the p1 control point almost 2 times whereas for the p3 p5 p7 control points it can be seen that the pressure value does not change very much and for control point p3 one can notice some increase in maximum pressure value with increasing thickness of the mud deposits this phenomenon is due to the fact that the control point p3 is located higher and as can be observed from the obtained values figs 11 13 an obstacle begins to accumulate mud flow on this wall of the obstacle and accordingly when using mud deposits with a higher thickness the pressure value increased on this wall of the obstacle and becomes higher due to the presence of additional mass of mud deposits it should be noted that the first impact is the most dangerous for the integrity of the dam structure and the use of viscous grease deposits has a beneficial effect on the dam structure itself during the first impact below are the results of a dam break simulation for different heights of the moving bed from the obtained results in figs 12 and 13 it can be noted that the moving layer helps to reduce the flow velocity which in turn brings to a reduce in the pressure value on the obstacle itself regardless the moving layer presence and moving layer thickness the fluid front position is almost the identical at the initial stage of the flow when the dam destructs but then the flow mixtures with the moving layer overtime and the layer starts to influence the fluid location and produces slowdown and the process could be observed in the front part of the obstacle after t 0 56 s figs 11 13 overtime the variation between the front locations of the liquid raises until the front of the liquid touches the opposite wall to further decrease the pressure values on the obstacle surface the various forms of obstacles were used thus optimal obstacle shapes were proposed for reducing the shock pressure values issakhov et al 2018 for the 3d model the same optimal forms as in study issakhov et al 2018 obstacles with a slope of 30 and an arched obstacle with a central arc angle of 45 fig 14 were used since these forms showed the best results for reducing the impact pressure value issakhov et al 2018 xue et al 2019 fig 15 shows the pressure profiles on the p1 p3 p5 p7 pressure gauges with different forms of obstacles however in this work muddy deposits were added fig 16 shows the pressure profiles on the p1 p3 p5 p7 pressure gauges for the arched shape at different deposition heights the arched shape of the obstacle made it possible to reduce the shock pressure by almost 3 7 times as compared with the rectangular shape of the barrier issakhov et al 2018 from the obtained results in fig 16 it can be observed that under the influence of a non newtonian fluid and the optimal shape of the barrier the maximum shock pressure at point p1 was reduced more than 6 times comparing with the rectangular shape of the obstacle however it should be noted that for the remaining control points p3 p5 p7 the pressure value does not actually change the whole process of moving the immobile layer and water in case of dam break with different heights of mudflows for different times from the arched form of an obstacle is shown in figs 17 19 all the obtained values confirmed that the viscous deposits transport during dam break extremely affects the whole flow behavior because the interaction between various phases non newtonian and newtonian brings to complex flow behavior fig 20 this influence is clearly observed from fig 20 so at a mudflow height of 0 05 m it can be observed that the flow arrives with a certain delay than at the mudflow height of 0 01 m since in actual situations the flow at dam destruction did not contain only of water and frequently consists some admixtures and the admixtures perform a substantial role in overall movements by transferring the whole water volume 6 conclusions this paper presents the computational results of an incompressible dam break flow simulation consisting of three phases a phase for sediment impurity air and water the movement of the water free surface has been performed using the newtonian fluid model and the movement of mud mixture has been carried out by the non newtonian fluid model based on the vof method the relationship of pressure and speed was reached using the piso method numerical simulation of the dam break problem using the vof method has been performed in ansys fluent in order to solve the problem the standard vof model with the combination of non newtonian and newtonian models was modified verification of the numerical algorithm and mathematical model was performed on two test problems although from the obtained numerical data there is a determined discrepancy in the shock distribution of pressure with laboratory measurement values however using the model it will be probably to carry out predictive modeling with satisfactory accuracy numerical modeling displayed good coincidence with the laboratory measurement values and the values from the numerical solution of other authors in particular the global pressure trends and fluid behavior on the dam walls were well produced the modeling values provide high assurance in the effectiveness of the method this study proposes the use of modified non newtonian and newtonian models for modeling waves caused by the dam collapse above the moving bed in this case the lower moving layer was taken as a non newtonian fluid the values from the simulation are in good agreement with the measurement results the obtained results show that with the modeling it is possible to accurately predict the dynamic sediment transfer process also the calculation results are in good agreement with other numerical data it was found that the transfer of the lower layer began near the initial dam section and spread downstream and various obstacle forms at various thicknesses of the mud were considered to reduce pressure value on the dam wall it can be mentioned that arched obstacles form reduced the maximum pressure value at least 4 times this study emphasizes the importance of carrying out numerical simulation of dam failure at moving earth layers because this condition is found in natural flows in the future these computational values and estimated mudflow heights may be utilized to simulate the 3d problem with actual complex terrain when the dam is broken author contributions alibek issakhov conceived and designed the analysis contributed data

newtonian fluid vof method piso algorithm 1 introduction the dam break problem is one of the most devastating floods in the history of the modern world intensive snow melting heavy rains as well as human factors such as carelessness can lead to a dam break which in turn can lead to flooding and destruction of neighboring settlements despite the fact that there has been a lot of research on the destruction of the dam this phenomenon remains one of the most important problems in the field of hydraulic engineering because of its danger to human society therefore dam breakthrough is a classic problem of great engineering importance chanson 2006 this problem is also acute in the republic of kazakhstan there have been similar natural disasters which resulted in the death of many local residents for example in 2010 the dam break of the kyzylagash reservoir in the almaty region killed 43 people hundreds were injured about a thousand people had to be evacuated from flooded places in the summer of 1921 heavy rains fell in almaty and intensive melting of snow and glaciers began in the mountainous areas because of these natural leashes along the river small almatinka the mudflow reached actually the center of the city within 5 h a significant part of alma ata was turned into ruins and covered with a mud mass more than 500 people were killed because of such acutely pressing issues it is very important to investigate all aspects of the dam break problem the scientific value of dam breakthrough has long been recognized as an idealized problem for evaluation and testing for a number of theories and approaches both in mathematics and in physics wang et al 2000 in most past studies dam failure was considered as a collapse of water and only a few of them were in mixtures of particles with water spinewine and zech 2007 razavitoosi et al 2014 with the advancement of computing technology numerical methods have become an excellent research tool in various fields for example the popular numerical method for tracking and locating a free surface the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 based on eulerian meshes and made it possible to simulate free surface deformations using such numerical methods many works were done to describe the flow behavior after the dam was broken in paper issakhov and imanberdiyeva 2019 a realistic model of a dam break above a fixed bed with different reliefs was presented also using the vof method issakhov et al 2018 issakhov and zhandaulet 2020 dam breaks were modeled for various forms of obstacles in paper ying et al 2009 developed a reliable and accurate numerical model based on a conservative form using the finite volume method fvm on unstructured triangular grids for flows with broken sections that can flow over difficult terrain also there are studies related to the use of rans equations which include turbulence models quecedo et al 2005 shigematsu et al 2004 abdolmaleki et al 2004 an improved sph approach to solving three dimensional free surface problems was demonstrated in paper xu 2016 where three complex numerical problems were modeled 1 three dimensional dam break to a vertical wall 2 an obstacle with a cubic shape and 3 an obstacle with a cylindrical shape which compared with the available numerical data and experimental data the numerical code developed in paper celis et al 2017 based on the finite difference method fdm showed good results of destruction and splashing when the dam is broken in paper li and yu 2019 a flood wave caused by a dam break acting on the vertical lower wall of the channel which was numerically investigated using vof and ls level set models where it was shown that vof model has an excellent ability to work with interface modeling especially with the waves destruction and the deformation of the free surface with a large amplitude compared with the ls model in paper yang et al 2018 presents a complete understanding of the water flow spreading process when a dam is broken through with varied depths of water downstream above a fixed bed however it is necessary to appreciate that in actual situations the flow at a dam break cannot contains only of water and frequently consists some admixtures and solid particles stones when the dam is broken the impurities perform a very significant role since the admixture transferring will have another movement pattern in this case the admixture could be characterized as a non newtonian flow the flow can be determined as a dense fluid flow and impurities in which direct interactions between impurities are the dominant feature that defines the flow nature intense flows that arise during the dam break and often cause sediment transport and morphological evolution which in turn contributes to the change in flows interactive processes of flow sediment transport and morphological evolution are a hierarchy of considerable physical problems interest in the fields of hydraulics and geomorphology a good understanding of these processes is important not only from an application point of view but also for effective flood risk management and the environmental well being of the region frey and church 2009 the dam destruction flows above a fixed impermeable layer were investigated in papers marsooli and wu 2014 issakhov et al 2018 kleefsman et al 2005 but with intensive flows the lower layer of the flow can be mobile therefore this flow may shift or transport to this bottom layer such as sand mud clay etc the process may bring to the transportation of enormous amounts of sediment which brings to a large scale change in the downstream region morphology and dramatically increases the damage to the environment and city infrastructure also due to friction inertial effects and pulse exchanges the lower layer can significantly affect the development of the flood wave therefore it is very significant to consider the geomorphological process of destruction and transfer of lower sediments the sediment transportation could not simply be produced by the model of newtonian fluid gotoh et al 2000 consequently a non newtonian model is necessary in order to be able to simulate the stress dependent phase viscosity thus it is important to accurately simulate the geomorphological changes associated with dam break flows the flow behavior in the fixed conditions and moving layers vary considerably and tightly influence the free surface deformation and the flood wave propagation therefore it is high theoretical and practical concern to study the flow types lauber and hager 1998 janosi et al 2004 in paper papanicolaou et al 2008 provide insights into future trends and needs regarding sediment transport and hydrodynamic models at the end of the last century attention to the effects of sediments was primarily focused on quasi analytical solutions fraccarollo and capart 2002 and then using numerical models including shallow water two layer models swartenbroekx et al 2013 leal et al 2010 li et al 2013 the bilayer models have been significantly improved in terms of the sediment transport description from partial connection between sediment and flow to full connection in paper evangelista et al 2013 the computational values are compared with various sets of laboratory measurement values in fixed statements and moving layers with various materials of the layer in order to verify the accuracy of the simulation in a wide range of cases in paper marsooli and wu 2015 a model of shallow water exner representing the dam break process was used this paper analyzes the ability of the classical model of shallow water to model a complex sediment transfer process the dam break flow caused by the partial dam break in a abruptly expanded region above the moving bed is simulated in this paper the model was used to simulate two laboratory tests hosseinzadeh tabrizi and ghaeini hessaroeyeh 2018 numerical simulations have been widely used as a reliable tool for studying various dam break flows above a moving bed gu et al 2018 yu et al 2019a yu et al 2019b marsooli and wu 2015 van emelen et al 2015 the 1d shallow water equations based on the fvm was used zhang and duan 2011 the modification of the 2d shallow water equations in combination with the sediment transfer equation to study the moving layer and an unstructured finite volume algorithm was used to solve the basic equations xia et al 2010 the dam break of pure non newtonian liquids such as liquid gel and clay was investigated in papers chambon et al 2009 ancey and cochard 2009 considering non newtonian fluids really allows for a better exploration of native complex natural flows such as impurity and mudflow flows than consisting only newtonian fluids such as water in paper li and zhao 2018 a dam breakthrough was taken into account as a fracture problem for a particles and a fluid mixture which was numerically studied using the cfd dem method for two non newtonian fluids based on measurement values the simulation results were carefully compared to several control cases including a water mixture and particles a dry granular system as well as three pure liquids herschel bulkley liquid bingham liquid and water the results of this work displayed that non newtonian fluids can decrease the particles kinetic energy during early stage of disruption in paper lin and chen 2013 investigated the number of particles effect on the flows behavior and momentum on the flow structure the flow rate increased with decreasing concentration while the impulse decreased the results of this work lin and chen 2013 showed that the friction coefficient has an obvious effect on the flow however the parameters considered in this study were limited and only the forward position of the mixture flow was compared to investigate their effects in previous studies related to dam break flows the effect of the moving lower layer was not shown in detail because sediments are very viscous they can affect flow in general their coefficients of friction and elastic recovery can affect the flow behavior due to the interaction between the fluids the focus of this work is on the dam destruction consisting of mud and water which is a non newtonian fluid coussot 1995 mudflow frequently happens after soil saturation due to rapid snow melt or due to rainfall the debris and mud flows occur on mountainous or steep slope regions detailed flow control permits us to distinguish three various wave development stages the transport phase the decline phase and the inertia phase hogg and pritchard 2004 hogg and woods 2001 at each of three stages various physical mechanisms dominate at various times based on a numerical approach this study aims to provide new results of numerical calculation of pressure peaks value during a dam break taking into account the mud flow more specifically this paper discusses the value of maximum pressure relative to different forms of obstacles numerical simulation was performed using vof using the ansys fluent 2 mathematical model in this study it was considered an incompressible flow consisting of three phases the

equations are sampled on a fixed cartesian grid using the fvm approximation for spatial discretization second order upwind was used whereas for temporal order first order the piso algorithm pressure implicit with splitting of operators was used as a numerical method for solving the navier stokes equation issa 1986 issakhov 2015a b issakhov 2015 2015 2016 issakhov and mashenkova 2019 this is an expansion of the simple algorithm used to solve the navier stokes equation issakhov and omarova 2020 issakhov and zhandaulet 2019 the piso algorithm is a procedure for finding the pressure and velocity for the rans equations which was firstly designed for non iterative computation of an unsteady compressible flow but also was successfully adjusted to steady problem the piso algorithm contains overall three stages first prediction stage and other two corrector stages and is constructed to supply mass conservation using predictor corrector stages 4 verification of the mathematical model 4 1 problem 1 the initial stage of the dam break the study of the flow impact was carried out taking into account the dam break in which the water flow column created by the destruction of the dam faces a vertical obstacle therefore improving the description of this particular flow of exposure is of great interest for verification of the 3d model it was used experimental dam break data from the marin netherlands marine research institute kleefsman et al 2005 this measurement could be considered as a simple model of water flow the geometry of the experiment is shown in fig 1 a large tank 3 22 0 993 1 0 m is used with an open roof in one part of the tank water with a volume of 0 67 m3 is held by the shutter when the shutter instantly rises by releasing a mass a water flow is created that moves due to gravitational forces a box representing a scale model of an obstacle with a size of 0 403 0 161 0 161 m was located in the tank the obstacle was covered with pressure sensors p1 p3 p5 p7 and two water level detectors h2 h4 the interaction of intensive water flows with the structure is a key problem in hydraulic oceanic and coastal construction this interaction is presented in fig 2 which includes a very fast impulsive force i e a stroke followed by a more stationary stage the obtained computational values from the vof model as shown in fig 3 the obtained computational values from the developed model show acceptable accuracy compared with experimental data fig 4 shows snapshots of numerical results for the total flow at time points of 0 4 and 0 56 s compared with experimental values kleefsman et al 2005 an unstructured mesh was used to modeling the test problem for numerical study a computational grid with a size of 563 932 was applied and the maximum and minimum cell sizes are 0 035 m and 0 0035 m respectively fig 1 for test problem the following types of boundary conditions were used for right left front back bottom and obstacle faces walls for top face pressure outlet moreover fig 2a shows the computational values of pressure distributions compared with the data from the laboratory measurement kleefsman et al 2005 for various computational grid sizes at point p1 as could be observed from the figure by using a different computational grid sizes min 5 mm and max 50 mm min 2 mm and max 20 mm min 1 5 mm and max 20 mm min 3 5 mm and max 35 mm the pressure distribution fully characterizes the experimental values but the first pressure peak value is not faithfully simulated only by using a mesh size min 3 5 mm and max 35 mm the pressure distribution fully characterizes the measurement and adequately simulates the pressure peak as can be displayed from fig 2 at the moment when the wave hits an obstacle the pressure distribution on the surface of this obstacle is well described using modeling this figure shows the pressure distribution at points p1 and p3 at the box front as well as at the box top at points p5 and p7 the positions of the detectors are marked in fig 1 the shock pressure magnitude is the same for both the values from the simulation and the measurement values at point p1 the lowest point on the box kleefsman et al 2005 at the moment when the backward wave hits the obstacle again approximately 4 7 s it is also well described using modeling fig 2 in the lower part of fig 2 where diagrams of pressure distribution over time are shown in the upper part of the box there is a clear variation between the computational results of simulation and measurement values kleefsman et al 2005 this anomalous pressure distribution appears each times in the form of bursts which can be seen at all control points p1 p3 p5 p7 fig 2 at the identical moment approximately 1 3 s the appearance of the pressure peaks is due to the fact that small droplets of water after a given impact on an obstacle fall into empty computational cells cells which are not filled with liquid that are completely surrounded by cells filled with a liquid and the empty computational cells cells which are not filled with liquid change to cells with a liquid in one time interval this intermittent change brings to the appearance of an anomalous peak pressure value in the whole pressure field from this figure it could be noticed that there is a well match between the simulation snapshots and the measurement snapshots when the water falls into the box for the first time at 0 4 s in the second figure the measurement values and computational values are presented for 0 56 s from this picture it can be illustrated the shape of the water free surface which goes around an obstacle and goes a little forward the simulation vales are in well convention with measurement data kleefsman et al 2005 the global water behavior is the same and the impact peak of pressure is in well coincidence particularly in the lower part of the obstacle 4 2 problem 2 the dam break flow above the movable layer of sediment in order to verify the proposed model in this section the model was applied to the control test of the dam break flow above the moving sediment layer the laboratory measurement spinewine and zech 2007 included a water tank separated by valves in the middle and the bottom of the tank is covered with a layer of mobile sediments the experimental area has a height of 0 7 m and a total length of 6 m that is 3 0 m on both sides of the central gate simulating an idealized dam the width of the channel was set to 25 cm along the entire length of the channel the water depth of this experiment is 35 cm as shown in fig 5 in this measurement homogeneous coarse sand with a density of 2683 kg m3 and polyvinyl chloride with a density of 1580 kg m3 were used as the bottom layer 4 2 1 numerical setup a structured mesh was used to modeling the test problem for computational simulation a computational grid with a size of 60 000 has been used and uniform quadrilateral the cell sizes have been 0 01 m for test problem the following types of boundary conditions were used for right left bottom faces walls for top face pressure outlet 4 2 2 grid independence study fig 7 a b c shows the computational values of free surface profiles compared with the measurement data spinewine and zech 2007 for various computational grid sizes at various times t 0 25 0 5 0 75 s as could be observed from the figure by using a different computational grid sizes h 0 02 m h 0 01 m and h 0 005 m the free surface profiles completely characterizes the experimental values only by using a mesh size h 0 01 m the free surface profiles completely characterizes the measurement and adequately simulates the flow characteristics 4 2 3 numerical results from the simulation snapshots of fig 6 it could be concluded that a significant amount of precipitation is being destroyed by the dam break flow this in turn leads to sediment loss changing the flow depth ultimately in the viscous phase the flow becomes dominant and is slowed down by friction due to the presence of coarse sand the flow at breakthrough slows down and leads to sediment transport and decreases also the proposed model has been compared with the results of other authors ran et al 2015 moreover fig 6 shows the simulation and experiment images spinewine and zech 2007 when a dam is broken through with geomorphological changes at various points t 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 s comparisons in fig 7 showed that the calculated free surface profiles are in good coincidence with the measurement values spinewine and zech 2007 and the computational values of other authors ran et al 2015 and the anomalous sawtooth forms appearance was caused to the circumstance that during the water interface movement air bubbles form in the water and applied the computational method did not manage with an unoccupied isolated cell which was surrounded by water cells the air bubbles themselves take place by the progressing wave impacts the front part of the dam walls and starts to lifting and when the water goes down into the dam walls isolated and empty cells are formed in general in fig 8 from the obtained results it can be seen that the observed flood wave differs from typical dam failure waves over fixed beds showing that the very presence of a moving bed greatly affects the transport of water flow the results showed that obtained profiles of the free surface during the dam break flow above the moving bed softens the fall of the water column compared to the dam break flow above the fixed rigid layer this is due to the fact that the transfer process of the lower layer reduces the energy flow thus the presence of a moving layer increased the area of the buffer zone and consequently reduced the flow rate 5 numerical study of dam breaks with mudflow for various forms of obstacle to estimate the pressure distribution on the surface of a dam with mudflow during a dam break a moving mud layer was added to the second measurement kleefsman et al 2005 as shown in fig 9 the moving layer consisted of homogeneous sand with a density of 2683 kg m3 in our model the sediment phase was referred as a non newtonian fluid the effective viscosity for a non newtonian fluid was defined by using equation 7 fig 9 shows that the three dimensional computing area consists of length width and height with dimensions of 3 22 m 0 993 m 1 0 m as in the second experiment the original water column is formed with a length width and height with dimensions of 1 228 m 0 993 m 0 55 m respectively a moving layer with different heights 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 05 m is laid between the water column and the obstacle which has a size of 1 167 m the air occupies the remaining space fig 10 shows the pressure distribution profiles on pressure gauges p1 p3 p5 p7 of the obstacle surface with mud flow during the dam break for various deposition heights for this model figs 11 13 are represented by snapshots of numerical results at time 0 4 and 0 56 s with mudflow at the dam break for various sediment heights the liquid column extends to the opposite wall and as can be seen from all the figures the deposition front moves more slowly than the water front figs 11 13 show that due to the presence of the mud deposit the free surface movement of the water begins to slow down and as the mud deposit height increases this movement becomes slower since the water free surface is mixed with gravity deposits and becomes more viscous this leads to a general inhibition of all impurities from the presented pressure profiles in fig 10 it can be noted that at all control points the maximum pressure value decreases due to mud deposits the decrease in pressure value is the result of a decrease in flow rate the effect of viscous clay deposition is qualitatively confirmed from the results shown in fig 10 where it could be observed a decrease in the maximum shock pressure for the p1 control point almost 2 times whereas for the p3 p5 p7 control points it can be seen that the pressure value does not change very much and for control point p3 one can notice some increase in maximum pressure value with increasing thickness of the mud deposits this phenomenon is due to the fact that the control point p3 is located higher and as can be observed from the obtained values figs 11 13 an obstacle begins to accumulate mud flow on this wall of the obstacle and accordingly when using mud deposits with a higher thickness the pressure value increased on this wall of the obstacle and becomes higher due to the presence of additional mass of mud deposits it should be noted that the first impact is the most dangerous for the integrity of the dam structure and the use of viscous grease deposits has a beneficial effect on the dam structure itself during the first impact below are the results of a dam break simulation for different heights of the moving bed from the obtained results in figs 12 and 13 it can be noted that the moving layer helps to reduce the flow velocity which in turn brings to a reduce in the pressure value on the obstacle itself regardless the moving layer presence and moving layer thickness the fluid front position is almost the identical at the initial stage of the flow when the dam destructs but then the flow mixtures with the moving layer overtime and the layer starts to influence the fluid location and produces slowdown and the process could be observed in the front part of the obstacle after t 0 56 s figs 11 13 overtime the variation between the front locations of the liquid raises until the front of the liquid touches the opposite wall to further decrease the pressure values on the obstacle surface the various forms of obstacles were used thus optimal obstacle shapes were proposed for reducing the shock pressure values issakhov et al 2018 for the 3d model the same optimal forms as in study issakhov et al 2018 obstacles with a slope of 30 and an arched obstacle with a central arc angle of 45 fig 14 were used since these forms showed the best results for reducing the impact pressure value issakhov et al 2018 xue et al 2019 fig 15 shows the pressure profiles on the p1 p3 p5 p7 pressure gauges with different forms of obstacles however in this work muddy deposits were added fig 16 shows the pressure profiles on the p1 p3 p5 p7 pressure gauges for the arched shape at different deposition heights the arched shape of the obstacle made it possible to reduce the shock pressure by almost 3 7 times as compared with the rectangular shape of the barrier issakhov et al 2018 from the obtained results in fig 16 it can be observed that under the influence of a non newtonian fluid and the optimal shape of the barrier the maximum shock pressure at point p1 was reduced more than 6 times comparing with the rectangular shape of the obstacle however it should be noted that for the remaining control points p3 p5 p7 the pressure value does not actually change the whole process of moving the immobile layer and water in case of dam break with different heights of mudflows for different times from the arched form of an obstacle is shown in figs 17 19 all the obtained values confirmed that the viscous deposits transport during dam break extremely affects the whole flow behavior because the interaction between various phases non newtonian and newtonian brings to complex flow behavior fig 20 this influence is clearly observed from fig 20 so at a mudflow height of 0 05 m it can be observed that the flow arrives with a certain delay than at the mudflow height of 0 01 m since in actual situations the flow at dam destruction did not contain only of water and frequently consists some admixtures and the admixtures perform a substantial role in overall movements by transferring the whole water volume 6 conclusions this paper presents the computational results of an incompressible dam break flow simulation consisting of three phases a phase for sediment impurity air and water the movement of the water free surface has been performed using the newtonian fluid model and the movement of mud mixture has been carried out by the non newtonian fluid model based on the vof method the relationship of pressure and speed was reached using the piso method numerical simulation of the dam break problem using the vof method has been performed in ansys fluent in order to solve the problem the standard vof model with the combination of non newtonian and newtonian models was modified verification of the numerical algorithm and mathematical model was performed on two test problems although from the obtained numerical data there is a determined discrepancy in the shock distribution of pressure with laboratory measurement values however using the model it will be probably to carry out predictive modeling with satisfactory accuracy numerical modeling displayed good coincidence with the laboratory measurement values and the values from the numerical solution of other authors in particular the global pressure trends and fluid behavior on the dam walls were well produced the modeling values provide high assurance in the effectiveness of the method this study proposes the use of modified non newtonian and newtonian models for modeling waves caused by the dam collapse above the moving bed in this case the lower moving layer was taken as a non newtonian fluid the values from the simulation are in good agreement with the measurement results the obtained results show that with the modeling it is possible to accurately predict the dynamic sediment transfer process also the calculation results are in good agreement with other numerical data it was found that the transfer of the lower layer began near the initial dam section and spread downstream and various obstacle forms at various thicknesses of the mud were considered to reduce pressure value on the dam wall it can be mentioned that arched obstacles form reduced the maximum pressure value at least 4 times this study emphasizes the importance of carrying out numerical simulation of dam failure at moving earth layers because this condition is found in natural flows in the future these computational values and estimated mudflow heights may be utilized to simulate the 3d problem with actual complex terrain when the dam is broken author contributions alibek issakhov conceived and designed the analysis contributed data

application are draw keywords bragg scattering perforated semi circular bar multipole expansions quadratic pressure drop condition reflection coefficient transmission coefficient energy loss coefficient 1 introduction breakwaters have been widely used to protect shorelines harbors and human activities recently submerged breakwaters become increasingly favorable in the practical engineering as the considerable merits of reflecting effectively incident wave energy not affecting water circulation and coastal landscape and sometimes providing fishes sheltering habitat when water waves from offshore obliquely propagate over the submerged breakwater system consisting of a series of equally spaced identical structures a strong wave reflection will be yielded when the relation of k x d nπ k x denotes the component of the wave number along the direction perpendicular to the breakwater d denotes the structure spacing and n denotes an arbitrary positive integer is satisfied the notable phenomenon is the so called bragg reflection and the mechanism is due to the constructive interference of reflected waves from successive structure crests a large volume of work has been undertaken for bragg reflection of water waves propagating over periodic structures the objectives mainly covered natural sandbars or seabed in early studies heathershaw 1982 and davies and heathershaw 1984 examined bragg reflection of surface waves propagating over periodically varying sandbars through experimental tests mei 1985 and hara and mei 1987 performed respectively theoretical analysis and experimental tests for bragg reflection of waves by periodic bars mei et al 1988 further analyzed the mechanism for bragg reflection of obliquely incident waves by a series of sandbars kirby 1986 studied bragg reflection of water waves propagating over a rippled seabed by extending the reduced wave equation of berkhoff subsequently bragg reflection of water waves was extended to other periodic structures mattioli 1990 reported the resonant reflection of water waves by a series of submerged rectangular bars hsu et al 2003 developed a numerical model for bragg scattering of water waves by multiple composite artificial bars based on the mild slope equation cho et al 2004 carried out a series of experimental tests for the reflection of regular waves over rectangular or trapezoidal submerged breakwaters and they indicated that the submerged breakwaters with the trapezoidal shape could perform better in term of reflecting wave energy linton 2011 developed analytical solutions for bragg resonance reflections of normally and obliquely incident waves by an arrays of horizontal cylinders in deep water by using the multipole expansion method liu et al 2016 developed analytical solutions to bragg reflections of normally and obliquely incident waves by submerged multiple impermeable semi circular bars and their analytical models have been proved to be reasonable through experimental tests based on the modified mild slope equation liu et al 2019 developed an analytical solution to bragg resonance of surface waves by periodic sinusoidal ripples and the analytical solution was validated by various results in literature note that the structures in above studies were impermeable and only the reflection coefficient were concerned actually a high reflection coefficient usually means that the transmission coefficient is low in the case of impermeable structures on the other hand bragg reflection may occur in the interaction between water waves and a periodic porous perforated structure system when waves propagate over such a structure system a part of incident wave energy will be dissipated mase et al 1995 investigated the effect of the permeability of rippled beds on bragg reflection of surface waves ting et al 2000 further considered the effect of current on bragg reflection of surface waves over permeable rippled beds twu and liu 2004 studied wave interaction with a periodic array of porous breakwaters on basis of the porous medium theory of sollitt and cross 1972 and they indicated that bragg reflection occurs in a porous breakwater system as that in an impermeable breakwater system based on the method of perturbation analysis martha et al 2007 studied the oblique wave reflection and transmission by a small undulant porous seabed zhang et al 2012 simulated bragg reflection of water waves by multiple submerged permeable trapezoidal breakwaters placed on a porous seabed in a numerical wave tank different from the rigid porous perforated structures lan et al 2011 developed analytical solutions to bragg scattering of water waves propagating over a series of submerged porous elastic rectangular bars using the matched eigenfunction expansion method and they validated the analytical model through experimental tests karmakar and guedes soares 2014 developed linear analytical solutions to bragg reflection of water waves by multiple bottom standing perforated vertical elastic thin plates in this paper bragg scattering of surface waves by multiple submerged perforated semi circular breakwaters bars will be examined the first semi circular breakwater was built at miyazaki port japan in early 1990s tanimoto and takahashi 1994 aburatani et al 1996 subsequently semi circular breakwaters have been often used in practical engineering zhang et al 2005 liu and li 2013 due to the outstanding advantages summarized by xie 1999 as following high stability against sliding almost zero overturning moment acting on them as the hydrodynamic pressure on the structure surfaces passes through the circle s center light deadweight which is suitable for a soft soil foundation and convenience for construction and removal studies on the hydrodynamic performance of the semi circular breakwaters have been carried out by many researchers e g sundar and ragu 1998 xie 1999 yuan and tao 2003 liu and li 2012 2013 koley and sahoo 2017 liu et al 2016 have checked the sheltering function of bragg reflection breakwater consisting of multiple submerged semi circular bars and presented some useful results for engineering design however they only considered impermeable semi circular structures which may not effectively dissipate incident wave energy in practice on the other hand liu and li 2012 2013 have indicated that perforating the semi circular bar can effectively dissipate the incident wave energy and then reduced both the reflection and transmission coefficients moreover the stability of the breakwater may be enhanced as the wave forces acting on the perforated bar are considerably reduced therefore the objective of this paper is to examine the water wave interaction with multiple submerged perforated semi circular bars through the theoretical and experimental methods and present valuable guidance for engineering application analytical solutions for the bragg scattering problem will be developed where the quadratic pressure drop condition molin 1992 molin and remy 2015 is imposed on the perforated semi circular arc to model the wave energy dissipation and the phase shift due to perforated arcs after using such a porous boundary condition the effect of the incident wave height on the wave energy dissipation is directly incorporated into the mathematical model the boundary

formulations water wave interaction with multiple perforated semi circular breakwaters bars submerged in ocean with constant depth h is considered as shown in fig 1 a global cartesian coordinate system with the original fixed on the still water surface and the x axis pointing the right hand side and the z axis taking vertically upwards is defined for the mathematical description there are total m perforated bars and the radius of bar q is a q q 1 2 m a q h the center of bar q is located at x q h the local pole coordinate system about the center of bar q is defined by x x q r q sin θ q and z h r q cos θ q the spacing between the centers of adjacent bars is d q x q 1 x q q 1 2 m 1 the length of each bar in the y direction is much larger than the incident wavelength and then it is assumed to be infinity the direction of incident wave with respect to the bars is denoted by angle β 0 β 90 measured from the positive x axis such that β 0 denotes the normally incident waves and β 90 corresponds to waves propagating in line with the direction of the bars the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and its motion is irrotational when the incident wave with angular frequency ω propagates a fluid velocity potential φ x y z t can be used to describe the whole fluid motion for obliquely incident wave the velocity potential can be further written as 1 φ x y z t re ϕ

and k is the positive real root of 2 k ω 2 g k tanh k h the velocity potential φ x y z t satisfies laplace equation substituting eq 1 into laplace equation yields the modified helmholtz equation for the reduced spatial velocity potential 3 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ z 2 k y 2 ϕ 0 for the linear water wave scattering problem the velocity potential satisfies the following boundary conditions on the free surface

velocity potential has the form of 8 ϕ i g h 2 ω e i k x x r e i k x x z 0 z x t e i k x x z 0 z x where r and t are respectively the unknown complex coefficients associated with the reflected and transmitted waves the semi circular arc s thickness is assumed to be zero as it is very small compared with the bar s radius and the incident wavelength then the whole fluid domain is divided into m 1 regions region 0 the exterior common fluid domain outside all the perforated bars and region q q 1 2 m the interior fluid domain of bar q on the surface of perforated bar q the velocity potential

the discharge coefficient molin 1992 and c q is the blockage coefficient of the perforated plate arc tuck 1975 suh et al 2002 it should be mentioned that the first and second parts on the right side of eq 10 denote the energy dissipation effect and the inertial effect of the perforated plate arc respectively for practical application of eq 10 the discharge coefficient and the blockage coefficient must be known a priori generally the discharge coefficient needs to be determined by experimental tests which will be detailed in section 6 4 the blockage coefficient can be empirically determined by suh et al 2011 huang et al 2011 11 c q b q 2 ε q where b q is the thickness of the q th semi circular arc note that the arc s thickness is used only for determining the blockage coefficient when considering water wave scattering by the whole breakwater system the arc s thickness is still assumed to be zero the preceding equations 3 6 9 and 10 formulate a closed boundary value problem for water wave scattering by multiple submerged perforated semi circular bars in the following section we will develop analytical solutions to the boundary value problem using the multipole expansion

bars were carried out in the wave flume of shandong provincial key laboratory of ocean engineering ocean university of china the length width and depth of the wave flume were 60 0 m 3 0 m and 1 5 m respectively a piston type wave maker was equipped to generate the target waves at one side of the wave flume and a dissipative slope was placed to eliminate the wave energy at the opposite of the wave flume the wave flume was divided into two channels with 2 2 m wide and 0 8 wide by a thin glass wall and all the perforated bars were fixed by iron frames in the 0 8 m wide channel the edges of the iron frames were very narrow so that their effect on the wave propagation could be ignored fig 2 shows pictures of three submerged perforated semi circular bars in the wave flume the perforated bars were made of stainless steel with the thickness of 2 mm and the surfaces were uniformly punched with circular holes with the diameter of 3 cm the sketch for the arrangement of the holes on the bar surface is shown in fig 3 the first bar was fixed at the distance of 30 m from the wave maker and the other 2 bars were successively installed behind the first one along the wave flume the spacings between the centers of adjacent bars were d 1 3 m more details on experimental setup in the wave flume for 3 bars are presented in fig 4 in the experiments the water depth h was 0 4 m or 0 5

l 0 01 l is the incident wavelength all the experimental cases and conditions are listed in table 1 several capacitive type wave gauges were used to measure the time series of free surface elevations no 2 gauge was fixed at the distance of 3 5 m before the center of bar 1 the position of no 1 gauge was adjusted to make the spacing between nos 1 and 2 gauges always equal to l 4 for different incident waves nos 3 and 4 gauges were placed at the middle positions of adjacent bars respectively no 5 gauge was placed at a distance of 3 5 m away from the center of the last bar i e bar 3 in fig 3 in the tests for two perforated bars no 4 gauge and bar 3 were removed from the wave flume and no 5 gauge was moved to the position at a distance of 3 5 m away from the center of bar 2 all the free surface elevations were recorded by the wave gauges with fixed sampling frequency of 50 hz typical time series of free surface elevations are presented in fig 5 the incident and reflected wave heights were obtained using the method of goda and suzuki 1976 based on the stable surface elevations between t 1 and t 2 recorded by nos 1 and 2 gauges as shown in fig 5 whilst the transmitted wave heights was statistically calculated by the zero up cross analysis method based on the stable surface elevations between t 3 and t 4 recorded by no 5 gauge then the reflection and transmission coefficients were determined in the tests each case was repeated at least three times and the average values were taken as the results of reflection and transmission coefficients 6 validations of analytical solutions 6 1 convergence examination to check the convergence of the present analytical solutions we calculate the transmission coefficient c t of the breakwaters at different truncated numbers n and list the results in tables 2 and 3 three perforated semi circular bars are examined and normally incident waves and obliquely incident waves with β 45 are considered the calculation conditions are a 1 0 6h a 2 0 7h a 3 0 8h d 1 3h d 2 4h ε 1 0 2 ε 2 0 15 ε 3 0 1 μ p 0 7 p 1 3 b p 0 02h p 1 3 and h l 0 01 it is observed from tables 2 and 3 that the convergence of the analytical solutions is very rapid and a truncated number n 6 can guarantee the calculated results with three figure accuracy which is sufficient to practical engineering analysis thus n 6 will be used in the subsequent calculation examples 6 2 comparison with multi domain bem solutions we have also solved the present boundary value problem using the independently developed multi domain boundary element method bem codes liu and li 2017 li et al 2019 fig 6 shows the comparison between the analytical solutions and the multi domain bem solutions in the calculations three perforated bars with different radii a 1 0 6h a 2 0 7h and a 3 0 8h are considered and the other calculation parameters are d 1 d 2 3h ε p 0 1 p 1 3 μ p 0 7 p 1 3 b p 0 02h p 1 3 and h l 0 01 the lines and dots in fig 6 denote the results of the analytical solutions and the multi bem solutions respectively excellent agreement between the results by two different solutions can be observed from the figure it should be mentioned that although the calculation results of both two different solutions are consistent the analytical solutions have the following merits the analytical solutions directly give the expression of the velocity potential and can provide better scientific insight in the present physical problem however the multi domain bem numerical solutions only give a series of discrete calculation results for the velocity potential and its normal derivative on the boundary of the fluid domain as the boundary needs to be discretized in the solving procedure in addition the analytical solutions have the advantages of higher computational efficiency and more accurate calculation results compared with the multi domain bem solutions in addition a very small incident angle was also used in the obliquely incident wave solution in section 3 1 it turned out that the calculated results of the reflection and transmission coefficients were almost the same as those by the normally incident wave solution in section 3 2 moreover the blockage coefficient of c 0 and an extremely small porosity of ε 10 6 were used in the calculation examples and the results of reflection and transmission coefficients were the same as those of multiple impermeable semi circular bars in liu et al 2016 6 3 comparison with wide spacing approximations the reflection and transmission coefficients c r and c t calculated by the analytical solutions and the wide spacing approximations are compared and the typical results are shown in fig 7 in this figure we consider 4 bars with different radii a 1 0 5h a 2 0 6h a 3 0 7h and a 4 0 8h and different porosities ε 1 0 2 ε 2 0 15 ε 3 0 1 and ε 4 0 05 the uniform discharge coefficient of μ 0 7 and the uniform thickness of the semi circular arc of b 0 02h are used in the calculations all the spacings between adjacent bars centers are d 5h the smallest spacing between the adjacent foot edges of bars is 3 5h the wave steepness of h l 0 01 is used the normally incident waves with β 0 and obliquely incident waves with β 45 are examined it is observed from fig 7 that in the wide spacing approximation the value of c r is usually slightly overestimated especially the peak of c r and the corresponding value of c t may be underestimated we have also developed analytical solutions and wide spacing approximations for the present physical problem by imposing a linear pressure drop condition yu 1995 on the perforated semi circular arcs and we have found that for the same cases in fig 7 while with the linear pressure loss conditions the results by the wide spacing approximations and the analytical solutions agreed excellently as the bar spacings were wide enough thus the slight discrepancy of results by the wide spacing approximations is due to the quadratic pressure loss boundary condition in eq 10 strictly speaking the wide spacing approximations are indeed inappropriate after using the nonlinear pressure loss boundary condition but considering the slight difference this powerful and simplified approximation may be still taken as a rapid approach in terms of engineering analysis 6 4 comparison with experimental results in the analytical solutions the blockage coefficient c and the discharge coefficient μ of the perforated semi circular arc see eq 10 are vital for giving reasonable predictions of the reflection transmission and energy loss coefficients the blockage coefficient c is determined by eq 11 and thus the value of c 0 01 m was used in this section for a flat perforated plate the discharge coefficient of μ 0 3 0 4 for the porosity of ε 0 5 was recommended by molin 2011 for perforated caissons the discharge coefficient of μ 0 4 for the fully perforated caissons and μ 0 7 for partially perforated caissons were recommend by liu and li 2017 but for the semi circular perforated arc plate the recommended values of discharge coefficient were lack in literature therefore we carry out experimental tests to calibrate the discharge coefficient and validate the present analytical solutions after a series of repeated trial calculations we found that using the discharge coefficient of μ 0 7 could give reasonable calculation results compared with the experimental data figs 8 and 9 present the comparisons between the reflection and transmission coefficients calculated by analytical solutions and those measured in the experimental tests where μ 0 7 was adopted in the analytical solutions the lines denote the results calculated by the analytical solutions whilst the dots denote the results measured in experiments it is observed from figs 8 and 9 that the overall agreement between the analytical solutions and the experimental data is reasonable we also found that the value of μ varying from 0 7 to 0 9 had no apparent effect on the calculation results the values of μ 0 7 is recommended for the perorated semi circular plate arc and is used in the subsequent calculation examples 7 calculation examples with discussions in this section we present calculation examples to investigate the effects of various parameters on the reflection transmission and energy loss coefficients c r c t and c l of multiple submerged perforated semi circular breakwaters we only consider uniform perforated bars and bar spacing unless otherwise noted the uniform bar radius bar spacing bar porosity bar thickness and discharge coefficient are denoted by a d ε b and μ respectively the discharge coefficient is fixed at μ 0 7 according to section 6 4 the bar thickness is fixed at b 0 02h and the wave steepness is fixed at h l 0 01 fig 10 shows the differences of c r c t and c l between the perforated breakwaters with ε 0 1 and the impermeable breakwaters with ε 0 the impermeable semi circular breakwaters have been examined in the previous study liu et al 2016 in fig 10 three uniform perforated semi circular bars with radius a 0 6h are considered the bar spacing is fixed at d 4h and normal waves with β 0 and oblique waves with β 45 are examined notable differences of c r c t and c l between the perforated breakwaters and impermeable breakwaters are observed from fig 10 the resonant reflection coefficient of the perforated breakwaters is smaller which is beneficial for suppressing the seabed scour in front of the seaside semi circular bar it is seen from fig 10 that the transmission coefficient of the perforated breakwaters is always smaller than that of the impermeable ones this is due to the fact that quite a part of wave energy is dissipated when water wave passes through the perforated semi circular arcs as shown in the figure note that the curve of the energy loss coefficient for the impermeable breakwaters is not plotted as no wave energy is dissipated in the context of potential theory these results indicate that compared with the impermeable breakwaters the perforated ones can provide better protection for the leeside region thus perforating the surfaces of the bars is sensible in the design of submerged semi circular breakwaters comparing fig 10 a and b the resonant reflection coefficient of the breakwaters at β 45 is smaller than that for normal waves the variations of c r c t and c l with kh at different bar number m 2 3 5 and 10 are shown in figs 11 and 12 the calculation conditions are a 0 6h d 4h ε 0 1 β 0 and 45 for comparison the calculation results for one single bar are also plotted in the figures it is observed from fig 11 a that the resonant reflection coefficient significantly increases with the increasing bar number while the corresponding bandwidth which was defined by bailard et al 1992 as the width of the principal wave reflection peak at the half value of the peak reflection coefficient decreases a similar phenomenon has been observed by liu et al 2016 for bragg reflection of multiple impermeable semi circular bars actually this is also the common feature of wave reflection by periodic structures linton 2011 fig 1 we also note from fig 11 a that increasing the bar number has slight effect on the frequency corresponding to the peak value of the reflection coefficient in addition increasing the bar number yields a lower transmission coefficient as shown in fig 11 b we also examined the results for larger bar number and found the further decreasing of transmission coefficient still exists but not such significant in practical application the engineering cost becomes higher for more bars from fig 11 c the energy loss coefficient of the breakwaters significantly increases with the increasing bar number in the whole frequency range which is in line with physical nature by observing fig 11 a and b the frequency corresponding to the minimum of the transmission coefficient is slightly less than the resonant reflection frequency which differs from the result that the transmission coefficient of impermeable structures attains its minimum at resonant reflection frequency this should be the contribution of wave energy dissipation caused by the perforated arcs as this phenomenon still existed when the inertial effect in eq 10 was not considered i e the blockage coefficient of c 0 similar phenomena as normal waves can be also observed in fig 12 for oblique waves figs 13 and 14 present the variations of c r c t and c l with kh at different bar spacing d three bars with uniform radius a 0 6h and three different bar spacings d 2h 4h and 6h are examined the other calculation conditions are the same as those used in figs 11 and 12 it is observed from fig 13 a that with the increasing bar spacing from 2h to 6h more peaks of reflection coefficient occur within the same frequency range this phenomenon for reflection coefficient can be also concluded from an approximated relation of k h n π cos β d h n 1 2 karmakar and guedes soares 2014 which is actually the bragg s law as presented in fig 13 a the first resonant reflection coefficient according to the approximated bragg s law in the case of d 6h is largest which differs from the results that the second one is largest for multiple impermeable semi circular bars liu et al 2016 under same conditions the difference is caused by the existence of the wave energy dissipation for perforated bars it is noted from fig 13 b and c that the transmission coefficient and the energy loss coefficient c t and c l in the cases of the large values d 4h and 6h slightly oscillate when the value of kh varies from 0 25 to 1 5 in addition the effect of the bar spacing on the transmission coefficient and the energy loss coefficient can be negligible for large values of kh short waves all the similar results for oblique waves can be obtained from fig 14 effects of the bar radius on c r c t and c l are presented in figs 15 and 16 in these figures three uniform bars with four different bar radii a 0 3h 0 5h 0 6h and 0 7h are checked the other calculation conditions are the same as those used in figs 13 and 14 it is observed from fig 15 a that when the bar radius increases the resonant reflection coefficient increases significantly and the corresponding frequency decreases slightly increasing the bar radius can considerably reduce the transmission coefficient for a fixed incident wave frequency as shown in fig 15 b it is observed from fig 15 c that more incident wave energy can be dissipated by increasing the bar radius it is evident that the breakwaters with a larger radius can provide better sheltering lower transmission coefficient for leeside region similar phenomena for the transmission coefficient and the energy loss coefficient can be observed for oblique waves in fig 16 however it is surprising that for oblique waves with β 45 in fig 16 a the resonant reflection coefficient for a 0 7h c r 0 172 at kh 0 89 is slightly less than that for a 0 6h c r 0 182 at kh 0 96 fig 17 gives the variations of c r c t and c l with kh at different wave incident angle β 0 30 45 60 and 75 it is observed from fig 17 a that when the value of β increases from 0 to 60 the resonant reflection occurs at a larger frequency and the corresponding reflection coefficient significantly decreases the sheltering function of the breakwaters for normal waves is better than that for oblique waves with β 60 at 0 25 kh 1 5 as shown in fig 17 b notably the sheltering function of the breakwaters at β 75 is very good for short incident waves kh 2 0 however the practical interest is low as a very large incident wave angle of β 75 may be unlikely for breakwaters in practical engineering 8 conclusions based on potential theory this study has developed analytical solutions for bragg scattering of water waves by a series of submerged perforated semi circular breakwaters using the multipole expansions combined with the shift of polar coordinates and the separation of variables a quadratic pressure drop condition on the perforated semi circular arc has been employed to model the wave energy dissipation in the analytical solutions the normally incident and obliquely incident waves have been independently considered the calculation methods of the reflection transmission and energy loss coefficients have been presented the convergence of the analytical solutions was rapid and the agreement between the analytical solutions and the multi domain bem was excellent the analytical solutions have been compared with the wide spacing approximations which only needed the analytical solutions of a single bar there were slight difference between the results by the wide spacing approximations and the analytical solutions in spite of the enough large bar spacing this was caused by the nonlinear pressure drop boundary condition imposed on the perforated semi circular arcs laboratory experiments have been performed to measure the reflection and transmission coefficients of two and three submerged perforated bars with uniform spacing according to the comparison between the analytical solutions and experimental data the discharge coefficient of μ 0 7 was recommended for the perforated semi circular arc plate the calculated reflection and transmission coefficients agreed reasonably with the experimental data calculation examples have been presented to examine the effects of various parameters on the bragg scattering of water waves by the breakwaters main results are drawn as following 1 the present perforated breakwaters with a suitable porosity had a better sheltering function a lower transmission coefficient compared with the impermeable ones the resonant reflection coefficient of the perforated breakwaters was smaller than that of the impermeable ones the perforated breakwaters could effectively dissipate the incident wave energy 2 the frequency corresponding to the minimum transmission coefficient was slightly less than the resonant reflection frequency which differed from the result that the transmission coefficient of impermeable bars attained the minimum at resonant reflection frequency 3 increasing the bar number led to the increase of the resonant reflection coefficient and the decrease of the corresponding bandwidth increasing the bar radius led to the decrease of the resonant reflection frequency increasing both the bar number and radius led to the decrease of the transmission coefficient and the increase of the energy loss coefficient 4 increasing the bar spacing led to the increase of resonant reflection frequency in the case of short waves the transmission coefficient and the energy loss coefficient were not sensitive to the bar spacing 5 the sheltering function of the breakwaters for normal waves was better than that for oblique waves with β 60 at 0 25 kh 1 5 declaration of competing interestcoi the authors declare that they have no

coefficient 1 introduction breakwaters have been widely used to protect shorelines harbors and human activities recently submerged breakwaters become increasingly favorable in the practical engineering as the considerable merits of reflecting effectively incident wave energy not affecting water circulation and coastal landscape and sometimes providing fishes sheltering habitat when water waves from offshore obliquely propagate over the submerged breakwater system consisting of a series of equally spaced identical structures a strong wave reflection will be yielded when the relation of k x d nπ k x denotes the component of the wave number along the direction perpendicular to the breakwater d denotes the structure spacing and n denotes an arbitrary positive integer is satisfied the notable phenomenon is the so called bragg reflection and the mechanism is due to the constructive interference of reflected waves from successive structure crests a large volume of work has been undertaken for bragg reflection of water waves propagating over periodic structures the objectives mainly covered natural sandbars or seabed in early studies heathershaw 1982 and davies and heathershaw 1984 examined bragg reflection of surface waves propagating over periodically varying sandbars through experimental tests mei 1985 and hara and mei 1987 performed respectively theoretical analysis and experimental tests for bragg reflection of waves by periodic bars mei et al 1988 further analyzed the mechanism for bragg reflection of obliquely incident waves by a series of sandbars kirby 1986 studied bragg reflection of water waves propagating over a rippled seabed by extending the reduced wave equation of berkhoff subsequently bragg reflection of water waves was extended to other periodic structures mattioli 1990 reported the resonant reflection of water waves by a series of submerged rectangular bars hsu et al 2003 developed a numerical model for bragg scattering of water waves by multiple composite artificial bars based on the mild slope equation cho et al 2004 carried out a series of experimental tests for the reflection of regular waves over rectangular or trapezoidal submerged breakwaters and they indicated that the submerged breakwaters with the trapezoidal shape could perform better in term of reflecting wave energy linton 2011 developed analytical solutions for bragg resonance reflections of normally and obliquely incident waves by an arrays of horizontal cylinders in deep water by using the multipole expansion method liu et al 2016 developed analytical solutions to bragg reflections of normally and obliquely incident waves by submerged multiple impermeable semi circular bars and their analytical models have been proved to be reasonable through experimental tests based on the modified mild slope equation liu et al 2019 developed an analytical solution to bragg resonance of surface waves by periodic sinusoidal ripples and the analytical solution was validated by various results in literature note that the structures in above studies were impermeable and only the reflection coefficient were concerned actually a high reflection coefficient usually means that the transmission coefficient is low in the case of impermeable structures on the other hand bragg reflection may occur in the interaction between water waves and a periodic porous perforated structure system when waves propagate over such a structure system a part of incident wave energy will be dissipated mase et al 1995 investigated the effect of the permeability of rippled beds on bragg reflection of surface waves ting et al 2000 further considered the effect of current on bragg reflection of surface waves over permeable rippled beds twu and liu 2004 studied wave interaction with a periodic array of porous breakwaters on basis of the porous medium theory of sollitt and cross 1972 and they indicated that bragg reflection occurs in a porous breakwater system as that in an impermeable breakwater system based on the method of perturbation analysis martha et al 2007 studied the oblique wave reflection and transmission by a small undulant porous seabed zhang et al 2012 simulated bragg reflection of water waves by multiple submerged permeable trapezoidal breakwaters placed on a porous seabed in a numerical wave tank different from the rigid porous perforated structures lan et al 2011 developed analytical solutions to bragg scattering of water waves propagating over a series of submerged porous elastic rectangular bars using the matched eigenfunction expansion method and they validated the analytical model through experimental tests karmakar and guedes soares 2014 developed linear analytical solutions to bragg reflection of water waves by multiple bottom standing perforated vertical elastic thin plates in this paper bragg scattering of surface waves by multiple submerged perforated semi circular breakwaters bars will be examined the first semi circular breakwater was built at miyazaki port japan in early 1990s tanimoto and takahashi 1994 aburatani et al 1996 subsequently semi circular breakwaters have been often used in practical engineering zhang et al 2005 liu and li 2013 due to the outstanding advantages summarized by xie 1999 as following high stability against sliding almost zero overturning moment acting on them as the hydrodynamic pressure on the structure surfaces passes through the circle s center light deadweight which is suitable for a soft soil foundation and convenience for construction and removal studies on the hydrodynamic performance of the semi circular breakwaters have been carried out by many researchers e g sundar and ragu 1998 xie 1999 yuan and tao 2003 liu and li 2012 2013 koley and sahoo 2017 liu et al 2016 have checked the sheltering function of bragg reflection breakwater consisting of multiple submerged semi circular bars and presented some useful results for engineering design however they only considered impermeable semi circular structures which may not effectively dissipate incident wave energy in practice on the other hand liu and li 2012 2013 have indicated that perforating the semi circular bar can effectively dissipate the incident wave energy and then reduced both the reflection and transmission coefficients moreover the stability of the breakwater may be enhanced as the wave forces acting on the perforated bar are considerably reduced therefore the objective of this paper is to examine the water wave interaction with multiple submerged perforated semi circular bars through the theoretical and experimental methods and present valuable guidance for engineering application analytical solutions for the bragg scattering problem will be developed where the quadratic pressure drop condition molin 1992 molin and remy 2015 is imposed on the perforated semi circular arc to model the wave energy dissipation and the phase shift due to perforated arcs after using such a porous boundary condition the effect of the incident wave height on the wave energy dissipation is directly incorporated into the mathematical model the boundary value problem for wave scattering by multiple submerged perforated semi circular breakwaters is formulated in the following section in section 3 analytical solutions for the problem are developed through the multipole expansions combined with the shift of polar coordinates and the separation of variables normally and obliquely incident waves are independently considered the calculation methods of the reflection transmission and energy loss coefficients are presented the wide spacing approximations for the problem are deduced in section 4 and the experimental tests are introduced in section 5 in section 6 the convergence of the analytical solutions is examined and the analytical solutions are compared with the independently developed multi domain bem solution the wide spacing approximations and the experimental results the effects of various parameters on the bragg scattering are investigated in section 7 finally conclusions of this study are summarized 2 mathematical formulations water wave interaction with multiple perforated semi circular breakwaters bars submerged in ocean with constant depth h is considered as shown in fig 1 a global cartesian coordinate system with the original fixed on the still water surface and the x axis pointing the right hand side and the z axis taking vertically upwards is defined for the mathematical description there are total m perforated bars and the radius of bar q is a q q 1 2 m a q h the center of bar q is located at x q h the local pole coordinate system about the center of bar q is defined by x x q r q sin θ q and z h r q cos θ q the spacing between the centers of adjacent bars is d q x q 1 x q q 1 2 m 1 the length of each bar in the y direction is much larger than the incident wavelength and then it is assumed to be infinity the direction of incident wave with respect to the bars is denoted by angle β 0 β 90 measured from the positive x axis such that β 0 denotes the normally incident waves and β 90 corresponds to waves propagating in line with the direction of the bars the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and its motion is irrotational when the incident wave with angular frequency ω propagates a fluid velocity potential φ x y z t can be used to describe the whole fluid motion for obliquely incident wave the velocity potential can be further written as 1 φ x y z t re ϕ x z e i k y y e i ω t where re denotes the real part of the argument i 1 ϕ x z is the reduced spatial velocity potential t is the time k y is the y component of incident wave number k i e k y k sin β and k is the positive real root of 2 k ω 2 g k tanh k h the velocity potential φ x y z t satisfies laplace equation substituting eq 1 into laplace equation yields the modified helmholtz equation for the reduced spatial velocity potential 3 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ z 2 k y 2 ϕ 0 for the linear water wave scattering problem the velocity potential satisfies the following boundary conditions on the free surface on the bottom and at far fields 4 ϕ z k ϕ z 0 5 ϕ z 0 z h 6 lim x x i k x ϕ ϕ i 0 where k x k cos β and ϕ i is the velocity potential of incident waves and written as 7 ϕ i i g h 2 ω e i k x x z 0 z in which g is the acceleration due to gravity h is the incident wave height and z 0 z cosh k z h cosh k h note that the velocity potential of incident waves satisfies eqs 3 6 at the far fields the velocity potential has the form of 8 ϕ i g h 2 ω e i k x x r e i k x x z 0 z x t e i k x x z 0 z x where r and t are respectively the unknown complex coefficients associated with the reflected and transmitted waves the semi circular arc s thickness is assumed to be zero as it is very small compared with the bar s radius and the incident wavelength then the whole fluid domain is divided into m 1 regions region 0 the exterior common fluid domain outside all the perforated bars and region q q 1 2 m the interior fluid domain of bar q on the surface of perforated bar q the velocity potential satisfies the continuous condition of the fluid velocity 9 ϕ 0 r q ϕ q r q r q a q π 2 θ q 3 π 2 where the subscript q denotes region q when water wave passes through the perforated semi circular arcs a part of wave energy will be dissipated and the phase of wave motion may be changed both of them can be modeled by the following quadratic pressure drop condition molin 1992 molin and remy 2015 liu

the discharge coefficient molin 1992 and c q is the blockage coefficient of the perforated plate arc tuck 1975 suh et al 2002 it should be mentioned that the first and second parts on the right side of eq 10 denote the energy dissipation effect and the inertial effect of the perforated plate arc respectively for practical application of eq 10 the discharge coefficient and the blockage coefficient must be known a priori generally the discharge coefficient needs to be determined by experimental tests which will be detailed in section 6 4 the blockage coefficient can be empirically determined by suh et al 2011 huang et al 2011 11 c q b q 2 ε q where b q is the thickness of the q th semi circular arc note that the arc s thickness is used only for determining the blockage coefficient when considering water wave scattering by the whole breakwater system the arc s thickness is still assumed to be zero the preceding equations 3 6 9 and 10 formulate a closed boundary value problem for water wave scattering by multiple submerged perforated semi circular bars in the following section we will develop analytical solutions to the boundary value problem using the multipole expansion method combined with the shift of polar coordinates and the separation of variables 3 analytical solutions 3 1 obliquely incident waves the velocity potential in region 0 is the sum of the velocity

approximation newman 1965 evans 1990 linton and mciver 2001 porter and evans 2006 mciver 2014 in such approximated method only the solution of a single structure is needed thus the solving procedure is significantly simplified however for the present study the wide spacing approximations are strictly speaking invalid due to the application of the nonlinear pressure drop boundary condition see eq 10 to check the difference between the wide spacing approximations and the analytical solutions we present the derivation of this method here and will give the comparisons in section 6 3 we first consider the case of a single perforated semi circular bar with center located at x 0 symmetric about z axis irrespective of whether the waves are incident from x with x component of e i k x x or x with x component of e i k x x the complex reflection and transmission coefficients of the single bar are consistent we use r p and t p to denote respectively the complex reflection and transmission coefficients of such a bar with radius a p following the similar procedures in linton and mciver 2001 chapter 6 3 and linton 2011 section 2 the complex reflection and transmission coefficients of m

approximated resonant reflection frequency may be found through eq 66 5 experimental tests laboratory experiments for wave interactions with two and three uniform submerged perforated semi circular bars were carried out in the wave flume of shandong provincial key laboratory of ocean engineering ocean university of china the length width and depth of the wave flume were 60 0 m 3 0 m and 1 5 m respectively a piston type wave maker was equipped to generate the target waves at one side of the wave flume and a dissipative slope was placed to eliminate the wave energy at the opposite of the wave flume the wave flume was divided into two channels with 2 2 m wide and 0 8 wide by a thin glass wall and all the perforated bars were fixed by iron frames in the 0 8 m wide channel the edges of the iron frames were very narrow so that their effect on the wave propagation could be ignored fig 2 shows pictures of three submerged perforated semi circular bars in the wave flume the perforated bars were made of stainless steel with the thickness of 2 mm and the surfaces were uniformly punched with circular holes with the diameter of 3 cm the sketch for the arrangement of the holes on the bar surface is shown in fig 3 the first bar was fixed at the distance of 30 m from the wave maker and the other 2 bars were successively installed behind the first one along the wave flume the spacings between the centers of adjacent bars were d 1 3 m more details on experimental setup in the wave flume for 3 bars are presented in fig 4 in the experiments the water depth h was 0 4 m or 0 5 m and the bar radius was a 0 3 m and the bar porosity was ε 0 1 the incident wave periods t increasing from 1 0 s to 2 6 s with an interval of 0 2 s were selected and the wave steepness was fixed at h l 0 01 l is the incident wavelength all the experimental cases and conditions are listed in table 1 several capacitive type wave gauges were used to measure the time series of free surface elevations no 2 gauge was fixed at the distance of 3 5 m before the center of bar 1 the position of no 1 gauge was adjusted to make the spacing between nos 1 and 2 gauges always equal to l 4 for different incident waves nos 3 and 4 gauges were placed at the middle positions of adjacent bars respectively no 5 gauge was placed at a distance of 3 5 m away from the center of the last bar i e bar 3 in fig 3 in the tests for two perforated bars no 4 gauge and bar 3 were removed from the wave flume and no 5 gauge was moved to the position at a distance of 3 5 m away from the center of bar 2 all the free surface elevations were recorded by the wave gauges with fixed sampling frequency of 50 hz typical time series of free surface elevations are presented in fig 5 the incident and reflected wave heights were obtained using the method of goda and suzuki 1976 based on the stable surface elevations between t 1 and t 2 recorded by nos 1 and 2 gauges as shown in fig 5 whilst the transmitted wave heights was statistically calculated by the zero up cross analysis method based on the stable surface elevations between t 3 and t 4 recorded by no 5 gauge then the reflection and transmission coefficients were determined in the tests each case was repeated at least three times and the average values were taken as the results of reflection and transmission coefficients 6 validations of analytical solutions 6 1 convergence examination to check the convergence of the present analytical solutions we calculate the transmission coefficient c t of the breakwaters at different truncated numbers n and list the results in tables 2 and 3 three perforated semi circular bars are examined and normally incident waves and obliquely incident waves with β 45 are considered the calculation conditions are a 1

rapid and a truncated number n 6 can guarantee the calculated results with three figure accuracy which is sufficient to practical engineering analysis thus n 6 will be used in the subsequent calculation examples 6 2 comparison with multi domain bem solutions we have also solved the present boundary value problem using the independently developed multi domain boundary element method bem codes liu and li 2017 li et al 2019 fig 6 shows the comparison between the analytical solutions and the multi domain bem solutions in the calculations three perforated bars with different radii a 1 0 6h a 2 0 7h and a 3 0 8h are considered and the other calculation parameters are d 1 d 2 3h ε p 0 1 p 1 3 μ p 0 7 p 1 3 b p 0 02h p 1 3 and h l 0 01 the lines and dots in fig 6 denote the results of the analytical solutions and the multi bem solutions respectively excellent agreement between the results by two different solutions can be observed from the figure it should be mentioned that although the calculation results of both two different solutions are consistent the analytical solutions have the following merits the analytical solutions directly give the expression of the velocity potential and can provide better scientific insight in the present physical problem however the multi domain bem numerical solutions only give a series of discrete calculation results for the velocity potential and its normal derivative on the boundary of the fluid domain as the boundary needs to be discretized in the solving procedure in addition the analytical solutions have the advantages of higher computational efficiency and more accurate calculation results compared with the multi domain bem solutions in addition a very small incident angle was also used in the obliquely incident wave solution in section 3 1 it turned out that the calculated results of the reflection and transmission coefficients were almost the same as those by the normally incident wave solution in section 3 2 moreover the blockage coefficient of c 0 and an extremely small porosity of ε 10 6 were used in the calculation examples and the results of reflection and transmission coefficients were the same as those of multiple impermeable semi circular bars in liu et al 2016 6 3 comparison with wide spacing approximations the reflection and transmission coefficients c r and c t calculated by the analytical solutions and the wide spacing approximations are compared and the typical results are shown in fig 7 in this figure we consider 4 bars with different radii a 1 0 5h a 2 0 6h a 3 0 7h and a 4 0 8h and different porosities ε 1 0 2 ε 2 0 15 ε 3 0 1 and ε 4 0 05 the uniform discharge coefficient of μ 0 7 and the uniform thickness of the semi circular arc of b 0 02h are used in the calculations all the spacings between adjacent bars centers are d 5h the smallest spacing between the adjacent foot edges of bars is 3 5h the wave steepness of h l 0 01 is used the normally incident waves with β 0 and obliquely incident waves with β 45 are examined it is observed from fig 7 that in the wide spacing approximation the value of c r is usually slightly overestimated especially the peak of c r and the corresponding value of c t may be underestimated we have also developed analytical solutions and wide spacing approximations for the present physical problem by imposing a linear pressure drop condition yu 1995 on the perforated semi circular arcs and we have found that for the same cases in fig 7 while with the linear pressure loss conditions the results by the wide spacing approximations and the analytical solutions agreed excellently as the bar spacings were wide enough thus the slight discrepancy of results by the wide spacing approximations is due to the quadratic pressure loss boundary condition in eq 10 strictly speaking the wide spacing approximations are indeed inappropriate after using the nonlinear pressure loss boundary condition but considering the slight difference this powerful and simplified approximation may be still taken as a rapid approach in terms of engineering analysis 6 4 comparison with experimental results in the analytical solutions the blockage coefficient c and the discharge coefficient μ of the perforated semi circular arc see eq 10 are vital for giving reasonable predictions of the reflection transmission and energy loss coefficients the blockage coefficient c is determined by eq 11 and thus the value of c 0 01 m was used in this section for a flat perforated plate the discharge coefficient of μ 0 3 0 4 for the porosity of ε 0 5 was recommended by molin 2011 for perforated caissons the discharge coefficient of μ 0 4 for the fully perforated caissons and μ 0 7 for partially perforated caissons were recommend by liu and li 2017 but for the semi circular perforated arc plate the recommended values of discharge coefficient were lack in literature therefore we carry out experimental tests to calibrate the discharge coefficient and validate the present analytical solutions after a series of repeated trial calculations we found that using the discharge coefficient of μ 0 7 could give reasonable calculation results compared with the experimental data figs 8 and 9 present the comparisons between the reflection and transmission coefficients calculated by analytical solutions and those measured in the experimental tests where μ 0 7 was adopted in the analytical solutions the lines denote the results calculated by the analytical solutions whilst the dots denote the results measured in experiments it is observed from figs 8 and 9 that the overall agreement between the analytical solutions and the experimental data is reasonable we also found that the value of μ varying from 0 7 to 0 9 had no apparent effect on the calculation results the values of μ 0 7 is recommended for the perorated semi circular plate arc and is used in the subsequent calculation examples 7 calculation examples with discussions in this section we present calculation examples to investigate the effects of various parameters on the reflection transmission and energy loss coefficients c r c t and c l of multiple submerged perforated semi circular breakwaters we only consider uniform perforated bars and bar spacing unless otherwise noted the uniform bar radius bar spacing bar porosity bar thickness and discharge coefficient are denoted by a d ε b and μ respectively the discharge coefficient is fixed at μ 0 7 according to section 6 4 the bar thickness is fixed at b 0 02h and the wave steepness is fixed at h l 0 01 fig 10 shows the differences of c r c t and c l between the perforated breakwaters with ε 0 1 and the impermeable breakwaters with ε 0 the impermeable semi circular breakwaters have been examined in the previous study liu et al 2016 in fig 10 three uniform perforated semi circular bars with radius a 0 6h are considered the bar spacing is fixed at d 4h and normal waves with β 0 and oblique waves with β 45 are examined notable differences of c r c t and c l between the perforated breakwaters and impermeable breakwaters are observed from fig 10 the resonant reflection coefficient of the perforated breakwaters is smaller which is beneficial for suppressing the seabed scour in front of the seaside semi circular bar it is seen from fig 10 that the transmission coefficient of the perforated breakwaters is always smaller than that of the impermeable ones this is due to the fact that quite a part of wave energy is dissipated when water wave passes through the perforated semi circular arcs as shown in the figure note that the curve of the energy loss coefficient for the impermeable breakwaters is not plotted as no wave energy is dissipated in the context of potential theory these results indicate that compared with the impermeable breakwaters the perforated ones can provide better protection for the leeside region thus perforating the surfaces of the bars is sensible in the design of submerged semi circular breakwaters comparing fig 10 a and b the resonant reflection coefficient of the breakwaters at β 45 is smaller than that for normal waves the variations of c r c t and c l with kh at different bar number m 2 3 5 and 10 are shown in figs 11 and 12 the calculation conditions are a 0 6h d 4h ε 0 1 β 0 and 45 for comparison the calculation results for one single bar are also plotted in the figures it is observed from fig 11 a that the resonant reflection coefficient significantly increases with the increasing bar number while the corresponding bandwidth which was defined by bailard et al 1992 as the width of the principal wave reflection peak at the half value of the peak reflection coefficient decreases a similar phenomenon has been observed by liu et al 2016 for bragg reflection of multiple impermeable semi circular bars actually this is also the common feature of wave reflection by periodic structures linton 2011 fig 1 we also note from fig 11 a that increasing the bar number has slight effect on the frequency corresponding to the peak value of the reflection coefficient in addition increasing the bar number yields a lower transmission coefficient as shown in fig 11 b we also examined the results for larger bar number and found the further decreasing of transmission coefficient still exists but not such significant in practical application the engineering cost becomes higher for more bars from fig 11 c the energy loss coefficient of the breakwaters significantly increases with the increasing bar number in the whole frequency range which is in line with physical nature by observing fig 11 a and b the frequency corresponding to the minimum of the transmission coefficient is slightly less than the resonant reflection frequency which differs from the result that the transmission coefficient of impermeable structures attains its minimum at resonant reflection frequency this should be the contribution of wave energy dissipation caused by the perforated arcs as this phenomenon still existed when the inertial effect in eq 10 was not considered i e the blockage coefficient of c 0 similar phenomena as normal waves can be also observed in fig 12 for oblique waves figs 13 and 14 present the variations of c r c t and c l with kh at different bar spacing d three bars with uniform radius a 0 6h and three different bar spacings d 2h 4h and 6h are examined the other calculation conditions are the same as those used in figs 11 and 12 it is observed from fig 13 a that with the increasing bar spacing from 2h to 6h more peaks of reflection coefficient occur within the same frequency range this phenomenon for reflection coefficient can be also concluded from an approximated relation of k h n π cos β d h n 1 2 karmakar and guedes soares 2014 which is actually the bragg s law as presented in fig 13 a the first resonant reflection coefficient according to the approximated bragg s law in the case of d 6h is largest which differs from the results that the second one is largest for multiple impermeable semi circular bars liu et al 2016 under same conditions the difference is caused by the existence of the wave energy dissipation for perforated bars it is noted from fig 13 b and c that the transmission coefficient and the energy loss coefficient c t and c l in the cases of the large values d 4h and 6h slightly oscillate when the value of kh varies from 0 25 to 1 5 in addition the effect of the bar spacing on the transmission coefficient and the energy loss coefficient can be negligible for large values of kh short waves all the similar results for oblique waves can be obtained from fig 14 effects of the bar radius on c r c t and c l are presented in figs 15 and 16 in these figures three uniform bars with four different bar radii a 0 3h 0 5h 0 6h and 0 7h are checked the other calculation conditions are the same as those used in figs 13 and 14 it is observed from fig 15 a that when the bar radius increases the resonant reflection coefficient increases significantly and the corresponding frequency decreases slightly increasing the bar radius can considerably reduce the transmission coefficient for a fixed incident wave frequency as shown in fig 15 b it is observed from fig 15 c that more incident wave energy can be dissipated by increasing the bar radius it is evident that the breakwaters with a larger radius can provide better sheltering lower transmission coefficient for leeside region similar phenomena for the transmission coefficient and the energy loss coefficient can be observed for oblique waves in fig 16 however it is surprising that for oblique waves with β 45 in fig 16 a the resonant reflection coefficient for a 0 7h c r 0 172 at kh 0 89 is slightly less than that for a 0 6h c r 0 182 at kh 0 96 fig 17 gives the variations of c r c t and c l with kh at different wave incident angle β 0 30 45 60 and 75 it is observed from fig 17 a that when the value of β increases from 0 to 60 the resonant reflection occurs at a larger frequency and the corresponding reflection coefficient significantly decreases the sheltering function of the breakwaters for normal waves is better than that for oblique waves with β 60 at 0 25 kh 1 5 as shown in fig 17 b notably the sheltering function of the breakwaters at β 75 is very good for short incident waves kh 2 0 however the practical interest is low as a very large incident wave angle of β 75 may be unlikely for breakwaters in practical engineering 8 conclusions based on potential theory this study has developed analytical solutions for bragg scattering of water waves by a series of submerged perforated semi circular breakwaters using the multipole expansions combined with the shift of polar coordinates and the separation of variables a quadratic pressure drop condition on the perforated semi circular arc has been employed to model the wave energy dissipation in the analytical solutions the normally incident and obliquely incident waves have been independently considered the calculation methods of the reflection transmission and energy loss coefficients have been presented the convergence of the analytical solutions was rapid and the agreement between the analytical solutions and the multi domain bem was excellent the analytical solutions have been compared with the wide spacing approximations which only needed the analytical solutions of a single bar there were slight difference between the results by the wide spacing approximations and the analytical solutions in spite of the enough large bar spacing this was caused by the nonlinear pressure drop boundary condition imposed on the perforated semi circular arcs laboratory experiments have been performed to measure the reflection and transmission coefficients of two and three submerged perforated bars with uniform spacing according to the comparison between the analytical solutions and experimental data the discharge coefficient of μ 0 7 was recommended for the perforated semi circular arc plate the calculated reflection and transmission coefficients agreed reasonably with the experimental data calculation examples have been presented to examine the effects of various parameters on the bragg scattering of water waves by the breakwaters main results are drawn as following 1 the present perforated breakwaters with a suitable porosity had a better sheltering function a lower transmission coefficient compared with the impermeable ones the resonant reflection coefficient of the perforated breakwaters was smaller than that of the impermeable ones the perforated breakwaters could effectively dissipate the incident wave energy 2 the frequency corresponding to the minimum transmission coefficient was slightly less than the resonant reflection frequency which differed from the result that the transmission coefficient of impermeable bars attained the minimum at resonant reflection frequency 3 increasing the bar number led to the increase of the resonant reflection coefficient and the decrease of the corresponding bandwidth increasing the bar radius led to the decrease of the resonant reflection frequency increasing both the bar number and radius led to the decrease of the transmission coefficient and the increase of the energy loss coefficient 4 increasing the bar spacing led to the increase of resonant reflection frequency in the case of short waves the transmission coefficient and the energy loss coefficient were not sensitive to the bar spacing 5 the sheltering function of the breakwaters for normal waves was better than that for oblique waves with β 60 at 0 25 kh 1 5 declaration of competing interestcoi the authors declare that they have no

21757,this paper attempts to study the effects of control parameters errors and launching attitude errors on the motion of an underwater glider and these errors are collectively called as input errors the dynamics model of the underwater glider is established to simplify the quantitative characterization of motion deviation an evaluation parameter which can simultaneously characterize the path deviation and velocity deviation is proposed on these bases the motion deviations of the glider are quantitatively analyzed under two kinds of input errors the control parameters errors include the net buoyancy adjustment amount error the movable internal mass block translation amount error and the movable internal mass block rotation amount error the launching attitude errors include the roll angle error the yaw angle error and the pitch angle error then an optimized response surface methodology orsm is proposed to obtain the approximate function expressions between the input errors and the evaluation parameter of motion deviation in the orsm the multi island genetic algorithm miga is used to identify the key terms of polynomial and the approximate function expressions are fitted by the polynomials including only the key terms which can effectively weaken the polynomial wiggle after that the sensitivity analysis of input errors to motion deviations is achieved based on the above approximate function expressions the results indicate that all control parameters errors and the yaw angle error should be small enough to avoid unacceptable motion deviations in addition the coexistence of particular input errors can offset motion deviations partially the research results provide significant guidance for the accuracy design of underwater glider keywords underwater glider

about 70 of earth surface is covered by water but for humans there are too many mysteries underwater in recent years with the progress of science and technology underwater exploration has become a research hotspot under this background underwater glider technology gets rapid development a normal underwater glider is designed as a winged underwater vehicle without external active propulsion system it can move up and down by adjusting its net buoyancy and adjust attitude by moving the translatable and rotatable internal mass blocks relying on the hydrodynamic forces exerted on a pair of wings the underwater glider can realize the space motion among various products and models of underwater glider commercially available glider the slocum webb et al 2001 the seaglider eriksen et al 2001 and the spray sherman et al 2001 would be typical ones since the underwater glider can realize the space motion without external active propulsion it has low energy consumption and is able to complete the large range long term underwater exploration missions in the design period it is indispensable to study the underwater glider performance using dynamics analysis methods leonard and graver 2001 bhatta and leonard 2003 graver 2005 and zhang et al 2013 established the rigid body dynamics models of underwater gliders by combining the linear momentum theorem the angular momentum theorem and the kinetic energy theorem and realized the simulations of the gliders space motions among these bhatta and leonard 2003 studied the stability control method and path following ability of underwater glider and zhang et al 2013 verified the dynamics modeling method using experimental data wang and wang 2009 simplified an underwater glider as a rigid body system deduced the gibbs function of the system and established the rigid body dynamics model of the glider using the gibbs appell equation wang et al 2006 and fan and woolsey 2014 established the rigid body dynamics models of underwater gliders using the second lagrange equation in which fan and woolsey 2014 considered the effects of unsteady and nonuniform currents additionally gu et al 2016 deduced the dynamics differential equations of an underwater glider using the kirchoff s equation solved the differential equations by runge kutta method and verified the calculation results using experimental data wang et al 2014 established the dynamic differential geometry model of an underwater glider using the riemannian differential geometry and affine connection and the comparison between model simulation results and experimental data showed a good agreement xue et al 2015 simplified an underwater glider formation as a multibody system constructed the artificial potential fields in the system and realized the motion analysis of the underwater glider formation based on the aforementioned research methods mahmoudian et al 2010 presented an approximate analytical expression for the steady turning motion of an underwater glider using perturbation theory hussain et al 2011 selected the ballast rate as the input achieved identification on net buoyancy depth and pitching angle of an underwater glider system yu et al 2013 increased the gliding range of an underwater glider by optimizing the steady motion parameters cao et al 2015 presented an approximate semi analytical solution for the steady spiral motion of an underwater glider after simplifying the motion equations rationally liu et al 2017 analyzed the effects of wing location on the spiral motion of an underwater glider and found the transition region that determines the turning direction of spiral motion yu et al 2018 gave a uniform description method of the underwater glider motion using the tangential velocity the vertical velocity and the angular velocity and analyzed the variation rules of the above three parameters under different control parameters values in some missions underwater gliders need to move at a specific path and velocity to explore specific waters and collect information sufficiently during formation voyages each glider must as well move at a specified path and velocity to keep formation to save glider s energy the feedback control of the glider is usually not real time continuous and there is a specific time interval between two successive feedback controls therefore it is necessary to accurately set the net buoyancy adjustment amount internal mass block translation amount internal mass block rotation amount glider launching attitude and glider launching location however in actual missions control parameters errors attitude errors and location errors can t be avoided so there will be inevitable path deviation and velocity deviation between the actual glider motion state and the ideal one these motion deviations will affect the smooth progress of actual mission therefore it is significant for practical applications of underwater glider to study the causes of motion deviations unfortunately above studies have not been reported almost in view of these the analysis methods of underwater glider motion deviations are studied in this paper the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives the dynamics model for an underwater glider with a cylindrically actuated movable internal mass block in section 3 the input errors are defined the evaluation parameter of motion deviation is presented and the motion deviations of the underwater glider are quantitatively analyzed using the design of experiment doe and optimization method in section 4 an optimized response surface methodology orsm is proposed to study the sensitivity of input errors to motion deviations section 5 summarizes the main contributions and points out the possible directions for continuing research 2 dynamics modeling of underwater glider this paper takes a small underwater glider developed by tianjin university as the research object and the structure of the glider is shown in fig 1 the battery pack of the glider is designed as a cylindrically actuated movable internal mass block by translating and rotating the movable internal mass block the attitude of the glider will be adjusted in addition the net buoyancy of the glider will be adjusted by changing the volume of external bladder therefore the control parameters of the glider include the net buoyancy adjustment amount the movable internal mass block translation amount and the movable internal mass block rotation amount for convenience the standard state of the glider is defined firstly the standard state refers to the state where the buoyancy and gravity of the whole glider are equal in value opposite and collinear in direction when the glider is placed horizontally hereafter the changes of control parameters values are determined based on the standard state since the net buoyancy adjustment amount of the glider is generally small the volume change amount of the external bladder is minute therefore compared with the position change of the whole glider barycenter caused by moving movable internal mass block the position change of the whole glider barycenter caused by changing external bladder volume is negligible graver 2005 in view of this the underwater glider is divided into two parts including the movable internal mass block and the glider body all parts except the movable internal mass block the two parts are both considered as rigid bodies whose masses are denoted as m p and m h respectively fig 2 shows the internal structure diagram of the glider where the four points from left to right denote the buoyancy center o e of the external bladder the barycenter o p of the movable internal mass block the buoyancy center o b of the whole glider under the standard state the barycenter o h of the glider body 2 1 coordinate frames and kinematic equations to realize the dynamics analysis of underwater glider we define two coordinate frames which are respectively fixed in the inertial space and glider body the inertial frame is represented by an orthonormal triad x axis y axis z axis and its origin is o the x axis and z axis form the horizontal plane the y axis is parallel to the direction of gravity the body frame is represented by an orthonormal triad x b axis y b axis z b axis and its origin is located at o b the x b axis coincides with the longitudinal axis of the glider the y b axis points to the bottom of the glider all coordinate frames obey the right hand rule as shown in fig 3 to improve the glider motion stability the whole glider barycenter is designed to be below its buoyancy center fan 2013 liu 2014 the distance between movable internal mass block barycenter o p and x b axis is denoted as y b where y b 0 016m according to fossen 2011 for underwater gliders the conventions are north east down ned for the inertial frame and surge sway heave ssh for the body frame therefore the z axis should be parallel to the direction of gravity and the z b axis should point to the bottom of the glider however to keep continuity in our research team the definitions of coordinate frames refer to liu 2014 in this paper the attitude of the body frame is described by roll angle φ pitch angle θ and yaw angle ψ the φ θ and ψ respectively denote the angles that the body frame rotates around the x axis z axis and y axis from the attitude coinciding with the inertial frame then the attitude angle vector of the body frame relative to the inertial frame is expressed as π φ ψ θ t according to fossen 2011 wang et al 2011 and liu 2014 the rotation matrix r be from the body frame to the inertial frame is expressed as 1 r be cos θ cos φ sin φ sin φ cos φ sin θ cos φ cos φ sin φ sin φ sin θ cos ψ sin θ cos φ cos θ sin φ cos θ cos θ sin φ sin φ cos φ cos φ sin θ sin φ cos φ cos φ sin φ sin θ sin φ the rotation matrix r eb from the inertial frame to the body frame is the transpose of r be the attack angle α and sideslip angle β are used to describe the direction of the glider resultant velocity in the body frame the linear velocity vector of the glider is expressed as v u v w t according to fossen 2011 wang et al 2011 and liu 2014 the expressions of α and β are 2 α arctan v u 3 β arcsin w u 2 v 2 w 2 in the inertial frame the position vector of the body frame relative to the inertial frame is expressed as b x y z t in the body frame the angular velocity vector of the glider is expressed as ω p q r t according to fossen 2011 wang et al 2011 and liu 2014 the kinematic differential equations of the glider are as follows 4 x y z r be u v w 5 φ ψ θ 1 cos φ tan θ sin φ tan θ 0 cos φ cos θ sin φ cos θ 0 sin φ cos φ p q r 2 2 force analysis under the standard state the buoyancy of the whole glider can be equivalent to a concentrated force exerted on the whole glider buoyancy center o b above concentrated force is denoted as b 0 after the net buoyancy is adjusted it is equivalent to exerting net buoyancy on the external bladder buoyancy center o e the net buoyancy is denoted as δ b in the motion process the underwater glider is also subjected to the gravity and hydrodynamic force here we let the gravity of the glider body be denoted as g h the gravity of the movable internal mass block be denoted as g p the inertial hydrodynamic force be denoted as f m and the viscous hydrodynamic force be denoted as f s since the action points of above forces may not coincide with the origin of the body frame o b when above forces are moved to o b additional moments may be generated here we let the additional moment generated by δ b be denoted as m b the additional moment generated by g h be denoted as m h the additional moment generated by g p be denoted as m p the additional moment generated by f m be denoted as m m and the additional moment generated by f s be denoted as m s m m and m s are called as the inertial hydrodynamic moment and viscous hydrodynamic moment respectively in addition the position vector of the glider body barycenter o h relative to the origin of the body frame o b is denoted as r h the position vector of the external bladder buoyancy center o e relative to o b is denoted as r b under the standard state the position vector of the movable internal mass block barycenter o p relative to o b is denoted as r p then the position change vector of o p is denoted as δ r here r h r b r p and δ r are all expressed in the body frame since the directions of both gravity and buoyancy are always parallel to the y axis of the inertial frame in the body frame the expressions of g h g p b 0 δ b m h m p and m b are as follows 6 g h m h r eb 0 m h g 0 t r h g h 7 g p m p r eb 0 m p g 0 t r p δ r g p 8 δ b m b r eb 0 ρ g v b 0 t r b δ b 9 b 0 r eb 0 m h m p g 0 t where g represents the gravitational acceleration ρ represents the density of water and v b represents the volume change amount of the external bladder since the glider body is symmetrical with respect to the x b o b y b plane of the body frame referring to fossen 2011 wang et al 2011 fan 2013 and liu 2014 in the body frame the expressions of the inertial hydrodynamic force and inertial hydrodynamic moment are simplified to 10 f m m m λ 11 0 0 0 λ 22 0 0 0 λ 33 0 0 0 0 0 λ 26 0 λ 35 0 0 0 0 0 0 λ 53 0 λ 62 0 λ 44 0 0 0 λ 55 0 0 0 λ 66 v ω where λ 11 λ 22 and λ 33 represent the added mass λ 44 λ 55 and λ 66 represent the added moment of inertia λ 26 λ 35 λ 53 and λ 62 represent the added static moment according to jones et al 2002 fossen 2011 wang et al 2011 and liu 2014 in the body frame the expressions of the viscous hydrodynamic force and viscous hydrodynamic moment are as follows 11 f s m s 0 5 ρ v 2 s c x 0 5 ρ v 2 s c y α α c y r r 0 5 ρ v 2 s c z β β c z p p c z q q 0

hydrodynamic moment coefficients which are obtained by experiment and computational fluid dynamics method fan 2013 zhang et al 2013 liu 2014 s represents the characteristic area of the glider l represents the characteristic length of the glider p q r represent pl v ql v rl v respectively 2 3 dynamics modeling and simulation the linear momentum theorem and angular momentum theorem are employed to establish the dynamics model of the underwater glider the correctness of this modeling method has been verified by our research team liu 2014 since the changing process of control parameters values is not considered in our subsequent research the dynamics modeling omits the mutual movement process between the movable internal mass block and the glider body in the inertial frame and relative to its origin o the linear momentum of the glider is denoted as p e and the angular momentum of the glider is denoted as l e in the body frame and relative to its origin o b the linear momentum of the glider is denoted as p b and the angular momentum of the glider is denoted as l b since the whole glider barycenter does not coincide with o b p b and l b can be represented as 12 p b l b m h m p v ω r g j o ω m h m p r g v where j o represents the inertia tensor of the glider relative to the body frame which is calculated based on the inertia tensor j p of the movable internal mass block relative to its own barycenter the inertia tensor j h of the glider body relative to its own barycenter and the parallel axis theorem fossen 2011 liu 2014 r g represents the position vector of the whole glider barycenter relative to o b which is expressed as 13 r g m h r h m p r p δ r m h m p based on the kinematic relation there are 14 b r be v r be r be ω ˆ 15 p e r be p b l e r be l b

a 1 a 2 a 1 0 17 a ˆ x a x the newton s second law gives 18 p e f l e τ b f where f and τ represent the resultant force and resultant moment respectively which are exerted on o b and expressed in the inertial frame combining eq 15 and eq 18 there is 19 f r be ω ˆ p b r be p b τ b f r be ω ˆ l b r be l b b p e r be v r be p b in the body frame the resultant force and resultant moment are denoted as f and m respectively which are ascertained by the sum of eq 6 to eq 11 then eq 19 can be presented as 20 p b p b ω f l b l b ω p b v m substituting eq 12 into eq 20 we can get 21 m h m p v ω r g m h m p v ω r g ω f j o ω m h m p r g v j o ω m h m p r g v ω m h m p v ω r g v m combining eq 4 eq 5 and eq 21 the dynamics model of the glider is established and the key parameters values of the model are listed in the appendix in this paper the dynamics model is solved by the fourth order explicit runge kutta method liu 2014 gu et al 2016 the total time of dynamics simulation is set to 1000s and the simulation step size δt is set to 0 1s therefore the number of iteration is 10000 denoted as n through simulation test this step size can make the equal step size runge kutta method achieve the same accuracy as the adaptive variable step size runge kutta method used by liu 2014 and gu et al 2016 the equal step size runge kutta method is conducive to establishing a unified evaluation criterion in the subsequent calculation since the length limitation of this paper the two frequently used working conditions of this glider are selected for our study here we do not consider the specific control process and only consider the control parameters values after the control process is completed i e before the glider is launched the control parameters values have been adjusted the vectors v b π and ω are all set to 0 at the moment of launching the glider on this basis the net buoyancy is set to 0 3 0 tn which is expressed in the inertial frame and represents the diving motion in the first numerical example the movable internal mass block is translated along the x b axis by 0 01m i e δ r 0 01 0 0 tm then the path of o b in which the glider glides in vertical plane is obtained by simulation calculation on the basis of the first numerical example the movable internal mass block is additionally rotated around the x b axis by 20 i e δ r 0 01 y b cos20 1 y b sin20 tm which is the second numerical example then the path of o b in which the glider glides spirally is obtained by simulation calculation in this paper the paths of o b are defined as the glider motion paths as shown in fig 4 the results show that the dynamics model can simulate the two basic space motions of the underwater glider 3 motion deviation analysis of underwater glider to make the glider move at a specific path and velocity it is necessary to accurately set the net buoyancy adjustment amount movable internal mass block translation amount movable internal mass block rotation amount launching attitude and launching location in fact control parameters errors launching attitude errors and launching location errors can t be avoided so there will be inevitable path deviation and velocity deviation between the actual glider motion state and the ideal one therefore this paper focuses on the effects of the above errors on the underwater glider motion in addition considering that the launching location errors only make the final motion path translate a certain distance we won t discuss the effects of them further in this section the path deviation and velocity deviation are called as the motion deviation collectively the evaluation parameter of motion deviation is proposed based on established dynamics model then under given conditions the motion deviations of underwater glider are quantitatively analyzed using the design of experiment doe and optimization method 3 1 input errors in this paper the input errors include the control parameters errors and launching attitude errors the control parameters errors include the net buoyancy adjustment amount error e 1 the movable internal mass block translation amount error e 2 and the movable internal mass block rotation amount error e 3 here we focus on the effects of the error values of control parameters so the specific control process is not considered the launching attitude errors include the roll angle error e 4 the yaw angle error e 5 and the pitch angle error e 6 according to wang et al 2011 and liu 2014 and engineering experience the ranges of e i are given in table 1 the input errors make the control parameters and launching attitude angles deviate from their ideal values actually the complex environmental factors such as ocean currents can also lead to motion deviation even without the input errors however the purpose of this paper is to study the effects of the errors carried by the glider itself so we carried out this research in a relative ideal state by excluding the effects of the environmental factors 3 2 evaluation parameter of motion deviation under the ideal motion state the path deviation and velocity deviation of the glider are supposed to be 0 at the same time for convenience of subsequent calculation process the evaluation parameter which can simultaneously characterize the path deviation and velocity deviation is proposed according to section 2 3 the dynamics model is solved by the runge kutta method and the step size of iterative calculation is δt the result of the i th iterative calculation of runge kutta method is the position coordinate of the glider at i δt time and it is denoted as x i y i z i after n iterative calculations the matrix d representing the position coordinates of each moment is obtained as 22 d x 1 y 1 z 1 x n y n z n for convenience the control parameters and launching attitude angles are collectively called as input parameters here the d which is calculated by substituting the ideal input parameters values into the dynamics model is denoted as d 0 further and the i th row of d 0 is denoted as x 0i y 0i z 0i the d which is calculated by substituting the input parameters values including input errors into the dynamics model is denoted as d e further and the i th row of d e is denoted as x ei y ei z ei d 0 and d e are obtained by two simulation calculations then the motion deviation can be determined by the discrepancy between d 0 and d e here we use frobenius norm f to assess the discrepancy between d 0 and d e which is as follows 23 d 0 d e f 2 i 1 n x 0 i x e i 2 y 0 i y e i 2 z 0 i z e i 2 according to eq 23 d 0 d e f 2 means the quadratic sum of position deviations of each moment between the ideal path and the path with errors then the evaluation parameter of motion deviation is defined as 24 t error d 0 d e f 2 n where the unit of t error is meter the t error is used to assess the position deviations of each moment between two space motions t error 0 means that d e is equal to d 0 that is to say the position coordinates of two space motions are the same at each moment so the velocities of two space motions are the same therefore although the core of t error is to calculate the position deviations of each moment t error also reflect the velocity deviations the larger the t error is the larger the motion deviation is 3 3 motion deviation calculation to save energy the feedback control of the glider is not real time continuous and there is time interval of about 1000s between two successive feedback controls when we calculate the motion deviation using control parameters errors caused by a single control process the calculation result is enough to reflect the effects of control parameters errors on the glider motion explicitly therefore to avoid complicated calculation the control parameters values switching is not considered here besides due to the error cumulative effect and the feedback control pattern the input errors caused by the initial control have greater effects on the whole motion process therefore we study the effects of the errors that exist at the moment of launching the glider and the two numerical examples in section 2 3 are set to ideal motion states to analyze the motion deviations however our analysis method and flow can also be used in other situations such as when considering different initial conditions and other types of underwater gliders based on the two numerical examples in section 2 3 the d 0 can be obtained firstly when we consider the effects of input errors the δ r of the first numerical example of section 2 3 is changed to 0 01 e 2 y b cos e 3 1 y b sin e 3 tm and the δ r of the second numerical example of section 2 3 is changed to 0 01 e 2 y b cos 20 e 3 1 y b sin 20 e 3 tm besides the net buoyancy is changed to 0 3 e 1 0 tn and the π is changed to e 4 e 5 e 6 t at the moment of launching the glider then the d e can be obtained by substituting above input parameters values into the dynamics model and the t error can be calculated based on eq 24 to comprehensively analyze the motion deviations 60 sets of input errors values are extracted from the ranges of table 1 by optimal latin hypercube experimental design then input parameters values including input errors are correspondingly obtained by substituting above input parameters values into the dynamics model we can get corresponding d e and corresponding t error the 60 sets of input errors values are called as input values of sample points and their corresponding t error are called as output values of sample points to differentiate the two kinds of motion modes of the glider the t error of gliding in vertical plane is denoted as t e vp and the t error of gliding spirally is denoted as t e s for sample points the means and standard deviations of both t e vp and t e s are calculated as shown in table 2 to obtain the maximum motion deviations caused by the input errors we use optimization method to seek the maximum t error and its corresponding input errors values rather than traverse the whole input errors space aimlessly in each iteration of optimization the dynamics model is used to calculate the t error and the input errors are set to the design variables the optimization mathematical model is 25 max t error s t 0 2 n e 1 0 2 n 0 002 m e 2 0 002 m 1 e 3 1 2 e i 2 i 4 5 6 in this paper the multi island genetic algorithm miga is used to complete the optimization calculation according to hu et al 2014 based on the conventional genetic algorithms ga miga divides the design variables space into multiple areas called as islands the same as the conventional ga the individuals on each island can achieve crossover and mutation further to get the elites different from the conventional ga the elites can achieve migration between the islands in view of these miga can avoid the local optimal solution better and is more suitable for nonlinear optimization problems in this section the key parameters values of miga are shown in table 3 after optimization calculations the maximum t e vp and t e s and their corresponding input errors values are obtained as shown in table 4 the motion paths with maximum motion deviations and the ideal motion paths are compared as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 the results show that control parameters errors and launching attitude errors have great effects on the glider motion with the increasing of time the motion deviations have further increasing trend 4 sensitivity analysis of input errors in this section the sensitivity of input errors to motion deviations is analyzed based on response surface methodology rsm the rsm can fit the approximate function expression between the input errors and the evaluation parameter of motion deviation using polynomial and a small number of sample points then the sensitivity analysis can be achieved directly by using the approximate function expression which is very convenient and time saving such as zhao et al 2014 however when the conventional rsm is used to fit the approximate function expression of the nonlinear dynamics model the polynomial wiggle may occur mathews and fink 2004 which will affect the predictive capability of the approximate function expression therefore an optimized response surface methodology orsm is proposed here in the orsm the key terms of the polynomial for fitting approximate function expression are identified by miga to weaken the polynomial wiggle then the orsm is used to achieve the sensitivity analysis 4 1 optimized response surface methodology before the approximate function expression is fitted the e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 and e 6 are normalized by scaling their ranges to 1 1 to avoid the effects of their different ranges the normalized input errors are 26 ξ 1 5 e 1 ξ 2 500 e 2 ξ 3 e 3 ξ 4 0 5 e 4 ξ 5 0 5 e 5 ξ 6 0 5 e 6 since the dynamics model of underwater glider is nonlinear it is necessary to use higher order polynomial to fit the approximate function expression between the input errors and the evaluation parameter of motion deviation however to avoid too complicated fitting calculation the cross terms of polynomial shouldn t be heavily used referring to bao and wang 2015 the incomplete quartic polynomial is used to fit the approximate function expression here besides when all input errors are equal to 0 t error is equal to 0 too so the constant term of incomplete quartic polynomial is deleted further therefore the polynomial used by us is 27 t error β 1 ξ 1 β 2 ξ 2 β 3 ξ 3 β 4 ξ 4 β 5 ξ 5 β 6 ξ 6 β 7 ξ 1 2 β 8 ξ 2 2 β 9 ξ 3 2 β 10 ξ 4 2 β 11 ξ 5 2 β 12 ξ 6 2 β

the approximate expression of t error the sample points extracted in section 3 3 act as the fitting points based on the output values and normalized input values of fitting points the matrix form of eq 27 is 28 t e β ε where e represents the matrix consisting of the normalized input values of fitting points t represents the column vector consisting of the output values of fitting points β represents the column vector consisting of all β i and ϵ represents the column vector consisting of the fitting errors the specific expressions of e t β and ϵ are detailed in li et al 2014 referring to fang and perera 2011 li et al 2014 and bao and wang 2015 when ϵ t ϵ takes minimum the least square method gives 29 β e t e 1 e t t after all β i are obtained the approximate expression of t error can be obtained at the same time the approximate output values of fitting points are calculated by substituting the normalized input values into the approximate expression of t error to analyze the fitting effect of rsm more comprehensively just as the process of obtaining sample points in section 3 3 the 20 sets of input values of checking points are extracted from the ranges of table 1 then the output values t error of checking points are calculated based on the dynamics model and eq 24 meanwhile the input values of checking points are normalized and the approximate output values of checking points are calculated by substituting the normalized input values into the approximate expression of t error the root mean square error r mse and the coefficient of determination r 2 are used to assess the fitting effect wang et al 2017 wu et al 2018 and their expressions are 30 r mse i 1 20 t i c t i c 2 i 1 20 t i c 31 r 2 1 i 1 60 t i f t i f 2 i 1 60 t i f t f 2 where t i c represents the output value of the i th checking point calculated by dynamics model t i c represents the approximate output value of the i th checking point calculated by the approximate expression of t error t i f represents the output value of the i th fitting point calculated by dynamics model t i f represents the approximate output value of the i th fitting point calculated by the approximate expression of t error t f represents the mean value of all t i f the closer the r mse is to 0 the better the predictive capability of the approximate function expression to checking points is the closer the r 2 is to 1 the higher the fitting accuracy of the approximate function expression to fitting points is above fitting method is the conventional rsm referring to mathews and fink 2004 if the terms combination mode of the polynomial for fitting approximate function expression is unsuitable the polynomial wiggle will occur the polynomial wiggle will reduce the predictive capability of approximate function expression greatly to avoid above problem the key terms of polynomial are identified by optimization method here finally the approximate function expression is fitted by the polynomial including only the key terms the polynomial shown in eq 27 is taken as the example to show the method that the key terms are identified first we let each term of polynomial correspond to a number that can only take 0 or 1 the 1 represents that its corresponding term persists when fitting and the 0 represents that its corresponding term has been deleted therefore the 39 numbers with value of 0 or 1 are gotten next the 39 numbers are listed from left to right according to the order of β i so we can get a binary number with 39 bits then the above binary number is translated to a decimal number so the terms combination mode of the polynomial can be represented by this decimal number to prevent above decimal number being too large the 39 bit binary number is divided into a 19 bit binary and a 20 bit binary number denoted as τ 1 and τ 2 respectively the τ 1 corresponds to the terms whose coefficients are β 1 to β 19 and the τ 2 corresponds to the terms whose coefficients are β 20 to β 39 after translating τ 1 and τ 2 to the decimal numbers χ 1 and χ 2 we can use χ 1 and χ 2 to represent the terms combination mode of the polynomial for example if χ 1 χ 2 3 τ 1 0000000000000000011 and τ 2 00000000000000000011 and the polynomial for fitting approximate function expression is 32 t error β 18 ξ 2 ξ 3 β 19 ξ 2 ξ 4 β 38 ξ 5 4 β 39 ξ 6 4 by calculating β 18 β 19 β 38 and β 39 based on eq 29 the approximate function expression is obtained according to the above content the approximate function expression is fitted by only the fitting points and the checking points are only used to assess the predictive capability of approximate function expression therefore the closer the r mse is to 0 the weaker the polynomial wiggle is here we hope to obtain the optimal values of χ 1 and χ 2 whose corresponding approximate function expression gives the minimum r mse to ensure the fitting accuracy of the approximate function expression to fitting points the r 2 should be greater than a certain value according to the length of τ 1 and τ 2 the χ 1 is an integer with value range from 0 to 524287 and the χ 2 is an integer with value range from 0 to 1048575 since χ 1 and χ 2 have large ranges when the optimal terms combination mode of the polynomial is obtained by trying all possible values of both χ 1 and χ 2 a lot of time will be consumed therefore the optimal values of both χ1 and χ2 are obtained by optimization calculation here here χ 1 and χ 2 are set to the design variables in each iteration of optimization the approximate function expression corresponding to χ 1 and χ 2 is fitted firstly then both r mse and r 2 of the approximate function expression are calculated the optimization target is to minimize the r mse in addition the r 2 is constrained to be no less than 0 95 the optimization process not only ensures the fitting accuracy of the approximate function expression to fitting points but also ensures the predictive capability of the approximate function expression to checking points therefore the polynomial wiggle can be effectively weakened the optimization mathematical model is 33 min r mse s t 0 95 r 2 0 χ 1 524287 0 χ 2 1048575 the miga is used to complete the optimization calculation here the key parameters values of miga are shown in table 5 after optimization calculation the optimal values of χ1 and χ2 and their corresponding approximate function expression can be obtained above fitting method is called as the optimized response surface methodology orsm to sum up the flow of orsm is shown in fig 7 4 2 sensitivity calculation based on orsm the sample points extracted in section 3 3 are used to fit approximate function expressions and calculate r 2 the checking points extracted in section 4 1 are used to calculate r mse after optimization calculations the optimal values of both χ 1 and χ 2 are obtained under two kinds of motion modes as shown in table 6 then the optimized approximate function expressions of both t e vp and t e s are obtained as shown in eq 34 and eq 35 at the same time the approximate function expressions with 39 terms are fitted by using conventional rsm and the results act as the control group of orsm 34 t e vp 0 0331 ξ 5 0 314 ξ 6 9 59 ξ 1 2 7 85 ξ 3 2 2 53 ξ 5 2 1 76 ξ 6 2 7 56 ξ 1 ξ 2 0 0567 ξ 1 ξ 5 0 298 ξ 2 ξ 3 0 0421 ξ 2 ξ 6 5 67 ξ 3 ξ 5 0 120 ξ 4 ξ 5 0 239 ξ 1 3 0 208 ξ 4 3 0 174 ξ 6 3 4 35

that although the fitting accuracy of the optimized approximate function expressions to fitting points is slightly deteriorated their predictive capability to checking points gets largely improvement for checking points the output values calculated by dynamics model and the approximate output values are compared as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 the results show that the wiggle of fitting results of orsm is weaker than that of conventional rsm the coefficient β i of each term of both eq 34 and eq 35 reflects the effect extent of this term to output fang et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 ni et al 2019 to make a more intuitive comparison and identify the key input errors the coefficients of all terms are changed to the percentages the calculation formula of the percentages is 36 n i β i j 1 n β β j 100 where n i represents the contribution degree of the i th term to output a positive value represents the positive effect and a negative value represents the negative effect the n β represents the total number of terms of polynomial then the absolute values of n i are listed from large to small and the pareto diagrams are obtained by using the n i the sum of whose absolute values are more than 80 as shown in fig 10 and fig 11 the figs 10 and 11 show that the effects of input errors on motion deviations are nonlinear and the nonlinear factors are mainly the quadratic terms of input errors the reason for producing this analysis results may be that the formula of t error contains the sum of squares the terms of both ξ 4 and ξ 6 are not included in figs 10 and 11 therefore it can be inferred that e 4 and e 6 have little effects on the underwater glider motion to verify the above inference e 4 and e 6 are set to 0 minima and maxima respectively while other input errors keep 0 then different values of both e 4 and e 6 are used to calculate t error after dynamics simulation the different motion paths are compared as shown in fig 12 and fig 13 figs 12 and 13 show that the values of t error are small when e 4 and e 6 exist the motion paths with motion deviations are very close to the error free path the results can verify the correctness of the above inference fig 10 shows that ξ 1 and ξ 3 have larger effects on output and fig 11 shows that ξ 1 and ξ 2 have larger effects on output therefore it can be inferred that e 1 and e 3 have larger effects on the underwater glider motion of gliding in vertical plane and e 1 and e 2 have larger effects on the underwater glider motion of gliding spirally to verify the above inferences all input errors are set to 0 firstly then e 1 e 2 e 3 and e 5 are set to the minima and maxima in turn and the different values of t error are calculated by using the dynamics model the different motion paths are compared as shown in fig 14 and fig 15 fig 14 shows that the values of t error are larger when e 1 and e 3 exist and the motion paths under these states have larger deviations to the error free path fig 15 shows that the values of t error are larger when e 1 and e 2 exist and the motion paths under these states have larger deviations to the error free path the results can verify the correctness of the above inferences in addition fig 10 shows that ξ 3 ξ 5 has negative effect on output and fig 11 shows that ξ 2 ξ 3 and ξ 3 ξ 5 have negative effects on output therefore it can be inferred that the coexistence of e 3 and e 5 can offset partial motion deviations of gliding in vertical plane and the coexistence of e 2 and e 3 or e 3 and e 5 can offset partial motion deviations of gliding spirally to verify the above inferences aiming at the motion mode of gliding in vertical plane all input errors are set to 0 firstly next let e 3 1 and e 5 2 in turn and let e 3 1 simultaneous e 5 2 then the different values of t error are calculated by using the dynamics model and the different motion paths are compared as shown in fig 16 aiming at the motion mode of gliding spirally all input errors are set to 0 firstly next let e 2 0 002m e 3 1 and e 5 2 in turn let e 2 0 002m simultaneous e 3 1 and let e 3 1 simultaneous e 5 2 then the different values of t error are calculated by using the dynamics model and the different motion paths are compared as shown in fig 17 the results of figs 16 and 17 can verify the correctness of the above inferences all analysis results indicate that the control parameters errors especially the net buoyancy adjustment amount error and the yaw angle error should be small enough to avoid unacceptable motion deviations in addition the coexistence of particular input errors can offset motion deviations partially the research results provide significant guidance for the accuracy design of underwater glider such as the selection of controllers the accuracy design of control mechanism the accuracy control of launching attitude following the process we should enhance the accuracy of net buoyancy adjustment system as much as possible when facing a strict cost limitation and as the results say the accuracy of yaw angle should be paid highly attention to when launching the glider 5 conclusion the dynamics model of an underwater glider is established on this basis an evaluation parameter of motion deviation is proposed then considering the effects of two kinds of input errors namely the control parameters errors and launching attitude errors we quantitatively analyze the motion deviations of the glider for two frequently used working conditions the results show that the control parameters errors and launching attitude errors can cause great motion deviations then the orsm is proposed to study the sensitivity of input errors to motion deviations the numerical examples show that the approximate function expressions obtained by the orsm have better predictive capability than those obtained by conventional rsm in addition the control parameters errors have greater effects on motion deviations the pitch angle error and roll angle error have little effects on motion deviations moreover the coexistence of the movable internal mass block rotation amount error and yaw angle error can offset partial motion deviations of gliding in vertical plane the coexistence of the movable internal mass block translation amount error and movable internal mass block rotation amount error can offset partial motion deviations of gliding spirally the coexistence of the movable internal mass block rotation amount error and yaw angle error can also offset partial motion deviations of gliding spirally the research results provide significant guidance for the accuracy design of underwater glider the orsm proposed in this paper can also be applied to sensitivity analysis and optimization design for other systems the next step of this research is to study the effects of environmental factors on the motion of underwater glider and the effects of motion deviations on underwater glider formation acknowledgments this work is supported by the national

21757,this paper attempts to study the effects of control parameters errors and launching attitude errors on the motion of an underwater glider and these errors are collectively called as input errors the dynamics model of the underwater glider is established to simplify the quantitative characterization of motion deviation an evaluation parameter which can simultaneously characterize the path deviation and velocity deviation is proposed on these bases the motion deviations of the glider are quantitatively analyzed under two kinds of input errors the control parameters errors include the net buoyancy adjustment amount error the movable internal mass block translation amount error and the movable internal mass block rotation amount error the launching attitude errors include the roll angle error the yaw angle error and the pitch angle error then an optimized response surface methodology orsm is proposed to obtain the approximate function expressions between the input errors and the evaluation parameter of motion deviation in the orsm the multi island genetic algorithm miga is used to identify the key terms of polynomial and the approximate function expressions are fitted by the polynomials including only the key terms which can effectively weaken the polynomial wiggle after that the sensitivity analysis of input errors to motion deviations is achieved based on the above approximate function expressions the results indicate that all control parameters errors and the yaw angle error should be small enough to avoid unacceptable motion deviations in addition the

about 70 of earth surface is covered by water but for humans there are too many mysteries underwater in recent years with the progress of science and technology underwater exploration has become a research hotspot under this background underwater glider technology gets rapid development a normal underwater glider is designed as a winged underwater vehicle without external active propulsion system it can move up and down by adjusting its net buoyancy and adjust attitude by moving the translatable and rotatable internal mass blocks relying on the hydrodynamic forces exerted on a pair of wings the underwater glider can realize the space motion among various products and models of underwater glider commercially available glider the slocum webb et al 2001 the seaglider eriksen et al 2001 and the spray sherman et al 2001 would be typical ones since the underwater glider can realize the space motion without external active propulsion it has low energy consumption and is able to complete the large range long term underwater exploration missions in the design period it is indispensable to study the underwater glider performance using dynamics analysis methods leonard and graver 2001 bhatta and leonard 2003 graver 2005 and zhang et al 2013 established the rigid body dynamics models of underwater gliders by combining the linear momentum theorem the angular momentum theorem and the kinetic energy theorem and realized the simulations of the gliders space motions among these bhatta and leonard 2003 studied the stability control method and path following ability of underwater glider and zhang et al 2013 verified the dynamics modeling method using experimental data wang and wang 2009 simplified an underwater glider as a rigid body system deduced the gibbs function of the system and established the rigid body dynamics model of the glider using the gibbs appell equation wang et al 2006 and fan and woolsey 2014 established the rigid body dynamics models of underwater gliders using the second lagrange equation in which fan and woolsey 2014 considered the effects of unsteady and nonuniform currents additionally gu et al 2016 deduced the dynamics differential equations of an underwater glider using the kirchoff s equation solved the differential equations by runge kutta method and verified the calculation results using experimental data wang et al 2014 established the dynamic differential geometry model of an underwater glider using the riemannian differential geometry and affine connection and the comparison between model simulation results and experimental data showed a good agreement xue et al 2015 simplified an underwater glider formation as a multibody system constructed the artificial potential fields in the system and realized the motion analysis of the underwater glider formation based on the aforementioned research methods mahmoudian et al 2010 presented an approximate analytical expression for the steady turning motion of an underwater glider using perturbation theory hussain et al 2011 selected the ballast rate as the input achieved identification on net buoyancy depth and pitching angle of an underwater glider system yu et al 2013 increased the gliding range of an underwater glider by optimizing the steady motion parameters cao et al 2015 presented an approximate semi analytical solution for the steady spiral motion of an underwater glider after simplifying the motion equations rationally liu et al 2017 analyzed the effects of wing location on the spiral motion of an underwater glider and found the transition region that determines the turning direction of spiral motion yu et al 2018 gave a uniform description method of the underwater glider motion using the tangential velocity the vertical velocity and the angular velocity and analyzed the variation rules of the above three parameters under different control parameters values in some missions underwater gliders need to move at a specific path and velocity to explore specific waters and collect information sufficiently during formation voyages each glider must as well move at a specified path and velocity to keep formation to save glider s energy the feedback control of the glider is usually not real time continuous and there is a specific time interval between two successive feedback controls therefore it is necessary to accurately set the net buoyancy adjustment amount internal mass block translation amount internal mass block rotation amount glider launching attitude and glider launching location however in actual missions control parameters errors attitude errors and location errors can t be avoided so there will be inevitable path deviation and velocity deviation between the actual glider motion state and the ideal one these motion deviations will affect the smooth progress of actual mission therefore it is significant for practical applications of underwater glider to study the causes of motion deviations unfortunately above studies have not been reported almost in view of these the analysis methods of underwater glider motion deviations are studied in this paper the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives the dynamics model for an underwater glider with a cylindrically actuated movable internal mass block in section 3 the input errors are defined the evaluation parameter of motion deviation is presented and the motion deviations of the underwater glider are quantitatively analyzed using the design of experiment doe and optimization method in section 4 an optimized response surface methodology orsm is proposed to study the sensitivity of input errors to motion deviations section 5 summarizes the main contributions and points out the possible directions for continuing research 2 dynamics modeling of underwater glider this paper takes a small underwater glider developed by tianjin university as the research object and the structure of the glider is shown in fig 1 the battery pack of the glider is designed as a cylindrically actuated movable internal mass block by translating and rotating the movable internal mass block the attitude of the glider will be adjusted in addition the net buoyancy of the glider will be adjusted by changing the volume of external bladder therefore the control parameters of the glider include the net buoyancy adjustment amount the movable internal mass block translation amount and the movable internal mass block rotation amount for convenience the standard state of the glider is defined firstly the standard state refers to the state where the buoyancy and gravity of the whole glider are equal in value opposite and collinear in direction when the glider is placed horizontally hereafter the changes of control parameters values are determined based on the standard state since the net buoyancy adjustment amount of the glider is generally small the volume change amount of the external bladder is minute therefore compared with the position change of the whole glider barycenter caused by moving movable internal mass block the position change of the whole glider barycenter caused by changing external bladder volume is negligible graver 2005 in view of this the underwater glider is divided into two parts including the movable internal mass block and the glider body all parts except the movable internal mass block the two parts are both considered as rigid bodies whose masses are denoted as m p and m h respectively fig 2 shows the internal structure diagram of the glider where the four points from left to right denote the buoyancy center o e of the external bladder the barycenter o p of the movable internal mass block the buoyancy center o b of the whole glider under the standard state the barycenter o h of the glider body 2 1 coordinate frames and kinematic equations to realize the dynamics analysis of underwater glider we define two coordinate frames which are respectively fixed in the inertial space and glider body the inertial frame is represented by an orthonormal triad x axis y axis z axis and its origin is o the x axis and z axis form the horizontal plane the y axis is parallel to the direction of gravity the body frame is represented by an orthonormal triad x b axis y b axis z b axis and its origin is located at o b the x b axis coincides with the longitudinal axis of the glider the y b axis points to the bottom of the glider all coordinate frames obey the right hand rule as shown in fig 3 to improve the glider motion stability the whole glider barycenter is designed to be below its buoyancy center fan 2013 liu 2014 the distance between movable internal mass block barycenter o p and x b axis is denoted as y b where y b 0 016m according to fossen 2011 for underwater gliders the conventions are north east down ned for the inertial frame and surge sway heave ssh for the body frame therefore the z axis should be parallel to the direction of gravity and the z b axis should point to the bottom of the glider however to keep continuity in our research team the definitions of coordinate frames refer to liu 2014 in this paper the attitude of the body frame is described by roll angle φ pitch angle θ and yaw angle ψ the φ θ and ψ respectively denote the angles that the body frame rotates around the x axis z axis and y axis from the attitude coinciding with the inertial frame then the attitude angle vector of the body frame relative to the inertial frame is expressed as π φ ψ θ t according to fossen 2011 wang et al 2011 and liu 2014 the rotation matrix r be from the body frame to the inertial frame is expressed as 1 r be cos θ cos φ sin φ sin φ cos φ sin θ cos φ cos φ sin φ sin φ sin θ cos ψ sin θ cos φ cos θ sin φ cos θ cos θ sin φ sin φ cos φ cos φ sin θ sin φ cos φ cos φ sin φ sin θ sin φ the rotation matrix r eb from the inertial frame to the body frame is the transpose of r be the attack angle α and sideslip angle β are used to describe the direction of the glider resultant velocity in the body frame the linear velocity vector of the glider is expressed as v u v w t according to fossen 2011 wang et al 2011 and liu 2014 the expressions of α and β are 2 α arctan v u 3 β arcsin w u 2 v 2 w 2 in the inertial frame the position vector of the body frame relative to the inertial frame is expressed as b x y z t in the body frame the angular velocity vector of the glider is expressed as ω p q r t according to fossen 2011 wang et al 2011 and liu 2014 the kinematic differential equations of the glider are as follows 4 x y z r be u v w 5 φ ψ θ 1 cos φ tan θ sin φ tan θ 0 cos φ cos θ sin φ cos θ 0 sin φ cos φ p q r 2 2 force analysis under the standard state the buoyancy of the whole glider can be equivalent to a concentrated force exerted on the whole glider buoyancy center o b above concentrated force is denoted as b 0 after the net buoyancy is adjusted it is equivalent to exerting net buoyancy on the external bladder buoyancy center o e the net buoyancy is denoted as δ b in the motion process the underwater glider is also subjected to the gravity and hydrodynamic force here we let the gravity of the glider body be denoted as g h the gravity of the movable internal mass block be denoted as g p the inertial hydrodynamic force be denoted as f m and the viscous hydrodynamic force be denoted as f s since the action points of above forces may not coincide with the origin of the body frame o b when above forces are moved to o b additional moments may be generated here we let the additional moment generated by δ b be denoted as m b the additional moment generated by g h be denoted as m h the additional moment generated by g p be denoted as m p the additional moment generated by f m be denoted as m m and the additional moment generated by f s be denoted as m s m m and m s are called as the inertial hydrodynamic moment and viscous hydrodynamic moment respectively in addition the position vector of the glider body barycenter o h relative to the origin of the body frame o b is denoted as r h the position vector of the external bladder buoyancy center o e relative to o b is denoted as r b under the standard state the position vector of the movable internal mass block barycenter o p relative to o b is denoted as r p then the position change vector of o p is denoted as δ r here r h r b r p and δ r are all expressed in the body frame since the directions of both gravity and buoyancy are always parallel to the y axis of the inertial frame in the body frame the expressions of g h g p b 0 δ b m h m p and m b are as follows 6 g h m h r eb 0 m h g 0 t r h g h 7 g p m p r eb 0 m p g 0 t r p δ r g p 8 δ b m b r eb 0 ρ g v b 0 t r b δ b 9 b 0 r eb 0 m h m p g 0 t where g represents the gravitational acceleration ρ represents the density of water and v b represents the volume change amount of the external bladder since the glider body is symmetrical with respect to the x b o b y b plane of the body frame referring to fossen 2011 wang et al 2011 fan 2013 and liu 2014 in the body frame the expressions of the inertial hydrodynamic force and inertial hydrodynamic moment are simplified to 10 f m m m λ 11 0 0 0 λ 22 0 0 0 λ 33 0 0 0 0 0 λ 26 0 λ 35 0 0 0 0 0 0 λ 53 0 λ 62 0 λ 44 0 0 0 λ 55 0 0 0 λ 66 v ω where λ 11 λ 22 and λ 33 represent the added mass λ 44 λ 55 and λ 66 represent the added moment of inertia λ 26 λ 35 λ 53 and λ 62 represent the added static moment according to jones et al 2002 fossen 2011 wang et al 2011 and liu 2014 in the body frame the expressions of the viscous hydrodynamic force and viscous hydrodynamic moment are as follows 11 f s m s 0 5 ρ v 2 s c x 0 5 ρ v 2 s c y α α c y r r 0 5 ρ v 2 s c z β β c z p p c z q q 0

hydrodynamic moment coefficients which are obtained by experiment and computational fluid dynamics method fan 2013 zhang et al 2013 liu 2014 s represents the characteristic area of the glider l represents the characteristic length of the glider p q r represent pl v ql v rl v respectively 2 3 dynamics modeling and simulation the linear momentum theorem and angular momentum theorem are employed to establish the dynamics model of the underwater glider the correctness of this modeling method has been verified by our research team liu 2014 since the changing process of control parameters values is not considered in our subsequent research the dynamics modeling omits the mutual movement process between the movable internal mass block and the glider body in the inertial frame and relative to its origin o the linear momentum of the glider is denoted as p e and the angular momentum of the glider is denoted as l e in the body frame and relative to its origin o b the linear momentum of the glider is denoted as p b and the angular momentum of the glider is denoted as l b since the whole glider barycenter does not coincide with o b p b and l b can be represented as 12 p b l b m h m p v ω r g j o ω m h m p r g v where j o represents the inertia tensor of the glider relative to the body frame which is calculated based on the inertia tensor j p of the movable internal mass block relative to its own barycenter the inertia tensor j h of the glider body relative to its own barycenter and the parallel axis theorem fossen 2011 liu 2014 r g represents the position vector of the whole glider barycenter relative to o b which is expressed as 13 r g m h r h m p r p δ r m h m p based on the kinematic relation there are 14 b r be v r be r be ω ˆ 15 p e r be p b l e r be l b b p e where the operator ˆ maps a vector to the matrix representation of the vector cross product operator leonard and graver 2001 for any vector a a 1 a 2 a 3 t and x there are 16 a ˆ 0 a 3 a 2 a 3 0 a 1 a 2 a 1 0 17 a ˆ x a x the newton s second law gives 18 p e f l e τ b f where f and τ represent the resultant force and resultant moment respectively which are exerted on o b and expressed in the inertial frame combining eq 15 and eq 18 there is 19 f r be ω ˆ p b r be p b τ b f r be ω ˆ l b r be l b b p e r be v r be p b in the body frame the resultant force and resultant moment are denoted as f and m respectively which are ascertained by the sum of eq 6 to eq 11 then eq 19 can be presented as 20 p b p b ω f l b l b ω p b v m substituting eq 12 into eq 20 we can get 21 m h m p v ω r g m h m p v ω r g ω f j o ω m h m p r g v j o ω m h m p r g v ω m h m p v ω r g v m combining eq 4 eq 5 and eq 21 the dynamics model of the glider is established and the key parameters values of the model are listed in the appendix in this paper the dynamics model is solved by the fourth order explicit runge kutta method liu 2014 gu et al 2016 the total time of dynamics simulation is set to 1000s and the simulation step size δt is set to 0 1s therefore the number of iteration is 10000 denoted as n through simulation test this step size can make the equal step size runge kutta method achieve the same accuracy as the adaptive variable step size runge kutta method used by liu 2014 and gu et al 2016 the equal step size runge kutta method is conducive to establishing a unified evaluation criterion in the subsequent calculation since the length limitation of this paper the two frequently used working conditions of this glider are selected for our study here we do not consider the specific control process and only consider the control parameters values after the control process is completed i e before the glider is launched the control parameters values have been adjusted the vectors v b π and ω are all set to 0 at the moment of launching the glider on this basis the net buoyancy is set to 0 3 0 tn which is expressed in the inertial frame and represents the diving motion in the first numerical example the movable internal mass block is translated along the x b axis by 0 01m i e δ r 0 01 0 0 tm then the path of o b in which the glider glides in vertical plane is obtained by simulation calculation on the basis of the first numerical example the movable internal mass block is additionally rotated around the x b axis by 20 i e δ r 0 01 y b cos20 1 y b sin20 tm which is the second numerical example then the path of o b in which the glider glides spirally is obtained by simulation calculation in this paper the paths of o b are defined as the glider motion paths as shown in fig 4 the results show that the dynamics model can simulate the two basic space motions of the underwater glider 3 motion deviation analysis of underwater glider to make the glider move at a specific path and velocity it is necessary to accurately set the net buoyancy adjustment amount movable internal mass block translation amount movable internal mass block rotation amount launching attitude and launching location in fact control parameters errors launching attitude errors and launching location errors can t be avoided so there will be inevitable path deviation and velocity deviation between the actual glider motion state and the ideal one therefore this paper focuses on the effects of the above errors on the underwater glider motion in addition considering that the launching location errors only make the final motion path translate a certain distance we won t discuss the effects of them further in this section the path deviation and velocity deviation are called as the motion deviation collectively the evaluation parameter of motion deviation is proposed based on established dynamics model then under given conditions the motion deviations of underwater glider are quantitatively analyzed using the design of experiment doe and optimization method 3 1 input errors in this paper the input errors include the control parameters errors and launching attitude errors the control parameters errors include the net buoyancy adjustment amount error e 1 the movable internal mass block translation amount error e 2 and the movable internal mass block rotation amount error e 3 here we focus on the effects of the error values of control parameters so the specific control process is not considered the launching attitude errors include the roll angle error e 4 the yaw angle error e 5 and the pitch angle error e 6 according to wang et al 2011 and liu 2014 and engineering experience the ranges of e i are given in table 1 the input errors make the control parameters and launching attitude angles deviate from their ideal values actually the complex environmental factors such as ocean currents can also lead to motion deviation even without the input errors however the purpose of this paper is to study the effects of the errors carried by the glider itself so we carried out this research in a relative ideal state by excluding the effects of the environmental factors 3 2 evaluation parameter of motion deviation under the ideal motion state the path deviation and velocity deviation of the glider are supposed to be 0 at the same time for convenience of subsequent calculation process the evaluation parameter which can simultaneously characterize the path deviation and velocity deviation is proposed according to section 2 3 the dynamics model is solved by the runge kutta method and the step size of iterative calculation is δt the result of the i th iterative calculation of runge kutta method is the position coordinate of the glider at i δt time and it is denoted as x i y i z i after n iterative calculations the matrix d representing the position coordinates of each moment is obtained as 22 d x 1 y 1 z 1 x n y n z n for convenience the control parameters and launching attitude angles are collectively called as input parameters here the d which is calculated by substituting the ideal input parameters values into the dynamics model is denoted as d 0 further and the i th row of d 0 is denoted as x 0i y 0i z 0i the d which is calculated by substituting the input parameters values including input errors into the dynamics model is denoted as d e further and the i th row of d e is denoted as x ei y ei z ei d 0 and d e are obtained by two simulation calculations then the motion deviation can be determined by the discrepancy between d 0 and d e here we use frobenius norm f to assess the discrepancy between d 0 and d e which is as follows 23 d 0 d e f 2 i 1 n x 0 i x e i 2 y 0 i y e i 2 z 0 i z e i 2 according to eq 23 d 0 d e f 2 means the quadratic sum of position deviations of each moment between the ideal path and the path with errors then the evaluation parameter of motion deviation is defined as 24 t error d 0 d e f 2 n where the unit of t error is meter the t error is used to assess the position deviations of each moment between two space motions t error 0 means that d e is equal to d 0 that is to say the position coordinates of two space motions are the same at each moment so the velocities of two space motions are the same therefore although the core of t error is to calculate the position deviations of each moment t error also reflect the velocity deviations the larger the t error is the larger the motion deviation is 3 3 motion deviation calculation to save energy the feedback control of the glider is not real time continuous and there is time interval of about 1000s between two successive feedback controls when we calculate the motion deviation using control parameters errors caused by a single control process the calculation result is enough to reflect the effects of control parameters errors on the glider motion explicitly therefore to avoid complicated calculation the control parameters values switching is not considered here besides due to the error cumulative effect and the feedback control pattern the input errors caused by the initial control have greater effects on the whole motion process therefore we study the effects of the errors that exist at the moment of launching the glider and the two numerical examples in section 2 3 are set to ideal motion states to analyze the motion deviations however our analysis method and flow can also be used in other situations such as when considering different initial conditions and other types of underwater gliders based on the two numerical examples in section 2 3 the d 0 can be obtained firstly when we consider the effects of input errors the δ r of the first numerical example of section 2 3 is changed to 0 01 e 2 y b cos e 3 1 y b sin e 3 tm and the δ r of the second numerical example of section 2 3 is changed to 0 01 e 2 y b cos 20 e 3 1 y b sin 20 e 3 tm besides the net buoyancy is changed to 0 3 e 1 0 tn and the π is changed to e 4 e 5 e 6 t at the moment of launching the glider then the d e can be obtained by substituting above input parameters values into the dynamics model and the t error can be calculated based on eq 24 to comprehensively analyze the motion deviations 60 sets of input errors values are extracted from the ranges of table 1 by optimal latin hypercube experimental design then input parameters values including input errors are correspondingly obtained by substituting above input parameters values into the dynamics model we can get corresponding d e and corresponding t error the 60 sets of input errors values are called as input values of sample points and their corresponding t error are called as output values of sample points to differentiate the two kinds of motion modes of the glider the t error of gliding in vertical plane is denoted as t e vp and the t error of gliding spirally is denoted as t e s for sample points the means and standard deviations of both t e vp and t e s are calculated as shown in table 2 to obtain the maximum motion deviations caused by the input errors we use optimization method to seek the maximum t error and its corresponding input errors values rather than traverse the whole input errors space aimlessly in each iteration of optimization the dynamics model is used to calculate the t error and the input errors are set to the design variables the optimization mathematical model is 25 max t error s t 0 2 n e 1 0 2 n 0 002 m e 2 0 002 m 1 e 3 1 2 e i 2 i 4 5 6 in this paper the multi island genetic algorithm miga is used to complete the optimization calculation according to hu et al 2014 based on the conventional genetic algorithms ga miga divides the design variables space into multiple areas called as islands the same as the conventional ga the individuals on each island can achieve crossover and mutation further to get the elites different from the conventional ga the elites can achieve migration between the islands in view of these miga can avoid the local optimal solution better and is more suitable for nonlinear optimization problems in this section the key parameters values of miga are shown in table 3 after optimization calculations the maximum t e vp and t e s and their corresponding input errors values are obtained as shown in table 4 the motion paths with maximum motion deviations and the ideal motion paths are compared as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 the results show that control parameters errors and launching attitude errors have great effects on the glider motion with the increasing of time the motion deviations have further increasing trend 4 sensitivity analysis of input errors in this section the sensitivity of input errors to motion deviations is analyzed based on response surface methodology rsm the rsm can fit the approximate function expression between the input errors and the evaluation parameter of motion deviation using polynomial and a small number of sample points then the sensitivity analysis can be achieved directly by using the approximate function expression which is very convenient and time saving such as zhao et al 2014 however when the conventional rsm is used to fit the approximate function expression of the nonlinear dynamics model the polynomial wiggle may occur mathews and fink 2004 which will affect the predictive capability of the approximate function expression therefore an optimized response surface methodology orsm is proposed here in the orsm the key terms of the polynomial for fitting approximate function expression are identified by miga to weaken the polynomial wiggle then the orsm is used to achieve the sensitivity analysis 4 1 optimized response surface methodology before the approximate function expression is fitted the e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 and e 6 are normalized by scaling their ranges to 1 1 to avoid the effects of their different ranges the normalized input errors are 26 ξ 1 5 e 1 ξ 2 500 e 2 ξ 3 e 3 ξ 4 0 5 e 4 ξ 5 0 5 e 5 ξ 6 0 5 e 6 since the dynamics model of underwater glider is nonlinear it is necessary to use higher order polynomial to fit the approximate function expression between the input errors and the evaluation parameter of motion deviation however to avoid too complicated fitting calculation the cross terms of polynomial shouldn t be heavily used referring to bao and wang 2015 the incomplete quartic polynomial is used to fit the approximate function expression here besides when all input errors are equal to 0 t error is equal to 0 too so the constant term of incomplete quartic polynomial is deleted further therefore the polynomial used by us is 27 t error β 1 ξ 1 β 2 ξ 2 β 3 ξ 3 β 4 ξ 4 β 5 ξ 5 β 6 ξ 6 β 7 ξ 1 2 β 8 ξ 2 2 β 9 ξ 3 2 β 10 ξ 4 2 β 11 ξ 5 2 β 12 ξ 6 2 β

the approximate expression of t error the sample points extracted in section 3 3 act as the fitting points based on the output values and normalized input values of fitting points the matrix form of eq 27 is 28 t e β ε where e represents the matrix consisting of the normalized input values of fitting points t represents the column vector consisting of the output values of fitting points β represents the column vector consisting of all β i and ϵ represents the column vector consisting of the fitting errors the specific expressions of e t β and ϵ are detailed in li et al 2014 referring to fang and perera 2011 li et al 2014 and bao and wang 2015 when ϵ t ϵ takes minimum the least square method gives 29 β e t e 1 e t t after all β i are obtained the approximate expression of t error can be obtained at the same time the approximate output values of fitting points are calculated by substituting the normalized input values into the approximate expression of t error to analyze the fitting effect of rsm more comprehensively just as the process of obtaining sample points in section 3 3 the 20 sets of input values of checking points are extracted from the ranges of table 1 then the output values t error of checking points are calculated based on the dynamics model and eq 24 meanwhile the input values of checking points are normalized and the approximate output values of checking points are calculated by substituting the normalized input values into the approximate expression of t error the root mean square error r mse and the coefficient of determination r 2 are used to assess the fitting effect wang et al 2017 wu et al 2018 and their expressions are 30 r mse i 1 20 t i c t i c 2 i 1 20 t i c 31 r 2 1 i 1 60 t i f t i f 2 i 1 60 t i f t f 2 where t i c represents the output value of the i th checking point calculated by dynamics model t i c represents the approximate output value of the i th checking point calculated by the approximate expression of t error t i f represents the output value of the i th fitting point calculated by dynamics model t i f represents the approximate output value of the i th fitting point calculated by the approximate expression of t error t f represents the mean value of all t i f the closer the r mse is to 0 the better the predictive capability of the approximate function expression to checking points is the closer the r 2 is to 1 the higher the fitting accuracy of the approximate function expression to fitting points is above fitting method is the conventional rsm referring to mathews and fink 2004 if the terms combination mode of the polynomial for fitting approximate function expression is unsuitable the polynomial wiggle will occur the polynomial wiggle will reduce the predictive capability of approximate function expression greatly to avoid above problem the key terms of polynomial are identified by optimization method here finally the approximate function expression is fitted by the polynomial including only the key terms the polynomial shown in eq 27 is taken as the example to show the method that the key terms are identified first we let each term of polynomial correspond to a number that can only take 0 or 1 the 1 represents that its corresponding term persists when fitting and the 0 represents that its corresponding term has been deleted therefore the 39 numbers with value of 0 or 1 are gotten next the 39 numbers are listed from left to right according to the order of β i so we can get a binary number with 39 bits then the above binary number is translated to a decimal number so the terms combination mode of the polynomial can be represented by this decimal number to prevent above decimal number being too large the 39 bit binary number is divided into a 19 bit binary and a 20 bit binary number denoted as τ 1 and τ 2 respectively the τ 1 corresponds to the terms whose coefficients are β 1 to β 19 and the τ 2 corresponds to the terms whose coefficients are β 20 to β 39 after translating τ 1 and τ 2 to the decimal numbers χ 1 and χ 2 we can use χ 1 and χ 2 to represent the terms combination mode of the polynomial for example if χ 1 χ 2 3 τ 1 0000000000000000011 and τ 2 00000000000000000011 and the polynomial for fitting approximate function expression is 32 t error β 18 ξ 2 ξ 3 β 19 ξ 2 ξ 4 β 38 ξ 5 4 β 39 ξ 6 4 by calculating β 18 β 19 β 38 and β 39 based on eq 29 the approximate function expression is obtained according to the above content the approximate function expression is fitted by only the fitting points and the checking points are only used to assess the predictive capability of approximate function expression therefore the closer the r mse is to 0 the weaker the polynomial wiggle is here we hope to obtain the optimal values of χ 1 and χ 2 whose corresponding approximate function expression gives the minimum r mse to ensure the fitting accuracy of the approximate function expression to fitting points the r 2 should be greater than a certain value according to the length of τ 1 and τ 2 the χ 1 is an integer with value range from 0 to 524287 and the χ 2 is an integer with value range from 0 to 1048575 since χ 1 and χ 2 have large ranges when the optimal terms combination mode of the polynomial is obtained by trying all possible values of both χ 1 and χ 2 a lot of time will be consumed therefore the optimal values of both χ1 and χ2 are obtained by optimization calculation here here χ 1 and χ 2 are set to the design variables in each iteration of optimization the approximate function expression corresponding to χ 1 and χ 2 is fitted firstly then both r mse and r 2 of the approximate function expression are calculated the optimization target is to minimize the r mse in addition the r 2 is constrained to be no less than 0 95 the optimization process not only ensures the fitting accuracy of the approximate function expression to fitting points but also ensures the predictive capability of the approximate function expression to checking points therefore the polynomial wiggle can be effectively weakened the optimization mathematical model is 33 min r mse s t 0 95 r 2 0 χ 1 524287 0 χ 2 1048575 the miga is used to complete the optimization calculation here the key parameters values of miga are shown in table 5 after optimization calculation the optimal values of χ1 and χ2 and their corresponding approximate function expression can be obtained above fitting method is called as the optimized response surface methodology orsm to sum up the flow of orsm is shown in fig 7 4 2 sensitivity calculation based on orsm the sample points extracted in section 3 3 are used to fit approximate function expressions and calculate r 2 the checking points extracted in section 4 1 are used to calculate r mse after optimization calculations the optimal values of both χ 1 and χ 2 are obtained under two kinds of motion modes as shown in table 6 then the optimized approximate function expressions of both t e vp and t e s are obtained as shown in eq 34 and eq 35 at the same time the approximate function expressions with 39 terms are fitted by using conventional rsm and the results act as the control group of orsm

that although the fitting accuracy of the optimized approximate function expressions to fitting points is slightly deteriorated their predictive capability to checking points gets largely improvement for checking points the output values calculated by dynamics model and the approximate output values are compared as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 the results show that the wiggle of fitting results of orsm is weaker than that of conventional rsm the coefficient β i of each term of both eq 34 and eq 35 reflects the effect extent of this term to output fang et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 ni et al 2019 to make a more intuitive comparison and identify the key input errors the coefficients of all terms are changed to the percentages the calculation formula of the percentages is 36 n i β i j 1 n β β j 100 where n i represents the contribution degree of the i th term to output a positive value represents the positive effect and a negative value represents the negative effect the n β represents the total number of terms of polynomial then the absolute values of n i are listed from large to small and the pareto diagrams are obtained by using the n i the sum of whose absolute values are more than 80 as shown in fig 10 and fig 11 the figs 10 and 11 show that the effects of input errors on motion deviations are nonlinear and the nonlinear factors are mainly the quadratic terms of input errors the reason for producing this analysis results may be that the formula of t error contains the sum of squares the terms of both ξ 4 and ξ 6 are not included in figs 10 and 11 therefore it can be inferred that e 4 and e 6 have little effects on the underwater glider motion to verify the above inference e 4 and e 6 are set to 0 minima and maxima respectively while other input errors keep 0 then different values of both e 4 and e 6 are used to calculate t error after dynamics simulation the different motion paths are compared as shown in fig 12 and fig 13 figs 12 and 13 show that the values of t error are small when e 4 and e 6 exist the motion paths with motion deviations are very close to the error free path the results can verify the correctness of the above inference fig 10 shows that ξ 1 and ξ 3 have larger effects on output and fig 11 shows that ξ 1 and ξ 2 have larger effects on output therefore it can be inferred that e 1 and e 3 have larger effects on the underwater glider motion of gliding in vertical plane and e 1 and e 2 have larger effects on the underwater glider motion of gliding spirally to verify the above inferences all input errors are set to 0 firstly then e 1 e 2 e 3 and e 5 are set to the minima and maxima in turn and the different values of t error are calculated by using the dynamics model the different motion paths are compared as shown in fig 14 and fig 15 fig 14 shows that the values of t error are larger when e 1 and e 3 exist and the motion paths under these states have larger deviations to the error free path fig 15 shows that the values of t error are larger when e 1 and e 2 exist and the motion paths under these states have larger deviations to the error free path the results can verify the correctness of the above inferences in addition fig 10 shows that ξ 3 ξ 5 has negative effect on output and fig 11 shows that ξ 2 ξ 3 and ξ 3 ξ 5 have negative effects on output therefore it can be inferred that the coexistence of e 3 and e 5 can offset partial motion deviations of gliding in vertical plane and the coexistence of e 2 and e 3 or e 3 and e 5 can offset partial motion deviations of gliding spirally to verify the above inferences aiming at the motion mode of gliding in vertical plane all input errors are set to 0 firstly next let e 3 1 and e 5 2 in turn and let e 3 1 simultaneous e 5 2 then the different values of t error are calculated by using the dynamics model and the different motion paths are compared as shown in fig 16 aiming at the motion mode of gliding spirally all input errors are set to 0 firstly next let e 2 0 002m e 3 1 and e 5 2 in turn let e 2 0 002m simultaneous e 3 1 and let e 3 1 simultaneous e 5 2 then the different values of t error are calculated by using the dynamics model and the different motion paths are compared as shown in fig 17 the results of figs 16 and 17 can verify the correctness of the above inferences all analysis results indicate that the control parameters errors especially the net buoyancy adjustment amount error and the yaw angle error should be small enough to avoid unacceptable motion deviations in addition the coexistence of particular input errors can offset motion deviations partially the research results provide significant guidance for the accuracy design of underwater glider such as the selection of controllers the accuracy design of control mechanism the accuracy control of launching attitude following the process we should enhance the accuracy of net buoyancy adjustment system as much as possible when facing a strict cost limitation and as the results say the accuracy of yaw angle should be paid highly attention to when launching the glider 5 conclusion the dynamics model of an underwater glider is established on this basis an evaluation parameter of motion deviation is proposed then considering the effects of two kinds of input errors namely the control parameters errors and launching attitude errors we quantitatively analyze the motion deviations of the glider for two frequently used working conditions the results show that the control parameters errors and launching attitude errors can cause great motion deviations then the orsm is proposed to study the sensitivity of input errors to motion deviations the numerical examples show that the approximate function expressions obtained by the orsm have better predictive capability than those obtained by conventional rsm in addition the control parameters errors have greater effects on motion deviations the pitch angle error and roll angle error have little effects on motion deviations moreover the coexistence of the movable internal mass block rotation amount error and yaw angle error can offset partial motion deviations of gliding in vertical plane the coexistence of the movable internal mass block translation amount error and movable internal mass block rotation amount error can offset partial motion deviations of gliding spirally the coexistence of the movable internal mass block rotation amount error and yaw angle error can also offset partial motion deviations of gliding spirally the research results provide significant guidance for the accuracy design of underwater glider the orsm proposed in this paper can also be applied to sensitivity analysis and optimization design for other systems the next step of this research is to study the effects of environmental factors on the motion of underwater glider and the effects of motion deviations on underwater glider formation acknowledgments this work is supported by the national

21758,the energy harvesting device with flapping foil has the characteristic of environmental adaptability particularly in shallow water this study applies a transient numerical calculation method based on a dynamic grid technique in an absolute coordinate system to analyze the flow fields and pressure distributions of a flapping airfoil near a ground wall the effects of reynolds number re average ground clearance and effective angle of attack on the power extraction efficiency of the flapping airfoil are investigated with respect to variations in the oscillation frequency the simulation results indicate that the ground effect can greatly increase the power extraction efficiency of the flapping airfoil and that the highest efficiency is obtained at an optimum average ground clearance this ground effect is asymmetric over the course of flapping airfoil motion toward and away from the ground wall and the efficiency is most increased as the airfoil moves far from or closely to the ground wall the formation of the corresponding divergent or convergent tunnel effects alters the flow fields and pressure distributions around the airfoil near the leading edge and in particular decreases the pressure on the suction side which results in an overall increase in the heaving force and a correspondingly increased power harvesting capability with or without the ground effect the efficiency of the flapping airfoil firstly increases and then decreases with increasing oscillation frequency or effective angle of attack at constant re and average ground clearance values moreover the positive impact of the ground wall effect on the power extraction efficiency of the airfoil becomes increasingly obvious when the oscillation frequency and the angle of attack are increased simultaneously finally the oscillation frequency obtaining the highest power extraction efficiency in conjunction with the ground effect decreases as the flow fields transition from laminar to turbulent flow with increasing re keywords flapping wing energy harvesting ground effect reynolds number normalized effective angle of attack average ground clearance 1 introduction the development of efficient and clean renewable energy resources has become increasingly urgent in view of the increasing consumption of fossil fuels and the resulting environmental pollution the flapping propulsion motion of animals such as birds fish and aquatic animals has recently inspired the development of flapping wing motion for energy acquisition from wind and water sources xiao and zhu 2014 young et al 2014 compared with conventional energy harvesting devices employing turbines flapping wing energy extraction devices have the advantages of simple design low noise little environmental impact and application over a wide range of scenarios therefore the development of flapping wing energy harvesting devices has significant potential and application prospects the concept of flapping wing movement was originated from bionics birds flight and marine life gain propulsion and lift by flapping their wings and have attracted widespread attention because of their excellent maneuverability wu et al wu and chwang 1975 found that fish and birds could extract energy from wave stream through flapping their wings to improve propulsion performance grue et al 2006 theoretically examined a propulsion of an oscillating foil moving in water below the free surface they discovered that a relatively large amount of the wave energy may be extracted for propulsion triantafyllou et al 2000 reviewed recent experimental and theoretical works with oscillating flexible bodies and fins in water for identifying the principal mechanism of producing propulsive and transient forces related to the formation and control of the large scale vortices rozhdestvensky et al rozhdestvensky and ryzhov 2003 focused on the aero hydrodynamics of flapping wing propulsors by numerical simulation and compared it with the experimental data to determine the physical factors and design parameters that enable the flapping propeller to work effectively priovolos et al 2018 used a vortex based method to study the flexible flapping wings combing heaving and pitching motion with appropriate phase difference it is found that the chordwise flexibility could significantly improve the propulsion performance of the flapping wing hover hover et al 2004 compared the difference of propulsion performance obtained with four types of profiles of specific angle attack i e simple harmonic motion a square wave a symmetric sawtooth wave and a cosine function the results indicate that the cosine function achieves a significant improvement in the sense of high thrust value with reasonable efficiency miao et al miao and ho 2006 investigated the effect of chord wise flexure amplitude on unsteady aerodynamic characteristics for a flapping wing based on conformal hybrid meshes and dynamic mesh techniques they suggested that the propulsive efficiency of flapping wing is improved obviously with a value of 1 3 chord length for the flexure amplitude heathcote et al 2008 experimentally explored the effect of spanwise flexibility on the thrust lift and propulsive efficiency of a rectangular wing it was reported that appropriate spanwise flexibility could increase the thrust coefficient the ability of a harmonically oscillating wing to extract wind energy was firstly investigated by mckinney and de laurier mckinney and delaurier 1981 their experiments indicate that when the dimensionless frequency of the flapping wing is 0 12 and the effective pitching amplitude is 30 the flapping wing could achieve the best energy efficiency since then the concept of flapping wing energy harvesting has received widespread attention and undergone extensive experimental and simulation studies for example simpson et al 2008 experimentally studied the energy extraction performance of flapping foils at reynolds number re equals 13 800 with various motion parameters considered they found that overall efficiencies of up to 43 3 are achieved with the sinusoidal motions le et al le and ko 2015 considered the effect of hydrofoil flexibility on the power extraction of a flapping tidal generator via two and three dimensional flow simulations the results show that the effect of the spanwise flexure on the power extraction is smaller than that of the chordwise flexure xu et al 2017 designed a practical flapping foil generator and found that higher efficiency could be achieved at medium reduced frequency in experiments the experimental results conducted by kim and strom in a water flume show that the aspect ratio of the hydrofoil has a great effect on energy harvesting performance which is mainly due to the delayed growth of the leading edge vortices near the ends of the hydrofoil kim et al 2017 xu et al xu and sun 2015 analyze the fluid dynamics of a passive oscillating hydrofoil for tidal current energy extracting the results reveal that the power extracted from the incoming flow comes mainly from the heaving motion while the energy contribution from pitching motion is quite limited at present most research focused on the development and analysis of flapping wing energy harvesting devices has been conducted based on numerical simulation because compared with experimental research simulations can quickly and efficiently obtain the energy harvesting properties of a flapping wing design with various parameter changes and analyze the complex flow field structures and their evolution numerous studies have investigated the effects of wing geometry on the power extraction efficiency of flapping wing devices for example wang et al 2016 investigated the effects of wing geometry by numerically evaluating the power extraction efficiency of flapping hydrofoils with different national advisory committee for aeronautics naca series foil shapes their results indicated that the maximum foil thickness had a greater influence on the efficiency than the maximum camber position zhao et al 2016 proposed a concept flapping foil design to harvest ocean wave energy and numerical simulation studies revealed that the design could greatly increase the wave energy harvesting capability compared to traditional designs le et al 2013 numerically investigated the energy extraction process of a scallop shell shaped hydrofoil design based on two dimensional 2d simulation the results indicated that adjusting the morphological factors of the hydrofoil design could improve the power extraction efficiency of a flapping wing type tidal stream generator due to the strong impact of these factors on the strength of leading edge vortices kinsey et al kinsey and dumas 2012 conducted three dimensional 3d numerical simulation and found that the relative drop of power extraction efficiency due to 3d hydrodynamic losses could be limited to only 10 of the predicted power extraction efficiency based on 2d numerical simulation when endplates are used on foils with aspect ratios greater than 1 deng et al 2014 also examined the relationship between the power extraction efficiency and the aspect ratio of foils the results identified a critical aspect ratio of 4 for sinusoidal pitching motions and determined that the 3d characteristics of low aspect ratio foils will dominate the flow evolution for aspect ratios below this critical value in addition numerous studies have investigated the effects of kinematic parameters on the power extraction efficiency of flapping wing devices for example teng et al 2016 numerically investigated the power extraction efficiency of a semi active flapping foil and found that non sinusoidal pitching motions could improve the efficiency of the system when the pitching amplitude is small zhu et al zhu and tian 2017 proposed a time asymmetric pitching motion for a semi active flapping wing power generator numerical results indicated that an optimal time asymmetric pitching motion increased the maximal energy coefficient to a value as high as 17 greater than that obtained under the time symmetric mode finally numerous studies have investigated the effects of the spatial layout parameters of multiple foils on the power extraction efficiency of flapping wing devices for example deng et al 2007 employed the lattice boltzmann method lbm to numerically investigate the hydrodynamic interactions between two tandem foils undergoing a fishlike swimming motion in moving air the results demonstrated that the increase in the power extraction efficiency of the downstream airfoil is related to the strouhal number st here the efficiency of the upstream airfoil is greater than a single airfoil at any st when the two airfoils are very close and the efficiency gradually approaches that of a single airfoil as the distance between the airfoils increases karbasian et al 2015 numerically investigated the power extraction efficiency of a number of flapping hydrofoils in a tandem formation at low reynolds number re their results demonstrated that a limited number of flapping hydrofoils are required in a tandem formation to obtain the maximum power xu et al xu and xu 2017 numerically investigated the interactions between two flapping foils in tandem configurations in particular they analyzed the effects of longitudinal distance and the phase shift of the foil motion on the power extraction efficiency xu and sun xu et al 2016 investigated the interaction effects of wake vortices on the power extraction efficiency of tandem oscillating hydrofoils the results demonstrated that tandem oscillating hydrofoils have a greater power extraction efficiency than a single hydrofoil for an optimal oscillation frequency and a suitable hydrofoil separation distance while these previous studies have investigated the energy harvesting properties of flapping wing designs from the perspectives of numerous parameters little work has been conducted to investigate the effect of a ground wall on the power extraction efficiencies of flapping wing devices the wing in ground wig effect was discovered for airplanes by raymond in 1921 raymond 1921 here an airfoil approaching the ground was found to produce a high lift together with a reduction in the induced drag however most existing studies have mainly focused on the impact of this ground effect on the propulsion performance of flapping wing structures for example jones et al 2002 reported that the ground effect can significantly improve the propulsion performance of a flapping wing based on the experimental and numerical investigation and also established that the re has a considerable influence on this improvement gao and lu 2008 applied the lbm to investigate the ground effect during the normal hovering flight of insects the ground effect was determined to impact the thrust according to three modes which included force enhancement force reduction and force recovery mivehchi et al 2016 experimentally investigated the ground effect for propulsive flapping foils operating near a wall the results demonstrated that the impact of the ground effect could be adjusted by the appropriate selection of kinematic parameters lin et al 2018 conducted 2d numerical simulations to investigate the influence of an asymmetrical heaving motion on the aerodynamic performance of a flapping wing near a wall the results indicated that the mean thrust coefficient is enhanced when the duration of the upstroke is reduced however there are relatively few researches considering the influence of ground effect on the energy harvesting properties of a flapping wing wu et al 2014a 2015a 2015b ever used the lbm to perform the power extraction of a pitching motion activated flapping foil near solid walls they found that the energy harvesting efficiency of the flapping wing near a wall is improved the above reviewed studies indicate that the ground effect has a significant impact on the propulsion of flapping wing structures correspondingly it is proved that the ground effect also has a significant impact on the power extraction efficiency of flapping wing devices this is particularly significant because flapping wing structures designed for energy harvesting have the advantage of being widely deployed in shallow water environments for which the ground effect can be expected to be substantial moreover shallow water environments have been the focus of relatively few studies therefore systematically evaluating the influence of the ground effect on the energy extraction characteristics of flapping wing structures is essential for optimizing the design of shallow water energy harvesting installations to this end this study applies the transient numerical calculation method based on a dynamic grid technique in absolute coordinates to investigate the flow fields and pressure distributions of a flapping wing structure near the ground the influences of re average ground clearance and effective angle of attack on the power extraction efficiency under varying oscillation frequencies are investigated the impact of the ground effect on the power extraction efficiency with respect to varying parameters is analyzed from the perspective of the observed flow field distributions 2 methods and validation 2 1 foil motion as shown in fig 1 the periodic motion of a flapping wing energy harvesting device can be simplified as combined periodic heaving and pitching motions here u represents the velocity of uniform incoming flow h t is the instantaneous distance between the foil pitching axis and the ground at time t h m represents the maximum displacement of the heaving motion θ t is the instantaneous pitching angle at t and θ m is the maximum pitching amplitude in the present study the pitch axis position x p is fixed at 1 3c from the leading edge where c is the chord length of the foil thus the combined periodic heaving and pitching motions of the foil are defined as 1 θ t θ m s i n 2 π f t 2 h t h 0 h m s i n 2 π f t φ where f is the oscillation frequency h 0 is the average value of h t over a single heaving motion cycle and φ is the phase angle difference between the heaving and pitching motions the present study employs φ 90 which has been demonstrated to support an optimum power extraction efficiency for flapping wing devices xiao and zhu 2014 young et al 2014 the instantaneous velocity of the heaving motion and the angular velocity of the pitching motion are respectively given as 3 v y t 2 π f h m c o s 2 π f t φ 4 ω t 2 π f θ m c o s 2 π f t the direction of the surface force on the foil enables it to have both energy extraction and propulsion modes the direction of the surface force on the foil varies periodically according to the angle of attack aoa which is expressed as 5 α t arctan d h t d t u θ t then the nominal effective aoa of the foil is the maximum aoa value over a single oscillation cycle of period t the nominal effective aoa is generally approximated over a quarter cycle as follows 6 α n α t 4 θ m a r c t a n 2 π f h m u according to the results of kinsey and dumas 2012 the foil is in the propulsion mode when α n 0 and the foil is in the energy extraction mode when α n 0 the present research considers the energy extraction of the flapping foil for five nominal effective aoa values of 10 20 30 40 and 50 the total power extracted by a flapping wing consists of two components denoted as p y t and p θ t where p y t derives from the contribution of the heaving force f y t and p θ t derives from the pitching moment m t with respect to the center of rotation the instantaneous values are expressed as 7 p y t f y t v y t 8 p θ t m t ω t as a result the total average power extraction coefficient c p extracted over a single oscillation period t can be computed as the sum of the energy coefficients extracted from the contribution of f y t denoted as c p y and from the pitching moment m t denoted as c p θ as follows 9 c p c p y c p θ 0 1 c p y c p θ d t t 0 1 c y t v y t u c m t ω t c u d t t here c y f y t 0 5 ρ c 2 u 2 and c m m θ t 0 5 ρ c 3 u 2 where ρ is the density of the working fluid and the coefficient of drag force is defined as c x f x t 0 5 ρ c 2 u 2 where f x t is the drag force the average coefficients of c x c y a n d c m are defined as the same of c p in eq 9 finally the power extraction efficiency η can be calculated as the ratio of the energy gained by the flapping wing to the energy derived from the kinetic energy of incoming flow over t as 10 η c p c d where d is the maximum vertical distance swept by the flapping wing 2 2 numerical method we conducted 2d numerical simulations in this study using the commercial software ansys fluent here simulations were limited to two dimensions because the impact of different parameters related to the ground effect such as h 0 re f and α n on η are effectively revealed without resorting to time consuming 3d conditions the specific numerical strategy employed here to simulate the heaving and pitching motions of the flapping wing with ground effect was to separate the entire rectangular computational domain into two parts as illustrated in fig 2 here one part adopted a circular domain around the foil undergoing both heaving and pitching motions simultaneously and the other part included the remainder of the original domain with a stationary boundary while allowing only the internal mesh layering to move in the vertical direction we employed various user defined functions udfs for these dynamic mesh operations data exchange between the circular subdomain and the remaining external domain were realized using an interface model denoted as the sliding mesh technique the overall calculation range was 85c 70c in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the circular subdomain adopted a radius equal to 5c a fixed static pressure value was applied for the outlet flow condition at the right hand boundary a uniform velocity in the x direction was used for the incoming flow at the left hand boundary meanwhile the top boundary was prescribed as symmetry boundary condition to isolate the free surface effect in this study and the bottom ground boundary was set as a non slip wall 2 3 validation the proposed numerical strategy was validated utilizing two cases one case was a flapping foil at infinite water depth and the other was a flapping foil near a ground wall in the case of infinite water depth 2d simulations of the flapping foil model without a ground wall i e h 0 were applied employing a naca 0015 airfoil over a sufficient number of oscillation periods under working conditions of re 1 1 103 a dimensionless frequency f f c u 0 14 h m c 1 θ m 76 33 and x p c 1 3 the influence of mesh size on the mean drag coefficient c x maximum of heaving force and moment coefficients c ˆ y c ˆ m and η was investigated according to kinsey s work kinsey and dumas 2008 2000 time steps is sufficient for a single oscillation cycle under laminar flow conditions the values obtained over the final oscillation period are listed in table 1 which are also compared with the simulation data obtained by kinsey with fluent and tian with immersed boundary method tian et al 2014 as can be seen from table 1 the values of c x and c ˆ y are nearly insensitive to the mesh size employed moreover the difference in η among all test cases is less than 1 the simulation results obtained with 60 000 grids are basically equivalent to those obtained by kinsey and tian therefore this was the final grid size selected for subsequent calculations in addition we present the instantaneous values of c x t c y t and c m t obtained in the present work and those obtained from kinsey s simulation work over a single oscillation period in fig 3 we note that our results are nearly equivalent to kinsey s data as for the working conditions under high re the shear strain transport sst turbulence model is suitable and this model is adopted herein according to our previous works zhu et al 2018 2019 wang et al 2019 besides a numerical simulation of flapping foil close to the ground wall was carried out employing a naca 0012 airfoil under working conditions of re 150 f 0 125 h m c 0 4 θ m 45 and h 0 c 3 as shown in fig 4 the present results can agree well with those of wu s lbm simulation data wu et al 2014b therefore the subsequent numerical simulation results with the validated method proposed in this paper should have high reliability 3 results and analysis based on the validated numerical method the power extraction performance of an naca 0015 flapping airfoil was systematically studied with respect to the ground effect the investigated parameters are summarized in table 2 where h 0 c represents no ground effect and h m c 1 and x p c 1 3 are uniformly applied in all simulations 3 1 effect of ground clearance on power extraction efficiency fig 5 presents the value of η with respect to variations in h 0 for re 1 1 103 f 0 15 and α n 20 the results indicate that η increases firstly with increasing h 0 to a maximum value at h 0 2 8c and then decreases we also note that the ground effect becomes negligible as h 0 approaches 34c to explain the observed changes in η with respect to changes in h 0 we plot the instantaneous coefficients of heaving forces c y t pitching moments c m t and power extraction coefficients c py t c pθ t obtained for different values of h 0 over a single period in fig 6 generally the existence of a ground wall increases the value of c y compared with the case of no ground wall and this increase is most obvious when h 0 2 8c furthermore the direction of v y t is basically in accordance with that of c y t under the considered conditions fig 5 a and this ensures that f y t provides a generally positive contribution during t the value of c py t attains local maxima when the airfoil moves closely to the ground at around t t 0 25 and when the airfoil moves far away from the ground at around t t 0 75 fig 5 b however the peak value at t t 0 75 is greater than that at t t 0 25 in the vicinity of t t 0 75 c py t increases with respect to h 0 for h 0 values in the order of 1 8c 5 8c and 2 8c in addition the results listed in table 3 indicate that the behavior of c p y with respect to h 0 is equivalent to that of c py t in the vicinity of t t 0 75 in addition the contribution of m t to energy extraction is negative over nearly the entire oscillation period and table 3 indicates that c p θ increases with respect to h 0 for h 0 values in the order of 1 8c 5 8c and 2 8c therefore because c p c p θ c p y from eq 9 the maximum value of η is obtained at h 0 2 8c we also note from fig 6 b that c py t varies widely for different h 0 when the pitching angle of the airfoil is approximately at its maximum value θ m therefore the vortex and pressure distributions around the flapping airfoil will be investigated for specific times s1 t t 0 24 indicated with short vertical line when the airfoil is moving toward the ground wall and s2 t t 0 72 when the airfoil is moving far from the wall figs 7 and 8 present the vortex and pressure distributions around the flapping airfoil with different values of h 0 at moments s1 and s2 respectively in addition fig 9 presents static pressure coefficients around the airfoil and the velocity distributions at location signed with direction arrow in figs 7 and 8 at s1 and s2 strong interactions are observable between detached vortices and the ground boundary layer and the strength of this effect increases with decreasing h 0 at s1 a tunnel effect increases the flow velocity through the clearance which decreases the pressure on the lower surface of the airfoil i e the suction surface near the leading edge as shown in figs 7 and 9 a and c here static pressure coefficient is defined as c p s p s p 0 0 5 ρ u 2 where p s is the local static pressure p 0 is the reference pressure thus we obtain the highest value of c y t at s1 for h 0 1 8c meanwhile at s2 the rear part of the airfoil with its clockwise rotation quickly narrows the clearance because x p is located 1 3c from the leading edge of the airfoil the resulting converged tunnel shape will impede the passing fluid reduce the fluid velocity and inversely increase the pressure under the lower surface of the airfoil the pressure surface relative to that obtained with no ground effect in addition fig 9 b and d indicate further that the velocity increases and the pressure decreases around the leading edge on the upper surface of the airfoil the suction surface thus the combined contributions from the pressure and suction surfaces will make the total lift at s2 greater than that at s1 for a specific h 0 accordingly the effect of the ground wall on the airfoil lift is greater when the flapping wing is moving away from the wall than when it is approaching the wall we also observe from the vortex distribution in fig 8 a for h 0 1 8c that the trailing region of the airfoil has entered into the boundary layer at s2 and some low momentum working fluid within the circled region of the figure remains near the trailing region this will obstruct fluid flowing from the upper surface of the airfoil and thus increase the pressure on the suction surface relative to that obtained with h 0 values of 2 8c and 5 8c this is also demonstrated in fig 9 b and d therefore a suitable h 0 must exist that makes full use of the ground effect for ensuring that the flapping airfoil obtains the highest power extraction efficiency possible 3 2 effect of effective angle of attack on the power extraction efficiency fig 10 presents the values of η obtained for the flapping airfoil with respect to f values in the range 0 05 0 225 for different values of α n in the range 10 50 with re 1 1 103 and h 0 1 8c similar variational trends of η with respect to f are observed for the different values of α n with or without the ground effect where η increases firstly and then decreases with increasing f and the value of f obtaining a maximum η decreases as α n is increased fig 11 presents the contours of η and δ η η η 1 8 c in the parametric space f α n for the flapping airfoil without the ground effect h 0 and with the ground effect h 0 1 8c here the white colored region in the figure at high values of both α n and f represents the region over which the flapping airfoil is operating in the propulsion mode and is consuming energy while the gray colored region in the figure at low f and α n indicates that the ground effect negatively contributes to the energy generation of the flapping airfoil it can be seen that the contribution of the ground effect toward increasing η increases with increasing f and α n which is illustrated by the direction of the arrow in fig 11 b however this region of parametric space with increasing ground effect is not optimum and the overall efficiency is not high therefore suitable operation parameters must be selected within the high efficiency range of the flapping airfoil which also ensure a significant contribution from the ground effect fig 12 presents the instantaneous values of c y t c py t c m t and c pθ t with respect to α n with re 1 1 103 f 0 15 and h 0 1 8c over a single period we note that the peak values of c py t increase firstly with increasing α n and then decrease fig 12 b meanwhile both c m t and c pθ t increase monotonically with increasing α n fig 12 c and d in addition we note that the variation of α n modifies the synchronization of directions between v y t and c y t here the direction of c y t corresponds well with the direction of v y t during the majority of the period i e they have the same signs when α n 30 at the selected parameters this results in a more positive contribution of c py t thereby increasing the value of η for the flapping airfoil besides while α n affects the value of c m t it has a smaller effect on the phase relationship between ω t and c m t seen in fig 12 c in general m t provides a negative contribution over the entire oscillation period nevertheless at f 0 15 m t provides a positive contribution within the time ranges nearby t t 0 45 and t t 0 95 as a result m t provides a positive integral of work over a single oscillation period and thus the value of η is increased this can be explained by the evolution process of the leading edge vortex according to the previous study baik et al 2012 the formation evolution and shedding of the leading edge vortex under low re and f values are consistent with the behavior of the flapping motion and the airfoil can therefore utilize the energy of the leading edge vortex to assist the wing in performing its pitching motion 3 3 effect of reynolds number on the power extraction efficiency fig 13 a and b presents the values of η obtained for the flapping airfoil with respect to f for α n 20 and h 0 1 8c i e with the ground effect under laminar and turbulent flow conditions respectively owing to re values of 5 0 102 1 1 103 1 1 104 and 5 0 105 for laminar flow we can see that the ground wall has little effect on η at relatively low values of f but η is significantly increased at medium and high values of f we also note that the value of η increases with increasing re and the effective range of f is widened in the direction of low f for turbulent flow η is significantly increased for re 1 1 104 at medium values of f while η is greatly increased for re 5 0 105 at medium and low values of f and is decreased at high f in general the region of f over which the value of η significantly increases first appears in the region of middle and high f under laminar flow conditions and then moves gradually in the direction of decreasing f with increasing re under turbulent flow conditions fig 14 presents the contours of η and δη in the parametric space f re without and with the ground effect for an naca 0015 flapping airfoil at fixed parameters of α n 20 and h 0 1 8c the results indicate that the high efficiency range roughly occurs around f 0 15 for the flapping airfoil without the ground effect under laminar flow conditions at low re however with increasing re the maximal value of η increases and the high efficiency range of f gradually moves toward higher f as illustrated in fig 14 a by the arrow with the ground effect the high efficiency range of f moves from high to low values of f with increasing re as illustrated in fig 14 b by the arrow in addition we find that the ground effect has the most significant impact on η in the region of medium re values 104 re 105 and medium f values around f 0 15 meanwhile the ground effect reduces the energy harvesting capability of the flapping airfoil in the regions of high re and high f or low re and low f as indicated by the gray colored areas in the figure the effect of re on η for the flapping airfoil with and without the ground wall is evaluated in greater detail by plotting the evolutions of c y t c py t and c pθ t over a single period in fig 15 at f values of 0 1 and 0 2 and at a low re of 1 1 103 and a high re of 5 105 in addition the integrated values c p y c p θ and η at these values of re and f are listed in table 4 as shown in fig 15 a the variational characteristics of η in the first half period t t values in the range 0 0 5 when re 1 1 103 and f 0 1 indicates that the ground effect initially increases the amplitude of c y t relative to that without the ground effect while the amplitude of c y t becomes less than that without the ground effect at about t t 0 38 this indicates that the impact of the ground effect cannot be completely synchronized with the flapping airfoil motion in addition the data in table 4 indicates that c y t generally provides the same energy extraction contribution for the flapping airfoil with or without the ground effect and c m t provides only a slight contribution over the entire oscillation period therefore η cannot be increased by the ground effect at low re and low f as shown in fig 15 b the ground effect increases the amplitude of c y t over the second half of the oscillation period relative to that without the ground effect when re 5 0 105 and f 0 1 and the synchronization between c y t and v y t with almost the same symbol is good in addition the ground effect has little impact on c pθ t during the entire cycle as a consequence the ground effect significantly increases η when the flapping airfoil operates at middle or low f and at a high re as shown in fig 15 c the amplitude of c y t for the flapping airfoil with the ground effect is nearly always increased than that without ground wall during the time periods t t of 0 2 0 3 and 0 7 1 0 when re 1 1 103 and f 0 2 and the synchronization between c y t and v y t is good this ensures that c y t generally plays a substantially positive role during energy harvesting however the synchronization between c y t and v y t is poor at around t t 0 4 which results in a negative contribution during energy harvesting nonetheless the negative impact of the ground effect around t t 0 4 and the positive impact around t t 0 9 nearly offset each other as a result the ground effect can increase η at low re and high f operation conditions as shown in table 4 as shown in fig 15 d the impact of the ground effect on c y t and c py t is nearly asymmetrical during the entire oscillation period when re 5 0 105 and f 0 2 here the impact of the ground effect on c y t is negative in the first period of t t in the range 0 0 5 and positive in the second period of t t in the range 0 5 1 0 and both nearly offset each other therefore the ground effect cannot increase η at high re and high f operation conditions the effects of re on η for the flapping airfoil with the ground wall are further analyzed by plotting the vortex distributions around the airfoil at specific moments with re 1 1 103 and re 5 0 105 in fig 16 and fig 17 for f 0 1 and f 0 2 respectively we note from fig 16 that strongly detached vortex evolutions occur around the flapping airfoil under laminar flow conditions at f 0 1 fig 16 a while only weakly attached vortices occur around the flapping airfoil under turbulent flow conditions fig 16 b which ensures that the flapping airfoil obtains a high magnitude c y t therefore η generally increases with increasing re however the flapping airfoil can also obtain a high efficiency if it operates at a suitable frequency such as f 0 15 as discussed previously we note that the moment when the detached vortex moves from the leading edge to the trailing edge matches well with the motion of the airfoil thus the airfoil efficiency can benefit from utilizing the energy from the detached vortex we also note from fig 17 that the effect of re at f 0 2 on the vortex distribution is similar to that obtained at f 0 1 except for a slight increase in the intensity a comparison of figs 16 and 17 indicates that increasing f from 0 1 to 0 2 alters the moment in time when a detached vortex passes the same location of the airfoil for the same re which alters the evolution phase between vortex motion and airfoil motion these results are substantiated by the poor synchronization observed between c y t and v y t nearby t t 0 4 as well as by the good synchronization observed between c y t and v y t nearby t t 0 9 as shown in fig 15 in addition we can see that the thickness of the boundary layer decreases substantially with increasing re 4 conclusions in this research a transient numerical method based on a dynamic grid technique in an absolute coordinate system was adopted to study the flow fields of a flapping airfoil near a ground wall the effects of reynolds number average ground clearance and effective angle of attack on the power extraction efficiency of the flapping airfoil were investigated with respect to variations in oscillation frequency the results can be summarized as follows 1 the ground effect can greatly increase the power extraction efficiency of a flapping airfoil and an optimum average ground clearance can be determined for ensuring the highest extraction efficiency for the flapping airfoil 2 the positive impact of the ground effect on the power extraction efficiency is asymmetric over the course of flapping airfoil motion toward and away from the ground wall the formation of corresponding divergent or convergent tunnel effects alters the flow fields and pressure distributions around the airfoil near the leading edge and in particular decreases the pressure on the suction side which increases the overall heaving force and its power harvesting capability 3 under constant reynolds number and average ground clearance values the power extraction efficiency of the flapping airfoil with or without the ground effect increases firstly and then decreases with increasing oscillation frequency or effective angle of attack moreover the positive impact of the ground wall effect on the energy harvesting performance of the airfoil becomes increasingly obvious when the oscillation frequency and the angle of attack are increased simultaneously 4 with the increasing of reynolds number for the flapping airfoil with the positive ground effect the range of oscillation frequency with high efficiency moves gradually from the high frequency to low frequency credit authorship contribution

21758,the energy harvesting device with flapping foil has the characteristic of environmental adaptability particularly in shallow water this study applies a transient numerical calculation method based on a dynamic grid technique in an absolute coordinate system to analyze the flow fields and pressure distributions of a flapping airfoil near a ground wall the effects of reynolds number re average ground clearance and effective angle of attack on the power extraction efficiency of the flapping airfoil are investigated with respect to variations in the oscillation frequency the simulation results indicate that the ground effect can greatly increase the power extraction efficiency of the flapping airfoil and that the highest efficiency is obtained at an optimum average ground clearance this ground effect is asymmetric over the course of flapping airfoil motion toward and away from the ground wall and the efficiency is most increased as the airfoil moves far from or closely to the ground wall the formation of the corresponding divergent or convergent tunnel effects alters the flow fields and pressure distributions around the airfoil near the leading edge and in particular decreases the pressure on the suction side which results in an overall increase in the heaving force and a correspondingly increased power harvesting capability with or without the ground effect the efficiency of the flapping airfoil firstly increases and then decreases with increasing oscillation frequency or effective angle of attack at constant re and average ground clearance values moreover the positive impact of the ground wall effect on the power extraction efficiency of the airfoil becomes increasingly obvious when the oscillation frequency and the angle of attack are increased simultaneously finally the oscillation frequency obtaining the highest power extraction efficiency in conjunction with the ground effect decreases as the flow fields transition from laminar to turbulent flow with increasing re keywords flapping wing energy harvesting ground effect reynolds number normalized effective angle of attack average ground clearance 1 introduction the development of efficient and clean renewable energy resources has become increasingly urgent in view of the increasing consumption of fossil fuels and the resulting environmental pollution the flapping propulsion motion of animals such as birds fish and aquatic animals has recently inspired the development of flapping wing motion for energy acquisition from wind and water sources xiao and zhu 2014 young et al 2014 compared with conventional energy harvesting devices employing turbines flapping wing energy extraction devices have the advantages of simple design low noise little environmental impact and application over a wide range of scenarios therefore the development of flapping wing energy harvesting devices has significant potential and application prospects the concept of flapping wing movement was originated from bionics birds flight and marine life gain propulsion and lift by flapping their wings and have attracted widespread attention because of their excellent maneuverability wu et al wu and chwang 1975 found that fish and birds could extract energy from wave stream through flapping their wings to improve propulsion performance grue et al 2006 theoretically examined a propulsion of an oscillating foil moving in water below the free surface they discovered that a relatively large amount of the wave energy may be extracted for propulsion triantafyllou et al 2000 reviewed recent experimental and theoretical works with oscillating flexible bodies and fins in water for identifying the principal mechanism of producing propulsive and transient forces related to the formation and control of the large scale vortices rozhdestvensky et al rozhdestvensky and ryzhov 2003 focused on the aero hydrodynamics of flapping wing propulsors by numerical simulation and compared it with the experimental data to determine the physical factors and design parameters that enable the flapping propeller to work effectively priovolos et al 2018 used a vortex based method to study the flexible flapping wings combing heaving and pitching motion with appropriate phase difference it is found that the chordwise flexibility could significantly improve the propulsion performance of the flapping wing hover hover et al 2004 compared the difference of propulsion performance obtained with four types of profiles of specific angle attack i e simple harmonic motion a square wave a symmetric sawtooth wave and a cosine function the results indicate that the cosine function achieves a significant improvement in the sense of high thrust value with reasonable efficiency miao et al miao and ho 2006 investigated the effect of chord wise flexure amplitude on unsteady aerodynamic characteristics for a flapping wing based on conformal hybrid meshes and dynamic mesh techniques they suggested that the propulsive efficiency of flapping wing is improved obviously with a value of 1 3 chord length for the flexure amplitude heathcote et al 2008 experimentally explored the effect of spanwise flexibility on the thrust lift and propulsive efficiency of a rectangular wing it was reported that appropriate spanwise flexibility could increase the thrust coefficient the ability of a harmonically oscillating wing to extract wind energy was firstly investigated by mckinney and de laurier mckinney and delaurier 1981 their experiments indicate that when the dimensionless frequency of the flapping wing is 0 12 and the effective pitching amplitude is 30 the flapping wing could achieve the best energy efficiency since then the concept of flapping wing energy harvesting has received widespread attention and undergone extensive experimental and simulation studies for example simpson et al 2008 experimentally studied the energy extraction performance of flapping foils at reynolds number re equals 13 800 with various motion parameters considered they found that overall efficiencies of up to 43 3 are achieved with the sinusoidal motions le et al le and ko 2015 considered the effect of hydrofoil flexibility on the power extraction of a flapping tidal generator via two and three dimensional flow simulations the results show that the effect of the spanwise flexure on the power extraction is smaller than that of the chordwise flexure xu et al 2017 designed a practical flapping foil generator and found that higher efficiency could be achieved at medium reduced frequency in experiments the experimental results conducted by kim and strom in a water flume show that the aspect ratio of the hydrofoil has a great effect on energy harvesting performance which is mainly due to the delayed growth of the leading edge vortices near the ends of the hydrofoil kim et al 2017 xu et al xu and sun 2015 analyze the fluid dynamics of a passive oscillating hydrofoil for tidal current energy extracting the results reveal that the power extracted from the incoming flow comes mainly from the heaving motion while the energy contribution from pitching motion is quite limited at present most research focused on the development and analysis of flapping wing energy harvesting devices has been conducted based on numerical simulation because compared with experimental research simulations can quickly and efficiently obtain the energy harvesting properties of a flapping wing design with various parameter changes and analyze the complex flow field structures and their evolution numerous studies have investigated the effects of wing geometry on the power extraction efficiency of flapping wing devices for example wang et al 2016 investigated the effects of wing geometry by numerically evaluating the power extraction efficiency of flapping hydrofoils with different national advisory committee for aeronautics naca series foil shapes their results indicated that the maximum foil thickness had a greater influence on the efficiency than the maximum camber position zhao et al 2016 proposed a concept flapping foil design to harvest ocean wave energy and numerical simulation studies revealed that the design could greatly increase the wave energy harvesting capability compared to traditional designs le et al 2013 numerically investigated the energy extraction process of a scallop shell shaped hydrofoil design based on two dimensional 2d simulation the results indicated that adjusting the morphological factors of the hydrofoil design could improve the power extraction efficiency of a flapping wing type tidal stream generator due to the strong impact of these factors on the strength of leading edge vortices kinsey et al kinsey and dumas 2012 conducted three dimensional 3d numerical simulation and found that the relative drop of power extraction efficiency due to 3d hydrodynamic losses could be limited to only 10 of the predicted power extraction efficiency based on 2d numerical simulation when endplates are used on foils with aspect ratios greater than 1 deng et al 2014 also examined the relationship between the power extraction efficiency and the aspect ratio of foils the results identified a critical aspect ratio of 4 for sinusoidal pitching motions and determined that the 3d characteristics of low aspect ratio foils will dominate the flow evolution for aspect ratios below this critical value in addition numerous studies have investigated the effects of kinematic parameters on the power extraction efficiency of flapping wing devices for example teng et al 2016 numerically investigated the power extraction efficiency of a semi active flapping foil and found that non sinusoidal pitching motions could improve the efficiency of the system when the pitching amplitude is small zhu et al zhu and tian 2017 proposed a time asymmetric pitching motion for a semi active flapping wing power generator numerical results indicated that an optimal time asymmetric pitching motion increased the maximal energy coefficient to a value as high as 17 greater than that obtained under the time symmetric mode finally numerous studies have investigated the effects of the spatial layout parameters of multiple foils on the power extraction efficiency of flapping wing devices for example deng et al 2007 employed the lattice boltzmann method lbm to numerically investigate the hydrodynamic interactions between two tandem foils undergoing a fishlike swimming motion in moving air the results demonstrated that the increase in the power extraction efficiency of the downstream airfoil is related to the strouhal number st here the efficiency of the upstream airfoil is greater than a single airfoil at any st when the two airfoils are very close and the efficiency gradually approaches that of a single airfoil as the distance between the airfoils increases karbasian et al 2015 numerically investigated the power extraction efficiency of a number of flapping hydrofoils in a tandem formation at low reynolds number re their results demonstrated that a limited number of flapping hydrofoils are required in a tandem formation to obtain the maximum power xu et al xu and xu 2017 numerically investigated the interactions between two flapping foils in tandem configurations in particular they analyzed the effects of longitudinal distance and the phase shift of the foil motion on the power extraction efficiency xu and sun xu et al 2016 investigated the interaction effects of wake vortices on the power extraction efficiency of tandem oscillating hydrofoils the results demonstrated that tandem oscillating hydrofoils have a greater power extraction efficiency than a single hydrofoil for an optimal oscillation frequency and a suitable hydrofoil separation distance while these previous studies have investigated the energy harvesting properties of flapping wing designs from the perspectives of numerous parameters little work has been conducted to investigate the effect of a ground wall on the power extraction efficiencies of flapping wing devices the wing in ground wig effect was discovered for airplanes by raymond in 1921 raymond 1921 here an airfoil approaching the ground was found to produce a high lift together with a reduction in the induced drag however most existing studies have mainly focused on the impact of this ground effect on the propulsion performance of flapping wing structures for example jones et al 2002 reported that the ground effect can significantly improve the propulsion performance of a flapping wing based on the experimental and numerical investigation and also established that the re has a considerable influence on this improvement gao and lu 2008 applied the lbm to investigate the ground effect during the normal hovering flight of insects the ground effect was determined to impact the thrust according to three modes which included force enhancement force reduction and force recovery mivehchi et al 2016 experimentally investigated the ground effect for propulsive flapping foils operating near a wall the results demonstrated that the impact of the ground effect could be adjusted by the appropriate selection of kinematic parameters lin et al 2018 conducted 2d numerical simulations to investigate the influence of an asymmetrical heaving motion on the aerodynamic performance of a flapping wing near a wall the results indicated that the mean thrust coefficient is enhanced when the duration of the upstroke is reduced however there are relatively few researches considering the influence of ground effect on the energy harvesting properties of a flapping wing wu et al 2014a 2015a 2015b ever used the lbm to perform the power extraction of a pitching motion activated flapping foil near solid walls they found that the energy harvesting efficiency of the flapping wing near a wall is improved the above reviewed studies indicate that the ground effect has a significant impact on the propulsion of flapping wing structures correspondingly it is proved that the ground effect also has a significant impact on the power extraction efficiency of flapping wing devices this is particularly significant because flapping wing structures designed for energy harvesting have the advantage of being widely deployed in shallow water environments for which the ground effect can be expected to be substantial moreover shallow water environments have been the focus of relatively few studies therefore systematically evaluating the influence of the ground effect on the energy extraction characteristics of flapping wing structures is essential for optimizing the design of shallow water energy harvesting installations to this end this study applies the transient numerical calculation method based on a dynamic grid technique in absolute coordinates to investigate the flow fields and pressure distributions of a flapping wing structure near the ground the influences of re average ground clearance and effective angle of attack on the power extraction efficiency under varying oscillation frequencies are investigated the impact of the ground effect on the power extraction efficiency with respect to varying parameters is analyzed from the perspective of the observed flow field distributions 2 methods and validation 2 1 foil motion as shown in fig 1 the periodic motion of a flapping wing energy harvesting device can be simplified as combined periodic heaving and pitching motions here u represents the velocity of uniform incoming flow h t is the instantaneous distance between the foil pitching axis and the ground at time t h m represents the maximum displacement of the heaving motion θ t is the instantaneous pitching angle at t and θ m is the maximum pitching amplitude in the present study the pitch axis position x p is fixed at 1 3c from the leading edge where c is the chord length of the foil thus the combined periodic heaving and pitching motions of the foil are defined as 1 θ t θ m s i n 2 π f t 2 h t h 0 h m s i n 2 π f t φ where f is the oscillation frequency h 0 is the average value of h t over a single heaving motion cycle and φ is the phase angle difference between the heaving and pitching motions the present study employs φ 90 which has been demonstrated to support an optimum power extraction efficiency for flapping wing devices xiao and zhu 2014 young et al 2014 the instantaneous velocity of the heaving motion and the angular velocity of the pitching motion are respectively given as 3 v y t 2 π f h m c o s 2 π f t φ 4 ω t 2 π f θ m c o s 2 π f t the direction of the surface force on the foil enables it to have both energy extraction and propulsion modes the direction of the surface force on the foil varies periodically according to the angle of attack aoa which is expressed as 5 α t arctan d h t d t u θ t then the nominal effective aoa of the foil is the maximum aoa value over a single oscillation cycle of period t the nominal effective aoa is generally approximated over a quarter cycle as follows 6 α n α t 4 θ m a r c t a n 2 π f h m u according to the results of kinsey and dumas 2012 the foil is in the propulsion mode when α n 0 and the foil is in the energy extraction mode when α n 0 the present research considers the energy extraction of the flapping foil for five nominal effective aoa values of 10 20 30 40 and 50 the total power extracted by a flapping wing consists of two components denoted as p y t and p θ t where p y t derives from the contribution of the heaving force f y t and p θ t derives from the pitching moment m t with respect to the center of rotation the instantaneous values are expressed as 7 p y t f y t v y t 8 p θ t m t ω t as a result the total average power extraction coefficient c p extracted over a single oscillation period t can be computed as the sum of the energy coefficients extracted from the contribution of f y t denoted as c p y and from the pitching moment m t denoted as c p θ as follows 9 c p c p y c p θ 0 1 c p y c p θ d t t 0 1 c y t v y t u c m t ω t c u d t t here c y f y t 0 5 ρ c 2 u 2 and c m m θ t 0 5 ρ c 3 u 2 where ρ is the density of the working fluid and the coefficient of drag force is defined as c x f x t 0 5 ρ c 2 u 2 where f x t is the drag force the average coefficients of c x c y a n d c m are defined as the same of c p in eq 9 finally the power extraction efficiency η can be calculated as the ratio of the energy gained by the flapping wing to the energy derived from the kinetic energy of incoming flow over t as 10 η c p c d where d is the maximum vertical distance swept by the flapping wing 2 2 numerical method we conducted 2d numerical simulations in this study using the commercial software ansys fluent here simulations were limited to two dimensions because the impact of different parameters related to the ground effect such as h 0 re f and α n on η are effectively revealed without resorting to time consuming 3d conditions the specific numerical strategy employed here to simulate the heaving and pitching motions of the flapping wing with ground effect was to separate the entire rectangular computational domain into two parts as illustrated in fig 2 here one part adopted a circular domain around the foil undergoing both heaving and pitching motions simultaneously and the other part included the remainder of the original domain with a stationary boundary while allowing only the internal mesh layering to move in the vertical direction we employed various user defined functions udfs for these dynamic mesh operations data exchange between the circular subdomain and the remaining external domain were realized using an interface model denoted as the sliding mesh technique the overall calculation range was 85c 70c in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the circular subdomain adopted a radius equal to 5c a fixed static pressure value was applied for the outlet flow condition at the right hand boundary a uniform velocity in the x direction was used for the incoming flow at the left hand boundary meanwhile the top boundary was prescribed as symmetry boundary condition to isolate the free surface effect in this study and the bottom ground boundary was set as a non slip wall 2 3 validation the proposed numerical strategy was validated utilizing two cases one case was a flapping foil at infinite water depth and the other was a flapping foil near a ground wall in the case of infinite water depth 2d simulations of the flapping foil model without a ground wall i e h 0 were applied employing a naca 0015 airfoil over a sufficient number of oscillation periods under working conditions of re 1 1 103 a dimensionless frequency f f c u 0 14 h m c 1 θ m 76 33 and x p c 1 3 the influence of mesh size on the mean drag coefficient c x maximum of heaving force and moment coefficients c ˆ y c ˆ m and η was investigated according to kinsey s work kinsey and dumas 2008 2000 time steps is sufficient for a single oscillation cycle under laminar flow conditions the values obtained over the final oscillation period are listed in table 1 which are also compared with the simulation data obtained by kinsey with fluent and tian with immersed boundary method tian et al 2014 as can be seen from table 1 the values of c x and c ˆ y are nearly insensitive to the mesh size employed moreover the difference in η among all test cases is less than 1 the simulation results obtained with 60 000 grids are basically equivalent to those obtained by kinsey and tian therefore this was the final grid size selected for subsequent calculations in addition we present the instantaneous values of c x t c y t and c m t obtained in the present work and those obtained from kinsey s simulation work over a single oscillation period in fig 3 we note that our results are nearly equivalent to kinsey s data as for the working conditions under high re the shear strain transport sst turbulence model is suitable and this model is adopted herein according to our previous works zhu et al 2018 2019 wang et al 2019 besides a numerical simulation of flapping foil close to the ground wall was carried out employing a naca 0012 airfoil under working conditions of re 150 f 0 125 h m c 0 4 θ m 45 and h 0 c 3 as shown in fig 4 the present results can agree well with those of wu s lbm simulation data wu et al 2014b therefore the subsequent numerical simulation results with the validated method proposed in this paper should have high reliability 3 results and analysis based on the validated numerical method the power extraction performance of an naca 0015 flapping airfoil was systematically studied with respect to the ground effect the investigated parameters are summarized in table 2 where h 0 c represents no ground effect and h m c 1 and x p c 1 3 are uniformly applied in all simulations 3 1 effect of ground clearance on power extraction efficiency fig 5 presents the value of η with respect to variations in h 0 for re 1 1 103 f 0 15 and α n 20 the results indicate that η increases firstly with increasing h 0 to a maximum value at h 0 2 8c and then decreases we also note that the ground effect becomes negligible as h 0 approaches 34c to explain the observed changes in η with respect to changes in h 0 we plot the instantaneous coefficients of heaving forces c y t pitching moments c m t and power extraction coefficients c py t c pθ t obtained for different values of h 0 over a single period in fig 6 generally the existence of a ground wall increases the value of c y compared with the case of no ground wall and this increase is most obvious when h 0 2 8c furthermore the direction of v y t is basically in accordance with that of c y t under the considered conditions fig 5 a and this ensures that f y t provides a generally positive contribution during t the value of c py t attains local maxima when the airfoil moves closely to the ground at around t t 0 25 and when the airfoil moves far away from the ground at around t t 0 75 fig 5 b however the peak value at t t 0 75 is greater than that at t t 0 25 in the vicinity of t t 0 75 c py t increases with respect to h 0 for h 0 values in the order of 1 8c 5 8c and 2 8c in addition the results listed in table 3 indicate that the behavior of c p y with respect to h 0 is equivalent to that of c py t in the vicinity of t t 0 75 in addition the contribution of m t to energy extraction is negative over nearly the entire oscillation period and table 3 indicates that c p θ increases with respect to h 0 for h 0 values in the order of 1 8c 5 8c and 2 8c therefore because c p c p θ c p y from eq 9 the maximum value of η is obtained at h 0 2 8c we also note from fig 6 b that c py t varies widely for different h 0 when the pitching angle of the airfoil is approximately at its maximum value θ m therefore the vortex and pressure distributions around the flapping airfoil will be investigated for specific times s1 t t 0 24 indicated with short vertical line when the airfoil is moving toward the ground wall and s2 t t 0 72 when the airfoil is moving far from the wall figs 7 and 8 present the vortex and pressure distributions around the flapping airfoil with different values of h 0 at moments s1 and s2 respectively in addition fig 9 presents static pressure coefficients around the airfoil and the velocity distributions at location signed with direction arrow in figs 7 and 8 at s1 and s2 strong interactions are observable between detached vortices and the ground boundary layer and the strength of this effect increases with decreasing h 0 at s1 a tunnel effect increases the flow velocity through the clearance which decreases the pressure on the lower surface of the airfoil i e the suction surface near the leading edge as shown in figs 7 and 9 a and c here static pressure coefficient is defined as c p s p s p 0 0 5 ρ u 2 where p s is the local static pressure p 0 is the reference pressure thus we obtain the highest value of c y t at s1 for h 0 1 8c meanwhile at s2 the rear part of the airfoil with its clockwise rotation quickly narrows the clearance because x p is located 1 3c from the leading edge of the airfoil the resulting converged tunnel shape will impede the passing fluid reduce the fluid velocity and inversely increase the pressure under the lower surface of the airfoil the pressure surface relative to that obtained with no ground effect in addition fig 9 b and d indicate further that the velocity increases and the pressure decreases around the leading edge on the upper surface of the airfoil the suction surface thus the combined contributions from the pressure and suction surfaces will make the total lift at s2 greater than that at s1 for a specific h 0 accordingly the effect of the ground wall on the airfoil lift is greater when the flapping wing is moving away from the wall than when it is approaching the wall we also observe from the vortex distribution in fig 8 a for h 0 1 8c that the trailing region of the airfoil has entered into the boundary layer at s2 and some low momentum working fluid within the circled region of the figure remains near the trailing region this will obstruct fluid flowing from the upper surface of the airfoil and thus increase the pressure on the suction surface relative to that obtained with h 0 values of 2 8c and 5 8c this is also demonstrated in fig 9 b and d therefore a suitable h 0 must exist that makes full use of the ground effect for ensuring that the flapping airfoil obtains the highest power extraction efficiency possible 3 2 effect of effective angle of attack on the power extraction efficiency fig 10 presents the values of η obtained for the flapping airfoil with respect to f values in the range 0 05 0 225 for different values of α n in the range 10 50 with re 1 1 103 and h 0 1 8c similar variational trends of η with respect to f are observed for the different values of α n with or without the ground effect where η increases firstly and then decreases with increasing f and the value of f obtaining a maximum η decreases as α n is increased fig 11 presents the contours of η and δ η η η 1 8 c in the parametric space f α n for the flapping airfoil without the ground effect h 0 and with the ground effect h 0 1 8c here the white colored region in the figure at high values of both α n and f represents the region over which the flapping airfoil is operating in the propulsion mode and is consuming energy while the gray colored region in the figure at low f and α n indicates that the ground effect negatively contributes to the energy generation of the flapping airfoil it can be seen that the contribution of the ground effect toward increasing η increases with increasing f and α n which is illustrated by the direction of the arrow in fig 11 b however this region of parametric space with increasing ground effect is not optimum and the overall efficiency is not high therefore suitable operation parameters must be selected within the high efficiency range of the flapping airfoil which also ensure a significant contribution from the ground effect fig 12 presents the instantaneous values of c y t c py t c m t and c pθ t with respect to α n with re 1 1 103 f 0 15 and h 0 1 8c over a single period we note that the peak values of c py t increase firstly with increasing α n and then decrease fig 12 b meanwhile both c m t and c pθ t increase monotonically with increasing α n fig 12 c and d in addition we note that the variation of α n modifies the synchronization of directions between v y t and c y t here the direction of c y t corresponds well with the direction of v y t during the majority of the period i e they have the same signs when α n 30 at the selected parameters this results in a more positive contribution of c py t thereby increasing the value of η for the flapping airfoil besides while α n affects the value of c m t it has a smaller effect on the phase relationship between ω t and c m t seen in fig 12 c in general m t provides a negative contribution over the entire oscillation period nevertheless at f 0 15 m t provides a positive contribution within the time ranges nearby t t 0 45 and t t 0 95 as a result m t provides a positive integral of work over a single oscillation period and thus the value of η is increased this can be explained by the evolution process of the leading edge vortex according to the previous study baik et al 2012 the formation evolution and shedding of the leading edge vortex under low re and f values are consistent with the behavior of the flapping motion and the airfoil can therefore utilize the energy of the leading edge vortex to assist the wing in performing its pitching motion 3 3 effect of reynolds number on the power extraction efficiency fig 13 a and b presents the values of η obtained for the flapping airfoil with respect to f for α n 20 and h 0 1 8c i e with the ground effect under laminar and turbulent flow conditions respectively owing to re values of 5 0 102 1 1 103 1 1 104 and 5 0 105 for laminar flow we can see that the ground wall has little effect on η at relatively low values of f but η is significantly increased at medium and high values of f we also note that the value of η increases with increasing re and the effective range of f is widened in the direction of low f for turbulent flow η is significantly increased for re 1 1 104 at medium values of f while η is greatly increased for re 5 0 105 at medium and low values of f and is decreased at high f in general the region of f over which the value of η significantly increases first appears in the region of middle and high f under laminar flow conditions and then moves gradually in the direction of decreasing f with increasing re under turbulent flow conditions fig 14 presents the contours of η and δη in the parametric space f re without and with the ground effect for an naca 0015 flapping airfoil at fixed parameters of α n 20 and h 0 1 8c the results indicate that the high efficiency range roughly occurs around f 0 15 for the flapping airfoil without the ground effect under laminar flow conditions at low re however with increasing re the maximal value of η increases and the high efficiency range of f gradually moves toward higher f as illustrated in fig 14 a by the arrow with the ground effect the high efficiency range of f moves from high to low values of f with increasing re as illustrated in fig 14 b by the arrow in addition we find that the ground effect has the most significant impact on η in the region of medium re values 104 re 105 and medium f values around f 0 15 meanwhile the ground effect reduces the energy harvesting capability of the flapping airfoil in the regions of high re and high f or low re and low f as indicated by the gray colored areas in the figure the effect of re on η for the flapping airfoil with and without the ground wall is evaluated in greater detail by plotting the evolutions of c y t c py t and c pθ t over a single period in fig 15 at f values of 0 1 and 0 2 and at a low re of 1 1 103 and a high re of 5 105 in addition the integrated values c p y c p θ and η at these values of re and f are listed in table 4 as shown in fig 15 a the variational characteristics of η in the first half period t t values in the range 0 0 5 when re 1 1 103 and f 0 1 indicates that the ground effect initially increases the amplitude of c y t relative to that without the ground effect while the amplitude of c y t becomes less than that without the ground effect at about t t 0 38 this indicates that the impact of the ground effect cannot be completely synchronized with the flapping airfoil motion in addition the data in table 4 indicates that c y t generally provides the same energy extraction contribution for the flapping airfoil with or without the ground effect and c m t provides only a slight contribution over the entire oscillation period therefore η cannot be increased by the ground effect at low re and low f as shown in fig 15 b the ground effect increases the amplitude of c y t over the second half of the oscillation period relative to that without the ground effect when re 5 0 105 and f 0 1 and the synchronization between c y t and v y t with almost the same symbol is good in addition the ground effect has little impact on c pθ t during the entire cycle as a consequence the ground effect significantly increases η when the flapping airfoil operates at middle or low f and at a high re as shown in fig 15 c the amplitude of c y t for the flapping airfoil with the ground effect is nearly always increased than that without ground wall during the time periods t t of 0 2 0 3 and 0 7 1 0 when re 1 1 103 and f 0 2 and the synchronization between c y t and v y t is good this ensures that c y t generally plays a substantially positive role during energy harvesting however the synchronization between c y t and v y t is poor at around t t 0 4 which results in a negative contribution during energy harvesting nonetheless the negative impact of the ground effect around t t 0 4 and the positive impact around t t 0 9 nearly offset each other as a result the ground effect can increase η at low re and high f operation conditions as shown in table 4 as shown in fig 15 d the impact of the ground effect on c y t and c py t is nearly asymmetrical during the entire oscillation period when re 5 0 105 and f 0 2 here the impact of the ground effect on c y t is negative in the first period of t t in the range 0 0 5 and positive in the second period of t t in the range 0 5 1 0 and both nearly offset each other therefore the ground effect cannot increase η at high re and high f operation conditions the effects of re on η for the flapping airfoil with the ground wall are further analyzed by plotting the vortex distributions around the airfoil at specific moments with re 1 1 103 and re 5 0 105 in fig 16 and fig 17 for f 0 1 and f 0 2 respectively we note from fig 16 that strongly detached vortex evolutions occur around the flapping airfoil under laminar flow conditions at f 0 1 fig 16 a while only weakly attached vortices occur around the flapping airfoil under turbulent flow conditions fig 16 b which ensures that the flapping airfoil obtains a high magnitude c y t therefore η generally increases with increasing re however the flapping airfoil can also obtain a high efficiency if it operates at a suitable frequency such as f 0 15 as discussed previously we note that the moment when the detached vortex moves from the leading edge to the trailing edge matches well with the motion of the airfoil thus the airfoil efficiency can benefit from utilizing the energy from the detached vortex we also note from fig 17 that the effect of re at f 0 2 on the vortex distribution is similar to that obtained at f 0 1 except for a slight increase in the intensity a comparison of figs 16 and 17 indicates that increasing f from 0 1 to 0 2 alters the moment in time when a detached vortex passes the same location of the airfoil for the same re which alters the evolution phase between vortex motion and airfoil motion these results are substantiated by the poor synchronization observed between c y t and v y t nearby t t 0 4 as well as by the good synchronization observed between c y t and v y t nearby t t 0 9 as shown in fig 15 in addition we can see that the thickness of the boundary layer decreases substantially with increasing re 4 conclusions in this research a transient numerical method based on a dynamic grid technique in an absolute coordinate system was adopted to study the flow fields of a flapping airfoil near a ground wall the effects of reynolds number average ground clearance and effective angle of attack on the power extraction efficiency of the flapping airfoil were investigated with respect to variations in oscillation frequency the results can be summarized as follows 1 the ground effect can greatly increase the power extraction efficiency of a flapping airfoil and an optimum average ground clearance can be determined for ensuring the highest extraction efficiency for the flapping airfoil 2 the positive impact of the ground effect on the power extraction efficiency is asymmetric over the course of flapping airfoil motion toward and away from the ground wall the formation of corresponding divergent or convergent tunnel effects alters the flow fields and pressure distributions around the airfoil near the leading edge and in particular decreases the pressure on the suction side which increases the overall heaving force and its power harvesting capability 3 under constant reynolds number and average ground clearance values the power extraction efficiency of the flapping airfoil with or without the ground effect increases firstly and then decreases with increasing oscillation frequency or effective angle of attack moreover the positive impact of the ground wall effect on the energy harvesting performance of the airfoil becomes increasingly obvious when the oscillation frequency and the angle of attack are increased simultaneously 4 with the increasing of reynolds number for the flapping airfoil with the positive ground effect the range of oscillation frequency with high efficiency moves gradually from the high frequency to low frequency credit authorship contribution

21759,while maneuvering or positioning in different situations the hull the angle of the inlet current and the tunnel opening fairing onto the hull have serious impacts on the performance of the bow thruster the co operation of multiple bow thrusters affects each other in the hydrodynamic performance in this study we report a thorough investigation of the hydrodynamic performance of the bow thruster combining experimental and numerical methods the influence of the hull the inflow angle and the fillet radius of the tunnel opening is considered the interaction between multiple bow thrusters is also studied open water tests and single bow thruster tests with the hull at eight different inflow angles were performed numerical simulations under the same condition were performed using the u rans method and the accuracy of numerical results is verified by comparing with experimental data then the flow field details of the single bow thruster condition were extracted by analyzing the velocity distribution in the tunnel the coupling influence of the hull and the inflow angle can be studied moreover numerical simulations were performed for four hull models with different fillet radii for the tunnel opening the influence of the opening fairing is analyzed by comparing numerical results and detailed flow fields finally the co operation of two bow thrusters is simulated and the interaction between three bow thrusters is investigated the results show that the joint influence will lead to a large scale asymmetric reversed flow zone at the tunnel opening the reversed flow zone changes with the inflow angle and leads to a great difference in pressure distribution for different blades of the propeller the opening fairing of the tunnel can improve the uniformity of the flow field in the tunnel restrain the asymmetric pressure distribution on the propeller and raise the efficiency of bow thruster in addition during co operation the induced flow direction of the propeller has a significant influence on the performance of the bow thruster the upstream bow thruster can slightly improve the efficiency of the downstream bow thruster keywords bow

fairing onto the hull the direction and velocity of the inlet flow and the connection structure may affect the propulsion performance of the bow thruster carlton 2012 meanwhile mutual interference of the multiple bow thrusters working together cannot be neglected early research on bow thrusters is mainly based on model tests taniguchi et al 1966 replaced the ship hull with a standard entity block and carried out both constrained and free model tests the influence of blade type blade number propeller area ratio pitch ration boss ratio inclination angle of the entity block guide vane length of the internal tunnel type of the internal tunnel submergence at the bottom and the fairing radius at the opening on the performance of the thruster was analyzed the results show that the joint influence of the current and the body lead to a large scale asymmetric flow separation at the tunnel opening and may be weakened by the rounded corner taylor et al 1958 performed experimental studies to determine the effects of the fairing radius at the tunnel opening the tunnel length and the tunnel diffuser angle on the thrust characteristics of a shrouded propeller beveridge et al 1971 examined the interaction between the bow thruster inflow and outflow and the ambient flow of the hull combining experimental method with a theoretical method due to the complex structure of the bow thruster it is difficult and time consuming to obtain results such as the flow field and the velocity distribution only by model tests in this study we describe a method combining experiments with cfd simulations the original numerical methods used to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of propellers are lifting surface theory and the surface method the numerical method for solving reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation is applied widely today and offers more accurate results and flow details zhang d 2019 bhattacharyya 2014a 2014b 2016 analyzed the scale effect on the open water characteristics of a controllable pitch propeller working with two different ducts using the commercial rans code star ccm the accuracy of different solution strategies was discussed and a reliable stepwise scaling approach was devised based on cfd results yu 2016 studied the tunnel thruster performance and flow using quasi steady rans simulations the influence of the blade area and the pitch on the hydrodynamic performance of tunnel thruster was discussed and the reason why the hub of impeller also contributes to thrust was elucidated the flow separation near the entrance to the tunnel was also captured van den brink 2014 conducted fine numerical simulations of the bow thruster using openfoam and studied the scour depth at quay walls tu 2019 carried out numerical simulations with the same working conditions of the potsdam propeller pptc test they studied the effect of grid type mesh density and turbulence models on simulation accuracy the results suggested that using an appropriate solution strategy cfd simulations could provide sufficient accuracy in predicting the hydrodynamic performance of the propellers song et al 2015 investigated the open water performance of hub type as well as hubless rim driven thrusters based on commercial code cfx 14 0 the numerical results were compared with experimental data and showed good correlation zhang et al 2019 performed numerical simulations to investigate the wake dynamics and instabilities of a ducted propeller the evolution of the vortical structures the wake flow instability and the variation in the wake flow with increase in the advance coefficient were analyzed nowruzi et al 2019 explored the effects of three different pre swirl ducts on propulsion performance of a series 60 ship via self propulsion testing and cfd analysis the accuracy of the cfd simulation was proven upon comparison with experimental results a detailed wake distribution and the vortex shedding were also captured to the best of our knowledge studies on the hydrodynamic performance of bow thruster systems are rarely reported and are mostly by experiments moreover most studies are done under straightway low speed sailing or calm water actual navigation is influenced by the currents and the currents can affect the direction and the velocity of the inlet flow this can impact the hydrodynamic performance of the bow thruster therefore the main purpose of this study was to evaluate the influences of the hull the opening fairing and the multiple thrusters at different inlet flow angles via experimental and numerical methods here the bow thruster system of a rescue vessel is taken as the research target by assessing the thrust and the torque measured from open water tests and ship model testing the hydrodynamic performance of the bow thruster system at different inflow angles are experimentally studied first then detailed flow fields in the tunnel and pressure distribution on the propellers are studied via cfd simulations moreover numerical simulations for different opening fairings and the co operation condition of multiple bow thrusters are performed at different inflow angles this study is organized as follows section 2 illustrates the experimental setup and test results details of the numerical setup such as the cfd solver the computational domain the mesh condition and a sensitivity study are presented in section 3 in section 4 the accuracy of the numerical results is validated by comparing with experimental data and all results are presented and discussed finally a summary of the key results and future work is added and detailed in section 5 2 model tests 2 1 test devices model tests are carried out in the circulating water channel cwc at shanghai jiao tong university sjtu the test section of the channel is 8 0 m length 3 0 m width 1 6 m water depth to compensate for velocity loss induced by the boundary layer a surface flow acceleration device is installed in the upstream area of the test section the test section is shown in fig 1 to obtain the thrust and torque of the bow thruster a frictionless dynamometer was designed and employed the sensor of the frictionless dynamometer clings to the propeller thus experimental data could be measured directly because there is neither the bearing nor the waterproof seal between the propeller and the sensor the effect of the friction caused by the bearing and the waterproof seal could be ignored the frictionless dynamometer is shown in fig 2 the traversing system is applied to fix the ship model the variation of the inflow angle is realized by rotating the model through the gear mechanism in the traversing system the traversing system is shown in fig 3 2 2 target model a four blade control pitch propeller cpp was selected as the bow thruster of the real rescue vessel and the design pitch angle is set to 19 and 19 to obtain thrust in opposite directions the experimental model is scaled according to the real propeller with a pitch angle of 19 and a ratio of 1 11 67 the diameter of the propeller model d is 0 24 m the propeller model is shown in fig 4 the scale ratio of the ship model is the same as the propeller the hull model is truncated due to the size of the cwc an approximate cone is used to close the hull smoothly at the cut off point to be consistent with the real rescue vessel three tunnels are set along the length direction of the hull to place the bow thrusters there is no fairing at the opening of each tunnel only a single thruster condition is considered in the model tests and the bow thruster system is set in the second tunnel the principle dimensions of the model are listed in table 1 and the ship model is illustrated in fig 5 2 3 test contents we performed both open water tests and hydrodynamic performance measurements for a single bow thruster with a ship hull hereafter called single thruster tests all tests were repeated three times by different experienced engineers to ensure the reliability of the test results detailed conditions of the model tests are described below 2 3 1 open water test the working condition of the open water test is shown in fig 6 thrust t and torque q of the propeller at 20 different advance coefficients ranging from 0 1357 to 0 9 are measured thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q and efficiency η are calculated via the following equations 1 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 2 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 3 η k t k q j 2 π 2 3 2 single thruster tests the working condition of single thruster tests is shown in fig 7 the thrust and torque of the propeller at eight different inflow angles were measured and the inflow angles were varied from 0 to 315 at intervals of 45 the coordinate system and rotation direction are shown in fig 8 here the x axis is paralleled to the inflow direction the z axis is vertically upward and the y axis is determined by the right hand rule the original point is located to the intersection of the propeller shaft and the longitudinal section of the hull the variation of the inflow angle is replaced by rotating the ship model the current velocity of the sea area where the rescue vessel primarily operates is about 2 kn and the inflow velocities of a single thruster test were set to 0 301 m s after conversion the rotational speed of the propeller is set to 13 86 rad s thrust t and torque q of the propeller at 8 different inflow angles were also measured 2 4 test results the open water characteristics obtained from the model test are illustrated in fig 9 although the inflow velocity remained constant during the single thruster tests the axial projection velocity of the bow thruster varies with inflow angle fig 10 defines the axial projection velocity to analyze the influence of the hull on the hydrodynamic performance of the bow thruster more reasonably the axial projection velocities at each inflow angles are calculated thrust coefficients k t and torque coefficients k q are obtained via interpolation of the open water characteristics the results of the open water condition and the single thruster tests are compared in fig 11 fig 11 shows that the torque decreases continuously in single thruster tests while the inflow angle changed from 0 to 225 sharp growth then appears at 270 and decreases again rapidly at 315 furthermore the torque is lower than the open water condition with the same axial velocity at all inflow angles the maximum decrease is 15 80 at 225 the thrust from single thruster tests decreases linearly while the inflow angle changes from 0 to 90 but not significantly the propeller thrust oscillates slightly when the inflow angle ranges from 90 to 225 similar to the torque the thrust increases rapidly at 270 and then decreases versus the open water condition the thrust is higher only when the inflow angles were 270 and 315 they increased by 8 74 and 0 96 respectively the maximum thrust reduction is 9 64 at 225 3 numerical setup 3 1 cfd solver the commercial cfd code star ccm was employed for numerical simulations the three dimensional unsteady rans equation and continuity equation for incompressible viscous newtonian fluid were solved to close the set of equations the shear stress transport k w sst k w turbulence model proposed by menter 1994 was implemented since the bow thruster system is not circumferentially symmetrical the sliding mesh method smm was applied to simulate the rotation of the propeller and the second order implicit scheme was used for time discretization according to the international towing tank conference ittc recommendations ittc 2014 1 per time step equals to 2 0e 4s was selected for all simulations here 3 2 domain and boundary conditions the numerical model of the propeller and the connection structure is shown in fig 12 other than using the same working conditions of the model tests single bow thruster condition without fairing the corresponding numerical simulations were also performed for different fillet radii of the tunnel openings with single bow thruster and multiple bow thrusters conditions without fairing in addition the numerical simulations for the hull only without propeller were also performed at each inflow angle to analyze the influence of the hull on the velocity distribution on the paddle disk details of each series of simulations and their abbreviations are illustrated in table 2 numerical simulations were carried out for the two working conditions for the multiple thruster conditions to analyze the effects of induced flow direction on the hydrodynamic performance of multiple bow thrusters the specific settings of the numerical simulations are presented below 3 2 1 open water condition the computational domain of open water condition is divided into two cylindrical domains the outflow domain and the rotation domain the outflow domain contains most areas of the computation field including the tunnel of the propeller and the connection the diameter of the rotation domain is set to 0 2415 m and the length is 0 24 m because the gap between the tunnel and the blade tip of the propeller is only 3 mm considering the boundary layer attached to both the propeller and the tunnel the dimensions and boundary conditions are shown in fig 13 3 2 2 no thruster and single thruster condition the dimensions of the ship hull are the same with the test model since the design speed of the ship is low enough fr less than 0 06 the impact of wave can be ignored and the multiple model method is adopted the free surface is treated as a symmetry plane and the hull above the water surface is ignored the numerical model of the no fairing hull is illustrated in fig 14 to analyze the influence of the fillet radius at the tunnel opening numerical simulations were also conducted for another four hull models with different fillet radii in addition to the no fairing condition the radius is set to 0 005 d 0 01 d 0 02 d and 0 03 d respectively the propeller and the connection structure are installed in the centered tunnel to be consistent with the experimental conditions the height and width of the computation domain were set to 1 6 m and 3 m respectively which is the same size of the circulating tunnel the computation domain is also divided into two part the external domain contains the hull and the connection structure and the rotation domain contains the propeller to make sure that the wake field is fully developed the length of the computation domain was set to 24 m which is three times of the cwc test section detailed dimensions and boundary conditions are shown in fig 15 only the external domain is simulated for the no thruster condition because the propeller is ignored the other settings remain the same with a single thruster condition 3 2 3 multiple thruster condition the ship model and boundary conditions of multiple thrusters are the same as the single thruster condition described in section 3 2 2 three rotation domains were established to simulate the rotation of different propellers the numerical model and the definition of the propeller index are shown in fig 16 similar to the actual vessel the second propeller is installed on the opposite side of the first and the third propeller the first and the second propeller work collectively the third propeller is used only in emergencies since the install directions of the 1st and 2nd propellers are opposite the pitch angle of the 2nd propeller is negative to the 1st propeller to gain thrust in the same direction under condition 1 the pitch angles of the 1st and the 2nd propellers are set to 19 and 19 respectively under condition 2 the pitch angles of the 1st and the 2nd propellers are set to 19 and 19 3 3 mesh generation and sensitivity study due to the complex geometrical characteristics of the propeller and the tiny gap between the blade tip and the tunnel unstructured trim mesh is applied here with a boundary layer that is refined using prism elements sixteen layers of prism mesh are generated with a growth ratio of 1 1 because a large velocity gradient was observed in the wall normal direction the first prism element center y is set to 1 0 the accuracy of cfd results largely depends on the mesh resolution thus mesh sensitivity studies were performed under a rotational velocity 13 87 r s inflow velocity 0 301 m s and inflow angle of 0 both open water conditions and single thruster conditions are considered and the rotation domain mesh sizes of the two conditions remained the same six different mesh solutions were calculated for each condition the number of different meshes increased by 2 times the numerical results are compared with experimental data and presented in fig 17 under open water conditions there is only subtle change when the element number is larger than 3 48 106 even though the accuracy of k t and k q is still increasing for single propeller conditions k t tends to change slightly when the element number is larger than 1 04 107 while the change trends of k q do not plateau until there are more than 1 04 107 elements overall 3 48 106 elements is optimal for open water conditions and 1 04 107 is optimal for single thruster conditions the mesh sizes of the propeller and the hull of the remaining calculations no thruster condition and multiple thruster condition are the same as these two conditions detailed mesh structures are shown in fig 18 4 results and discussion 4 1 accuracy validation of cfd simulations the accuracy of the cfd simulation was validated by comparing numerical results with experimental data the open water characteristics obtained by both model tests and numerical simulations are summarized in fig 19 fig 19 shows that the accuracy of the numerical results decreases gradually with increasing advance coefficient j but the error is rather small when j is less than 0 4 the computed mean absolute errors of k t k q and η are 2 04 1 49 and 1 60 and the maximum errors are 4 26 2 31 and 3 91 respectively j of the bow thruster that studied in this paper is from 0 09 to 0 09 in this range the mean absolute errors of k t k q and η are only 1 18 1 36 and 1 62 respectively the numerical and experimental results of the single thruster condition are summarized in fig 20 in these cases the influence of the hull and the inflow angle complicates the flow field the computational accuracy is slightly lower than the open water condition the numerical results are larger than the experimental data for both k t and k q the mean absolute errors of k t and k q are 5 10 and 2 47 while the maximum errors are 9 51 and 3 13 respectively in summary the numerical results of open water conditions are sufficiently accurate the accuracy of the numerical simulations for single propeller conditions is slightly lower but acceptable because of the simplified numerical model and complex flow field as a result cfd simulations are employed for the research below 4 2 influence of the hull and inflow angle to verify the influence of the hull on the hydrodynamic performance of the bow thruster the k t and k q at each axial projection velocity are interpolated and calculated from the calculated open water characteristics the results are compared with the single thruster condition and illustrated in fig 21 the change trends of k t and k q are almost the same as the model tests in order to analyze the influence of the hull and the inflow angle flow field details under no thruster conditions including the axial velocity distribution on the paddle disk the line integral convolutions cabral et al 1993 of the waterline plane velocity and the line integral convolutions lic of the section plane are drawn and summarized in fig 22 the waterline plane is on the same height of the thruster shaft center the section plane is perpendicular to the longitude direction and passes through the thruster shaft center along the longitudinal direction we define the side of the tunnel surface near the bow as the front side and the side far from the bow as the back side in the height direction the lower side is defined as the bottom and the other side is the top fig 22 shows that when the inflow angle is 0 or 180 the velocity magnitude in most areas of the tunnel is extremely low velocity changes only slightly at the back front side of the tunnel opening but the area is rather small the velocity distribution at the paddle disk is symmetrical especially in the height direction when the inflow direction is parallel to the axis of the propeller a small scale reversed flow appears at both the front and the back side of the tunnel opening since the hull is expanding along the longitudinal direction the area of the reversed flow zone at the front side is larger than that of the back side in addition a large flow separation zone will be formed at the top of the tunnel opening when the fluid flows through the tunnel an obvious reversed flow zone can be observed at the top of the paddle disk when the inflow angle is 90 when the inflow angle is 270 although there is no reversed flow zone the velocity magnitude at the top of the paddle disk is quite small the velocity distribution on the paddle disk is slightly asymmetrical in the longitudinal direction but is significantly divided into two regions in the height direction for other inflow angles large scale flow separation occurs at the top and the front back side of the tunnel opening the velocity distribution on the paddle disk is layered along an oblique line and shows a strong asymmetry in both the longitudinal and height direction moreover the average velocity in the tunnel may also affected by the hull average velocities v at all inflow angles are calculated by equation 4 and summarized in table 3 4 v q ρ s here q is the mass flow rate in the tunnel ρ is the density of water and s is the cross section area of the tunnel table 3 shows that when the inflow angle is 0 the mass flow rate in the tunnel is almost zero at 180 due to the shrinkage trend of the hull from back to front the averaged velocity in the tunnel is not zero but is very small for other inflow angles the mass flow rate in the tunnel is lower than the ideal case because of the large scale reversed flow zone furthermore the coupling of the propeller induced flow with the hull and inflow angle makes the flow field in the tunnel more complex while working flow field details under single thruster condition are illustrated in fig 23 the direction of the induced flow tends to deviate toward the hull due to the coanda effect flow separation occurs while fluid flows through the opening of the tunnel and the area of the reversed flow zone is correlated with the degree of surface curvature change and inflow angle unlike the no thruster condition large scale reversed flow can be observed at the bottom of the tunnel opening at all inflow angles when inflow angle is 0 180 the reversed flow area expands at the front back side but weakens to almost disappearing at the back front side in the case of a positive advance coefficient the inflow angle ranging from 0 to 180 the reversed flow area exists on both sides of the water plane obvious flow separation can also be observed at the top of the tunnel opening the reversed flow area on the water plane is much smaller with a negative advance coefficient the inflow angle ranging from 180 to 360 this is affected by both the connection structure and negative inflow the flow field at the top of the tunnel opening becomes much smoother the pressure distribution on the propeller face and back in both the open water condition and the single thruster condition are compared in fig 24 because of the large scale reversed flow at the bottom of the tunnel opening high low pressure region on the face back of blade 3 numbered as fig 3 is obviously expanding its amplitude also increases more or less in addition the low high pressure region on the blade becomes closer to the tip of the blade for single thruster condition this region is affected by the reversed flow zone at the tunnel opening and the shape is narrowed and elongated the asymmetry of velocity distribution in the tunnel is due to the influence of the hull the inflow angle and propeller induced flow this asymmetry results in a significant difference in pressure distribution on different blades the non uniformity pressure distribution on the propeller can lead to a slight decrease in the torque even when the thrust increases but the unstable forces acting on the hull structure and enhanced vibration of the propeller are predictable fig 25 shows the flow field in the first tunnel and the third tunnel at all inflow angles the flow in the first and the third tunnel is mainly caused by the coupling effect between the inlet flow and the hull and the velocity magnitude is quite small the suction direction of the bow thruster is perpendicular to the longitudinal section of the hull although the direction of the inlet flow varies from 0 to 315 and the streamline of the suction always deviates from the hull somewhat fig 27 thus the influence of the two empty tunnels on the suction is quite small there are minimal anti suction effects on the performance of the bow thruster 4 3 influence of opening fairing the thrust and torque at each inflow angle were calculated for the other four hulls with different tunnel opening fillet radii the tunnel opening fillet radius for each hull is 0 005 r 0 010 r 0 02 r and 0 030 r respectively where r represents the propeller radius to more intuitively analyze the influence of tunnel opening fillet radius on hydrodynamic performance of bow thruster the efficiency of the bow thruster for each simulation are calculated via equation 5 5 η t v a 2 π n q here v a is the averaged velocity in the tunnel calculated by equation 4 k t k q and η are summarized in fig 26 fig 26 shows that both k t and k q decrease continuously with increasing fillet radius the efficiency raises at each inflow angle moreover the efficiency under a positive advance coefficient increases obviously but there is only a slight increase for negative advance coefficients the pressure distribution of the propeller and lic of the velocity in the tunnel at each fillet radius are summarized in fig 27 with the 0 inflow angle condition as an example the opening fairing has an obvious impact on smoothing the flow field in the tunnel fig 27 as the fillet radius increases the reversed flow at the opening of the tunnel obviously contracts especially at the bottom the large scale reversed flow at the bottom almost disappears when the fillet radius is up to 0 030 r meanwhile the pressure distribution on the blades also becomes uniform as the fillet radius increases the high low pressure regions on blade 3 obviously shrinks and the asymmetry pressure distribution of the propeller caused by a non uniform flow field is also alleviated the pressure distribution on the four blades is almost the same when the fillet radius is sufficiently large 4 4 interaction between multiple bow thrusters the two bow thrusters are installed in opposite directions to ensure the balance of forces acting on the hull in the width direction the pitch angles of the two propellers are also opposite to obtain thrust in the same direction there are two combination conditions for the two propellers 1 the pitch angle of the 1st propeller is set to 19 while the 2nd propeller is set to 19 condition 1 2 the pitch angle of the 1st propeller is set to 19 while the 2nd propeller is set to 19 condition 2 both conditions are simulated at all inflow angles and the results are compared with the single thruster condition and illustrated in figs 28 and 29 versus the interaction between multiple thrusters the propeller induced flow direction may have a greater impact on the hydrodynamic performance of the bow thruster the lic of the velocity distribution on the waterline plane is illustrated in fig 29 for the two conditions under two typical inflow angles 0 and 180 when the induced flow direction of the propeller is negative fluid passes the connection first and then flows through the propeller namely 2nd propeller in condition 1 and 1st propeller in condition 2 buffering by the tunnel wall and the connection leads to a uniform distribution of velocity distribution at the paddle disk the efficiency of the bow thruster is significantly higher than that of positive induced flow direction the two bow thrusters work together for the bow thruster with a positive induced flow direction here the induced flow trajectory of the downstream thruster is affected by the upstream thruster and deviates slightly from the hull fig 30 for example the 1st thruster in condition 1 has improved propulsion efficiency when the inflow angle ranges from 90 to 270 with a smaller reversed flow zone at the tunnel opening 5 conclusion we report a thorough investigation on the hydrodynamic performance of bow thrusters via experimental and numerical methods the influence of the hull the inflow angle the tunnel opening fairing and the interaction between multiple bow thrusters was considered the open water tests and single bow thruster tests at different inflow angles are performed numerical simulations were performed under the same conditions and its accuracy was verified by comparing numerical results with experimental results the other four hulls with different fillet radii at the tunnel opening were simulated for a single thruster condition at each inflow angle simulations for multiple bow thrusters were also performed by analyzing the numerical and experimental results the following conclusions can be reported 1 numerical simulations have sufficient accuracy for predicting the torque and thrust for the open water condition and the single bow thruster condition 2 the coupling effect of the hull inflow direction and propeller induced flow makes the flow field in the tunnel extremely confusing the uneven velocity distribution results in an asymmetry of pressure distribution on the propeller this may lead to unstable forces acting on the hull structure and enhanced vibration of the propeller 3 the fairing of the tunnel opening can improve the quality of the flow field in the tunnel with increasing opening fillet radius the velocity distribution in the tunnel becomes much more uniform and the pressure distribution on the propeller tends to be symmetrical thus the efficiency of the bow thrusters is improved 4 the propeller induced flow direction has a great impact on the hydrodynamic performance of the bow thruster when the induced flow passes the connection first and then flows through the propeller the connection structure and the tunnel wall can reduce the non uniformity of the flow this dramatically improves the efficiency of the bow thruster 5 with co operation the induced flow trajectory of the downstream thruster is affected by the upstream one and the downstream thruster deviates from the hull surface a reduced reversed flow zone at the tunnel opening may lead to a slightly increase in propulsion efficiency in order to be consistent with the experimental conditions the numerical simulations in this study were performed in narrow waters and a simplified numerical model also makes the results slightly different from the real situation moreover the influences of the tunnel length and the installation position of the bow thruster

21759,while maneuvering or positioning in different situations the hull the angle of the inlet current and the tunnel opening fairing onto the hull have serious impacts on the performance of the bow thruster the co operation of multiple bow thrusters affects each other in the hydrodynamic performance in this study we report a thorough investigation of the hydrodynamic performance of the bow thruster combining experimental and numerical methods the influence of the hull the inflow angle and the fillet radius of the tunnel opening is considered the interaction between multiple bow thrusters is also studied open water tests and single bow thruster tests with the hull at eight different inflow angles were performed numerical simulations under the same condition were performed using the u rans method and the accuracy of numerical results is verified by comparing with experimental data then the flow field details of the single bow thruster condition were extracted by analyzing the velocity distribution in the tunnel the coupling influence of the hull and the inflow angle can be studied moreover numerical simulations were performed for four hull models with different fillet radii for the tunnel opening the influence of the opening fairing is analyzed by comparing numerical results and detailed flow fields finally the co operation of two bow thrusters is simulated and the interaction between three bow thrusters is investigated the results show that the joint influence will lead to a large scale asymmetric reversed flow zone at the tunnel opening the reversed flow zone changes with the inflow angle and leads to a great difference in pressure distribution for different blades of the propeller the opening fairing of the tunnel can improve the uniformity of the flow field in the tunnel restrain the asymmetric pressure distribution on the propeller and raise the efficiency of bow thruster in addition during co operation the induced flow direction of the propeller has a significant influence on the performance of the bow thruster the upstream bow thruster can slightly improve the efficiency of the downstream bow thruster keywords bow

the multiple bow thrusters working together cannot be neglected early research on bow thrusters is mainly based on model tests taniguchi et al 1966 replaced the ship hull with a standard entity block and carried out both constrained and free model tests the influence of blade type blade number propeller area ratio pitch ration boss ratio inclination angle of the entity block guide vane length of the internal tunnel type of the internal tunnel submergence at the bottom and the fairing radius at the opening on the performance of the thruster was analyzed the results show that the joint influence of the current and the body lead to a large scale asymmetric flow separation at the tunnel opening and may be weakened by the rounded corner taylor et al 1958 performed experimental studies to determine the effects of the fairing radius at the tunnel opening the tunnel length and the tunnel diffuser angle on the thrust characteristics of a shrouded propeller beveridge et al 1971 examined the interaction between the bow thruster inflow and outflow and the ambient flow of the hull combining experimental method with a theoretical method due to the complex structure of the bow thruster it is difficult and time consuming to obtain results such as the flow field and the velocity distribution only by model tests in this study we describe a method combining experiments with cfd simulations the original numerical methods used to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of propellers are lifting surface theory and the surface method the numerical method for solving reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation is applied widely today and offers more accurate results and flow details zhang d 2019 bhattacharyya 2014a 2014b 2016 analyzed the scale effect on the open water characteristics of a controllable pitch propeller working with two different ducts using the commercial rans code star ccm the accuracy of different solution strategies was discussed and a reliable stepwise scaling approach was devised based on cfd results yu 2016 studied the tunnel thruster performance and flow using quasi steady rans simulations the influence of the blade area and the pitch on the hydrodynamic performance of tunnel thruster was discussed and the reason why the hub of impeller also contributes to thrust was elucidated the flow separation near the entrance to the tunnel was also captured van den brink 2014 conducted fine numerical simulations of the bow thruster using openfoam and studied the scour depth at quay walls tu 2019 carried out numerical simulations with the same working conditions of the potsdam propeller pptc test they studied the effect of grid type mesh density and turbulence models on simulation accuracy the results suggested that using an appropriate solution strategy cfd simulations could provide sufficient accuracy in predicting the hydrodynamic performance of the propellers song et al 2015 investigated the open water performance of hub type as well as hubless rim driven thrusters based on commercial code cfx 14 0 the numerical results were compared with experimental data and showed good correlation zhang et al 2019 performed numerical simulations to investigate the wake dynamics and instabilities of a ducted propeller the evolution of the vortical structures the wake flow instability and the variation in the wake flow with increase in the advance coefficient were analyzed nowruzi et al 2019 explored the effects of three different pre swirl ducts on propulsion performance of a series 60 ship via self propulsion testing and cfd analysis the accuracy of the cfd simulation was proven upon comparison with experimental results a detailed wake distribution and the vortex shedding were also captured to the best of our knowledge studies on the hydrodynamic performance of bow thruster systems are rarely reported and are mostly by experiments moreover most studies are done under straightway low speed sailing or calm water actual navigation is influenced by the currents and the currents can affect the direction and the velocity of the inlet flow this can impact the hydrodynamic performance of the bow thruster therefore the main purpose of this study was to evaluate the influences of the hull the opening fairing and the multiple thrusters at different inlet flow angles via experimental and numerical methods here the bow thruster system of a rescue vessel is taken as the research target by assessing the thrust and the torque measured from open water tests and ship model testing the hydrodynamic performance of the bow thruster system at different inflow angles are experimentally studied first then detailed flow fields in the tunnel and pressure distribution on the propellers are studied via cfd simulations moreover numerical simulations for different opening fairings and the co operation condition of multiple bow thrusters are performed at different inflow angles this study is organized as follows section 2 illustrates the experimental setup and test results details of the numerical setup such as the cfd solver the computational domain the mesh condition and a sensitivity study are presented in section 3 in section 4 the accuracy of the numerical results is validated by comparing with experimental data and all results are presented and discussed finally a summary of the key results and future work is added and detailed in section 5 2 model tests 2 1 test devices model tests are carried out in the circulating water channel cwc at shanghai jiao tong university sjtu the test section of the channel is 8 0 m length 3 0 m width 1 6 m water depth to compensate for velocity loss induced by the boundary layer a surface flow acceleration device is installed in the upstream area of the test section the test section is shown in fig 1 to obtain the thrust and torque of the bow thruster a frictionless dynamometer was designed and employed the sensor of the frictionless dynamometer clings to the propeller thus experimental data could be measured directly because there is neither the bearing nor the waterproof seal between the propeller and the sensor the effect of the friction caused by the bearing and the waterproof seal could be ignored the frictionless dynamometer is shown in fig 2 the traversing system is applied to fix the ship model the variation of the inflow angle is realized by rotating the model through the gear mechanism in the traversing system the traversing system is shown in fig 3 2 2 target model a four blade control pitch propeller cpp was selected as the bow thruster of the real rescue vessel and the design pitch angle is set to 19 and 19 to obtain thrust in opposite directions the experimental model is scaled according to the real propeller with a pitch angle of 19 and a ratio of 1 11 67 the diameter of the propeller model d is 0 24 m the propeller model is shown in fig 4 the scale ratio of the ship model is the same as the propeller the hull model is truncated due to the size of the cwc an approximate cone is used to close the hull smoothly at the cut off point to be consistent with the real rescue vessel three tunnels are set along the length direction of the hull to place the bow thrusters there is no fairing at the opening of each tunnel only a single thruster condition is considered in the model tests and the bow thruster system is set in the second tunnel the principle dimensions of the model are listed in table 1 and the ship model is illustrated in fig 5 2 3 test contents we performed both open water tests and hydrodynamic performance measurements for a single bow thruster with a ship hull hereafter called single thruster tests all tests were repeated three times by different experienced engineers to ensure the reliability of the test results detailed conditions of the model tests are described below 2 3 1 open water test the working condition of the open water test is shown in fig 6 thrust t and torque q of the propeller at 20 different advance coefficients ranging from 0 1357 to 0 9 are measured thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q and efficiency η are calculated via the following equations 1 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 2 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 3 η k t k q j 2 π 2 3 2 single thruster tests the working condition of single thruster tests is shown in fig 7 the thrust and torque of the propeller at eight different inflow angles were measured and the inflow angles were varied from 0 to 315 at intervals of 45 the coordinate system and rotation direction are shown in fig 8 here the x axis is paralleled to the inflow direction the z axis is vertically upward and the y axis is determined by the right hand rule the original point is located to the intersection of the propeller shaft and the longitudinal section of the hull the variation of the inflow angle is replaced by rotating the ship model the current velocity of the sea area where the rescue vessel primarily operates is about 2 kn and the inflow velocities of a single thruster test were set to 0 301 m s after conversion the rotational speed of the propeller is set to 13 86 rad s thrust t and torque q of the propeller at 8 different inflow angles were also measured 2 4 test results the open water characteristics obtained from the model test are illustrated in fig 9 although the inflow velocity remained constant during the single thruster tests the axial projection velocity of the bow thruster varies with inflow angle fig 10 defines the axial projection velocity to analyze the influence of the hull on the hydrodynamic performance of the bow thruster more reasonably the axial projection velocities at each inflow angles are calculated thrust coefficients k t and torque coefficients k q are obtained via interpolation of the open water characteristics the results of the open water condition and the single thruster tests are compared in fig 11 fig 11 shows that the torque decreases continuously in single thruster tests while the inflow angle changed from 0 to 225 sharp growth then appears at 270 and decreases again rapidly at 315 furthermore the torque is lower than the open water condition with the same axial velocity at all inflow angles the maximum decrease is 15 80 at 225 the thrust from single thruster tests decreases linearly while the inflow angle changes from 0 to 90 but not significantly the propeller thrust oscillates slightly when the inflow angle ranges from 90 to 225 similar to the torque the thrust increases rapidly at 270 and then decreases versus the open water condition the thrust is higher only when the inflow angles were 270 and 315 they increased by 8 74 and 0 96 respectively the maximum thrust reduction is 9 64 at 225 3 numerical setup 3 1 cfd solver the commercial cfd code star ccm was employed for numerical simulations the three dimensional unsteady rans equation and continuity equation for incompressible viscous newtonian fluid were solved to close the set of equations the shear stress transport k w sst k w turbulence model proposed by menter 1994 was implemented since the bow thruster system is not circumferentially symmetrical the sliding mesh method smm was applied to simulate the rotation of the propeller and the second order implicit scheme was used for time discretization according to the international towing tank conference ittc recommendations ittc 2014 1 per time step equals to 2 0e 4s was selected for all simulations here 3 2 domain and boundary conditions the numerical model of the propeller and the connection structure is shown in fig 12 other than using the same working conditions of the model tests single bow thruster condition without fairing the corresponding numerical simulations were also performed for different fillet radii of the tunnel openings with single bow thruster and multiple bow thrusters conditions without fairing in addition the numerical simulations for the hull only without propeller were also performed at each inflow angle to analyze the influence of the hull on the velocity distribution on the paddle disk details of each series of simulations and their abbreviations are illustrated in table 2 numerical simulations were carried out for the two working conditions for the multiple thruster conditions to analyze the effects of induced flow direction on the hydrodynamic performance of multiple bow thrusters the specific settings of the numerical simulations are presented below 3 2 1 open water condition the computational domain of open water condition is divided into two cylindrical domains the outflow domain and the rotation domain the outflow domain contains most areas of the computation field including the tunnel of the propeller and the connection the diameter of the rotation domain is set to 0 2415 m and the length is 0 24 m because the gap between the tunnel and the blade tip of the propeller is only 3 mm considering the boundary layer attached to both the propeller and the tunnel the dimensions and boundary conditions are shown in fig 13 3 2 2 no thruster and single thruster condition the dimensions of the ship hull are the same with the test model since the design speed of the ship is low enough fr less than 0 06 the impact of wave can be ignored and the multiple model method is adopted the free surface is treated as a symmetry plane and the hull above the water surface is ignored the numerical model of the no fairing hull is illustrated in fig 14 to analyze the influence of the fillet radius at the tunnel opening numerical simulations were also conducted for another four hull models with different fillet radii in addition to the no fairing condition the radius is set to 0 005 d 0 01 d 0 02 d and 0 03 d respectively the propeller and the connection structure are installed in the centered tunnel to be consistent with the experimental conditions the height and width of the computation domain were set to 1 6 m and 3 m respectively which is the same size of the circulating tunnel the computation domain is also divided into two part the external domain contains the hull and the connection structure and the rotation domain contains the propeller to make sure that the wake field is fully developed the length of the computation domain was set to 24 m which is three times of the cwc test section detailed dimensions and boundary conditions are shown in fig 15 only the external domain is simulated for the no thruster condition because the propeller is ignored the other settings remain the same with a single thruster condition 3 2 3 multiple thruster condition the ship model and boundary conditions of multiple thrusters are the same as the single thruster condition described in section 3 2 2 three rotation domains were established to simulate the rotation of different propellers the numerical model and the definition of the propeller index are shown in fig 16 similar to the actual vessel the second propeller is installed on the opposite side of the first and the third propeller the first and the second propeller work collectively the third propeller is used only in emergencies since the install directions of the 1st and 2nd propellers are opposite the pitch angle of the 2nd propeller is negative to the 1st propeller to gain thrust in the same direction under condition 1 the pitch angles of the 1st and the 2nd propellers are set to 19 and 19 respectively under condition 2 the pitch angles of the 1st and the 2nd propellers are set to 19 and 19 3 3 mesh generation and sensitivity study due to the complex geometrical characteristics of the propeller and the tiny gap between the blade tip and the tunnel unstructured trim mesh is applied here with a boundary layer that is refined using prism elements sixteen layers of prism mesh are generated with a growth ratio of 1 1 because a large velocity gradient was observed in the wall normal direction the first prism element center y is set to 1 0 the accuracy of cfd results largely depends on the mesh resolution thus mesh sensitivity studies were performed under a rotational velocity 13 87 r s inflow velocity 0 301 m s and inflow angle of 0 both open water conditions and single thruster conditions are considered and the rotation domain mesh sizes of the two conditions remained the same six different mesh solutions were calculated for each condition the number of different meshes increased by 2 times the numerical results are compared with experimental data and presented in fig 17 under open water conditions there is only subtle change when the element number is larger than 3 48 106 even though the accuracy of k t and k q is still increasing for single propeller conditions k t tends to change slightly when the element number is larger than 1 04 107 while the change trends of k q do not plateau until there are more than 1 04 107 elements overall 3 48 106 elements is optimal for open water conditions and 1 04 107 is optimal for single thruster conditions the mesh sizes of the propeller and the hull of the remaining calculations no thruster condition and multiple thruster condition are the same as these two conditions detailed mesh structures are shown in fig 18 4 results and discussion 4 1 accuracy validation of cfd simulations the accuracy of the cfd simulation was validated by comparing numerical results with experimental data the open water characteristics obtained by both model tests and numerical simulations are summarized in fig 19 fig 19 shows that the accuracy of the numerical results decreases gradually with increasing advance coefficient j but the error is rather small when j is less than 0 4 the computed mean absolute errors of k t k q and η are 2 04 1 49 and 1 60 and the maximum errors are 4 26 2 31 and 3 91 respectively j of the bow thruster that studied in this paper is from 0 09 to 0 09 in this range the mean absolute errors of k t k q and η are only 1 18 1 36 and 1 62 respectively the numerical and experimental results of the single thruster condition are summarized in fig 20 in these cases the influence of the hull and the inflow angle complicates the flow field the computational accuracy is slightly lower than the open water condition the numerical results are larger than the experimental data for both k t and k q the mean absolute errors of k t and k q are 5 10 and 2 47 while the maximum errors are 9 51 and 3 13 respectively in summary the numerical results of open water conditions are sufficiently accurate the accuracy of the numerical simulations for single propeller conditions is slightly lower but acceptable because of the simplified numerical model and complex flow field as a result cfd simulations are employed for the research below 4 2 influence of the hull and inflow angle to verify the influence of the hull on the hydrodynamic performance of the bow thruster the k t and k q at each axial projection velocity are interpolated and calculated from the calculated open water characteristics the results are compared with the single thruster condition and illustrated in fig 21 the change trends of k t and k q are almost the same as the model tests in order to analyze the influence of the hull and the inflow angle flow field details under no thruster conditions including the axial velocity distribution on the paddle disk the line integral convolutions cabral et al 1993 of the waterline plane velocity and the line integral convolutions lic of the section plane are drawn and summarized in fig 22 the waterline plane is on the same height of the thruster shaft center the section plane is perpendicular to the longitude direction and passes through the thruster shaft center along the longitudinal direction we define the side of the tunnel surface near the bow as the front side and the side far from the bow as the back side in the height direction the lower side is defined as the bottom and the other side is the top fig 22 shows that when the inflow angle is 0 or 180 the velocity magnitude in most areas of the tunnel is extremely low velocity changes only slightly at the back front side of the tunnel opening but the area is rather small the velocity distribution at the paddle disk is symmetrical especially in the height direction when the inflow direction is parallel to the axis of the propeller a small scale reversed flow appears at both the front and the back side of the tunnel opening since the hull is expanding along the longitudinal direction the area of the reversed flow zone at the front side is larger than that of the back side in addition a large flow separation zone will be formed at the top of the tunnel opening when the fluid flows through the tunnel an obvious reversed flow zone can be observed at the top of the paddle disk when the inflow angle is 90 when the inflow angle is 270 although there is no reversed flow zone the velocity magnitude at the top of the paddle disk is quite small the velocity distribution on the paddle disk is slightly asymmetrical in the longitudinal direction but is significantly divided into two regions in the height direction for other inflow angles large scale flow separation occurs at the top and the front back side of the tunnel opening the velocity distribution on the paddle disk is layered along an oblique line and shows a strong asymmetry in both the longitudinal and height direction moreover the average velocity in the tunnel may also affected by the hull average velocities v at all inflow angles are calculated by equation 4 and summarized in table 3 4 v q ρ s here q is the mass flow rate in the tunnel ρ is the density of water and s is the cross section area of the tunnel table 3 shows that when the inflow angle is 0 the mass flow rate in the tunnel is almost zero at 180 due to the shrinkage trend of the hull from back to front the averaged velocity in the tunnel is not zero but is very small for other inflow angles the mass flow rate in the tunnel is lower than the ideal case because of the large scale reversed flow zone furthermore the coupling of the propeller induced flow with the hull and inflow angle makes the flow field in the tunnel more complex while working flow field details under single thruster condition are illustrated in fig 23 the direction of the induced flow tends to deviate toward the hull due to the coanda effect flow separation occurs while fluid flows through the opening of the tunnel and the area of the reversed flow zone is correlated with the degree of surface curvature change and inflow angle unlike the no thruster condition large scale reversed flow can be observed at the bottom of the tunnel opening at all inflow angles when inflow angle is 0 180 the reversed flow area expands at the front back side but weakens to almost disappearing at the back front side in the case of a positive advance coefficient the inflow angle ranging from 0 to 180 the reversed flow area exists on both sides of the water plane obvious flow separation can also be observed at the top of the tunnel opening the reversed flow area on the water plane is much smaller with a negative advance coefficient the inflow angle ranging from 180 to 360 this is affected by both the connection structure and negative inflow the flow field at the top of the tunnel opening becomes much smoother the pressure distribution on the propeller face and back in both the open water condition and the single thruster condition are compared in fig 24 because of the large scale reversed flow at the bottom of the tunnel opening high low pressure region on the face back of blade 3 numbered as fig 3 is obviously expanding its amplitude also increases more or less in addition the low high pressure region on the blade becomes closer to the tip of the blade for single thruster condition this region is affected by the reversed flow zone at the tunnel opening and the shape is narrowed and elongated the asymmetry of velocity distribution in the tunnel is due to the influence of the hull the inflow angle and propeller induced flow this asymmetry results in a significant difference in pressure distribution on different blades the non uniformity pressure distribution on the propeller can lead to a slight decrease in the torque even when the thrust increases but the unstable forces acting on the hull structure and enhanced vibration of the propeller are predictable fig 25 shows the flow field in the first tunnel and the third tunnel at all inflow angles the flow in the first and the third tunnel is mainly caused by the coupling effect between the inlet flow and the hull and the velocity magnitude is quite small the suction direction of the bow thruster is perpendicular to the longitudinal section of the hull although the direction of the inlet flow varies from 0 to 315 and the streamline of the suction always deviates from the hull somewhat fig 27 thus the influence of the two empty tunnels on the suction is quite small there are minimal anti suction effects on the performance of the bow thruster 4 3 influence of opening fairing the thrust and torque at each inflow angle were calculated for the other four hulls with different tunnel opening fillet radii the tunnel opening fillet radius for each hull is 0 005 r 0 010 r 0 02 r and 0 030 r respectively where r represents the propeller radius to more intuitively analyze the influence of tunnel opening fillet radius on hydrodynamic performance of bow thruster the efficiency of the bow thruster for each simulation are calculated via equation 5 5 η t v a 2 π n q here v a is the averaged velocity in the tunnel calculated by equation 4 k t k q and η are summarized in fig 26 fig 26 shows that both k t and k q decrease continuously with increasing fillet radius the efficiency raises at each inflow angle moreover the efficiency under a positive advance coefficient increases obviously but there is only a slight increase for negative advance coefficients the pressure distribution of the propeller and lic of the velocity in the tunnel at each fillet radius are summarized in fig 27 with the 0 inflow angle condition as an example the opening fairing has an obvious impact on smoothing the flow field in the tunnel fig 27 as the fillet radius increases the reversed flow at the opening of the tunnel obviously contracts especially at the bottom the large scale reversed flow at the bottom almost disappears when the fillet radius is up to 0 030 r meanwhile the pressure distribution on the blades also becomes uniform as the fillet radius increases the high low pressure regions on blade 3 obviously shrinks and the asymmetry pressure distribution of the propeller caused by a non uniform flow field is also alleviated the pressure distribution on the four blades is almost the same when the fillet radius is sufficiently large 4 4 interaction between multiple bow thrusters the two bow thrusters are installed in opposite directions to ensure the balance of forces acting on the hull in the width direction the pitch angles of the two propellers are also opposite to obtain thrust in the same direction there are two combination conditions for the two propellers 1 the pitch angle of the 1st propeller is set to 19 while the 2nd propeller is set to 19 condition 1 2 the pitch angle of the 1st propeller is set to 19 while the 2nd propeller is set to 19 condition 2 both conditions are simulated at all inflow angles and the results are compared with the single thruster condition and illustrated in figs 28 and 29 versus the interaction between multiple thrusters the propeller induced flow direction may have a greater impact on the hydrodynamic performance of the bow thruster the lic of the velocity distribution on the waterline plane is illustrated in fig 29 for the two conditions under two typical inflow angles 0 and 180 when the induced flow direction of the propeller is negative fluid passes the connection first and then flows through the propeller namely 2nd propeller in condition 1 and 1st propeller in condition 2 buffering by the tunnel wall and the connection leads to a uniform distribution of velocity distribution at the paddle disk the efficiency of the bow thruster is significantly higher than that of positive induced flow direction the two bow thrusters work together for the bow thruster with a positive induced flow direction here the induced flow trajectory of the downstream thruster is affected by the upstream thruster and deviates slightly from the hull fig 30 for example the 1st thruster in condition 1 has improved propulsion efficiency when the inflow angle ranges from 90 to 270 with a smaller reversed flow zone at the tunnel opening 5 conclusion we report a thorough investigation on the hydrodynamic performance of bow thrusters via experimental and numerical methods the influence of the hull the inflow angle the tunnel opening fairing and the interaction between multiple bow thrusters was considered the open water tests and single bow thruster tests at different inflow angles are performed numerical simulations were performed under the same conditions and its accuracy was verified by comparing numerical results with experimental results the other four hulls with different fillet radii at the tunnel opening were simulated for a single thruster condition at each inflow angle simulations for multiple bow thrusters were also performed by analyzing the numerical and experimental results the following conclusions can be reported 1 numerical simulations have sufficient accuracy for predicting the torque and thrust for the open water condition and the single bow thruster condition 2 the coupling effect of the hull inflow direction and propeller induced flow makes the flow field in the tunnel extremely confusing the uneven velocity distribution results in an asymmetry of pressure distribution on the propeller this may lead to unstable forces acting on the hull structure and enhanced vibration of the propeller 3 the fairing of the tunnel opening can improve the quality of the flow field in the tunnel with increasing opening fillet radius the velocity distribution in the tunnel becomes much more uniform and the pressure distribution on the propeller tends to be symmetrical thus the efficiency of the bow thrusters is improved 4 the propeller induced flow direction has a great impact on the hydrodynamic performance of the bow thruster when the induced flow passes the connection first and then flows through the propeller the connection structure and the tunnel wall can reduce the non uniformity of the flow this dramatically improves the efficiency of the bow thruster 5 with co operation the induced flow trajectory of the downstream thruster is affected by the upstream one and the downstream thruster deviates from the hull surface a reduced reversed flow zone at the tunnel opening may lead to a slightly increase in propulsion efficiency in order to be consistent with the experimental conditions the numerical simulations in this study were performed in narrow waters and a simplified numerical model also makes the results slightly different from the real situation moreover the influences of the tunnel length and the installation position of the bow thruster were not considered because the research is carried out for a specific vessel future work will focus on these issues credit authorship contribution statement feng yukun software investigation formal
