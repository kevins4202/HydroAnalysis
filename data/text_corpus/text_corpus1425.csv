7125,the goal of this study was to determine if assimilating a combination of various derived data products can help circumvent some of the difficulties associated with urban watershed modeling combinations of the snodas snow data assimilation system snow water equivalent data the smos soil moisture and ocean salinity l2 soil moisture and streamflow observations were used for the data assimilation schemes combinations of these observation data sets were assimilated into lumped conceptual rainfall runoff models of the highly urbanized don river basin in southern ontario to determine if assimilation of geophysical variables will have a significant impact on simulations and forecasting in an urbanized watershed the ensemble kalman filter enkf data assimilation method was used for these analyses with various rainfall runoff models that include gr4j hymod mac hbv and sac sma models the best data assimilation scheme for hydrologic modeling involved using a combination of streamflow soil moisture and snow water equivalent while performing both state and parameter updating these results suggest that using a combination of soil moisture and snow water equivalent from the smos and snodas data products can improve simulations and ensemble forecasts in an urban basin keywords data assimilation urban watershed ensemble forecasting hydrologic modeling soil moisture snow water equivalent 1 introduction urbanization is an increasing global trend which can have impacts on the hydrology of a watershed these impacts include an increase in impervious surfaces reduced infiltration lower baseflow increased runoff and more flashy ness in the hydrograph all of which contribute to the difficulty in simulating an urbanized basin mcpherson and schneider 1974 urban hydrology is important to understand and model due to the impacts it has on the often dense local population therefore it is important to determine simple and easy methods which can be used to overcome the difficulties and improve rainfall runoff modeling in urban areas previous studies have assessed the use of data assimilation to improve urban basin modeling by integrating one observation type such as water level or discharge branisavljevic et al 2014 hutton et al 2014 this paper will explore the improvements data assimilation which integrates multiple observation types can have on urban basin modeling with various conceptual rainfall runoff models both the soil moisture and snow water equivalent swe play important roles in the hydrology of a watershed and have been shown to improve streamflow estimations when assimilated into a hydrologic model huang et al 2017 moradkhani 2008 samuel et al 2014 better quantification of soil moisture in a watershed leads to a more accurate estimation of the rainfall quantity that becomes runoff or infiltration in northern and or snow dominated basins snowmelt can be a large contributor to runoff therefore better estimates of snowmelt in the form of snow water equivalent can lead to better estimation of streamflow moradkhani 2008 these observations are available through several data products which can provide informative variables at near real time frequency can be used for data assimilation and are of interest to hydrologists possible data products include the european space agency s esa soil moisture and ocean salinity smos data rodríguez fernández et al 2017 the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa soil moisture active passive smap data and the national operational hydrologic remote sensing center s nohrsc snow data assimilation system snodas data to name a few entekhabi et al 2008 kerr et al 2010 national operations hydrologic remote sensing center 2004 the nohrsc has provided daily gridded estimates of snow parameters such as swe through the snodas program since 2004 national operations hydrologic remote sensing center 2004 this paper will explore the use of the smos l2 soil moisture and the snodas snow water equivalent data products for assimilation into conceptual rainfall runoff models to determine if they can be used to improve hydrologic modeling in an urban basin data assimilation will be used to help merge these datasets with the hydrologic models while also accounting for the uncertainty in both the models and the data products liu et al 2012 reichle 2008 the ensemble kalman filter enkf proposed by evensen 1994 was used for data assimilation in these analyses there are several examples in which the enkf has been used for hydrologic modeling and forecasting abaza et al 2014 alvarez garreton et al 2015 clark et al 2008 crow and ryu 2009 dumedah and coulibaly 2013 komma et al 2008 massari et al 2015 moradkhani et al 2005 neal et al 2007 samuel et al 2014 thiboult and anctil 2015 vrugt and robinson 2007 wanders et al 2014 weerts and el serafy 2006 moradkhani et al 2005 proposed dual state parameter updating using the enkf and samuel et al 2014 found that using both streamflow and soil moisture observations together to update state and model parameters provided more accurate forecasts snow data assimilation which includes assimilation of swe has also been examined in previous studies and has been shown to improve hydrologic simulations and forecasts bergeron et al 2016 dziubanski and franz 2016 huang et al 2017 liu et al 2012 moradkhani 2008 building on these previous findings this study will assess some combinations of streamflow swe soil moisture in a dual state parameter updating scheme with different hydrologic models to enhance streamflow forecast in urban watershed 2 study area and data the study area being focused on in this paper is the don river basin drb in toronto ontario canada fig 1 the drb is managed by the toronto region conservation authority trca it contains several sub catchments the largest of them being the upper east don german mills creek lower east don upper west don lower west don taylor massey creek and the lower don river the drb is approximately 350 km2 and is a mostly urban watershed being roughly 80 developed with the remaining area being split between crops and pasture forest and wetland natural resources canada 2009 this area has an average daily temperature of 9 4 c the average daily minimum and maximum temperatures are 5 9 c 12 9 c respectively and an average annual precipitation of 831 3 mm year based on the 1981 2010 canadian climate normals environment and climate change canada 2017 major soils in the drb include sandy loam loam clay loam and clay ontario ministry of agriculture 2015 and its elevation ranges from 75 to 330 m above mean sea level masl daily precipitation temperature and snow depth data sets were obtained from environment and climate change canada eccc weather stations and evapotranspiration was estimated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 three observation data sets were used for data assimilation they are daily streamflow data from environment canada s hydrometric database hydat daily swe from snodas national operations hydrologic remote sensing center 2004 and daily soil moisture sm from the esa s smos satellite kerr et al 2010 3 methodology 3 1 data processing 3 1 1 snodas snow water equivalent data one of this study s goals is to assess the assimilation of snow data as swe into models of an urban basin several snodas data products are available including swe and snow depth the snodas swe data product will be the source for the data being assimilated the snodas products are developed as follows first data from the rapid refresh numerical weather prediction model rapid update cycle numerical weather prediction model for dates before may 1 2012 are downscaled from 13 to 1 km2 next these data are used to drive the nohrsc snow model nsm at a resolution of 1 km2 finally available remote sensing radar and ground station snow observations are assimilated into the model using a newtonian nudging technique to produce a best estimate of near real time snow conditions carroll et al 2006 clow et al 2012 to determine the validity of using the snodas data the eccc snow on ground snow depth data available at gauges within and near the drb was used to validate and bias correct the snodas snow depth and swe data this was done since swe and snow depth are related and there are no swe measurements available from eccc a cumulative distribution function cdf matching bias correction method which uses polynomial fitting drusch et al 2005 kornelsen and coulibaly 2015 was used to correct the snodas snow depth such that it s cdf matched the eccc snow depth a consequence of this method is the ability to apply the polynomial to other data sets in order to implement a similar bias correction since no actual eccc swe data set is available in the study area the bias correction used to correct snodas snow depth was applied to the snodas swe data set to correct potential bias it may have this assumes that since snow depth and swe are related they would contain a similar relative bias when compared with the eccc observations for comparison only a pseudo swe data set was generated using a quick estimate from the eccc snow depth values to compare with the bias corrected snodas swe this quick estimate was based on environment canada 2013 and dubé 2003 where it is shown that using a 10 1 ratio although not exact for converting snow depth to swe can provide a good estimate to evaluate the correction method the bias the root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used they are defined as follows 1 bias y x 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 1 2 3 nse 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 where x i is the observed data eccc data at time i x is the mean of the observed data y i is the simulated data snodas data at time i y is the mean of the simulated data and n is the sample size the rmse was used to measure the fit between the observed and simulated data lower values being preferable the bias shows the consistent difference between the data and is better as the absolute bias approaches zero nse can be used to show how accurately the simulated and observed values match each other and ranges from to 1 with 1 being a perfect match 3 1 2 smos l2 soil moisture data the smos satellite was launched in november 2009 it has a revisit time for both its ascending 6 am and descending 6 pm passes every three days at the equator kerr et al 2012 2010 soil moisture data from the smos soil moisture level 2 user data products which also contains retrieved parameters such as optical thickness and surface temperature was used for this study kerr et al 2010 this data is retrieved using the smos satellite s l band microwave radiometer which operates in the 1 4 ghz band range kerr et al 2012 in the smos l2 data product soil moisture is retrieved on a 15 km discrete global grid dgg however the resolution of the instrument on the satellite is 43 km around each dgg center kerr et al 2012 2010 therefore there is overlap in the sensing area between dggs within the drb there are two smos dgg points dgg206279 and dgg206792 that have retrieved soil moisture data available every three days because of the inherent overlap and to minimize uncertainty the mean of the two drb dggs was calculated as the basin average soil moisture when two retrievals were available to use the soil moisture values at these points the data was first filtered based on their probability of radio frequency interference rfi as well as their data quality index values this filtering was done for both the ascending overpass which is retrieved in the mornings and descending overpass which is retrieved during the evenings soil moisture data retrievals with rfi probability and data quality index values greater than 0 1 were removed kornelsen et al 2016 assimilation of soil moisture 3only occurred during the non freezing months of may to october to avoid the impact of retrievals of frozen soils fig 2 illustrates the similarity of the smos soil moisture data from each dgg point within the drb using the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test the distribution of the ascending and descending retrievals at each dgg were compared and shown to be from the same distribution α 0 01 from this comparison it was determined that a combination of the data from each dgg could be used to obtain one ascending and one descending soil moisture data set for the drb which could both be used for assimilation the significance of the role of soil moisture in rainfall runoff modeling can often be under valued in urban areas due to the influence of impervious surfaces this presumption may also hold for the drb as a highly urbanized basin fig 1 to explore the validity of this assumption and justify the use of assimilation of smos soil moisture spectral unmixing was used to determine the pervious areas of the watershed 3 1 3 spectral unmixing spectral unmixing is a method that can determine the contents of an image pixel if that pixel contains more than one material nascimento and dias 2005 for this research it will be used to identify the pervious land cover in the drb as part of the justification for assimilating soil moisture data in a highly developed urban basin fig 1 using google s earth engine google earth engine team 2015 a mosaic of landsat 8 surface reflectance images over the drb was created to help filter out cloud cover and other atmospheric interferences the mosaic was then spectrally unmixed to find the relative proportion of pervious versus impervious regions each pixel is presumed to contain some mixed proportion of relevant land cover types pervious impervious and water by comparing the spectral characteristics of the mixed pixel to within scene pure pixels referred to as endmembers the relative proportion of each land cover type with a landsat pixel can be determined small 2002 2001 the vertex component analysis vca method was chosen to identify spectral endmembers since it is quick and performs as well as manually determining the endmembers nascimento and dias 2005 vca exploits the fact that the endmembers used to identify substances are the vertices of a simplex and it is based on the assumption that pure pixels exist in the data the vca algorithm iteratively finds a preset number of purest endmembers which correspond to the most abundant land covers in this case vca was used to determine three endmembers of the landsat 8 mosaic using bands 1 7 ultra blue blue green red near infrared shortwave infrared 1 shortwave infrared 2 which were then spectrally unmixed into a 3 band image that could be used to determine the land cover fraction of each pixel water vegetation urban 3 2 hydrologic models four lumped hydrologic models were used in this study to model the drb they are the gr4j modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier hymod hydrologic model mac hbv mcmaster university hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning and sac sma sacramento soil moisture accounting models these models were calibrated using the particle swarm optimization pso kennedy and spears 1998 which has been used to calibrate rainfall runoff models previously chau 2006 gill et al 2006 li et al 2009 to determine optimal parameter sets for the open loop simulations used for comparison with the data assimilation results each model was calibrated using data from 2001 01 01 to 2010 12 31 and validated against 2011 01 01 to 2013 12 31 values using the pso the optimal parameter sets were found by maximizing the nash volume error nve performance metric from samuel et al 2012 4 nve 0 5 nse 0 1 ve 0 25 nse log 0 25 nse sqr where nse is the nash sutcliffe efficiency ve is the volume error ve bias x nselog is the nse calculated using the log streamflow values for low flows and nsesqr is the nse found using the squared streamflow values for high flows the gr4j is an empirical hydrologic model that has four parameters and runs on a daily scale perrin et al 2003 in this study gr4j was modified to include the degree day snow routine described in samuel et al 2011 so that it would contain a swe state which could be updated during assimilation the modified model will henceforth be referred to as gr4j sr inputs for the gr4j sr model include precipitation evapotranspiration temperature and the parameter set optimized by the pso the model parameters and states are shown in table 1 the hydrologic model hymod developed by boyle 2001 is a simple conceptual rainfall runoff model as with the gr4j model the hymod model used for these analyses was modified to include the snow routine from samuel et al 2011 the modified model will be referred to as hymod sr inputs for the hymod sr model include precipitation evapotranspiration temperature and the parameter set optimized by the pso the model parameters and states are shown in table 2 the mac hbv model is a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model developed by samuel et al 2012 2011 based on the hbv model bergsröm 1976 for estimating streamflow in ungauged ontario basins the mac hbv incorporates a nonlinear response function a routing routine a degree day snow routine that is used to determine the swe from the forcing data a soil moisture routine used to show the change in soil moisture storage in the catchment and uses a nonlinear storage discharge relationship in the soil layers samuel et al 2012 2011 both the swe and soil moisture states from these routines will be updated using the chosen data assimilation method inputs into the mac hbv model include precipitation temperature and the calibrated parameter set from the pso the parameters and state variables used are summarized in table 3 the sac sma is a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model with several parameters and model states table 4 there are five storages within the model used to represent the water accumulation in the catchment burnash 1995 burnash et al 1973 koren et al 2004 the upper soil layer consists of both upper zone water storage contents while the lower soil layer consists of the three lower zone water storage contents the sum of the upper and lower soil layers was considered as the soil moisture for use in data assimilation samuel et al 2014 the degree day snow routine within the model is used to determine the swe from the forcing data samuel et al 2014 the sac sma model has been applied in several studies and is extensively used for operational streamflow forecasting samuel et al 2014 vrugt et al 2006b 2006a vrugt and robinson 2007 3 3 data assimilation using the ensemble kalman filter the enkf was used for both state and dual state parameter estimating moradkhani et al 2005 samuel et al 2014 for this study eight data assimilation schemes were used for each hydrologic model table 5 state updating was performed using streamflow soil moisture snow water equivalent and combined soil moisture snow water equivalent observations dual state parameter updating was also performed using streamflow observations to update the parameter values in each case samuel et al 2014 previously showed that using streamflow to update the parameter values and soil moisture to update state values allowed for more accurate estimates of streamflow and soil moisture since the combination allows for the model to better adjust over time the sm and swe values were used to update their related states and parameters while the streamflow observations were used to update all or remaining states and parameters this is illustrated in fig 3 the related states and parameters updated for each model using snodas swe based on notation from tables 1 4 are swe tr scf ddf and rcr the related states and parameters updated using smos sm based on notation from tables 1 4 are s and x1 gr4j sr s bexp and cmax hymod sr ssm fc and flp mac hbv and uztwc uzfwc lztwc lzfpc lzfsc uztwm uzfwm lztwm lzfpm and lzfsm sac sma for the assimilation schemes using snodas swe the updates to state values were performed for the months of november april if data was available when updating using smos soil moisture the ascending pass data was prioritized over the descending pass such that the descending retrieval was assimilated only if there was no soil moisture data available from the ascending retrieval since the models are run at a daily timestep the ascending overpass 6 am retrieval is assumed to provide a better representation of the antecedent soil moisture conditions of the day additionally the ascending has been shown to perform better than the descending pass jackson et al 2012 kornelsen et al 2016 since data assimilation is used to help remove random error in the model outputs the smos soil moisture data was bias corrected using cdf matching to each of the models soil moisture states ascending and descending separately cdf matching was chosen based on the results of kornelsen and coulibaly 2015 this adjustment was made so that the observations better fit the model to help avoid systematic errors since unbiased errors are an important assumption for data assimilation methods reichle 2008 the enkf developed by evensen 2003 1994 uses a monte carlo approach to estimate the posterior distributions of the model output by using an ensemble estimate of their priors due to uncertainty related to initial conditions especially when using data assimilation for both parameter and state estimating several simulations can be run to determine the performance of the data assimilation method the optimal ensemble size was determined for each model based on this fact see section 3 3 1 the enkf was formulated as follows moradkhani et al 2005 samuel et al 2014 5 u t i u t ζ t i where u t i is the perturbed forcing data at time t for ensemble member i ut is the unperturbed forcing data and ζ t i is the noise added to the forcing data to generate i ensemble members the precipitation was perturbed using lognormally distributed noise ζ t i logn 0 σ t u whereas the temperature and evaporation was perturbed using normally distributed noise ζ t i n 0 σ t u the variance of the noise σ t u is used to influence the ensemble spread to better account for uncertainty it is calculated by taking the square of the product of the forcing data u t and a proportionality factor γ this proportionality term is considered a hyper parameter which can be adjusted to improve results and ensure adequate ensemble spread moradkhani et al 2005 thiboult and anctil 2015 the state variables being updated in each model are in general calculated as follows 6 x t 1 i f x t i u t i θ where x t 1 i is the non updated vector of state variables in the model at time t 1 for ensemble member i f is the operator within the models that propagate the state variables x t i is the updated vector of state variables at time t for ensemble i and θ is the vector of parameters θ t i for dual state parameter updating for the dual state parameter updating assimilation scheme the parameter set θ t i at t 1 is generated from a uniform distribution for each ensemble member and each parameter based on the ranges in tables 1 4 the hydrologic model outputs are then calculated as follows 7 y t 1 i h x t 1 i θ ν t 1 i ν t 1 i n 0 σ t 1 m where y t 1 i is the simulated model output at time t 1 for ensemble member i h is the hydrologic model ν t 1 i is normally distributed noise at time t for ensemble member i and σ t 1 m is the variance of the noise found by taking the square of the product of the model output and its hyper parameter ω this noise is used to represent uncertainty related to the model structure to perform the update an ensemble of observations is generated at each time step by perturbing measured data as follows 8 y t 1 i y t 1 η t 1 i η t 1 i n 0 σ t 1 y where y t 1 i is the perturbed observation data used for updating the state or parameter vector for i ensemble members at time t 1 y t 1 is the observation at time t 1 η t 1 i is the normally distributed noise with variance σ t 1 y used for perturbing the observations into i ensemble members and the variance of the noise is found by taking the square of the product of the observation data with the hyper parameter ρ the kalman gain used in the enkf is calculated as follows 9 k t 1 σ t 1 xy σ t 1 yy σ t 1 y 1 where k t 1 is the kalman gain at time t 1 σ t 1 xy is the cross covariance of the state variable ensembles with the prediction ensemble streamflow soil moisture or snow water equivalent and σ t 1 yy is the error covariance of matrix of the streamflow or soil moisture or snow water equivalent prediction ensemble after calculating equations 5 9 the updated state or parameter vector is then found by 10 x t 1 i x t 1 i k t 1 y t 1 i y t 1 i where x t 1 i is the updated state or parameter vector for time t 1 and ensemble member i after the states or parameters are updated realism is checked to ensure values are not out of their allowed ranges this is repeated every time step until the simulation has been completed 3 3 1 determining hyper parameter values and optimal ensemble sizes the hyper parameters are used to control the ensemble spread caused by perturbation of forcing data γ observations ρ and simulated model results ω moradkhani et al 2005 thiboult and anctil 2015 the normalized rmse ratio nrr was used to help determine the optimal ensemble size and hyper parameter values such that they would not cause too much or too little spread murphy 1988 and has been used in previous studies alvarez garreton et al 2014 moradkhani et al 2005 thiboult and anctil 2015 the nrr is defined as follows 11 nrr 1 t t 1 t 1 n i 1 n y t i y t 2 1 n i 1 n 1 t t 1 t y t i y t 2 n 1 2 n where t is the length of the time series n is the number of ensemble members y t is the observation at time t and y t i is the simulated value at time t for ensemble i the ideal value for nrr is 1 while if nrr 1 or nrr 1 there is too much or too little spread respectively using the das5 assimilation scheme hyper parameter values for the forcing data streamflow observations and models were generated from the uniform distribution u 0 0 5 and tested against ensemble sizes ranging from 25 to 500 the combinations which provided the best nse value along with an nrr value closest to 1 were chosen for each model additionally the hyper parameter used to perturb the smos l2 soil moisture and the snodas swe were determined based on uncertainty analysis performed in previous studies al bitar et al 2012 clow et al 2012 kerr et al 2012 kornelsen and coulibaly 2015 zhang and yang 2016 finally a pairwise comparison of the ensemble means was used to confirm that at the chosen ensemble size based on nrr the mean nse was not significantly different from subsequent increases in ensemble size 3 4 evaluation of assimilation schemes to determine the performance of each data assimilation scheme and model combination for the don river basin the ensemble means of the hydrologic assimilation experiments were evaluated using the kling gupta efficiency kge performance metric gupta et al 2009 12 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between the simulated and observed runoff values α σ s σ o is the measure of relative variability in the simulated and observed values and β μ s μ o is the ratio between the simulated and observed values and is used to represent bias gupta et al 2009 the kge has a range from to 1 with 1 being the optimal value this metric uses the same components as the nse when these components are near their optimal values the kge will be near its optimal value which is not always the case for the nse gupta et al 2009 additionally the ensemble forecast performance of each assimilation scheme and model combination was also examined in this case the mean continues ranked probability score crps performance metric which assesses accuracy and resolution was used to evaluate the one to fourteen day ensemble forecast performances the cprs is formulated as matheson and winkler 1976 unger 1985 13 crps f x f y 1 y x 2 dy where f y is the cumulative distribution function of the forecast distribution ensemble forecasts y is the predicted variable simulated runoff x is used to verify the distribution observed runoff and 1 y x is the heaviside step function that provides a value of 1 if the predicted value is larger than the observed and 0 otherwise a perfect forecast is indicated with a cprs value of 0 there is no upper limit to the value using these performance metrics the potential improvements of each assimilation scheme will be easily quantified which will help identify the best performing assimilation scheme hydrologic model and combination of the two for performing hydrologic simulations and forecasts in an urban basin 4 results and discussions 4 1 data processing results 4 1 1 snodas the raw and bias corrected snodas data sets were compared with eccc data at various weather gauges as well as a thiessen polygon weighted basin average value for the period of 2011 01 01 to 2015 12 31 over this period the snodas data showed systematically higher values than the observations shown in tables 6 and 7 which is likely attributed to snodas not being ideally calibrated for small urban basins coupled with forcing data issues due to downscaling 13 km to 1 km grids this bias can be seen in the mean annual maximum values for snow depths being 435 mm and 299 mm and the average snow cover days being 110 days and 88 days for snodas and eccc data respectively the basin average estimate of swe is illustrated in fig 4 where there still exists a slight bias to the snodas swe product despite this the corrected snodas swe values can be used to provide a good estimate for the basin average swe 4 1 2 vca spectral unmixing the drb is recognized as a highly developed urban basin fig 1 in which the assimilation of soil moisture would often be dismissed to demonstrate the potential value of soil moisture assimilation in such a basin a better estimate of pervious land cover was produced by spectrally unmixing a landsat 8 surface reflectance image mosaic of the drb a temporal mosaic of images was used to better remove cloud cover and using data from the period 2013 06 01 to 2015 09 30 in the unmixed image it was assumed that vegetation cover was equivalent to pervious areas this is shown by vegetation fraction in fig 5 taking the averages of each pixel the urban vegetation and water coverages are shown to be 54 44 and 2 respectively based on these results there is a significant portion of the study area that can be considered pervious surface and it should be acceptable to use soil moisture assimilation in the drb 4 2 model calibration and validation the resulting performance metrics for both the calibration 2001 2010 and validation 2011 2013 periods are summarized in table 8 of note the performance during calibration varies between each model much more than during the validation period in which the gr4j sr performs noticeably better than the other three models during the validation however the gr4j sr hymod sr and sac sma have relatively similar performances with the sac sma being slightly better in both cases the mac hbv model does not perform as well these results are likely due to the differing model structures the gr4j sr and hymod sr are both simple and easily adaptable models therefore applying and using them in an urban basin is fairly easy the sac sma model can handle impervious areas due to the wide variety of parameters within the model making it adaptable for use in an urban basin as well however the mac hbv model does not have any parameters specifically for urban areas within the basin which may have led to its poorer performance these validation results will be used as an open loop comparison to the data assimilation schemes being tested to help illustrate the improvements the assimilation has on the hydrologic simulations 4 3 optimal hyper parameters and ensemble size for each hydrologic model the ensemble size test results are illustrated in fig 6 these results show that increasing the ensemble size increases the nse performance of the models ensemble mean and decreases the amount that the performance can vary this test showed that for the hymod sr the optimal ensemble size was 200 for the mac hbv and sacsma models the optimal ensemble size was 250 and the optimal ensemble size for gr4j sr was 325 additionally fig 6 shows that the mac hbv and sac sma model performances have higher variability than the other two models this is due to them having more parameters to update to ensure the best results from the assimilation schemes tuning of the hyper parameters was done to better quantify the uncertainty in the observations and models moradkhani et al 2005 thiboult and anctil 2015 summarized in table 9 are the hyper parameter values used for each model 4 4 hydrologic model performance using different data assimilation schemes the main focus of this study is to determine the effects of assimilating soil moisture snow water equivalent and streamflow under various data assimilation schemes can have on hydrologic simulation and forecasting in an urban basin to assess the effect assimilating these observations have on simulating the drb two performance metrics were examined the kge and the nse the nse being the traditional measure of hydrologic model performance and the kge which is relatively newer and uses the same components as nse to partition performance into contributing components gupta et al 2009 due to the metrics similarities the assimilation schemes being compared are considered acceptable if they perform better than the calibrated model for only one of the metrics from the results shown in fig 7 it is apparent that models perform the best under the assimilation schemes das1 4 based on the improvements seen compared to the open loop simulation when comparing the average relative improvements over the open loop simulation for both kge and nse das2 performed the best the gr4j sr model had the largest improvement over the ol seen from das6 which had an increase in nse from 0 6 to 0 69 with similar increase in performance seen from the other dual state parameter estimating schemes this agrees with the results of samuel et al 2014 which stated that the combination helped to account for variations through time in the model parameters hymod sr showed minor improvement in kge for das3 and das4 mac hbv showed minor kge improvement in das1 4 and sac sma showed minor improvements in kge for das2 8 these results indicate that the only model of the four tested to significantly benefit from data assimilation when simulating the runoff of an urban basin is gr4j sr additionally these results suggest that the improvement from state updates is smoothed out the longer the simulation which can be seen in the forecast results finally the results show that data assimilation which updates both states and parameters has the potential to reduce the performance of a model mac hbv das5 8 although this may be due to mac hbv lacking a parameter which explicitly considers urban areas illustrated in fig 8 are the 2013 01 01 to 2013 12 31 simulated ensemble means for each hydrologic model and the four best performing data assimilation schemes here it is apparent that the ensemble means do not always capture the peak flows despite the model s performances however when looking at the ensemble simulation results from das2 for example fig 9 the extreme ensemble values can capture the majority of those peak flows also apparent in fig 9 is that mac hbv has some issues capturing low flows within the drb which is likely due to it being initially developed to simulate natural catchments and its inability to account for impervious areas 4 5 performance of ensemble forecasts ensemble forecasts were made using perfect weather forecasts meteorological observations and the updated states and parameter values for each model and assimilation scheme the perfect forecast was chosen to help reduce uncertainty in the forcing data these forecasts were made for lead times of up to 14 days over the 2011 01 01 to 2013 12 31 period to evaluate the performance of these ensemble forecasts the crps was used the results for each model and assimilation scheme are shown in fig 10 for the hymod sr mac hbv and sac sma models the best performances for each assimilation scheme are generally shown for the 1 day ahead forecast the gr4j sr however performed its best for the 2 day ahead forecast which is likely due to the model s structure more specifically how it utilizes unit hydrographs for routing as the forecast lead times increase the mean crps values begin to degrade and converge towards the ol values for each model and assimilation scheme with the exception of das8 for sac sma which shows consistent performance over the forecast horizon the performance of the state updating assimilation schemes show as good or better performance for each model over all forecast horizons which agrees with the literature in that more accurate states produce better forecast results moradkhani 2008 reichle 2008 however the performance of the dual state parameter assimilation schemes varies depending on the model which is most apparent with the hymod sr and mac hbv forecast results where for short term forecasts updates to states and parameters das5 8 provide the hymod sr model with better ensemble forecasting skill which degraded slower when compared to only state updating das1 4 while for mac hbv das5 8 provides much worse performance which is also seen in fig 10 these differences could be attributed to structural differences in the models such as the simple fast and slow storages in hymod and gr4j which can easily adapt to urban basins as well as sac smas explicit consideration of urban areas while mac hbv lacks the ability to account for the quicker runoff from more than half the basin among the four models the top performing assimilation schemes for ensemble forecasting were das2 das3 and das4 when compared to the ol which suggests that assimilating the smos l2 sm and or the snodas swe data can improve the short term forecasts for an urban model additionally the best overall performance was seen from the sac sma model under das8 however the gr4j sr hymod sr and sac sma models had similar forecasting performances on average the das2 assimilation scheme showed the most improvement in ensemble forecast performance over all forecast horizons compared to the ol this is likely caused by the size and climate of the basin the watershed response is quick and the snow cover time is short allowing for antecedent soil moisture estimation to be the most meaningful variable of the three for runoff prediction when comparing the forecast performance from each assimilation scheme and model by ranking them from lowest to highest crps the best to worst performing for ensemble forecasting are das8 das2 das3 das7 das4 das6 das5 and das1 this shows that the forecasts benefit from the additional information provided from soil moisture and swe ultimately these results show that assimilation of the smos l2 soil moisture and the snodas swe data products can improve hydrologic modeling and forecasting in the don river basin this indicates that assimilating soil moisture and snow water equivalent could potentially improve hydrologic models of urban basins additionally when moving forward into semi distributed or distributed models these gridded data products would likely be more useful as there will be less chance of losing information due to aggregation of data when computing the basin average 5 conclusions this study examined the performance of four lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model s ability to simulate the streamflow in the urban don river basin under various data assimilation schemes as with previous studies assimilation of streamflow can improve the urban models performance e g branisavljevic et al 2014 hutton et al 2014 and others additionally this study showed that further improvements to model performance could be made through assimilating soil moisture and or swe although some models benefitted more than others the results showed that the simpler gr4j sr model had the most improved hydrologic simulations based on nse from data assimilation under the dual state and parameter updating assimilation schemes with the best performing being that of das6 for flow forecasting sac sma performed the best followed by hymod sr however the gr4j sr model was comparable for 2 days forecasts or longer das2 4 performed the best for the 1 day forecast while the das2 das3 and das8 provided the best overall performance when comparing all assimilation schemes for every forecast horizon in general the results show that assimilating the snodas swe and smos l2 sm data products can provide some improvement to different aspects of hydrologic simulation and forecasting which is apparent through the use of multiple performance metrics even in urban basins such as the drb however further improvements could likely be made to the results by using a different snow models such as snow17 which has been used in previous studies when assimilating swe data dechant and moradkhani 2011 dziubanski and franz 2016 huang et al 2017 or a more comprehensive analysis for error quantification since the enkf is known to perform better when the uncertainties associated with the model and observations are better quantified huang et al 2017 moradkhani et al 2005 additionally potential improvements could be made through identifying and addressing problematic variables which could arise from updating with different types of observational data finally the analysis performed here were for one basin on the daily time scale with lumped models further analyses are needed to determine if these results are valid at finer spatial and temporal scales as well

7125,the goal of this study was to determine if assimilating a combination of various derived data products can help circumvent some of the difficulties associated with urban watershed modeling combinations of the snodas snow data assimilation system snow water equivalent data the smos soil moisture and ocean salinity l2 soil moisture and streamflow observations were used for the data assimilation schemes combinations of these observation data sets were assimilated into lumped conceptual rainfall runoff models of the highly urbanized don river basin in southern ontario to determine if assimilation of geophysical variables will have a significant impact on simulations and forecasting in an urbanized watershed the ensemble kalman filter enkf data assimilation method was used for these analyses with various rainfall runoff models that include gr4j hymod mac hbv and sac sma models the best data assimilation scheme for hydrologic modeling involved using a combination of streamflow soil moisture and snow water equivalent while performing both state and parameter updating these results suggest that using a combination of soil moisture and snow water equivalent from the smos and snodas data products can improve simulations and ensemble forecasts in an urban basin keywords data assimilation urban watershed ensemble forecasting hydrologic modeling soil moisture snow water equivalent 1 introduction urbanization is an increasing global trend which can have impacts on the hydrology of a watershed these impacts include an increase in impervious surfaces reduced infiltration lower baseflow increased runoff and more flashy ness in the hydrograph all of which contribute to the difficulty in simulating an urbanized basin mcpherson and schneider 1974 urban hydrology is important to understand and model due to the impacts it has on the often dense local population therefore it is important to determine simple and easy methods which can be used to overcome the difficulties and improve rainfall runoff modeling in urban areas previous studies have assessed the use of data assimilation to improve urban basin modeling by integrating one observation type such as water level or discharge branisavljevic et al 2014 hutton et al 2014 this paper will explore the improvements data assimilation which integrates multiple observation types can have on urban basin modeling with various conceptual rainfall runoff models both the soil moisture and snow water equivalent swe play important roles in the hydrology of a watershed and have been shown to improve streamflow estimations when assimilated into a hydrologic model huang et al 2017 moradkhani 2008 samuel et al 2014 better quantification of soil moisture in a watershed leads to a more accurate estimation of the rainfall quantity that becomes runoff or infiltration in northern and or snow dominated basins snowmelt can be a large contributor to runoff therefore better estimates of snowmelt in the form of snow water equivalent can lead to better estimation of streamflow moradkhani 2008 these observations are available through several data products which can provide informative variables at near real time frequency can be used for data assimilation and are of interest to hydrologists possible data products include the european space agency s esa soil moisture and ocean salinity smos data rodríguez fernández et al 2017 the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa soil moisture active passive smap data and the national operational hydrologic remote sensing center s nohrsc snow data assimilation system snodas data to name a few entekhabi et al 2008 kerr et al 2010 national operations hydrologic remote sensing center 2004 the nohrsc has provided daily gridded estimates of snow parameters such as swe through the snodas program since 2004 national operations hydrologic remote sensing center 2004 this paper will explore the use of the smos l2 soil moisture and the snodas snow water equivalent data products for assimilation into conceptual rainfall runoff models to determine if they can be used to improve hydrologic modeling in an urban basin data assimilation will be used to help merge these datasets with the hydrologic models while also accounting for the uncertainty in both the models and the data products liu et al 2012 reichle 2008 the ensemble kalman filter enkf proposed by evensen 1994 was used for data assimilation in these analyses there are several examples in which the enkf has been used for hydrologic modeling and forecasting abaza et al 2014 alvarez garreton et al 2015 clark et al 2008 crow and ryu 2009 dumedah and coulibaly 2013 komma et al 2008 massari et al 2015 moradkhani et al 2005 neal et al 2007 samuel et al 2014 thiboult and anctil 2015 vrugt and robinson 2007 wanders et al 2014 weerts and el serafy 2006 moradkhani et al 2005 proposed dual state parameter updating using the enkf and samuel et al 2014 found that using both streamflow and soil moisture observations together to update state and model parameters provided more accurate forecasts snow data assimilation which includes assimilation of swe has also been examined in previous studies and has been shown to improve hydrologic simulations and forecasts bergeron et al 2016 dziubanski and franz 2016 huang et al 2017 liu et al 2012 moradkhani 2008 building on these previous findings this study will assess some combinations of streamflow swe soil moisture in a dual state parameter updating scheme with different hydrologic models to enhance streamflow forecast in urban watershed 2 study area and data the study area being focused on in this paper is the don river basin drb in toronto ontario canada fig 1 the drb is managed by the toronto region conservation authority trca it contains several sub catchments the largest of them being the upper east don german mills creek lower east don upper west don lower west don taylor massey creek and the lower don river the drb is approximately 350 km2 and is a mostly urban watershed being roughly 80 developed with the remaining area being split between crops and pasture forest and wetland natural resources canada 2009 this area has an average daily temperature of 9 4 c the average daily minimum and maximum temperatures are 5 9 c 12 9 c respectively and an average annual precipitation of 831 3 mm year based on the 1981 2010 canadian climate normals environment and climate change canada 2017 major soils in the drb include sandy loam loam clay loam and clay ontario ministry of agriculture 2015 and its elevation ranges from 75 to 330 m above mean sea level masl daily precipitation temperature and snow depth data sets were obtained from environment and climate change canada eccc weather stations and evapotranspiration was estimated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 three observation data sets were used for data assimilation they are daily streamflow data from environment canada s hydrometric database hydat daily swe from snodas national operations hydrologic remote sensing center 2004 and daily soil moisture sm from the esa s smos satellite kerr et al 2010 3 methodology 3 1 data processing 3 1 1 snodas snow water equivalent data one of this study s goals is to assess the assimilation of snow data as swe into models of an urban basin several snodas data products are available including swe and snow depth the snodas swe data product will be the source for the data being assimilated the snodas products are developed as follows first data from the rapid refresh numerical weather prediction model rapid update cycle numerical weather prediction model for dates before may 1 2012 are downscaled from 13 to 1 km2 next these data are used to drive the nohrsc snow model nsm at a resolution of 1 km2 finally available remote sensing radar and ground station snow observations are assimilated into the model using a newtonian nudging technique to produce a best estimate of near real time snow conditions carroll et al 2006 clow et al 2012 to determine the validity of using the snodas data the eccc snow on ground snow depth data available at gauges within and near the drb was used to validate and bias correct the snodas snow depth and swe data this was done since swe and snow depth are related and there are no swe measurements available from eccc a cumulative distribution function cdf matching bias correction method which uses polynomial fitting drusch et al 2005 kornelsen and coulibaly 2015 was used to correct the snodas snow depth such that it s cdf matched the eccc snow depth a consequence of this method is the ability to apply the polynomial to other data sets in order to implement a similar bias correction since no actual eccc swe data set is available in the study area the bias correction used to correct snodas snow depth was applied to the snodas swe data set to correct potential bias it may have this assumes that since snow depth and swe are related they would contain a similar relative bias when compared with the eccc observations for comparison only a pseudo swe data set was generated using a quick estimate from the eccc snow depth values to compare with the bias corrected snodas swe this quick estimate was based on environment canada 2013 and dubé 2003 where it is shown that using a 10 1 ratio although not exact for converting snow depth to swe can provide a good estimate to evaluate the correction method the bias the root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used they are defined as follows 1 bias y x 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 1 2 3 nse 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 where x i is the observed data eccc data at time i x is the mean of the observed data y i is the simulated data snodas data at time i y is the mean of the simulated data and n is the sample size the rmse was used to measure the fit between the observed and simulated data lower values being preferable the bias shows the consistent difference between the data and is better as the absolute bias approaches zero nse can be used to show how accurately the simulated and observed values match each other and ranges from to 1 with 1 being a perfect match 3 1 2 smos l2 soil moisture data the smos satellite was launched in november 2009 it has a revisit time for both its ascending 6 am and descending 6 pm passes every three days at the equator kerr et al 2012 2010 soil moisture data from the smos soil moisture level 2 user data products which also contains retrieved parameters such as optical thickness and surface temperature was used for this study kerr et al 2010 this data is retrieved using the smos satellite s l band microwave radiometer which operates in the 1 4 ghz band range kerr et al 2012 in the smos l2 data product soil moisture is retrieved on a 15 km discrete global grid dgg however the resolution of the instrument on the satellite is 43 km around each dgg center kerr et al 2012 2010 therefore there is overlap in the sensing area between dggs within the drb there are two smos dgg points dgg206279 and dgg206792 that have retrieved soil moisture data available every three days because of the inherent overlap and to minimize uncertainty the mean of the two drb dggs was calculated as the basin average soil moisture when two retrievals were available to use the soil moisture values at these points the data was first filtered based on their probability of radio frequency interference rfi as well as their data quality index values this filtering was done for both the ascending overpass which is retrieved in the mornings and descending overpass which is retrieved during the evenings soil moisture data retrievals with rfi probability and data quality index values greater than 0 1 were removed kornelsen et al 2016 assimilation of soil moisture 3only occurred during the non freezing months of may to october to avoid the impact of retrievals of frozen soils fig 2 illustrates the similarity of the smos soil moisture data from each dgg point within the drb using the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test the distribution of the ascending and descending retrievals at each dgg were compared and shown to be from the same distribution α 0 01 from this comparison it was determined that a combination of the data from each dgg could be used to obtain one ascending and one descending soil moisture data set for the drb which could both be used for assimilation the significance of the role of soil moisture in rainfall runoff modeling can often be under valued in urban areas due to the influence of impervious surfaces this presumption may also hold for the drb as a highly urbanized basin fig 1 to explore the validity of this assumption and justify the use of assimilation of smos soil moisture spectral unmixing was used to determine the pervious areas of the watershed 3 1 3 spectral unmixing spectral unmixing is a method that can determine the contents of an image pixel if that pixel contains more than one material nascimento and dias 2005 for this research it will be used to identify the pervious land cover in the drb as part of the justification for assimilating soil moisture data in a highly developed urban basin fig 1 using google s earth engine google earth engine team 2015 a mosaic of landsat 8 surface reflectance images over the drb was created to help filter out cloud cover and other atmospheric interferences the mosaic was then spectrally unmixed to find the relative proportion of pervious versus impervious regions each pixel is presumed to contain some mixed proportion of relevant land cover types pervious impervious and water by comparing the spectral characteristics of the mixed pixel to within scene pure pixels referred to as endmembers the relative proportion of each land cover type with a landsat pixel can be determined small 2002 2001 the vertex component analysis vca method was chosen to identify spectral endmembers since it is quick and performs as well as manually determining the endmembers nascimento and dias 2005 vca exploits the fact that the endmembers used to identify substances are the vertices of a simplex and it is based on the assumption that pure pixels exist in the data the vca algorithm iteratively finds a preset number of purest endmembers which correspond to the most abundant land covers in this case vca was used to determine three endmembers of the landsat 8 mosaic using bands 1 7 ultra blue blue green red near infrared shortwave infrared 1 shortwave infrared 2 which were then spectrally unmixed into a 3 band image that could be used to determine the land cover fraction of each pixel water vegetation urban 3 2 hydrologic models four lumped hydrologic models were used in this study to model the drb they are the gr4j modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier hymod hydrologic model mac hbv mcmaster university hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning and sac sma sacramento soil moisture accounting models these models were calibrated using the particle swarm optimization pso kennedy and spears 1998 which has been used to calibrate rainfall runoff models previously chau 2006 gill et al 2006 li et al 2009 to determine optimal parameter sets for the open loop simulations used for comparison with the data assimilation results each model was calibrated using data from 2001 01 01 to 2010 12 31 and validated against 2011 01 01 to 2013 12 31 values using the pso the optimal parameter sets were found by maximizing the nash volume error nve performance metric from samuel et al 2012 4 nve 0 5 nse 0 1 ve 0 25 nse log 0 25 nse sqr where nse is the nash sutcliffe efficiency ve is the volume error ve bias x nselog is the nse calculated using the log streamflow values for low flows and nsesqr is the nse found using the squared streamflow values for high flows the gr4j is an empirical hydrologic model that has four parameters and runs on a daily scale perrin et al 2003 in this study gr4j was modified to include the degree day snow routine described in samuel et al 2011 so that it would contain a swe state which could be updated during assimilation the modified model will henceforth be referred to as gr4j sr inputs for the gr4j sr model include precipitation evapotranspiration temperature and the parameter set optimized by the pso the model parameters and states are shown in table 1 the hydrologic model hymod developed by boyle 2001 is a simple conceptual rainfall runoff model as with the gr4j model the hymod model used for these analyses was modified to include the snow routine from samuel et al 2011 the modified model will be referred to as hymod sr inputs for the hymod sr model include precipitation evapotranspiration temperature and the parameter set optimized by the pso the model parameters and states are shown in table 2 the mac hbv model is a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model developed by samuel et al 2012 2011 based on the hbv model bergsröm 1976 for estimating streamflow in ungauged ontario basins the mac hbv incorporates a nonlinear response function a routing routine a degree day snow routine that is used to determine the swe from the forcing data a soil moisture routine used to show the change in soil moisture storage in the catchment and uses a nonlinear storage discharge relationship in the soil layers samuel et al 2012 2011 both the swe and soil moisture states from these routines will be updated using the chosen data assimilation method inputs into the mac hbv model include precipitation temperature and the calibrated parameter set from the pso the parameters and state variables used are summarized in table 3 the sac sma is a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model with several parameters and model states table 4 there are five storages within the model used to represent the water accumulation in the catchment burnash 1995 burnash et al 1973 koren et al 2004 the upper soil layer consists of both upper zone water storage contents while the lower soil layer consists of the three lower zone water storage contents the sum of the upper and lower soil layers was considered as the soil moisture for use in data assimilation samuel et al 2014 the degree day snow routine within the model is used to determine the swe from the forcing data samuel et al 2014 the sac sma model has been applied in several studies and is extensively used for operational streamflow forecasting samuel et al 2014 vrugt et al 2006b 2006a vrugt and robinson 2007 3 3 data assimilation using the ensemble kalman filter the enkf was used for both state and dual state parameter estimating moradkhani et al 2005 samuel et al 2014 for this study eight data assimilation schemes were used for each hydrologic model table 5 state updating was performed using streamflow soil moisture snow water equivalent and combined soil moisture snow water equivalent observations dual state parameter updating was also performed using streamflow observations to update the parameter values in each case samuel et al 2014 previously showed that using streamflow to update the parameter values and soil moisture to update state values allowed for more accurate estimates of streamflow and soil moisture since the combination allows for the model to better adjust over time the sm and swe values were used to update their related states and parameters while the streamflow observations were used to update all or remaining states and parameters this is illustrated in fig 3 the related states and parameters updated for each model using snodas swe based on notation from tables 1 4 are swe tr scf ddf and rcr the related states and parameters updated using smos sm based on notation from tables 1 4 are s and x1 gr4j sr s bexp and cmax hymod sr ssm fc and flp mac hbv and uztwc uzfwc lztwc lzfpc lzfsc uztwm uzfwm lztwm lzfpm and lzfsm sac sma for the assimilation schemes using snodas swe the updates to state values were performed for the months of november april if data was available when updating using smos soil moisture the ascending pass data was prioritized over the descending pass such that the descending retrieval was assimilated only if there was no soil moisture data available from the ascending retrieval since the models are run at a daily timestep the ascending overpass 6 am retrieval is assumed to provide a better representation of the antecedent soil moisture conditions of the day additionally the ascending has been shown to perform better than the descending pass jackson et al 2012 kornelsen et al 2016 since data assimilation is used to help remove random error in the model outputs the smos soil moisture data was bias corrected using cdf matching to each of the models soil moisture states ascending and descending separately cdf matching was chosen based on the results of kornelsen and coulibaly 2015 this adjustment was made so that the observations better fit the model to help avoid systematic errors since unbiased errors are an important assumption for data assimilation methods reichle 2008 the enkf developed by evensen 2003 1994 uses a monte carlo approach to estimate the posterior distributions of the model output by using an ensemble estimate of their priors due to uncertainty related to initial conditions especially when using data assimilation for both parameter and state estimating several simulations can be run to determine the performance of the data assimilation method the optimal ensemble size was determined for each model based on this fact see section 3 3 1 the enkf was formulated as follows moradkhani et al 2005 samuel et al 2014 5 u t i u t ζ t i where u t i is the perturbed forcing data at time t for ensemble member i ut is the unperturbed forcing data and ζ t i is the noise added to the forcing data to generate i ensemble members the precipitation was perturbed using lognormally distributed noise ζ t i logn 0 σ t u whereas the temperature and evaporation was perturbed using normally distributed noise ζ t i n 0 σ t u the variance of the noise σ t u is used to influence the ensemble spread to better account for uncertainty it is calculated by taking the square of the product of the forcing data u t and a proportionality factor γ this proportionality term is considered a hyper parameter which can be adjusted to improve results and ensure adequate ensemble spread moradkhani et al 2005 thiboult and anctil 2015 the state variables being updated in each model are in general calculated as follows 6 x t 1 i f x t i u t i θ where x t 1 i is the non updated vector of state variables in the model at time t 1 for ensemble member i f is the operator within the models that propagate the state variables x t i is the updated vector of state variables at time t for ensemble i and θ is the vector of parameters θ t i for dual state parameter updating for the dual state parameter updating assimilation scheme the parameter set θ t i at t 1 is generated from a uniform distribution for each ensemble member and each parameter based on the ranges in tables 1 4 the hydrologic model outputs are then calculated as follows 7 y t 1 i h x t 1 i θ ν t 1 i ν t 1 i n 0 σ t 1 m where y t 1 i is the simulated model output at time t 1 for ensemble member i h is the hydrologic model ν t 1 i is normally distributed noise at time t for ensemble member i and σ t 1 m is the variance of the noise found by taking the square of the product of the model output and its hyper parameter ω this noise is used to represent uncertainty related to the model structure to perform the update an ensemble of observations is generated at each time step by perturbing measured data as follows 8 y t 1 i y t 1 η t 1 i η t 1 i n 0 σ t 1 y where y t 1 i is the perturbed observation data used for updating the state or parameter vector for i ensemble members at time t 1 y t 1 is the observation at time t 1 η t 1 i is the normally distributed noise with variance σ t 1 y used for perturbing the observations into i ensemble members and the variance of the noise is found by taking the square of the product of the observation data with the hyper parameter ρ the kalman gain used in the enkf is calculated as follows 9 k t 1 σ t 1 xy σ t 1 yy σ t 1 y 1 where k t 1 is the kalman gain at time t 1 σ t 1 xy is the cross covariance of the state variable ensembles with the prediction ensemble streamflow soil moisture or snow water equivalent and σ t 1 yy is the error covariance of matrix of the streamflow or soil moisture or snow water equivalent prediction ensemble after calculating equations 5 9 the updated state or parameter vector is then found by 10 x t 1 i x t 1 i k t 1 y t 1 i y t 1 i where x t 1 i is the updated state or parameter vector for time t 1 and ensemble member i after the states or parameters are updated realism is checked to ensure values are not out of their allowed ranges this is repeated every time step until the simulation has been completed 3 3 1 determining hyper parameter values and optimal ensemble sizes the hyper parameters are used to control the ensemble spread caused by perturbation of forcing data γ observations ρ and simulated model results ω moradkhani et al 2005 thiboult and anctil 2015 the normalized rmse ratio nrr was used to help determine the optimal ensemble size and hyper parameter values such that they would not cause too much or too little spread murphy 1988 and has been used in previous studies alvarez garreton et al 2014 moradkhani et al 2005 thiboult and anctil 2015 the nrr is defined as follows 11 nrr 1 t t 1 t 1 n i 1 n y t i y t 2 1 n i 1 n 1 t t 1 t y t i y t 2 n 1 2 n where t is the length of the time series n is the number of ensemble members y t is the observation at time t and y t i is the simulated value at time t for ensemble i the ideal value for nrr is 1 while if nrr 1 or nrr 1 there is too much or too little spread respectively using the das5 assimilation scheme hyper parameter values for the forcing data streamflow observations and models were generated from the uniform distribution u 0 0 5 and tested against ensemble sizes ranging from 25 to 500 the combinations which provided the best nse value along with an nrr value closest to 1 were chosen for each model additionally the hyper parameter used to perturb the smos l2 soil moisture and the snodas swe were determined based on uncertainty analysis performed in previous studies al bitar et al 2012 clow et al 2012 kerr et al 2012 kornelsen and coulibaly 2015 zhang and yang 2016 finally a pairwise comparison of the ensemble means was used to confirm that at the chosen ensemble size based on nrr the mean nse was not significantly different from subsequent increases in ensemble size 3 4 evaluation of assimilation schemes to determine the performance of each data assimilation scheme and model combination for the don river basin the ensemble means of the hydrologic assimilation experiments were evaluated using the kling gupta efficiency kge performance metric gupta et al 2009 12 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between the simulated and observed runoff values α σ s σ o is the measure of relative variability in the simulated and observed values and β μ s μ o is the ratio between the simulated and observed values and is used to represent bias gupta et al 2009 the kge has a range from to 1 with 1 being the optimal value this metric uses the same components as the nse when these components are near their optimal values the kge will be near its optimal value which is not always the case for the nse gupta et al 2009 additionally the ensemble forecast performance of each assimilation scheme and model combination was also examined in this case the mean continues ranked probability score crps performance metric which assesses accuracy and resolution was used to evaluate the one to fourteen day ensemble forecast performances the cprs is formulated as matheson and winkler 1976 unger 1985 13 crps f x f y 1 y x 2 dy where f y is the cumulative distribution function of the forecast distribution ensemble forecasts y is the predicted variable simulated runoff x is used to verify the distribution observed runoff and 1 y x is the heaviside step function that provides a value of 1 if the predicted value is larger than the observed and 0 otherwise a perfect forecast is indicated with a cprs value of 0 there is no upper limit to the value using these performance metrics the potential improvements of each assimilation scheme will be easily quantified which will help identify the best performing assimilation scheme hydrologic model and combination of the two for performing hydrologic simulations and forecasts in an urban basin 4 results and discussions 4 1 data processing results 4 1 1 snodas the raw and bias corrected snodas data sets were compared with eccc data at various weather gauges as well as a thiessen polygon weighted basin average value for the period of 2011 01 01 to 2015 12 31 over this period the snodas data showed systematically higher values than the observations shown in tables 6 and 7 which is likely attributed to snodas not being ideally calibrated for small urban basins coupled with forcing data issues due to downscaling 13 km to 1 km grids this bias can be seen in the mean annual maximum values for snow depths being 435 mm and 299 mm and the average snow cover days being 110 days and 88 days for snodas and eccc data respectively the basin average estimate of swe is illustrated in fig 4 where there still exists a slight bias to the snodas swe product despite this the corrected snodas swe values can be used to provide a good estimate for the basin average swe 4 1 2 vca spectral unmixing the drb is recognized as a highly developed urban basin fig 1 in which the assimilation of soil moisture would often be dismissed to demonstrate the potential value of soil moisture assimilation in such a basin a better estimate of pervious land cover was produced by spectrally unmixing a landsat 8 surface reflectance image mosaic of the drb a temporal mosaic of images was used to better remove cloud cover and using data from the period 2013 06 01 to 2015 09 30 in the unmixed image it was assumed that vegetation cover was equivalent to pervious areas this is shown by vegetation fraction in fig 5 taking the averages of each pixel the urban vegetation and water coverages are shown to be 54 44 and 2 respectively based on these results there is a significant portion of the study area that can be considered pervious surface and it should be acceptable to use soil moisture assimilation in the drb 4 2 model calibration and validation the resulting performance metrics for both the calibration 2001 2010 and validation 2011 2013 periods are summarized in table 8 of note the performance during calibration varies between each model much more than during the validation period in which the gr4j sr performs noticeably better than the other three models during the validation however the gr4j sr hymod sr and sac sma have relatively similar performances with the sac sma being slightly better in both cases the mac hbv model does not perform as well these results are likely due to the differing model structures the gr4j sr and hymod sr are both simple and easily adaptable models therefore applying and using them in an urban basin is fairly easy the sac sma model can handle impervious areas due to the wide variety of parameters within the model making it adaptable for use in an urban basin as well however the mac hbv model does not have any parameters specifically for urban areas within the basin which may have led to its poorer performance these validation results will be used as an open loop comparison to the data assimilation schemes being tested to help illustrate the improvements the assimilation has on the hydrologic simulations 4 3 optimal hyper parameters and ensemble size for each hydrologic model the ensemble size test results are illustrated in fig 6 these results show that increasing the ensemble size increases the nse performance of the models ensemble mean and decreases the amount that the performance can vary this test showed that for the hymod sr the optimal ensemble size was 200 for the mac hbv and sacsma models the optimal ensemble size was 250 and the optimal ensemble size for gr4j sr was 325 additionally fig 6 shows that the mac hbv and sac sma model performances have higher variability than the other two models this is due to them having more parameters to update to ensure the best results from the assimilation schemes tuning of the hyper parameters was done to better quantify the uncertainty in the observations and models moradkhani et al 2005 thiboult and anctil 2015 summarized in table 9 are the hyper parameter values used for each model 4 4 hydrologic model performance using different data assimilation schemes the main focus of this study is to determine the effects of assimilating soil moisture snow water equivalent and streamflow under various data assimilation schemes can have on hydrologic simulation and forecasting in an urban basin to assess the effect assimilating these observations have on simulating the drb two performance metrics were examined the kge and the nse the nse being the traditional measure of hydrologic model performance and the kge which is relatively newer and uses the same components as nse to partition performance into contributing components gupta et al 2009 due to the metrics similarities the assimilation schemes being compared are considered acceptable if they perform better than the calibrated model for only one of the metrics from the results shown in fig 7 it is apparent that models perform the best under the assimilation schemes das1 4 based on the improvements seen compared to the open loop simulation when comparing the average relative improvements over the open loop simulation for both kge and nse das2 performed the best the gr4j sr model had the largest improvement over the ol seen from das6 which had an increase in nse from 0 6 to 0 69 with similar increase in performance seen from the other dual state parameter estimating schemes this agrees with the results of samuel et al 2014 which stated that the combination helped to account for variations through time in the model parameters hymod sr showed minor improvement in kge for das3 and das4 mac hbv showed minor kge improvement in das1 4 and sac sma showed minor improvements in kge for das2 8 these results indicate that the only model of the four tested to significantly benefit from data assimilation when simulating the runoff of an urban basin is gr4j sr additionally these results suggest that the improvement from state updates is smoothed out the longer the simulation which can be seen in the forecast results finally the results show that data assimilation which updates both states and parameters has the potential to reduce the performance of a model mac hbv das5 8 although this may be due to mac hbv lacking a parameter which explicitly considers urban areas illustrated in fig 8 are the 2013 01 01 to 2013 12 31 simulated ensemble means for each hydrologic model and the four best performing data assimilation schemes here it is apparent that the ensemble means do not always capture the peak flows despite the model s performances however when looking at the ensemble simulation results from das2 for example fig 9 the extreme ensemble values can capture the majority of those peak flows also apparent in fig 9 is that mac hbv has some issues capturing low flows within the drb which is likely due to it being initially developed to simulate natural catchments and its inability to account for impervious areas 4 5 performance of ensemble forecasts ensemble forecasts were made using perfect weather forecasts meteorological observations and the updated states and parameter values for each model and assimilation scheme the perfect forecast was chosen to help reduce uncertainty in the forcing data these forecasts were made for lead times of up to 14 days over the 2011 01 01 to 2013 12 31 period to evaluate the performance of these ensemble forecasts the crps was used the results for each model and assimilation scheme are shown in fig 10 for the hymod sr mac hbv and sac sma models the best performances for each assimilation scheme are generally shown for the 1 day ahead forecast the gr4j sr however performed its best for the 2 day ahead forecast which is likely due to the model s structure more specifically how it utilizes unit hydrographs for routing as the forecast lead times increase the mean crps values begin to degrade and converge towards the ol values for each model and assimilation scheme with the exception of das8 for sac sma which shows consistent performance over the forecast horizon the performance of the state updating assimilation schemes show as good or better performance for each model over all forecast horizons which agrees with the literature in that more accurate states produce better forecast results moradkhani 2008 reichle 2008 however the performance of the dual state parameter assimilation schemes varies depending on the model which is most apparent with the hymod sr and mac hbv forecast results where for short term forecasts updates to states and parameters das5 8 provide the hymod sr model with better ensemble forecasting skill which degraded slower when compared to only state updating das1 4 while for mac hbv das5 8 provides much worse performance which is also seen in fig 10 these differences could be attributed to structural differences in the models such as the simple fast and slow storages in hymod and gr4j which can easily adapt to urban basins as well as sac smas explicit consideration of urban areas while mac hbv lacks the ability to account for the quicker runoff from more than half the basin among the four models the top performing assimilation schemes for ensemble forecasting were das2 das3 and das4 when compared to the ol which suggests that assimilating the smos l2 sm and or the snodas swe data can improve the short term forecasts for an urban model additionally the best overall performance was seen from the sac sma model under das8 however the gr4j sr hymod sr and sac sma models had similar forecasting performances on average the das2 assimilation scheme showed the most improvement in ensemble forecast performance over all forecast horizons compared to the ol this is likely caused by the size and climate of the basin the watershed response is quick and the snow cover time is short allowing for antecedent soil moisture estimation to be the most meaningful variable of the three for runoff prediction when comparing the forecast performance from each assimilation scheme and model by ranking them from lowest to highest crps the best to worst performing for ensemble forecasting are das8 das2 das3 das7 das4 das6 das5 and das1 this shows that the forecasts benefit from the additional information provided from soil moisture and swe ultimately these results show that assimilation of the smos l2 soil moisture and the snodas swe data products can improve hydrologic modeling and forecasting in the don river basin this indicates that assimilating soil moisture and snow water equivalent could potentially improve hydrologic models of urban basins additionally when moving forward into semi distributed or distributed models these gridded data products would likely be more useful as there will be less chance of losing information due to aggregation of data when computing the basin average 5 conclusions this study examined the performance of four lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model s ability to simulate the streamflow in the urban don river basin under various data assimilation schemes as with previous studies assimilation of streamflow can improve the urban models performance e g branisavljevic et al 2014 hutton et al 2014 and others additionally this study showed that further improvements to model performance could be made through assimilating soil moisture and or swe although some models benefitted more than others the results showed that the simpler gr4j sr model had the most improved hydrologic simulations based on nse from data assimilation under the dual state and parameter updating assimilation schemes with the best performing being that of das6 for flow forecasting sac sma performed the best followed by hymod sr however the gr4j sr model was comparable for 2 days forecasts or longer das2 4 performed the best for the 1 day forecast while the das2 das3 and das8 provided the best overall performance when comparing all assimilation schemes for every forecast horizon in general the results show that assimilating the snodas swe and smos l2 sm data products can provide some improvement to different aspects of hydrologic simulation and forecasting which is apparent through the use of multiple performance metrics even in urban basins such as the drb however further improvements could likely be made to the results by using a different snow models such as snow17 which has been used in previous studies when assimilating swe data dechant and moradkhani 2011 dziubanski and franz 2016 huang et al 2017 or a more comprehensive analysis for error quantification since the enkf is known to perform better when the uncertainties associated with the model and observations are better quantified huang et al 2017 moradkhani et al 2005 additionally potential improvements could be made through identifying and addressing problematic variables which could arise from updating with different types of observational data finally the analysis performed here were for one basin on the daily time scale with lumped models further analyses are needed to determine if these results are valid at finer spatial and temporal scales as well

7126,soil moisture is an important parameter associated with the land atmosphere interface and is highly influenced by multiple factors previous studies have provided an effective mechanism for accurately estimating soil moisture by building a global estimation model that comprehensively integrates multiple factors at a local scale however a global model is inefficient for accurately estimating soil moisture at a large or even global scale because of the complex surface features that make it difficult to fit data globally furthermore inconsistencies in the spatial integrity between multisource data and the mismatch between the training space and application space decrease the generalizability of the model which may lead to unreasonable soil moisture values in certain areas this study proposes a pyramid framework that integrates multiple factors from different sources using the classification and regression tree cart algorithm a machine learning method to estimate soil moisture at a high spatial resolution 1 km the framework considers soil moisture as a response variable and several factors such as precipitation soil properties and temperature as explanatory variables the framework uses piecewise fitting instead of global fitting and avoids the generation of unreasonable values a k fold cross validation approach using hold out years was used to assess the performance of the soil moisture estimation framework for the summer period the results show that the performance of the framework was relatively stable during the study period with low variabilities in the r values 1 std 0 06 and error measures 1 std 0 05 the results predicted based on the framework are more accurate than the temperature vegetation drought index tvdi results the correlation coefficients between the tvdi and soil moisture observations in june july and august were 0 49 0 29 and 0 49 respectively whereas those between the predictions and observations were 0 70 0 68 and 0 69 respectively which reflected increases of 0 21 0 39 and 0 20 respectively the spatiotemporal analysis of summer soil moisture from 2000 to 2014 exhibited a significant wetting trend the spatial patterns were characterized by wetting trends over arid and humid regions and drying trends over semi arid regions the results indicate that the pyramid framework can provide a soil moisture dataset with reasonable accuracy and high spatial resolution keywords soil moisture cart remote sensing soil moisture variation 1 introduction as a key parameter of the climate system soil moisture controls the water and energy cycle between the land and the atmosphere acting as a regulator of the water and energy balance entin et al 2000 zuo and zhang 2008 li et al 2011 soil moisture and climate change interact with each other changes in temperature precipitation and other climatic factors directly result in soil moisture variations which can change the heat distribution between the surface latent heat flux and sensible heat flux thereby affecting the regional climate ma et al 2000 zhang et al 2016a 2016b therefore it is important to obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture and analyse its spatiotemporal variation in the regional climate system to monitor and forecast droughts and disasters and adjust agricultural production among other purposes numerical simulations have long been one of the main approaches used to obtain large scale soil moisture data using basic meteorological data and land surface models li et al 2011 land surface models particularly the community land model clm have been widely used in china chen et al 2010 du et al 2008 wang and zeng 2011 li et al 2011 because the accuracy of soil moisture simulations depends critically on the quality of meteorological data and the description of the land surface the numerical simulation of soil moisture contains many uncertainties guo et al 2007 shi et al 2011 lu and shi 2012 the development of remote sensing technology provides an effective way to obtain large scale soil moisture data the algorithms can be divided into two categories depending on the wavelength bands used to measure soil moisture measurements based on visible thermal infrared sensing and measurements based on microwave sensing the former measures soil moisture indirectly using statistical models kogan 1995 sandholt et al 2002 wang et al 2007 or hydrological models zhang and wegehenkel 2006 kunnath poovakka et al 2016 hornero et al 2016 which utilize land surface features retrieved by visible thermal infrared bands e g vegetation land surface temperature surface albedo as model parameters the soil moisture data measured using these algorithms often has a relatively high spatial resolution and accuracy depending on the land surface features e g land surface temperature determined based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data with a resolution of 1 km and an accuracy of approximately 1 2 km the main issue associated with this method is the inability of visible thermal infrared radiation to penetrate clouds which greatly affects the quality of the measured data because the microwave scattering coefficient is directly linked to the soil dielectric constant which is greatly affected by the soil water content and because microwaves have the ability to penetrate clouds rain and other atmospheric conditions microwave remote sensing and particularly passive microwave remote sensing has been widely used for global soil moisture measurement at all times and under all weather conditions mao et al 2008 shen et al 2015 however microwave remote sensing also has several limitations first the accuracy of the algorithms are seriously affected by the soil surface roughness vegetation and other factors shi et al 2011 kim et al 2015 second the time series of the data is short and is unfavourable for long term analyses of variations e g the duration of the widely used amsr e data is only 10 years and the duration of smap data is considerably shorter third the spatial resolution of the data is relatively low 10 40 km finally many agricultural and hydrological researchers are interested in root zone soil moisture and passive microwave can detect only surface soil moisture conditions the detection depth is 0 5 cm on bare land and can be even less on grassland shrub land farmland or woodland piles et al 2011 zhang et al 2016a 2016b these shortcomings greatly limit the application of microwave remote sensing products the spatial scale of soil moisture variability can be divided into two categories the local scale which is impacted by soil properties and the regional scale which is impacted by meteorological systems vinnikov and robock 1996 entin et al 2000 seneviratne et al 2010 cho and choi 2014 these studies indicate that multiple factors have a complex effect on soil moisture variations including precipitation evapotranspiration ground temperature radiation soil texture st and soil heterogeneity in addition the growth of vegetation also has an effect on soil moisture particularly in arid and semi arid areas magagi and kerr 2001 an effective method of building a soil moisture estimation model should integrate regional meteorological data remotely sensed surface information and information on elevation and soil properties to estimate soil moisture with high accuracy and spatial resolution however a global model is unable to estimate soil moisture accurately at a large scale or even a global scale the data have more complex surface features on a large scale making it difficult to achieve a global fit furthermore the generalizability of the model is decreased which leads to unreasonable soil moisture values in certain areas the classification and regression tree cart algorithm provides unique advantages for developing a soil moisture estimation model compared to traditional statistical regression techniques in a large area with complex surface features the cart algorithm can divide the data into multiple areas with lower complexity and then use piecewise fitting instead of global fitting the low generalizability of a model is mainly caused by two issues which were not identified in previous studies the first issue is the inconsistency of the spatial integrity of data from multiple sources i e we cannot ensure that all data are valid at each location for instance on an average day 60 of the land surface is covered by clouds thus few thermal infrared tir land surface temperature lst measurements are available in southern china in the summer duan et al 2017 the other issue is the mismatch between the training space defined by training samples and the application space which is mainly caused by the uneven spatial distribution of the sampling stations therefore a framework is needed not only to estimate soil moisture accurately but also to address the above problems thus there are three main objectives in this study a to design a soil moisture estimation framework based on data from multiple sources including precipitation lst evapotranspiration vegetation condition elevation slope st and soil water capacity the framework should provide for machine learning and then generate a soil moisture product with a spatial resolution of 1 km b to assess the quality of the soil moisture products via a comparison with the temperature vegetation drought index tvdi and in situ measurements and c to analyse the spatiotemporal variability of the summer soil moisture from 2000 to 2014 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area china s landmass was selected as the study area for this study china is located in the eastern part of asia and lies on the west coast of the pacific ocean 3 31 00 n 53 33 00

basins and plains the qinghai tibet plateau is the highest plateau in the world the climatic conditions in the study area include three monsoon climates temperate monsoon subtropical monsoon and tropical monsoon and two non monsoon climates temperate continental and plateau mountainous the different types of climate have a spatial distribution with the lowest amount of precipitation in the northwest and the highest amount of precipitation in southeast the main food crops are wheat rice corn and potatoes 2 2 remote sensing data data products from modis were selected for this research because of their long durations modis has been widely used for land ocean and atmospheric research the 8 day composite lst product mod11a2 monthly normalized difference vegetation index ndvi product mod13a3 and monthly evapotranspiration et product mod16a2 from 2000 to 2014 with a spatial resolution of 1 km were used these products are made available to the public by the u s land processes distributed active archive center lpdaac usgs gov 2 3 meteorological data the daily precipitation data observed by meteorological stations from 2000 to 2014 was provided by the china meteorological data sharing service system data cma cn after performing data quality control data sets from 703 meteorological stations were found to be of sufficient quality we also collected in situ soil moisture measurements observed at agrometeorological stations from the china meteorological data sharing service system the majority of these data sets began in the 1980s and were collected every 10 days typically on the 8th 18th and 28th days of each month until the sampled soil areas froze during the winter the original data were measured by the gravimetrically but were released in the form of relative soil moisture in this study we selected soil moisture data from 2001 to 2013 to ensure data integrity and quality the observational depth spanned from 0 to 1 m 10 cm was chosen as the study depth here 2 4 auxiliary data the auxiliary data used in our research included st digital elevation model dem soil available water capacity awc and soil field capacity fc data st data determines the agricultural soil classes based on the proportions of various mineral particles in the soil using a qualitative classification it is a key factor used to approximate the response of the soil to environmental and management conditions dem data were used because the distribution of precipitation gross vegetation and other features are directly related to elevation the st and dem data were both provided by the cold and arid regions sciences data centre in lanzhou westdc westgis ac cn and have a spatial resolution of 1 km the sts were classified into twelve types using the usda soil texture classification system only the top layer 0 30 cm was processed awc is the range of available water that can be stored in soil and be available for growing crops fc is the amount of soil moisture or water content held in the soil after excess water has drained away and the rate of downward movement has decreased these two properties were obtained from the global gridded surfaces of selected soil characteristics igbp dis database with a spatial resolution of 10 km 3 methods 3 1 data preprocessing once the modis products were obtained they were mosaicked and reprojected to the wgs84 datum and geographic projections with the modis projection tool mrt using nearest neighbour resampling to maintain the same temporal resolution as that of the ndvi and et product the lst product was transformed into a monthly product using the average value of the four antecedent days of the year doys for example a composite of the products doy153 doy161 doy169 and doy177 was generated as the product of june soil moisture observations were transformed from having a temporal resolution of 10 days to monthly using the average value of the measurements for the month the soil moisture observations recorded by the agrometeorological stations are the soil relative moisture unit we translated these observations into soil volumetric moisture unit m3 m3 as follows 1 θ v θ θ f h where θ v θ θ f and h are the soil volumetric moisture soil relative moisture fc and soil depth respectively in eq 1 the fc is defined by the water depth unit mm in the igbp dis database the default setting is 1 m the daily precipitation data were converted to monthly cumulative precipitation cp an inverse distance weighted idw method was used to interpolate the monthly cp data into a 1 km raster format to unify the spatial resolution the awc was also resampled from a 10 km resolution to a 1 km resolution using the method of nearest resampling in addition we acquired the topography data surface slope from the dem using the surface tool in arcgis 10 02 finally all of the raster data were reprojected to albers projections 3 2 pyramid framework for soil moisture estimation in this study we estimated the soil moisture as a function with meteorological precipitation lst evapotranspiration and biophysical elevation topography vegetation condition st type soil available water content characteristics as follows 2 sm i t f x i t ε where x is a vector of predictor variables ε is the estimation error produced by f applied to x the subscript i denotes the location of the pixel in space indexed by pixel and t refers to its location in time indexed by year and month cart is a method of machine learning that was proposed by breiman et al 1984 suppose that x 1 x 2 x n are the input variables and that y is the output variable for a training dataset in the space d with n input variables and m input samples let d x 11 x 12 x 1 n y 1 x 21 x 22 x 2 n y 2 x m 1 x m 2 x mn y m cart splits d into a certain number of subspaces using a binary recursive process each recursive process attempts to select several splitting variables and splitting points from the current space s parent node to divide the space into two inhomogeneous subspaces s 1 and s 2 child nodes every subspace has an estimated value y determined by fitting using the least squares method the optimal splitting variable j and splitting point s are finally selected to ensure that the binary division has the minimum residual variance as follows 3 var j s min s min s 1 j s x i s 1 j s y i y 1 2 min s 2 j s x i s 2 j s y i y 2 2 each child node is treated as a potential parent node in the next division process until the homogeneous divisions or terminal nodes are obtained the cart algorithm allows for a wide range of possible input data types statistical assumptions regarding the data distribution are not required thus non normally distributed data can readily be utilized in the analysis without the difficulties typically created by such data herold et al 2003 the commercial software tool cubist which has adopted the cart algorithm was used to generate a rule based regression tree model cubist was developed by rulequest company http www rulequest com and has been used in numerous studies including vegetation cover mapping drought monitoring and urban land cover estimation sexton et al 2013 walton 2008 brown et al 2013 wu et al 2015 the software produces a rule based set based on training data with each rule having the syntax if conditions then linear formula to calculate the soil moisture value the following is an example of one of the many rules generated for a specific period if lst 302 2865 and awc 17 38371 and slope 0 06013519 and dem 34 91837 and st is in 9 10 11 12 then soil moisture 64 391042 71 96 slope 0 00263 dem 0 0242 cp 0 0042 et 0 3 awc 0 14 lst 0 7 ndvi in the tree model application for the independent input variables in raster format if the value of an independent variable meets the threshold identified by one rule then the corresponding linear regression rule is used to calculate the soil moisture value at the pixel level there are two prerequisites first the spatial integrity of model parameters must be consistent in general more factors will yield higher estimation accuracies however as discussed in section 1 it is difficult to ensure that all data are valid in certain areas for example when the et data are opened there may be a large number of pixels with invalid data in northwest china errors will inevitably be generated when the applied model uses et as a parameter in such areas another prerequisite is that the size of the training space defined by the training samples and the size of the application space must match however the stations are mainly concentrated in eastern china at low elevations as shown in fig 1 this uneven spatial distribution of the stations causes the training space and application space to be mismatched and invalidates the rules generated from the training data for example we compared the extent of the training space and application space defined by eight independent variables and the corresponding data in june 2000 respectively as shown in table 1 not all the variable ranges in the application space match those of the training space for example the range of dem values in the application space varied from 0 to 8654 whereas they varied from 0 to 4300 in the training space which means that a rule that uses elevation as a parameter is not applicable to an area with an elevation greater than 4300 such as the qinghai tibet plateau therefore it is not possible to use only one estimation model to obtain the soil moisture distribution over all of china despite using only the matched variables in table 1 as model parameters instead specific models should be generated for different regions thus we designed a pyramid framework that includes multiple models with different parameters to account for these two issues in this framework the higher level model theoretically has a higher precision but a smaller applicable area whereas the lower level model is the opposite the specific process of building the framework is shown as fig 2 after determining the variable range matching result from table 1 we can divide the variables into two parts matched variables and mismatched variables the matched variables can then be selected to construct the basic soil moisture estimation model which is at the bottom of the pyramid framework and can be applied to the entire area then based on the basic model other mismatched variables can be gradually introduced to construct multiple models finally the multiple models can be sorted based on their precision to determine the model level in the framework and the model priority in the application in this study six candidate training schemes were prepared to be input into cubist as shown in table 2 a window was applied to extract the value at each site location from the raster or grid data the ndvi lst et and cp were extracted for the same time period as the soil moisture records the dem slope awc and st are intrinsic properties of earth we assumed that these variables did not change considerably in the study area during the research period of 2000 2014 therefore these variables were considered to be constants for all continuous variables e g ndvi lst et cp dem slope awc fc the average value within the window was calculated to represent the site location value for st which is a categorical variable the average method was replaced by the majority wu et al 2015 also used the cart algorithm to monitor agricultural droughts in china the study considered that the window size may affect the accuracy wu compared different window sizes and concluded that a 9 9 km window size was the most suitable we followed the same approach in this study and compared several window sizes including 3 3 km 5 5 km 7 7 km and 9 9 km to determine the most reasonable size we selected the optimal model from each scheme to build the pyramid framework based on three criteria the minimum average error minimum relative error and maximum correlation coefficient these three evaluation criteria are defined by cubist the average error is the average of the biases between the observations and predictions the relative error is the ratio of the average error to the error that would result from always predicting the mean value for useful models this should be less than 1 the correlation coefficient measures the agreement between the cases actual values of the target variables and those values predicted by the model of the six models which are labelled with model tags model 5 3 was the most suitable to be the top of the pyramid because it had the lowest average error of 4 15 the lowest relative error of 0 64 and the highest correlation coefficient of 0 74 model 1 3 was the most suitable to be at the bottom the order of the models from top to bottom was model 5 3 model 4 4 model 3 4 model 2 4 and model 1 3 model 6 4 was not employed because its precision was lower than that of model 5 3 even though it contained all of the factors in the practical application of the framework we first set the spatial unintegrity part and mismatched part of the multiple grid data as invalid then for each pixel location we check whether the variables are valid based on its values choosing the optimal estimation model from the pyramid framework based on the same input variables thus if all the pixels in the study area were assigned a reasonable soil moisture value the monthly soil moisture levels in the summer from 2000 to 2014 were produced with a resolution of 1 km 3 3 validation strategies it is very important to make validation for the method and the observation data is used to make validation in order to keep more convincing tvdi is used as indirect methods for further comparison analysis by using tvdi the in situ observation data from 2001 to 2013 and the tvdi used to monitor the results in the summer of 2013 were adopted as evaluation standards to evaluate the feasibility of the framework and the reliability of the predictions a k fold cross validation by year approach using hold out years was used to assess the performance of the soil moisture estimation framework for the summer period for each month 13 validation iterations or folds were performed by using 12 years of historical data to train a model e g 2001 2012 and one independent hold out year e g 2013 to determine the estimation accuracy of the framework across all of the stations a different hold out year was selected for each iteration which allowed every year in the 13 year record to be withheld for testing in each iteration the correlation coefficient r and the average and relative errors of the estimation framework were calculated and the mean 1 standard deviation coefficient and error values across the 13 years were reported for the summer period a number of studies have found that the ts ndvi feature space a universal triangle or trapezoidal shape can provide information on soil moisture conditions at the surface researchers have proposed many indices based on the ts ndvi feature space one of these indices is the tvdi which is widely used in soil moisture or drought monitoring sandholt et al 2002 due to the large range in elevations in china a calibrated method was used to revise the surface temperatures before the tvdi calculations according to ran et al 2005 as follows 4 t d t s h a where t d is the calibrated lst t s is the lst before the calibration h is the elevation and a is a parameter that reflects the extent of the influence of elevation on the soil moisture retrieval process which is 0 006 for china in addition the tvdi and soil moisture are negatively correlated we made several changes to the calculation to facilitate the analysis and comparisons the final formula for the tvdi is as follows 5 tvdi 1 t d t d min t d max t d min where t d is the calibrated lst t d min is the minimum lst of a pixel in the feature space and t d max is maximum lst low tvdi values indicate dry conditions whereas high values correspond to wet conditions 3 4 spatiotemporal variability method the least squares method was used to fit the linear tendency of soil moisture during each summer to determine the annual variability of soil moisture the formula is as follows 6 slope n i 1 n i sm i i n i i n sm i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where slope represents the linear tendency and sm i is the value of soil moisture during year i i 1 2 3 n the soil moisture has an increasing trend when slope 0 and a decreasing trend otherwise before slope was calculated a durbin watson test method was used to test the autocorrelation of the data the linear model is only effective if the serial data are not autocorrelated the test formula is as follows 7 d t 2 n e t e t 1 2 t 1 n e t 2 where d is the statistic and et is the residual of the linear model the durbin watson test has two limit values the upper du and the lower dl if 0 d dl or 4 dl d 4 the serial data have a positive or negative autocorrelation respectively if du d 4 du there is no autocorrelation 4 results and analysis 4 1 accuracy assessment table 3 shows the 13 fold cross validation results including the mean of the average error the relative error and the correlation coefficient 1 standard deviation the correlation coefficient values revealed that all models had a relatively high accuracy r 0 60 the r values for the individual hold out years ranged from 0 48 june 2007 to 0 73 july 2008 the average and relative errors of the models were also relatively low for the summer period ranging from 3 90 to 5 31 and from 0 62 to 0 84 respectively the performance of the framework was relatively stable across the 13 year study period with low variabilities in the r values 1 std 0 06 and error measures 1 std 0 05 however subtle monthly differences were found between the models with consistently higher r values and lower average and relative errors during june and august and lower r values and higher average and relative errors in july 4 2 comparison to the tvdi results we also used the soil moisture conditions as monitored by remote sensing to evaluate the reliability of the predicted spatial distribution of the soil moisture the tvdi was used as a reference to ensure a constant prediction depth the predicted soil moisture and tvdi in the summer of 2013 were calculated as shown in fig 3 where fig 3a b and c show the predicted results for june july and august respectively and fig 3d e and f show the corresponding tvdi results the in situ observations during the summer of 2013 were used to qualitatively compare the predictions and tvdi results as shown in fig 3g i fig 3a f show that the two results were generally consistent in northeastern and northern china the soil moisture was low in the plains areas and relatively high in mountainous areas in the northwest both measures tended to gradually become drier from east to west in inner mongolia the alxa desert in the west of inner mongolia and the taklimakan desert in the south of xinjiang were the driest areas of china li et al 2011 lu and shi 2012 sun et al 2005 the tvdi did not reflect this feature well as the soil moisture around the taklimakan desert was relatively wet this feature was more accurately described by the predictions than by the tvdi the predictions and tvdi consistently reflected the soil moisture in the western part of the qinghai tibet plateau but yielded different results for the southeastern part of the plateau the tvdi indicated that the southeast part was dry which was not true in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river a large scale extreme drought occurred during july and early august the predictions and tvdi both reflected the drought but the predictions better reflected its characteristics in guizhou and hunan which were the areas most affected by the drought overall the spatial patterns of the soil moisture reflected by the predictions and tvdi were consistent and the predictions were more accurate in certain areas e g the hetao plain horqin sandy region qinghai lake and the oasis surrounding the taklimakan desert as shown in fig 3g i the correlations between the tvdi and measured data are low in june july and august with coefficients of 0 49 0 29 and 0 49 respectively whereas the correlation coefficients between the predictions and the measured data were 0 70 0 68 and 0 69 respectively this indicates that the predictions can better reflect the differences in soil moisture between different locations 4 3 spatial patterns of the summer soil moisture fig 4 shows the spatial patterns of the average summer soil moisture within the top 10 cm of the soil in china the soil moisture increases gradually from northwest to southeast and exhibits a spatial distribution pattern of northwest dry northeast and southeast wet as a whole the areas with low soil moisture values i e below 10 m3 m3 are mainly distributed in the gobi desert between the tarim basin and alashan plateau these areas have a temperate continental climate with little precipitation strong daylight and poor surface water capacity due to the low vegetation coverage the areas with high soil moisture values i e more than 30 m3 m3 are mainly distributed in the northeast china plain the huang huai hai plain and south of the yangtze river the climate of these areas is mainly a monsoon climate with high temperatures and a rainy summer high vegetation coverage and well developed river systems soil moisture also exhibits different spatial distributions in the different summer months there were no notable changes in july and august aside from several areas in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river significant changes in soil moisture spatial distribution between june and august are concentrated in the eastern part of china in the northeast china plain and huang huai hai plain the soil moisture is higher in june than in july and august whereas in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the soil moisture is relatively low exhibiting a wet to dry pattern in the south and a dry to wet pattern in the north this trend is mainly caused by the characteristics of the summer rainy season which advances from south to north due to the monsoon climate affect the majority of southern china enters the main rainy season in early june later the rainy season moves to the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and brings this area into the plum rainy season or east asian rainy season northern and northeastern china enter the main rainy season in early to middle july whereas southern china and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river leave the rainy season in northern china and northeastern china the rainy season ends in late august 4 4 spatiotemporal variation of summer soil moisture in china table 4 shows the inter annual variations of the summer soil moisture at a depth of 10 cm in china from 2000 to 2014 the durbin watson test results reveal that there was no autocorrelation of the time series data the interannual variations of the soil moisture in the summer from 2000 to 2014 increased at a rate of 0 03 a with a significance level of 0 1 in june and july the soil moisture increased at rates of 0 04 a and 0 06 a respectively both with a significance level of 0 01 the soil moisture decreased in august at a rate of 0 01 a but the trend was not significant to determine the interannual variability of soil moisture at a depth of 10 cm in china the trend in the soil moisture during the summers from 2000 to 2014 was calculated at the pixel level fig 5 a red represents the areas where soil moisture is decreasing whereas blue represents wetter areas in general the patterns were both characterized by an alternating drying and wetting trend from the northwest to the southeast arid regions including northern and western inner mongolia and the majority of xinjiang presented a drying trend in semi arid regions except for midwest tibet and the yili region of xinjiang the soil moisture increased and exhibited wetting trends in the semi humid and humid regions certain areas including the hulunbuir pasture land and the northeast china plain the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and the border areas of guangdong and guangxi exhibited wetting trends other areas particularly the huang huai area and the yunnan guizhou plateau exhibited considerable drying approximately 36 17 of the areas exhibited drying trends whereas 57 37 exhibited wetting trends approximately 26 1 of the areas exhibited significant changes with a significance level of 0 1 as shown in fig 5 b the majority of the significantly changing areas exhibited wetting trends 14 87 which were mainly distributed in the hulunbuir pasture land nenjiang river basin loess plateau and lüliang mountains area at the junction of shaanxi and shanxi the main parts of qinghai south of gansu north of hebei and south of anhui significantly drying areas represented 11 23 of the total area and were mainly distributed in the huang huai area tarim basin of xinjiang central tibet central yunnan southwest of hunan and north of guangdong 5 conclusions and discussion this research comprehensively estimated soil moisture from regional precipitation data the remotely sensed surface thermal and ecological environment and information on elevation and soil properties a pyramid framework with multiple estimation models based on the cart algorithm was developed to address the problems caused by the large scale of the estimate namely global fitting when building the model and the low generalizability when applying the model then the framework was used to produce summer soil moisture products at a depth of 10 cm with a spatial resolution of 1 km from 2000 to 2014 a k fold cross validation approach was used to assess the performance of the soil moisture estimation framework across the summer period the results reveal that the performance of the framework was relatively stable during the study period with low variabilities in the r values 1 std 0 06 and error measures 1 std 0 05 the predictions reflect the spatial variations more accurately than the tvdi results the correlation coefficients between the tvdi and observations in june july and august were 0 49 0 29 and 0 49 respectively whereas the corresponding coefficients between the predictions and observations were 0 70 0 68 and 0 69 respectively corresponding to increases of 0 21 0 39 and 0 21 respectively the results indicate that the pyramid framework can provide a soil moisture dataset with reasonable accuracy and high spatial resolution the spatial pattern of soil moisture is characterized by an increasing gradient from northwest to southeast the major areas of low soil moisture were located in the gobi desert between the tarim basin and the alashan plateau whereas the high soil moisture values were mainly distributed in the northeast china plain the huang huai hai plain and south of the yangtze river different months in summer also exhibit different spatial patterns particularly in the eastern part of china between june and august these different patterns are mainly caused by the characteristics of the summer rainy season which advances from south to north due to the effect of the monsoon climate the spatiotemporal analysis of the predictions from 2000 to 2014 revealed that the summer soil moisture exhibited a significant overall wetting trend the spatial patterns were characterized by wetting trends over arid and humid regions and drying trends over semi arid regions the area of the significantly wetter regions was larger than that of the drier regions regions with significantly wetter trends were mainly distributed in the hulunbuir pasture land loess plateau and the main parts of qinghai whereas regions with significantly drier trends were mainly distributed in the huang huai area and central tibet the direct causes of these trends require further study however the spatiotemporal variations in soil moisture indicate changes in the regional climate water resources and environment which would have a profound impact on the agricultural regions acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the relative data centre for providing the research data and

7126,soil moisture is an important parameter associated with the land atmosphere interface and is highly influenced by multiple factors previous studies have provided an effective mechanism for accurately estimating soil moisture by building a global estimation model that comprehensively integrates multiple factors at a local scale however a global model is inefficient for accurately estimating soil moisture at a large or even global scale because of the complex surface features that make it difficult to fit data globally furthermore inconsistencies in the spatial integrity between multisource data and the mismatch between the training space and application space decrease the generalizability of the model which may lead to unreasonable soil moisture values in certain areas this study proposes a pyramid framework that integrates multiple factors from different sources using the classification and regression tree cart algorithm a machine learning method to estimate soil moisture at a high spatial resolution 1 km the framework considers soil moisture as a response variable and several factors such as precipitation soil properties and temperature as explanatory variables the framework uses piecewise fitting instead of global fitting and avoids the generation of unreasonable values a k fold cross validation approach using hold out years was used to assess the performance of the soil moisture estimation framework for the summer period the results show that the performance of the framework was relatively stable during the study period with low variabilities in the r values 1 std 0 06 and error measures 1 std 0 05 the results predicted based on the framework are more accurate than the temperature vegetation drought index tvdi results the correlation coefficients between the tvdi and soil moisture observations in june july and august were 0 49 0 29 and 0 49 respectively whereas those between the predictions and observations were 0 70 0 68 and 0 69 respectively which reflected increases of 0 21 0 39 and 0 20 respectively the spatiotemporal analysis of summer soil moisture from 2000 to 2014 exhibited a significant wetting trend the spatial patterns were characterized by wetting trends over arid and humid regions and drying trends over semi arid regions the results indicate that the pyramid framework can provide a soil moisture dataset with reasonable accuracy and high spatial resolution keywords soil moisture cart remote sensing soil moisture variation 1 introduction as a key parameter of the climate system soil moisture controls the water and energy cycle between the land and the atmosphere acting as a regulator of the water and energy balance entin et al 2000 zuo and zhang 2008 li et al 2011 soil moisture and climate change interact with each other changes in temperature precipitation and other climatic factors directly result in soil moisture variations which can change the heat distribution between the surface latent heat flux and sensible heat flux thereby affecting the regional climate ma et al 2000 zhang et al 2016a 2016b therefore it is important to obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture and analyse its spatiotemporal variation in the regional climate system to monitor and forecast droughts and disasters and adjust agricultural production among other purposes numerical simulations have long been one of the main approaches used to obtain large scale soil moisture data using basic meteorological data and land surface models li et al 2011 land surface models particularly the community land model clm have been widely used in china chen et al 2010 du et al 2008 wang and zeng 2011 li et al 2011 because the accuracy of soil moisture simulations depends critically on the quality of meteorological data and the description of the land surface the numerical simulation of soil moisture contains many uncertainties guo et al 2007 shi et al 2011 lu and shi 2012 the development of remote sensing technology provides an effective way to obtain large scale soil moisture data the algorithms can be divided into two categories depending on the wavelength bands used to measure soil moisture measurements based on visible thermal infrared sensing and measurements based on microwave sensing the former measures soil moisture indirectly using statistical models kogan 1995 sandholt et al 2002 wang et al 2007 or hydrological models zhang and wegehenkel 2006 kunnath poovakka et al 2016 hornero et al 2016 which utilize land surface features retrieved by visible thermal infrared bands e g vegetation land surface temperature surface albedo as model parameters the soil moisture data measured using these algorithms often has a relatively high spatial resolution and accuracy depending on the land surface features e g land surface temperature determined based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data with a resolution of 1 km and an accuracy of approximately 1 2 km the main issue associated with this method is the inability of visible thermal infrared radiation to penetrate clouds which greatly affects the quality of the measured data because the microwave scattering coefficient is directly linked to the soil dielectric constant which is greatly affected by the soil water content and because microwaves have the ability to penetrate clouds rain and other atmospheric conditions microwave remote sensing and particularly passive microwave remote sensing has been widely used for global soil moisture measurement at all times and under all weather conditions mao et al 2008 shen et al 2015 however microwave remote sensing also has several limitations first the accuracy of the algorithms are seriously affected by the soil surface roughness vegetation and other factors shi et al 2011 kim et al 2015 second the time series of the data is short and is unfavourable for long term analyses of variations e g the duration of the widely used amsr e data is only 10 years and the duration of smap data is considerably shorter third the spatial resolution of the data is relatively low 10 40 km finally many agricultural and hydrological researchers are interested in root zone soil moisture and passive microwave can detect only surface soil moisture conditions the detection depth is 0 5 cm on bare land and can be even less on grassland shrub land farmland or woodland piles et al 2011 zhang et al 2016a 2016b these shortcomings greatly limit the application of microwave remote sensing products the spatial scale of soil moisture variability can be divided into two categories the local scale which is impacted by soil properties and the regional scale which is impacted by meteorological systems vinnikov and robock 1996 entin et al 2000 seneviratne et al 2010 cho and choi 2014 these studies indicate that multiple factors have a complex effect on soil moisture variations including precipitation evapotranspiration ground temperature radiation soil texture st and soil heterogeneity in addition the growth of vegetation also has an effect on soil moisture particularly in arid and semi arid areas magagi and kerr 2001 an effective method of building a soil moisture estimation model should integrate regional meteorological data remotely sensed surface information and information on elevation and soil properties to estimate soil moisture with high accuracy and spatial resolution however a global model is unable to estimate soil moisture accurately at a large scale or even a global scale the data have more complex surface features on a large scale making it difficult to achieve a global fit furthermore the generalizability of the model is decreased which leads to unreasonable soil moisture values in certain areas the classification and regression tree cart algorithm provides unique advantages for developing a soil moisture estimation model compared to traditional statistical regression techniques in a large area with complex surface features the cart algorithm can divide the data into multiple areas with lower complexity and then use piecewise fitting instead of global fitting the low generalizability of a model is mainly caused by two issues which were not identified in previous studies the first issue is the inconsistency of the spatial integrity of data from multiple sources i e we cannot ensure that all data are valid at each location for instance on an average day 60 of the land surface is covered by clouds thus few thermal infrared tir land surface temperature lst measurements are available in southern china in the summer duan et al 2017 the other issue is the mismatch between the training space defined by training samples and the application space which is mainly caused by the uneven spatial distribution of the sampling stations therefore a framework is needed not only to estimate soil moisture accurately but also to address the above problems thus there are three main objectives in this study a to design a soil moisture estimation framework based on data from multiple sources including precipitation lst evapotranspiration vegetation condition elevation slope st and soil water capacity the framework should provide for machine learning and then generate a soil moisture product with a spatial resolution of 1 km b to assess the quality of the soil moisture products via a comparison with the temperature vegetation drought index tvdi and in situ measurements and c to analyse the spatiotemporal variability of the summer soil moisture from 2000 to 2014 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area china s landmass was selected as the study area for this study china is located in the eastern part of asia and lies on the west coast of the pacific ocean 3 31 00 n 53 33 00

basins and plains the qinghai tibet plateau is the highest plateau in the world the climatic conditions in the study area include three monsoon climates temperate monsoon subtropical monsoon and tropical monsoon and two non monsoon climates temperate continental and plateau mountainous the different types of climate have a spatial distribution with the lowest amount of precipitation in the northwest and the highest amount of precipitation in southeast the main food crops are wheat rice corn and potatoes 2 2 remote sensing data data products from modis were selected for this research because of their long durations modis has been widely used for land ocean and atmospheric research the 8 day composite lst product mod11a2 monthly normalized difference vegetation index ndvi product mod13a3 and monthly evapotranspiration et product mod16a2 from 2000 to 2014 with a spatial resolution of 1 km were used these products are made available to the public by the u s land processes distributed active archive center lpdaac usgs gov 2 3 meteorological data the daily precipitation data observed by meteorological stations from 2000 to 2014 was provided by the china meteorological data sharing service system data cma cn after performing data quality control data sets from 703 meteorological stations were found to be of sufficient quality we also collected in situ soil moisture measurements observed at agrometeorological stations from the china meteorological data sharing service system the majority of these data sets began in the 1980s and were collected every 10 days typically on the 8th 18th and 28th days of each month until the sampled soil areas froze during the winter the original data were measured by the gravimetrically but were released in the form of relative soil moisture in this study we selected soil moisture data from 2001 to 2013 to ensure data integrity and quality the observational depth spanned from 0 to 1 m 10 cm was chosen as the study depth here 2 4 auxiliary data the auxiliary data used in our research included st digital elevation model dem soil available water capacity awc and soil field capacity fc data st data determines the agricultural soil classes based on the proportions of various mineral particles in the soil using a qualitative classification it is a key factor used to approximate the response of the soil to environmental and management conditions dem data were used because the distribution of precipitation gross vegetation and other features are directly related to elevation the st and dem data were both provided by the cold and arid regions sciences data centre in lanzhou westdc westgis ac cn and have a spatial resolution of 1 km the sts were classified into twelve types using the usda soil texture classification system only the top layer 0 30 cm was processed awc is the range of available water that can be stored in soil and be available for growing crops fc is the amount of soil moisture or water content held in the soil after excess water has drained away and the rate of downward movement has decreased these two properties were obtained from the global gridded surfaces of selected soil characteristics igbp dis database with a spatial resolution of 10 km 3 methods 3 1 data preprocessing once the modis products were obtained they were mosaicked and reprojected to the wgs84 datum and geographic projections with the modis projection tool mrt using nearest neighbour resampling to maintain the same temporal resolution as that of the ndvi and et product the lst product was transformed into a monthly product using the average value of the four antecedent days of the year doys for example a composite of the products doy153 doy161 doy169 and doy177 was generated as the product of june soil moisture observations were transformed from having a temporal resolution of 10 days to monthly using the average value of the measurements for the month the soil moisture observations recorded by the agrometeorological stations are the soil relative moisture unit we translated these observations into soil volumetric moisture unit m3 m3 as follows 1 θ v θ θ f h where θ v θ θ f and h are the soil volumetric moisture soil relative moisture fc and soil depth respectively in eq 1 the fc is defined by the water depth unit mm in the igbp dis database the default setting is 1 m the daily precipitation data were converted to monthly cumulative precipitation cp an inverse distance weighted idw method was used to interpolate the monthly cp data into a 1 km raster format to unify the spatial resolution the awc was also resampled from a 10 km resolution to a 1 km resolution using the method of nearest resampling in addition we acquired the topography data surface slope from the dem using the surface tool in arcgis 10 02 finally all of the raster data were reprojected to albers projections 3 2 pyramid framework for soil moisture estimation in this study we estimated the soil moisture as a function with meteorological precipitation lst evapotranspiration and biophysical elevation topography vegetation condition st type soil available water content characteristics as follows 2 sm i t f x i t ε where x is a vector of predictor variables ε is the estimation error produced by f applied to x the subscript i denotes the location of the pixel in space indexed by pixel and t refers to its location in time indexed by year and month cart is a method of machine learning that was proposed by breiman et al 1984 suppose that x 1 x 2 x n are the input variables and that y is the output variable for a training dataset in the space d with n input variables and m input samples let d x 11 x 12 x 1 n y 1 x 21 x 22 x 2 n y 2 x m 1 x m 2 x mn y m cart splits d into a certain number of subspaces using a binary recursive process each recursive process attempts to select several splitting variables and splitting points from the current space s parent node to divide the space into two inhomogeneous subspaces s 1 and s 2 child nodes every subspace has an estimated value y determined by fitting using the least squares method the optimal splitting variable j and splitting point s are finally selected to ensure that the binary division has the minimum residual variance as follows 3 var j s min s min s 1 j s x i s 1 j s y i y 1 2 min s 2 j s x i s 2 j s y i y 2 2 each child node is treated as a potential parent node in the next division process until the homogeneous divisions or terminal nodes are obtained the cart algorithm allows for a wide range of possible input data types statistical assumptions regarding the data distribution are not required thus non normally distributed data can readily be utilized in the analysis without the difficulties typically created by such data herold et al 2003 the commercial software tool cubist which has adopted the cart algorithm was used to generate a rule based regression tree model cubist was developed by rulequest company http www rulequest com and has been used in numerous studies including vegetation cover mapping drought monitoring and urban land cover estimation sexton et al 2013 walton 2008 brown et al 2013 wu et al 2015 the software produces a rule based set based on training data with each rule having the syntax if conditions then linear formula to calculate the soil moisture value the following is an example of one of the many rules generated for a specific period if lst 302 2865 and awc 17 38371 and slope 0 06013519 and dem 34 91837 and st is in 9 10 11 12 then soil moisture 64 391042 71 96 slope 0 00263 dem 0 0242 cp 0 0042 et 0 3 awc 0 14 lst 0 7 ndvi in the tree model application for the independent input variables in raster format if the value of an independent variable meets the threshold identified by one rule then the corresponding linear regression rule is used to calculate the soil moisture value at the pixel level there are two prerequisites first the spatial integrity of model parameters must be consistent in general more factors will yield higher estimation accuracies however as discussed in section 1 it is difficult to ensure that all data are valid in certain areas for example when the et data are opened there may be a large number of pixels with invalid data in northwest china errors will inevitably be generated when the applied model uses et as a parameter in such areas another prerequisite is that the size of the training space defined by the training samples and the size of the application space must match however the stations are mainly concentrated in eastern china at low elevations as shown in fig 1 this uneven spatial distribution of the stations causes the training space and application space to be mismatched and invalidates the rules generated from the training data for example we compared the extent of the training space and application space defined by eight independent variables and the corresponding data in june 2000 respectively as shown in table 1 not all the variable ranges in the application space match those of the training space for example the range of dem values in the application space varied from 0 to 8654 whereas they varied from 0 to 4300 in the training space which means that a rule that uses elevation as a parameter is not applicable to an area with an elevation greater than 4300 such as the qinghai tibet plateau therefore it is not possible to use only one estimation model to obtain the soil moisture distribution over all of china despite using only the matched variables in table 1 as model parameters instead specific models should be generated for different regions thus we designed a pyramid framework that includes multiple models with different parameters to account for these two issues in this framework the higher level model theoretically has a higher precision but a smaller applicable area whereas the lower level model is the opposite the specific process of building the framework is shown as fig 2 after determining the variable range matching result from table 1 we can divide the variables into two parts matched variables and mismatched variables the matched variables can then be selected to construct the basic soil moisture estimation model which is at the bottom of the pyramid framework and can be applied to the entire area then based on the basic model other mismatched variables can be gradually introduced to construct multiple models finally the multiple models can be sorted based on their precision to determine the model level in the framework and the model priority in the application in this study six candidate training schemes were prepared to be input into cubist as shown in table 2 a window was applied to extract the value at each site location from the raster or grid data the ndvi lst et and cp were extracted for the same time period as the soil moisture records the dem slope awc and st are intrinsic properties of earth we assumed that these variables did not change considerably in the study area during the research period of 2000 2014 therefore these variables were considered to be constants for all continuous variables e g ndvi lst et cp dem slope awc fc the average value within the window was calculated to represent the site location value for st which is a categorical variable the average method was replaced by the majority wu et al 2015 also used the cart algorithm to monitor agricultural droughts in china the study considered that the window size may affect the accuracy wu compared different window sizes and concluded that a 9 9 km window size was the most suitable we followed the same approach in this study and compared several window sizes including 3 3 km 5 5 km 7 7 km and 9 9 km to determine the most reasonable size we selected the optimal model from each scheme to build the pyramid framework based on three criteria the minimum average error minimum relative error and maximum correlation coefficient these three evaluation criteria are defined by cubist the average error is the average of the biases between the observations and predictions the relative error is the ratio of the average error to the error that would result from always predicting the mean value for useful models this should be less than 1 the correlation coefficient measures the agreement between the cases actual values of the target variables and those values predicted by the model of the six models which are labelled with model tags model 5 3 was the most suitable to be the top of the pyramid because it had the lowest average error of 4 15 the lowest relative error of 0 64 and the highest correlation coefficient of 0 74 model 1 3 was the most suitable to be at the bottom the order of the models from top to bottom was model 5 3 model 4 4 model 3 4 model 2 4 and model 1 3 model 6 4 was not employed because its precision was lower than that of model 5 3 even though it contained all of the factors in the practical application of the framework we first set the spatial unintegrity part and mismatched part of the multiple grid data as invalid then for each pixel location we check whether the variables are valid based on its values choosing the optimal estimation model from the pyramid framework based on the same input variables thus if all the pixels in the study area were assigned a reasonable soil moisture value the monthly soil moisture levels in the summer from 2000 to 2014 were produced with a resolution of 1 km 3 3 validation strategies it is very important to make validation for the method and the observation data is used to make validation in order to keep more convincing tvdi is used as indirect methods for further comparison analysis by using tvdi the in situ observation data from 2001 to 2013 and the tvdi used to monitor the results in the summer of 2013 were adopted as evaluation standards to evaluate the feasibility of the framework and the reliability of the predictions a k fold cross validation by year approach using hold out years was used to assess the performance of the soil moisture estimation framework for the summer period for each month 13 validation iterations or folds were performed by using 12 years of historical data to train a model e g 2001 2012 and one independent hold out year e g 2013 to determine the estimation accuracy of the framework across all of the stations a different hold out year was selected for each iteration which allowed every year in the 13 year record to be withheld for testing in each iteration the correlation coefficient r and the average and relative errors of the estimation framework were calculated and the mean 1 standard deviation coefficient and error values across the 13 years were reported for the summer period a number of studies have found that the ts ndvi feature space a universal triangle or trapezoidal shape can provide information on soil moisture conditions at the surface researchers have proposed many indices based on the ts ndvi feature space one of these indices is the tvdi which is widely used in soil moisture or drought monitoring sandholt et al 2002 due to the large range in elevations in china a calibrated method was used to revise the surface temperatures before the tvdi calculations according to ran et al 2005 as follows 4 t d t s h a where t d is the calibrated lst t s is the lst before the calibration h is the elevation and a is a parameter that reflects the extent of the influence of elevation on the soil moisture retrieval process which is 0 006 for china in addition the tvdi and soil moisture are negatively correlated we made several changes to the calculation to facilitate the analysis and comparisons the final formula for the tvdi is as follows 5 tvdi 1 t d t d min t d max t d min where t d is the calibrated lst t d min is the minimum lst of a pixel in the feature space and t d max is maximum lst low tvdi values indicate dry conditions whereas high values correspond to wet conditions 3 4 spatiotemporal variability method the least squares method was used to fit the linear tendency of soil moisture during each summer to determine the annual variability of soil moisture the formula is as follows 6 slope n i 1 n i sm i i n i i n sm i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where slope represents the linear tendency and sm i is the value of soil moisture during year i i 1 2 3 n the soil moisture has an increasing trend when slope 0 and a decreasing trend otherwise before slope was calculated a durbin watson test method was used to test the autocorrelation of the data the linear model is only effective if the serial data are not autocorrelated the test formula is as follows 7 d t 2 n e t e t 1 2 t 1 n e t 2 where d is the statistic and et is the residual of the linear model the durbin watson test has two limit values the upper du and the lower dl if 0 d dl or 4 dl d 4 the serial data have a positive or negative autocorrelation respectively if du d 4 du there is no autocorrelation 4 results and analysis 4 1 accuracy assessment table 3 shows the 13 fold cross validation results including the mean of the average error the relative error and the correlation coefficient 1 standard deviation the correlation coefficient values revealed that all models had a relatively high accuracy r 0 60 the r values for the individual hold out years ranged from 0 48 june 2007 to 0 73 july 2008 the average and relative errors of the models were also relatively low for the summer period ranging from 3 90 to 5 31 and from 0 62 to 0 84 respectively the performance of the framework was relatively stable across the 13 year study period with low variabilities in the r values 1 std 0 06 and error measures 1 std 0 05 however subtle monthly differences were found between the models with consistently higher r values and lower average and relative errors during june and august and lower r values and higher average and relative errors in july 4 2 comparison to the tvdi results we also used the soil moisture conditions as monitored by remote sensing to evaluate the reliability of the predicted spatial distribution of the soil moisture the tvdi was used as a reference to ensure a constant prediction depth the predicted soil moisture and tvdi in the summer of 2013 were calculated as shown in fig 3 where fig 3a b and c show the predicted results for june july and august respectively and fig 3d e and f show the corresponding tvdi results the in situ observations during the summer of 2013 were used to qualitatively compare the predictions and tvdi results as shown in fig 3g i fig 3a f show that the two results were generally consistent in northeastern and northern china the soil moisture was low in the plains areas and relatively high in mountainous areas in the northwest both measures tended to gradually become drier from east to west in inner mongolia the alxa desert in the west of inner mongolia and the taklimakan desert in the south of xinjiang were the driest areas of china li et al 2011 lu and shi 2012 sun et al 2005 the tvdi did not reflect this feature well as the soil moisture around the taklimakan desert was relatively wet this feature was more accurately described by the predictions than by the tvdi the predictions and tvdi consistently reflected the soil moisture in the western part of the qinghai tibet plateau but yielded different results for the southeastern part of the plateau the tvdi indicated that the southeast part was dry which was not true in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river a large scale extreme drought occurred during july and early august the predictions and tvdi both reflected the drought but the predictions better reflected its characteristics in guizhou and hunan which were the areas most affected by the drought overall the spatial patterns of the soil moisture reflected by the predictions and tvdi were consistent and the predictions were more accurate in certain areas e g the hetao plain horqin sandy region qinghai lake and the oasis surrounding the taklimakan desert as shown in fig 3g i the correlations between the tvdi and measured data are low in june july and august with coefficients of 0 49 0 29 and 0 49 respectively whereas the correlation coefficients between the predictions and the measured data were 0 70 0 68 and 0 69 respectively this indicates that the predictions can better reflect the differences in soil moisture between different locations 4 3 spatial patterns of the summer soil moisture fig 4 shows the spatial patterns of the average summer soil moisture within the top 10 cm of the soil in china the soil moisture increases gradually from northwest to southeast and exhibits a spatial distribution pattern of northwest dry northeast and southeast wet as a whole the areas with low soil moisture values i e below 10 m3 m3 are mainly distributed in the gobi desert between the tarim basin and alashan plateau these areas have a temperate continental climate with little precipitation strong daylight and poor surface water capacity due to the low vegetation coverage the areas with high soil moisture values i e more than 30 m3 m3 are mainly distributed in the northeast china plain the huang huai hai plain and south of the yangtze river the climate of these areas is mainly a monsoon climate with high temperatures and a rainy summer high vegetation coverage and well developed river systems soil moisture also exhibits different spatial distributions in the different summer months there were no notable changes in july and august aside from several areas in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river significant changes in soil moisture spatial distribution between june and august are concentrated in the eastern part of china in the northeast china plain and huang huai hai plain the soil moisture is higher in june than in july and august whereas in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the soil moisture is relatively low exhibiting a wet to dry pattern in the south and a dry to wet pattern in the north this trend is mainly caused by the characteristics of the summer rainy season which advances from south to north due to the monsoon climate affect the majority of southern china enters the main rainy season in early june later the rainy season moves to the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and brings this area into the plum rainy season or east asian rainy season northern and northeastern china enter the main rainy season in early to middle july whereas southern china and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river leave the rainy season in northern china and northeastern china the rainy season ends in late august 4 4 spatiotemporal variation of summer soil moisture in china table 4 shows the inter annual variations of the summer soil moisture at a depth of 10 cm in china from 2000 to 2014 the durbin watson test results reveal that there was no autocorrelation of the time series data the interannual variations of the soil moisture in the summer from 2000 to 2014 increased at a rate of 0 03 a with a significance level of 0 1 in june and july the soil moisture increased at rates of 0 04 a and 0 06 a respectively both with a significance level of 0 01 the soil moisture decreased in august at a rate of 0 01 a but the trend was not significant to determine the interannual variability of soil moisture at a depth of 10 cm in china the trend in the soil moisture during the summers from 2000 to 2014 was calculated at the pixel level fig 5 a red represents the areas where soil moisture is decreasing whereas blue represents wetter areas in general the patterns were both characterized by an alternating drying and wetting trend from the northwest to the southeast arid regions including northern and western inner mongolia and the majority of xinjiang presented a drying trend in semi arid regions except for midwest tibet and the yili region of xinjiang the soil moisture increased and exhibited wetting trends in the semi humid and humid regions certain areas including the hulunbuir pasture land and the northeast china plain the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and the border areas of guangdong and guangxi exhibited wetting trends other areas particularly the huang huai area and the yunnan guizhou plateau exhibited considerable drying approximately 36 17 of the areas exhibited drying trends whereas 57 37 exhibited wetting trends approximately 26 1 of the areas exhibited significant changes with a significance level of 0 1 as shown in fig 5 b the majority of the significantly changing areas exhibited wetting trends 14 87 which were mainly distributed in the hulunbuir pasture land nenjiang river basin loess plateau and lüliang mountains area at the junction of shaanxi and shanxi the main parts of qinghai south of gansu north of hebei and south of anhui significantly drying areas represented 11 23 of the total area and were mainly distributed in the huang huai area tarim basin of xinjiang central tibet central yunnan southwest of hunan and north of guangdong 5 conclusions and discussion this research comprehensively estimated soil moisture from regional precipitation data the remotely sensed surface thermal and ecological environment and information on elevation and soil properties a pyramid framework with multiple estimation models based on the cart algorithm was developed to address the problems caused by the large scale of the estimate namely global fitting when building the model and the low generalizability when applying the model then the framework was used to produce summer soil moisture products at a depth of 10 cm with a spatial resolution of 1 km from 2000 to 2014 a k fold cross validation approach was used to assess the performance of the soil moisture estimation framework across the summer period the results reveal that the performance of the framework was relatively stable during the study period with low variabilities in the r values 1 std 0 06 and error measures 1 std 0 05 the predictions reflect the spatial variations more accurately than the tvdi results the correlation coefficients between the tvdi and observations in june july and august were 0 49 0 29 and 0 49 respectively whereas the corresponding coefficients between the predictions and observations were 0 70 0 68 and 0 69 respectively corresponding to increases of 0 21 0 39 and 0 21 respectively the results indicate that the pyramid framework can provide a soil moisture dataset with reasonable accuracy and high spatial resolution the spatial pattern of soil moisture is characterized by an increasing gradient from northwest to southeast the major areas of low soil moisture were located in the gobi desert between the tarim basin and the alashan plateau whereas the high soil moisture values were mainly distributed in the northeast china plain the huang huai hai plain and south of the yangtze river different months in summer also exhibit different spatial patterns particularly in the eastern part of china between june and august these different patterns are mainly caused by the characteristics of the summer rainy season which advances from south to north due to the effect of the monsoon climate the spatiotemporal analysis of the predictions from 2000 to 2014 revealed that the summer soil moisture exhibited a significant overall wetting trend the spatial patterns were characterized by wetting trends over arid and humid regions and drying trends over semi arid regions the area of the significantly wetter regions was larger than that of the drier regions regions with significantly wetter trends were mainly distributed in the hulunbuir pasture land loess plateau and the main parts of qinghai whereas regions with significantly drier trends were mainly distributed in the huang huai area and central tibet the direct causes of these trends require further study however the spatiotemporal variations in soil moisture indicate changes in the regional climate water resources and environment which would have a profound impact on the agricultural regions acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the relative data centre for providing the research data and

7127,there is increasing recognition of the need to incorporate the complex and dynamic interactions between society and water in studies of water resource systems the study of human water dynamics requires the involvement of researchers from different disciplines including hydrology and social science this paper tracks recent trends in socio hydrological research using quantitative and qualitative methods bibliographic metrics and network analysis are used to identify general trends and illustrate the internal connections in this small but growing interdisciplinary field results show that hydrologists dominate research in socio hydrology as presently defined with far less participation from social scientists research questions for socio hydrology tend to focus on system dynamics and are often not framed in a way that engages the interests and expertise of social scientists a qualitative analysis addresses key barriers to the interdisciplinary development of socio hydrology and identifies research needs and directions for better integration of the human dimensions of water science attracting social scientists to this field requires a broader conceptualization of socio hydrology to focus on sustainable development risk assessment hazard management resilience adaptation and knowledge mobilization in addition to hydrology s traditional focus on systems modeling and decision support we propose three themes for thematic focus systemic risk and natural hazards sustainability science and adaptive governance this broader framing of socio hydrology is inherently more interdisciplinary brings new methods and viewpoints to the field and ensures that place based local values are included in studies of water system dynamics keywords human water interaction system dynamics bibliographic metrics network analysis interdisciplinary 1 introduction human activities including urban and rural land management the construction and management of water infrastructure such as reservoirs and drainage systems industrial and agricultural activities conservation practices and policy are important sources of change in hydrological systems hancock 2002 barnett et al 2008 savenije et al 2014 gober and wheater 2014 hydrologic conditions also have significant impacts on society at multiple scales from local to regional and global for example via flooding drought water quality and erosion oki and kanae 2006 biemans et al 2011 vogel et al 2015 more than 40 years ago falkenmark 1977 articulated the need for social scientists to be more actively involved in water science and to assess the social consequences of water projects she named this new field of study hydro sociology more recently sivapalan et al 2012 noted that it is not possible to study the evolution of contemporary water systems without treating human activities as an integral part of system dynamics and they called the new scientific field of people and water socio hydrology in the past five years socio hydrological studies have drawn attention from various disciplines and several studies have assessed the status of this emerging domain for example troy et al 2015 summarized early efforts to model water system dynamics and the two way coupling of human water systems including studies of flooding land use change governance and water quality and loss of ecosystem services more recently pande and sivapalan 2017 critically reviewed previous studies on socio hydrology and proposed the integration of human elements into models of water cycle dynamics extended to larger spatial and temporal scales seidl and barthel 2017 examined patterns of collaborative development in socio hydrology and found them on a positive track with the need to make further progress in integrating social science research topics viewpoints and methods into the field the main purpose of this paper is to ask whether the call for broadening the field of hydrology to include social sciences has translated into substantive change in the structure of scientific activity as evidenced by research articles in journals and book chapters a secondary goal is to identify areas of social science related to human water issues that might strengthen interdisciplinary collaboration within a broader framework of socio hydrology accordingly this paper focuses on the social structure and intellectual patterns of socio hydrology it explores the topics and people who have sought to work under the umbrella of socio hydrology quantitative analysis synthesizes the existing literature using biographic tools from the web of science wos patterns of research reveal general trends in the number and social organization of work in these fields qualitative analysis involves more interpretive approaches to identify knowledge production patterns barriers to the interdisciplinary development of this area of study and opportunities to reorganize around timely and emerging intellectual themes 2 socio hydrology by the numbers and maps we collected existing publications and used bibliometric and network analyses to portray trends and investigate the associated collaborative research relationships in studies of the relationship between society and hydrology first we created a raw dataset by applying word combinations of soci hydrolog or human hydrolog or people hydrolog to the search for publications in the web of science between 1970 and 2017 data accessed in september 2017 the exercise provided a general understanding of research that combined society and hydrology themes we used the core collection databases to collect bibliographic data of publications including the science citation index expanded sci expended social sciences citation index ssci arts humanities citation index a hci conference proceedings citation index science social science humanities cpci s ssh book citation index science social science humanities bkci s ssh and emerging sources citation index esci later we used keywords socio hydrolog and sociohydrolog to identifypapers more narrowly focused on socio hydrology the latter subset of the society hydrology theme provides a clearer picture of which actors have chosen to self identify with this body of work what are the patterns of co authorship and what kinds of analyses are being done under this umbrella 2 1 statistics on socio hydrological literature we found a total of 9914 articles published between 1970 and 2017 that linked hydrology with the words social human or people it should be noted that more studies could be retrieved for the broad topics about humans and water by using other keywords e g anthropocene water and anthropogenic water and that there may be studies which address coupled water and social dynamics that were not included in our analysis because they did not use the word socio hydrology to define their studies however as several reviews of the literature on these more general human and water interactive relations exist e g srinivasan et al 2012 wada et al 2017 we narrowed our scope in this paper to explore the status of the specific emerging field of socio hydrology illustrated on an annual basis our analysis shows the very slow progression of this type of work until 1990 and exponential growth after 2005 fig 1 the red bars in fig 1 show annual numbers of publications after 1970 results suggest that falkenmark s call for greater integration of social science and hydrology had very little immediate impact on the science of water the black symbolled line represents the proportion of the larger water and society field that is specifically devoted to socio hydrology which has never constituted more than 4 of the broader society water research domain fig 1 to examine the popular themes in the rest of the papers we statistically analyzed the frequency of the keywords that appeared in the abstracts of those papers which do not use the word socio hydrology but have interests in the linkage of hydrology and society namely 9813 papers according to the statistics flood floods drought droughts and change changes are most frequent keywords that appear in the abstracts of 9813 papers with numbers of occurrence at 5075 3137 and 2729 respectively other frequent keywords include rights land use change ecosystem regulation resilience vulnerability and urbanization table 1 the keywords demonstrate that these broader topics have attracted more interest from scientists focusing on the linkage between hydrology and society these most frequent keywords address issues around environmental change risks and natural hazards governance and adaptation ecosystem services and biodiversity as well as sustainability and development the statistical analysis of keywords suggests that in addition to the quantitative modeling of human water dynamics there are many other areas for collaboration in socio hydrology between hydrologists and social scientists direct reference to socio hydrology appeared in 101 papers including 76 research articles 13 conference proceedings papers 7 editorial materials 4 review papers and 1 book chapter the numbers grew rapidly after the sivapalan s call to arms in 2012 three hundred and forty three authors contributed to the 101 socio hydrology papers between 2010 and 2017 after 2012 the number of papers grew and the average number of authors per paper increased from 2 3 to 5 2 over the last five years upcoming special issues on socio hydrology spatial and temporal dynamics of coupled human water systems in water resources research and a virtual special issue on building socio hydrological resilience in the journal of hydrology are likely to continue to build critical mass in this field socio hydrology has drawn more attention from hydrologists than from social scientists leading outlets for socio hydrology are hydrology and earth system sciences water resources research and iahs publications table 2 2 2 mapping collaborative networks in socio hydrology in this section we use co authorships to map the structure of the existing scholarly networks and examine the status of interdisciplinary development in the socio hydrological field we collected co authorships from the bibliographic records of 101 targeted papers on socio hydrology the co authorship network describes scientific collaboration through publications where nodes the points in the network denote authors and an edge or line which links two nodes represents two authors who have co authored one or more publications a co authorship network is an undirected network which is built by the matrix product m aa where a and its transpose a is a n p matrix with generic elements a ij i n j p n and p is the set of n authors and p publications respectively it is assumed that a ij is equal to 1 if the ith author also wrote the jth publication and 0 otherwise therefore the matrix m is the valued n n undirected adjacency matrix g in which generic element g ik is greater than 0 if authors i and k i k n have written at least one publication together in the set p a value of g ik equals to 0 means that two authors ith and kth have never co authored the width of an edge represents the number of shared publications between the linked nodes the co authorship network contained 238 authors nodes with 1870 co authorships edges among 101 publications for a better illustration the authors were clustered into groups according to the k core partition approach embedded in pajek de nooy et al 2011 i e the degree of nodes in the network and visualized by vosviewer van eck and waltman 2010 fig 2 the degree of a node is equal to the number of its neighbors which means that a k core contains the nodes that have at least k neighbors within the group in fig 2 the size of nodes depicts the total number of publications while the width of edges represents the closeness of authors that is the bigger the node the more publications the author has published and the wider the edge the closer are the collaborations between them a growing number of researchers are involved in the socio hydrology network the co authorship network is dominated by those nodes that are linked by edges valued 1 1741 out of 1870 edges in other words most authors have only co authored once with one another person in the network according to the k core partition method explained above current co author relationships are clustered into sixteen groups illustrated by different colors in the network the widest collaborations stretch out to the nodes in cameo pink where the authors also possess the most publications in the field following this are nodes in celadon green aqua green and yellow other wide collaborations stem from papers in which a large group of authors are included especially the papers from the international association of hydrological sciences iahs programs such as panta rhei 2013 2015 global perspectives on hydrology society and change mcmillan et al 2016 savenije et al 2014 observed that integrated water resource management iwrm is inherently a social process in addition to being an interdependent physical system linking hydrology and society thus it requires an interdisciplinary perspective that combines insights from hydrologists and water engineers with knowledge about social and economic systems and public policy seidl and barthel 2017 investigated the integration of social scientists into socio hydrological research through a questionnaire survey with hydrological scientists and professionals and an analysis of disciplinary backgrounds of authors of socio hydrological research papers they found that the integration of social scientists is on a promising track but collaboration is at a preliminary stage more specifically they found that a sizable majority of respondents who referenced sivapalan et al 2012 32 of 43 were led by natural science teams and only two were dominated by social scientists eight had balanced research teams and two were unclear while socio hydrology has produced more collaborations than hydrology as a whole hydrologists come into the collaboration with differing expectations from social scientists survey respondents saw the role of social science in socio hydrological collaborations as 1 integrated collaboration where projects are co designed and knowledge is exchanged 2 classic social science research involving process reflection and moderation and 3 transfer of scientific knowledge and results to the public and water stakeholders hydrologists in the survey believed that they had equal responsibility for communicating results of their work and securing public acceptance and that social scientists are more responsible for the social and economic parts of the analysis the authors posit that hydrologists prefer to learn the important human drivers of water system change so that they can integrate them into their own research to determine the composition of disciplinary perspectives of the authors in our study we classified the network of authors into twelve groups according to disciplinary training and background based on website profiles the multidisciplinary group included those authors who have multiple disciplinary background training and research interests for example it would include individuals who have degrees in multiple areas for example engineering environmental economics and natural resources management we assumed that authors whose information was unavailable online are not currently active in research we visualized the disciplinary composition of authors using a network of co authorships in the 101 articles fig 3 the social science category consisted of representatives from anthropology and humanities governance politics and policy studies psychological and behavioral sciences and business and economics these fields deal with the social activities related to water management markets and governance human and physical geographers were combined into a single category because geographers often integrate physical and human processes in the study of water systems hydrologists n 101 dominate the core of the socio hydrology network meteorologists and climatologists are loosely linked to the field accounting for 1 7 of all authors 4 out of 238 in the network the number of researchers from the social sciences is relatively small at 33 including representatives from governance politics and policy analysis n 14 economics and business n 11 and anthropology and humanities n 8 human geographers n 13 also bring a long tradition of social science participation into water science in addition to longstanding interests in synthesizing human environment relationships besides the multidisciplinary group n 13 plays an important role in interdisciplinary collaborations due to their multidisciplinary training which enables them easier to communicate with other disciplines socio hydrology may not be new to them but rather a perspective on water that comes naturally given varied educational backgrounds and professional experiences in a recent retrospective paper sivapalan 2018 reemphasizes the need for socio hydrological research but places it more in the domain of quantitative hydrology than in the social sciences li et al 2018 demonstrate that socio hydrology has to be an interdisciplinary science which offers opportunity for social sciences to reinforce a quantitative interdisciplinary domain given the unequally involved disciplinary status of socio hydrology we suggest in the following section a broader definition for socio hydrology and its research agenda that will attract more social scientists to the field 3 reframing socio hydrology we conclude from the bibliographic analysis that socio hydrology is a small but growing field that is intellectually concentrated in the discipline of hydrology and hydrological journals with modest participation from social scientists the field can expand by 1 attracting more interest from environmental social scientists in system dynamics modeling 2 challenging more hydrologists to incorporate human variables into existing system dynamics models or 3 broadening the field to include topics that are more inherently interesting to social scientists 3 1 attracting more interest from environmental social scientists in system dynamics anthropogenic effects on hydrological systems are ubiquitous and include short as well as long term impacts across multiple spatial scales wheater and gober 2015 so that for example large scale hydrological models are currently faced with major challenges in the representation of human controls on water management wada et al 2017 nazemi and wheater 2015a and b humans affect water systems in a variety of ways including obvious variables such as population growth land use change levels of development and urbanization in addition to more difficult to measure aspects of human attitudes and values and governance strategies whether water is a common pool resource or a market good are also factors into water system behavior for example a major current issue in western canadian water policy involves wetland drainage in the face of downstream flooding of landowners and watersheds prairie farmers in western canada have drained agricultural land to increase efficiency and land available for planting crops recent evidence indicates that this has increased the incidence and magnitude of downstream flooding dumanski et al 2015 flooding is now a major issue on the public agenda as water security stakeholders weigh trade offs between maximizing productive capacity and environmental protection and flood control of downstream watersheds gober 2018 policy variables include the historical date of drainage licenses the amount of land approved for drainage and impacts on downstream flooding policy decisions affect hydrological function that in turn influences future policy choices the long term evolution of hydrological systems must consider interactions and feedbacks among the human and natural components di baldassarre et al 2015 implemented socio hydrology as a flood risk problem using the concept of social memory as a vehicle to link human perceptions to flood damage they used this idea to model effects of flood damages in green versus technological societies their model produced findings that reinforced the levee effect the idea that investment in flood mitigation infrastructure reduces the perception of risk and decreases vulnerability to low impact events but increases vulnerability to high impact extreme events burton and cutter 2008 montz and tobin 2008 the idea that socio hydrology seeks to understand the co evolution of human and water systems assumes that there is a two way connection between these two systems troy et al 2015 in empirical studies however there is enormous variation in the strength of relationships the time scales to which they are relevant and the directness of the coupling feedbacks identified in previous research involve human perceptions of local water quality relationships between ecosystem services and water quality and effects of flood protection decisions on flood damage in methodological terms social scientists may be more comfortable working in historical and ethnographic interpretation than in the quantitative complex system modeling that drives the current socio hydrology paradigm many have also embraced the role of participant observation where the researchers are participants in the social process of policy making a position that would violate positivist norms of standing outside of the research problem to maintain scientific objectivity 3 2 challenging more hydrologists to incorporate human variables into existing system dynamics models while hydrologists are the backbone of socio hydrology as currently practiced they are not trained in public policy economic analysis ethnographic research or social network analysis seidl and barthel 2017 note that interdisciplinary research is often not as interdisciplinary as it seems interdisciplinary research has been most successful across closely aligned fields in contrast to multidisciplinary work joint research on common problems from different disciplinary perspectives truly interdisciplinary research involves researchers from different disciplines working jointly on common problems they conducted a survey to elicit what hydrologists expect from social science in collaborative research three roles emerged 1 integrated collaboration 2 classic social science analysis and 3 translation and communications of research knowledge when confronted with a range of ideas about who should do what in socio hydrological research they found that hydrologists themselves should consider and integrate socioeconomic aspects in their own work is cited as the most preferable option in other words they want to learn social science research ideas to better integrate societal variables into their own research 3 3 broadening the field to include topics that are more inherently interesting to social scientists a broader more interdisciplinary perspective may be the most appropriate strategy for integrating new ideas and methods into socio hydrology hydrologists agreed in seidl and barthel s 2017 survey that hydrologists and social scientists are equally responsible for knowledge mobilization socio hydrology should include the social processes through which scientific knowledge is shared with decision makers and used for decision making gober and wheater 2014 socio hydrologists can play a crucial role as partners in water governance across a range of scales international national regional and local decision making knowledge translation is grist for social science research in addition to being a mechanism to make socio hydrology relevant to decision makers and society ideas from knowledge mobilization and scientific communication have demonstrated that the usability of scientific knowledge is a function of both the scientific results themselves as well as the social context in which that knowledge produced potential remedies to problems of poor science communication involve having users at the discussion table to frame the problem initially dilling and lemos 2011 drew attention to the importance of two way iterative engagement between knowledge producers and users to build trust and better understand the needs of policy making to facilitate the two way communication and nurture interdisciplinarity of socio hydrology more broad topics which help understand social processes and their interactions with hydrological processes should be introduced to future research 4 promising topics to include social science to socio hydrology barriers for the integration of social and hydrological sciences are several but are common to all attempts to meld different disciplines in a common purpose one is the difficulty in unifying different languages between hydrology and social sciences or the natural and social sciences in general second is the need to frame a common agenda hydrologists coined the term socio hydrology and posed a set of research questions with the mission of embracing social sciences within hydrology sivapalan et al 2012 however these research questions and missions do not appear to have attracted major interest from many social scientists our bibliometric analysis has demonstrated that socio hydrology has developed well in the past five years but accounts for no more than 4 of the larger society and water field fig 1 however wider collaborative opportunities could be developed between hydrologists and social scientists through introducing some popular themes into the research investigating other interdisciplinary research fields one can find that the highly cited literature has either focused on a broad research theme or included a wider disciplinary collaboration examples include coupled human and natural systems research liu et al 2007 human environmental systems turner et al 2003 and social ecological systems ostrom 2009 social scientists have made significant contributions to interdisciplinary research programs in natural hazards and disasters sustainability resilience adaptation and knowledge mobilization brown and westaway 2011 adger et al 2005 ostrom 2009 edelenbos et al 2011 incorporating these themes as linkage points between the socio and hydrology portions of the field holds potential for more interdisciplinary collaboration and enhanced growth and societal significant for socio hydrology these broader themes may include sustainability ostrom 2009 vulnerability and resilience walker et al 2004 eakin and luers 2006 adaptation and governance folke et al 2005 and hazards cutter et al 2008 in the following we propose three general and inter related research themes that a benefit socio hydrology b are of considerable interest to social scientists and c have potential to foster interdisciplinary development of socio hydrology 4 1 systemic risks and natural hazards water systems threatened by climate and other environmental change include increased risks to human and natural systems brought about by human activities streamflow regime change in the north american prairies given in the last section is just one of many evident examples natural hazards such as floods droughts fire disease outbreaks and tornados occur ordinarily in many parts of globe wisner et al 2004 these challenges call for research on the two way feedbacks as posed by socio hydrology but more important questions are how such research will inform effective adaptation to change and how they are suitably evaluated birkmann 2011 one promising subtopic of risks and hazards is a focus on system resilience resilience has become a popular interdisciplinary tool to address these uncertain changes and disturbances and has become a renewed adaptive approach for the anthropocene xu et al 2015 it emphasizes nonlinear and long term views of slowly responding variables that may drive systems towards tipping points biggs et al 2009 folke et al 2010 these nonlinear relationships have been found in many coupled human and water systems such as water quality and landscape due to urbanization li et al 2016a the co evolutionary thinking of social ecological resilience links system states to the existence of thresholds uncertainties and dynamic feedbacks between systems across temporal and spatial scales socio hydrological models and system dynamics highlight features such as those embraced in resilience theory blair and buytaert 2016 for complex socio hydrological systems the need to identify how human society co evolves with hydrology and to address human adaptation to the changing hydrologic conditions under the variability of climate requires knowledge contributions from different disciplines in their recent review blair and buytaert 2016 suggested that socio hydrological modeling makes efforts to investigate interactions between hydrological and socioeconomic systems that could cause long term impacts to determine system vulnerability and signals for critical transitions of system states the recent studies of mao et al 2017 and yu et al 2017 provide conceptual and quantitative breakthroughs to take resilience thinking into socio hydrological research although a wide range of questions still remain to be addressed mutual interest could be established through topics with regard to the interdependencies and feedbacks in complex and dynamic systems critical thresholds and tipping points lags and legacies and trade offs and unintended consequences specific research questions may include how to create early warning signals of regime shifts of hydrological systems whether cascading effects exist in socio hydrological systems namely if hydrologic regime shifts would give rise to changes in regimes of the connected social systems and how to detect connections between systems and the potential cascading consequences a feature of resilience that could draw more attention from social scientists is its capacity to embrace social adaptations into hydrological contexts xu and kajikawa 2018 for example one can explore adaptive cycles in socio hydrological systems by looking at adaptation of individuals and communities in response to hydrological alterations on a long term time scale and across various space and jurisdictional scales natural hazards are by definition extreme events that occur naturally and disrupt the normal functioning of society and economy causing harms to humans white 1974 the early study of hazards emphasized their biophysical dimensions such as return periods intensity and spatial extent gober 2018 in the 1970s and 1980s political ecologists drew attention to the societal factors that put people in unsafe places limit support for them and undermine their ability to cope wisner et al 2004 interest in floods and drought can incorporate not only social memory human perceptions and values but also a range of ideas such as social learning social resilience collective action adaptive governance public policies ecological knowledge and knowledge translation into complex system dynamics modeling 4 2 sustainability science sustainability science has attracted social and biophysical scientists to think together in deep and meaningful ways about the nature of human natural coupled systems kajikawa et al 2014 larson et al 2015 complexities inherent in human environment systems present uncertainties and challenges for decision making the core ideas of sustainability science system dynamics scalar interdependencies uncertainty management robust decision making and stakeholder engagement are highly compatible to socio hydrology and are ideas that attract both social and natural scientists a possible way to link socio hydrology to sustainability science is to conduct scenario development with engagement of stakeholders scenario analysis is a planning methodology which incorporates quantitative modeling and or qualitative narrative information to generate possible futures for decision makings it offers conservation practitioners a method to couple local and global conditions and to build a group of plausible futures for developing more sustainable strategies and policies swart et al 2004 it also provides opportunities for communication to improve public appreciation of science and natural resources robinson et al 2011 scenario planning is a promising area for socio hydrological research due to the fact that it is able to include a set of possible and important uncertainties in the system rather than relying on accurate prediction of a single outcome peterson et al 2003 in that sense scenarios can be powerful tools to replace more traditional methods based on optimization and to introduce concepts such as resilience in future planning current socio hydrological models have successfully reconstructed the long term patterns of the human water relations lu et al 2015 but are still some way away from reliable prediction of the future over long time frames as the most uncertain elements often result from human activities and are hard to be fully understood with the knowledge and data we possess scenario development can be useful to identify decisions to balance trade offs between human and environmental water uses and to accommodate uncertain potential futures human water systems involve a wide range of trade offs which may occur between different water users for example agricultural drainage in canadian prairies increases food production of farmers however it leads to reduction of natural capital stocks such as the loss of wetlands and habitat for waterfowls decrease of ecosystem services including pollutant retention and carbon sequestration and increase in flood risk downstream these losses of ecosystem services must be deducted from the benefits that have been given developing scenarios of possible drainage intensity into socio hydrological models will help identify trade offs between the use of water for agricultural production and the use for ecosystems a possible way to evaluate such trade offs is to conduct ecosystem services based economic valuations costanza et al 1997 2014 that link value changes in landscape and ecosystem services to changes in hydrology ecosystem goods and services provide a broader conceptual framework for the alteration of hydrology thus water use in the present will change capital stocks in social ecological systems which may change the future value of water to support ecosystem services scenario development can be focused on for example identifying proper discount rate and accounting prices for estimating change in ecological capital for the change in net present values of services generated by that capital 4 3 adaptive governance adaptation to climate change has also led to new collaborations between social and natural scientists adaptation increasingly calls for building more resilience into both human and natural systems ipcc 2014 interest in adaptive governance comes from a variety of disciplines including ecology and environmental management folke et al 2005 liu et al 2007 pahl wostl et al 2010 stein et al 2013 landscape and urban planning hamin and gurran 2009 quay 2010 li et al 2016b and the policy sciences huitema and meijerink 2010 brunner 2010 adaptation research relies heavily on the concept of resilience defined as the extent to which a system can absorb recurrent natural and human perturbations and continue to regenerate without slowly degrading or even unexpectedly flipping into less desirable states folke et al 2005 p 442 443 a resilient social ecological system has the potential to cope with negative environmental changes without flipping into a different configuration which may be undesirable it can thus provide decision makers with tools and an integrative framework to plan adaptive strategies li et al 2014 xu and kajikawa 2018 in a recent article in ecology and society abel et al 2016 argued that the interactive dynamics of the murray darling basin in australia require new pathways for transformation that recognizes not only system dynamics but also diverse decision makers and rules high levels of uncertainty generated by stakeholders values understanding of climate change and acceptable ways of adapting 5 conclusions socio hydrology research has opened up a new way of dynamic thinking about humans and water which has further extended research of human water interactions to a domain that views people and their behaviors as endogenous and co evolving components in water cycle dynamics however this research field is still at an exploratory stage and better understanding of the interactions between the two systems is needed in both depth and scope requiring wide interdisciplinary collaboration in this paper we first showed the trends and status of interdisciplinary development in socio hydrology based on quantitative bibliometric analysis qualitative analysis of the literature was then conducted to explore ways that can be used to nurture interdisciplinary development of the field although there is raised awareness of the need to enhance collaboration between social and natural scientists to improve understanding of complex and dynamic water systems results of our empirical analysis demonstrate that the domain is still mainly populated by hydrologists with limited and arguably insufficient contribution from social scientists in previous socio hydrological studies hydrologists attempted to incorporate human and societal variables in quantitative models yet few social scientists have actively become involved in the field to investigate human water dynamics from their own perspectives we note that social scientists have not been particularly active in this research domain probably because of its underlying focus on hydrological processes which creates barriers for the communication between hydrologists and social scientists specifically the use of different language in hydrology and social sciences has led to their different emphasis on the two way dynamic feedbacks of human water systems hydrologists emphasize the importance of using mathematical models to quantitatively describe such dynamic feedbacks while social scientists highlight the role of social processes structures and governance in decision making accompanied by a need for knowledge translation to the decision makers and end users we believe that if the research question had been posed to favor human system dynamics including governance markets behaviors local knowledge policy and legal frameworks the composition of socio hydrology would be expected to be different to promote interdisciplinary collaboration we suggest that the field of socio hydrology be reframed to a attract more interest from social scientists in system dynamics modeling b challenge more hydrologists to incorporate human variables into existing system dynamics models and c broaden the field to include topics which are inherently interesting to social scientists future collaborative areas could be focused on three general research themes associated with a systemic risks and natural hazards b linkages to sustainability science and c adaptive governance this reflects a broader perspective of socio hydrology than many previous papers have considered but we feel that these research themes offer real promise for the involvement of social scientists for the development of enhanced understanding of and predictive capability for human water systems

7127,there is increasing recognition of the need to incorporate the complex and dynamic interactions between society and water in studies of water resource systems the study of human water dynamics requires the involvement of researchers from different disciplines including hydrology and social science this paper tracks recent trends in socio hydrological research using quantitative and qualitative methods bibliographic metrics and network analysis are used to identify general trends and illustrate the internal connections in this small but growing interdisciplinary field results show that hydrologists dominate research in socio hydrology as presently defined with far less participation from social scientists research questions for socio hydrology tend to focus on system dynamics and are often not framed in a way that engages the interests and expertise of social scientists a qualitative analysis addresses key barriers to the interdisciplinary development of socio hydrology and identifies research needs and directions for better integration of the human dimensions of water science attracting social scientists to this field requires a broader conceptualization of socio hydrology to focus on sustainable development risk assessment hazard management resilience adaptation and knowledge mobilization in addition to hydrology s traditional focus on systems modeling and decision support we propose three themes for thematic focus systemic risk and natural hazards sustainability science and adaptive governance this broader framing of socio hydrology is inherently more interdisciplinary brings new methods and viewpoints to the field and ensures that place based local values are included in studies of water system dynamics keywords human water interaction system dynamics bibliographic metrics network analysis interdisciplinary 1 introduction human activities including urban and rural land management the construction and management of water infrastructure such as reservoirs and drainage systems industrial and agricultural activities conservation practices and policy are important sources of change in hydrological systems hancock 2002 barnett et al 2008 savenije et al 2014 gober and wheater 2014 hydrologic conditions also have significant impacts on society at multiple scales from local to regional and global for example via flooding drought water quality and erosion oki and kanae 2006 biemans et al 2011 vogel et al 2015 more than 40 years ago falkenmark 1977 articulated the need for social scientists to be more actively involved in water science and to assess the social consequences of water projects she named this new field of study hydro sociology more recently sivapalan et al 2012 noted that it is not possible to study the evolution of contemporary water systems without treating human activities as an integral part of system dynamics and they called the new scientific field of people and water socio hydrology in the past five years socio hydrological studies have drawn attention from various disciplines and several studies have assessed the status of this emerging domain for example troy et al 2015 summarized early efforts to model water system dynamics and the two way coupling of human water systems including studies of flooding land use change governance and water quality and loss of ecosystem services more recently pande and sivapalan 2017 critically reviewed previous studies on socio hydrology and proposed the integration of human elements into models of water cycle dynamics extended to larger spatial and temporal scales seidl and barthel 2017 examined patterns of collaborative development in socio hydrology and found them on a positive track with the need to make further progress in integrating social science research topics viewpoints and methods into the field the main purpose of this paper is to ask whether the call for broadening the field of hydrology to include social sciences has translated into substantive change in the structure of scientific activity as evidenced by research articles in journals and book chapters a secondary goal is to identify areas of social science related to human water issues that might strengthen interdisciplinary collaboration within a broader framework of socio hydrology accordingly this paper focuses on the social structure and intellectual patterns of socio hydrology it explores the topics and people who have sought to work under the umbrella of socio hydrology quantitative analysis synthesizes the existing literature using biographic tools from the web of science wos patterns of research reveal general trends in the number and social organization of work in these fields qualitative analysis involves more interpretive approaches to identify knowledge production patterns barriers to the interdisciplinary development of this area of study and opportunities to reorganize around timely and emerging intellectual themes 2 socio hydrology by the numbers and maps we collected existing publications and used bibliometric and network analyses to portray trends and investigate the associated collaborative research relationships in studies of the relationship between society and hydrology first we created a raw dataset by applying word combinations of soci hydrolog or human hydrolog or people hydrolog to the search for publications in the web of science between 1970 and 2017 data accessed in september 2017 the exercise provided a general understanding of research that combined society and hydrology themes we used the core collection databases to collect bibliographic data of publications including the science citation index expanded sci expended social sciences citation index ssci arts humanities citation index a hci conference proceedings citation index science social science humanities cpci s ssh book citation index science social science humanities bkci s ssh and emerging sources citation index esci later we used keywords socio hydrolog and sociohydrolog to identifypapers more narrowly focused on socio hydrology the latter subset of the society hydrology theme provides a clearer picture of which actors have chosen to self identify with this body of work what are the patterns of co authorship and what kinds of analyses are being done under this umbrella 2 1 statistics on socio hydrological literature we found a total of 9914 articles published between 1970 and 2017 that linked hydrology with the words social human or people it should be noted that more studies could be retrieved for the broad topics about humans and water by using other keywords e g anthropocene water and anthropogenic water and that there may be studies which address coupled water and social dynamics that were not included in our analysis because they did not use the word socio hydrology to define their studies however as several reviews of the literature on these more general human and water interactive relations exist e g srinivasan et al 2012 wada et al 2017 we narrowed our scope in this paper to explore the status of the specific emerging field of socio hydrology illustrated on an annual basis our analysis shows the very slow progression of this type of work until 1990 and exponential growth after 2005 fig 1 the red bars in fig 1 show annual numbers of publications after 1970 results suggest that falkenmark s call for greater integration of social science and hydrology had very little immediate impact on the science of water the black symbolled line represents the proportion of the larger water and society field that is specifically devoted to socio hydrology which has never constituted more than 4 of the broader society water research domain fig 1 to examine the popular themes in the rest of the papers we statistically analyzed the frequency of the keywords that appeared in the abstracts of those papers which do not use the word socio hydrology but have interests in the linkage of hydrology and society namely 9813 papers according to the statistics flood floods drought droughts and change changes are most frequent keywords that appear in the abstracts of 9813 papers with numbers of occurrence at 5075 3137 and 2729 respectively other frequent keywords include rights land use change ecosystem regulation resilience vulnerability and urbanization table 1 the keywords demonstrate that these broader topics have attracted more interest from scientists focusing on the linkage between hydrology and society these most frequent keywords address issues around environmental change risks and natural hazards governance and adaptation ecosystem services and biodiversity as well as sustainability and development the statistical analysis of keywords suggests that in addition to the quantitative modeling of human water dynamics there are many other areas for collaboration in socio hydrology between hydrologists and social scientists direct reference to socio hydrology appeared in 101 papers including 76 research articles 13 conference proceedings papers 7 editorial materials 4 review papers and 1 book chapter the numbers grew rapidly after the sivapalan s call to arms in 2012 three hundred and forty three authors contributed to the 101 socio hydrology papers between 2010 and 2017 after 2012 the number of papers grew and the average number of authors per paper increased from 2 3 to 5 2 over the last five years upcoming special issues on socio hydrology spatial and temporal dynamics of coupled human water systems in water resources research and a virtual special issue on building socio hydrological resilience in the journal of hydrology are likely to continue to build critical mass in this field socio hydrology has drawn more attention from hydrologists than from social scientists leading outlets for socio hydrology are hydrology and earth system sciences water resources research and iahs publications table 2 2 2 mapping collaborative networks in socio hydrology in this section we use co authorships to map the structure of the existing scholarly networks and examine the status of interdisciplinary development in the socio hydrological field we collected co authorships from the bibliographic records of 101 targeted papers on socio hydrology the co authorship network describes scientific collaboration through publications where nodes the points in the network denote authors and an edge or line which links two nodes represents two authors who have co authored one or more publications a co authorship network is an undirected network which is built by the matrix product m aa where a and its transpose a is a n p matrix with generic elements a ij i n j p n and p is the set of n authors and p publications respectively it is assumed that a ij is equal to 1 if the ith author also wrote the jth publication and 0 otherwise therefore the matrix m is the valued n n undirected adjacency matrix g in which generic element g ik is greater than 0 if authors i and k i k n have written at least one publication together in the set p a value of g ik equals to 0 means that two authors ith and kth have never co authored the width of an edge represents the number of shared publications between the linked nodes the co authorship network contained 238 authors nodes with 1870 co authorships edges among 101 publications for a better illustration the authors were clustered into groups according to the k core partition approach embedded in pajek de nooy et al 2011 i e the degree of nodes in the network and visualized by vosviewer van eck and waltman 2010 fig 2 the degree of a node is equal to the number of its neighbors which means that a k core contains the nodes that have at least k neighbors within the group in fig 2 the size of nodes depicts the total number of publications while the width of edges represents the closeness of authors that is the bigger the node the more publications the author has published and the wider the edge the closer are the collaborations between them a growing number of researchers are involved in the socio hydrology network the co authorship network is dominated by those nodes that are linked by edges valued 1 1741 out of 1870 edges in other words most authors have only co authored once with one another person in the network according to the k core partition method explained above current co author relationships are clustered into sixteen groups illustrated by different colors in the network the widest collaborations stretch out to the nodes in cameo pink where the authors also possess the most publications in the field following this are nodes in celadon green aqua green and yellow other wide collaborations stem from papers in which a large group of authors are included especially the papers from the international association of hydrological sciences iahs programs such as panta rhei 2013 2015 global perspectives on hydrology society and change mcmillan et al 2016 savenije et al 2014 observed that integrated water resource management iwrm is inherently a social process in addition to being an interdependent physical system linking hydrology and society thus it requires an interdisciplinary perspective that combines insights from hydrologists and water engineers with knowledge about social and economic systems and public policy seidl and barthel 2017 investigated the integration of social scientists into socio hydrological research through a questionnaire survey with hydrological scientists and professionals and an analysis of disciplinary backgrounds of authors of socio hydrological research papers they found that the integration of social scientists is on a promising track but collaboration is at a preliminary stage more specifically they found that a sizable majority of respondents who referenced sivapalan et al 2012 32 of 43 were led by natural science teams and only two were dominated by social scientists eight had balanced research teams and two were unclear while socio hydrology has produced more collaborations than hydrology as a whole hydrologists come into the collaboration with differing expectations from social scientists survey respondents saw the role of social science in socio hydrological collaborations as 1 integrated collaboration where projects are co designed and knowledge is exchanged 2 classic social science research involving process reflection and moderation and 3 transfer of scientific knowledge and results to the public and water stakeholders hydrologists in the survey believed that they had equal responsibility for communicating results of their work and securing public acceptance and that social scientists are more responsible for the social and economic parts of the analysis the authors posit that hydrologists prefer to learn the important human drivers of water system change so that they can integrate them into their own research to determine the composition of disciplinary perspectives of the authors in our study we classified the network of authors into twelve groups according to disciplinary training and background based on website profiles the multidisciplinary group included those authors who have multiple disciplinary background training and research interests for example it would include individuals who have degrees in multiple areas for example engineering environmental economics and natural resources management we assumed that authors whose information was unavailable online are not currently active in research we visualized the disciplinary composition of authors using a network of co authorships in the 101 articles fig 3 the social science category consisted of representatives from anthropology and humanities governance politics and policy studies psychological and behavioral sciences and business and economics these fields deal with the social activities related to water management markets and governance human and physical geographers were combined into a single category because geographers often integrate physical and human processes in the study of water systems hydrologists n 101 dominate the core of the socio hydrology network meteorologists and climatologists are loosely linked to the field accounting for 1 7 of all authors 4 out of 238 in the network the number of researchers from the social sciences is relatively small at 33 including representatives from governance politics and policy analysis n 14 economics and business n 11 and anthropology and humanities n 8 human geographers n 13 also bring a long tradition of social science participation into water science in addition to longstanding interests in synthesizing human environment relationships besides the multidisciplinary group n 13 plays an important role in interdisciplinary collaborations due to their multidisciplinary training which enables them easier to communicate with other disciplines socio hydrology may not be new to them but rather a perspective on water that comes naturally given varied educational backgrounds and professional experiences in a recent retrospective paper sivapalan 2018 reemphasizes the need for socio hydrological research but places it more in the domain of quantitative hydrology than in the social sciences li et al 2018 demonstrate that socio hydrology has to be an interdisciplinary science which offers opportunity for social sciences to reinforce a quantitative interdisciplinary domain given the unequally involved disciplinary status of socio hydrology we suggest in the following section a broader definition for socio hydrology and its research agenda that will attract more social scientists to the field 3 reframing socio hydrology we conclude from the bibliographic analysis that socio hydrology is a small but growing field that is intellectually concentrated in the discipline of hydrology and hydrological journals with modest participation from social scientists the field can expand by 1 attracting more interest from environmental social scientists in system dynamics modeling 2 challenging more hydrologists to incorporate human variables into existing system dynamics models or 3 broadening the field to include topics that are more inherently interesting to social scientists 3 1 attracting more interest from environmental social scientists in system dynamics anthropogenic effects on hydrological systems are ubiquitous and include short as well as long term impacts across multiple spatial scales wheater and gober 2015 so that for example large scale hydrological models are currently faced with major challenges in the representation of human controls on water management wada et al 2017 nazemi and wheater 2015a and b humans affect water systems in a variety of ways including obvious variables such as population growth land use change levels of development and urbanization in addition to more difficult to measure aspects of human attitudes and values and governance strategies whether water is a common pool resource or a market good are also factors into water system behavior for example a major current issue in western canadian water policy involves wetland drainage in the face of downstream flooding of landowners and watersheds prairie farmers in western canada have drained agricultural land to increase efficiency and land available for planting crops recent evidence indicates that this has increased the incidence and magnitude of downstream flooding dumanski et al 2015 flooding is now a major issue on the public agenda as water security stakeholders weigh trade offs between maximizing productive capacity and environmental protection and flood control of downstream watersheds gober 2018 policy variables include the historical date of drainage licenses the amount of land approved for drainage and impacts on downstream flooding policy decisions affect hydrological function that in turn influences future policy choices the long term evolution of hydrological systems must consider interactions and feedbacks among the human and natural components di baldassarre et al 2015 implemented socio hydrology as a flood risk problem using the concept of social memory as a vehicle to link human perceptions to flood damage they used this idea to model effects of flood damages in green versus technological societies their model produced findings that reinforced the levee effect the idea that investment in flood mitigation infrastructure reduces the perception of risk and decreases vulnerability to low impact events but increases vulnerability to high impact extreme events burton and cutter 2008 montz and tobin 2008 the idea that socio hydrology seeks to understand the co evolution of human and water systems assumes that there is a two way connection between these two systems troy et al 2015 in empirical studies however there is enormous variation in the strength of relationships the time scales to which they are relevant and the directness of the coupling feedbacks identified in previous research involve human perceptions of local water quality relationships between ecosystem services and water quality and effects of flood protection decisions on flood damage in methodological terms social scientists may be more comfortable working in historical and ethnographic interpretation than in the quantitative complex system modeling that drives the current socio hydrology paradigm many have also embraced the role of participant observation where the researchers are participants in the social process of policy making a position that would violate positivist norms of standing outside of the research problem to maintain scientific objectivity 3 2 challenging more hydrologists to incorporate human variables into existing system dynamics models while hydrologists are the backbone of socio hydrology as currently practiced they are not trained in public policy economic analysis ethnographic research or social network analysis seidl and barthel 2017 note that interdisciplinary research is often not as interdisciplinary as it seems interdisciplinary research has been most successful across closely aligned fields in contrast to multidisciplinary work joint research on common problems from different disciplinary perspectives truly interdisciplinary research involves researchers from different disciplines working jointly on common problems they conducted a survey to elicit what hydrologists expect from social science in collaborative research three roles emerged 1 integrated collaboration 2 classic social science analysis and 3 translation and communications of research knowledge when confronted with a range of ideas about who should do what in socio hydrological research they found that hydrologists themselves should consider and integrate socioeconomic aspects in their own work is cited as the most preferable option in other words they want to learn social science research ideas to better integrate societal variables into their own research 3 3 broadening the field to include topics that are more inherently interesting to social scientists a broader more interdisciplinary perspective may be the most appropriate strategy for integrating new ideas and methods into socio hydrology hydrologists agreed in seidl and barthel s 2017 survey that hydrologists and social scientists are equally responsible for knowledge mobilization socio hydrology should include the social processes through which scientific knowledge is shared with decision makers and used for decision making gober and wheater 2014 socio hydrologists can play a crucial role as partners in water governance across a range of scales international national regional and local decision making knowledge translation is grist for social science research in addition to being a mechanism to make socio hydrology relevant to decision makers and society ideas from knowledge mobilization and scientific communication have demonstrated that the usability of scientific knowledge is a function of both the scientific results themselves as well as the social context in which that knowledge produced potential remedies to problems of poor science communication involve having users at the discussion table to frame the problem initially dilling and lemos 2011 drew attention to the importance of two way iterative engagement between knowledge producers and users to build trust and better understand the needs of policy making to facilitate the two way communication and nurture interdisciplinarity of socio hydrology more broad topics which help understand social processes and their interactions with hydrological processes should be introduced to future research 4 promising topics to include social science to socio hydrology barriers for the integration of social and hydrological sciences are several but are common to all attempts to meld different disciplines in a common purpose one is the difficulty in unifying different languages between hydrology and social sciences or the natural and social sciences in general second is the need to frame a common agenda hydrologists coined the term socio hydrology and posed a set of research questions with the mission of embracing social sciences within hydrology sivapalan et al 2012 however these research questions and missions do not appear to have attracted major interest from many social scientists our bibliometric analysis has demonstrated that socio hydrology has developed well in the past five years but accounts for no more than 4 of the larger society and water field fig 1 however wider collaborative opportunities could be developed between hydrologists and social scientists through introducing some popular themes into the research investigating other interdisciplinary research fields one can find that the highly cited literature has either focused on a broad research theme or included a wider disciplinary collaboration examples include coupled human and natural systems research liu et al 2007 human environmental systems turner et al 2003 and social ecological systems ostrom 2009 social scientists have made significant contributions to interdisciplinary research programs in natural hazards and disasters sustainability resilience adaptation and knowledge mobilization brown and westaway 2011 adger et al 2005 ostrom 2009 edelenbos et al 2011 incorporating these themes as linkage points between the socio and hydrology portions of the field holds potential for more interdisciplinary collaboration and enhanced growth and societal significant for socio hydrology these broader themes may include sustainability ostrom 2009 vulnerability and resilience walker et al 2004 eakin and luers 2006 adaptation and governance folke et al 2005 and hazards cutter et al 2008 in the following we propose three general and inter related research themes that a benefit socio hydrology b are of considerable interest to social scientists and c have potential to foster interdisciplinary development of socio hydrology 4 1 systemic risks and natural hazards water systems threatened by climate and other environmental change include increased risks to human and natural systems brought about by human activities streamflow regime change in the north american prairies given in the last section is just one of many evident examples natural hazards such as floods droughts fire disease outbreaks and tornados occur ordinarily in many parts of globe wisner et al 2004 these challenges call for research on the two way feedbacks as posed by socio hydrology but more important questions are how such research will inform effective adaptation to change and how they are suitably evaluated birkmann 2011 one promising subtopic of risks and hazards is a focus on system resilience resilience has become a popular interdisciplinary tool to address these uncertain changes and disturbances and has become a renewed adaptive approach for the anthropocene xu et al 2015 it emphasizes nonlinear and long term views of slowly responding variables that may drive systems towards tipping points biggs et al 2009 folke et al 2010 these nonlinear relationships have been found in many coupled human and water systems such as water quality and landscape due to urbanization li et al 2016a the co evolutionary thinking of social ecological resilience links system states to the existence of thresholds uncertainties and dynamic feedbacks between systems across temporal and spatial scales socio hydrological models and system dynamics highlight features such as those embraced in resilience theory blair and buytaert 2016 for complex socio hydrological systems the need to identify how human society co evolves with hydrology and to address human adaptation to the changing hydrologic conditions under the variability of climate requires knowledge contributions from different disciplines in their recent review blair and buytaert 2016 suggested that socio hydrological modeling makes efforts to investigate interactions between hydrological and socioeconomic systems that could cause long term impacts to determine system vulnerability and signals for critical transitions of system states the recent studies of mao et al 2017 and yu et al 2017 provide conceptual and quantitative breakthroughs to take resilience thinking into socio hydrological research although a wide range of questions still remain to be addressed mutual interest could be established through topics with regard to the interdependencies and feedbacks in complex and dynamic systems critical thresholds and tipping points lags and legacies and trade offs and unintended consequences specific research questions may include how to create early warning signals of regime shifts of hydrological systems whether cascading effects exist in socio hydrological systems namely if hydrologic regime shifts would give rise to changes in regimes of the connected social systems and how to detect connections between systems and the potential cascading consequences a feature of resilience that could draw more attention from social scientists is its capacity to embrace social adaptations into hydrological contexts xu and kajikawa 2018 for example one can explore adaptive cycles in socio hydrological systems by looking at adaptation of individuals and communities in response to hydrological alterations on a long term time scale and across various space and jurisdictional scales natural hazards are by definition extreme events that occur naturally and disrupt the normal functioning of society and economy causing harms to humans white 1974 the early study of hazards emphasized their biophysical dimensions such as return periods intensity and spatial extent gober 2018 in the 1970s and 1980s political ecologists drew attention to the societal factors that put people in unsafe places limit support for them and undermine their ability to cope wisner et al 2004 interest in floods and drought can incorporate not only social memory human perceptions and values but also a range of ideas such as social learning social resilience collective action adaptive governance public policies ecological knowledge and knowledge translation into complex system dynamics modeling 4 2 sustainability science sustainability science has attracted social and biophysical scientists to think together in deep and meaningful ways about the nature of human natural coupled systems kajikawa et al 2014 larson et al 2015 complexities inherent in human environment systems present uncertainties and challenges for decision making the core ideas of sustainability science system dynamics scalar interdependencies uncertainty management robust decision making and stakeholder engagement are highly compatible to socio hydrology and are ideas that attract both social and natural scientists a possible way to link socio hydrology to sustainability science is to conduct scenario development with engagement of stakeholders scenario analysis is a planning methodology which incorporates quantitative modeling and or qualitative narrative information to generate possible futures for decision makings it offers conservation practitioners a method to couple local and global conditions and to build a group of plausible futures for developing more sustainable strategies and policies swart et al 2004 it also provides opportunities for communication to improve public appreciation of science and natural resources robinson et al 2011 scenario planning is a promising area for socio hydrological research due to the fact that it is able to include a set of possible and important uncertainties in the system rather than relying on accurate prediction of a single outcome peterson et al 2003 in that sense scenarios can be powerful tools to replace more traditional methods based on optimization and to introduce concepts such as resilience in future planning current socio hydrological models have successfully reconstructed the long term patterns of the human water relations lu et al 2015 but are still some way away from reliable prediction of the future over long time frames as the most uncertain elements often result from human activities and are hard to be fully understood with the knowledge and data we possess scenario development can be useful to identify decisions to balance trade offs between human and environmental water uses and to accommodate uncertain potential futures human water systems involve a wide range of trade offs which may occur between different water users for example agricultural drainage in canadian prairies increases food production of farmers however it leads to reduction of natural capital stocks such as the loss of wetlands and habitat for waterfowls decrease of ecosystem services including pollutant retention and carbon sequestration and increase in flood risk downstream these losses of ecosystem services must be deducted from the benefits that have been given developing scenarios of possible drainage intensity into socio hydrological models will help identify trade offs between the use of water for agricultural production and the use for ecosystems a possible way to evaluate such trade offs is to conduct ecosystem services based economic valuations costanza et al 1997 2014 that link value changes in landscape and ecosystem services to changes in hydrology ecosystem goods and services provide a broader conceptual framework for the alteration of hydrology thus water use in the present will change capital stocks in social ecological systems which may change the future value of water to support ecosystem services scenario development can be focused on for example identifying proper discount rate and accounting prices for estimating change in ecological capital for the change in net present values of services generated by that capital 4 3 adaptive governance adaptation to climate change has also led to new collaborations between social and natural scientists adaptation increasingly calls for building more resilience into both human and natural systems ipcc 2014 interest in adaptive governance comes from a variety of disciplines including ecology and environmental management folke et al 2005 liu et al 2007 pahl wostl et al 2010 stein et al 2013 landscape and urban planning hamin and gurran 2009 quay 2010 li et al 2016b and the policy sciences huitema and meijerink 2010 brunner 2010 adaptation research relies heavily on the concept of resilience defined as the extent to which a system can absorb recurrent natural and human perturbations and continue to regenerate without slowly degrading or even unexpectedly flipping into less desirable states folke et al 2005 p 442 443 a resilient social ecological system has the potential to cope with negative environmental changes without flipping into a different configuration which may be undesirable it can thus provide decision makers with tools and an integrative framework to plan adaptive strategies li et al 2014 xu and kajikawa 2018 in a recent article in ecology and society abel et al 2016 argued that the interactive dynamics of the murray darling basin in australia require new pathways for transformation that recognizes not only system dynamics but also diverse decision makers and rules high levels of uncertainty generated by stakeholders values understanding of climate change and acceptable ways of adapting 5 conclusions socio hydrology research has opened up a new way of dynamic thinking about humans and water which has further extended research of human water interactions to a domain that views people and their behaviors as endogenous and co evolving components in water cycle dynamics however this research field is still at an exploratory stage and better understanding of the interactions between the two systems is needed in both depth and scope requiring wide interdisciplinary collaboration in this paper we first showed the trends and status of interdisciplinary development in socio hydrology based on quantitative bibliometric analysis qualitative analysis of the literature was then conducted to explore ways that can be used to nurture interdisciplinary development of the field although there is raised awareness of the need to enhance collaboration between social and natural scientists to improve understanding of complex and dynamic water systems results of our empirical analysis demonstrate that the domain is still mainly populated by hydrologists with limited and arguably insufficient contribution from social scientists in previous socio hydrological studies hydrologists attempted to incorporate human and societal variables in quantitative models yet few social scientists have actively become involved in the field to investigate human water dynamics from their own perspectives we note that social scientists have not been particularly active in this research domain probably because of its underlying focus on hydrological processes which creates barriers for the communication between hydrologists and social scientists specifically the use of different language in hydrology and social sciences has led to their different emphasis on the two way dynamic feedbacks of human water systems hydrologists emphasize the importance of using mathematical models to quantitatively describe such dynamic feedbacks while social scientists highlight the role of social processes structures and governance in decision making accompanied by a need for knowledge translation to the decision makers and end users we believe that if the research question had been posed to favor human system dynamics including governance markets behaviors local knowledge policy and legal frameworks the composition of socio hydrology would be expected to be different to promote interdisciplinary collaboration we suggest that the field of socio hydrology be reframed to a attract more interest from social scientists in system dynamics modeling b challenge more hydrologists to incorporate human variables into existing system dynamics models and c broaden the field to include topics which are inherently interesting to social scientists future collaborative areas could be focused on three general research themes associated with a systemic risks and natural hazards b linkages to sustainability science and c adaptive governance this reflects a broader perspective of socio hydrology than many previous papers have considered but we feel that these research themes offer real promise for the involvement of social scientists for the development of enhanced understanding of and predictive capability for human water systems

7128,a colorimetric method based on the development of the yellow potassium iodoantimonite complex previously developed for biological matrices was applied to successfully quantify total sb in contaminated waters that were collected from an sb mineralised zone in nsw australia the method showed good repeatability and little interference from co occurring ions such as as iii ca2 fe iii and so4 2 field testing demonstrated good precisions and recoveries making the method truly quantitative under the given conditions the method s detection limit and limit of reporting 0 6 µg ml 1 made it applicable in areas of high sb concentration and for rapid response to sb contamination preliminary investigations into extending the method to rapid sb speciation screening was trialled using anionic spe columns that retained sb v and excluded sb iii in isolation and in combined solutions antimony v retention was compromised in the presence of ions such as ca2 and so4 2 spiked at realistic field concentrations despite this the coupling of the colorimetric determination with the anionic columns showed no gross interferences during field trialling and the columns showed potential for rapid screening of sb species as well as rapid preconcentration of sb from water samples the latter process lowered the effective detection limit of the colorimetric method almost 10 fold both the colorimetric method and the combination of this with rapid speciation techniques show great potential for expanding rapid sb analysis capability applicable especially for screening water samples with known or suspected sb content keywords antimony colorimetric method speciation anion columns 1 introduction global production of antimony sb from mining has been increasing in recent years given its numerous industrial uses including as a fire retardant semi conductor and even as a medical agent wilson et al 2010 this group 15 element predominantly occurs as 3 iii or 5 v species in the environment there is no known human requirement for antimony which has carcinogenic potential and is known to be clastogenic in its 3 form denys et al 2008 filella et al 2002a obiakor et al 2017a wilson et al 2010 antimony is analytically problematic many laboratory techniques are used for total sb and its speciation analysis including hplc icpms icp oes hplc hgaas and electrochemical methods such as differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry nash et al 2000 quentel and filella 2002 smichowski et al 1998 telford et al 2009 these are often expensive time consuming and may be quite complex this can cause problems in situations such as environmental monitoring and spill response vanhoof et al 2013 or in remote areas where the more typical laboratory analyses of sb are not feasible in particular the ability to both rapidly detect sb in environmental waters and to have some preliminary indication of species present would reduce research and monitoring costs and increase response times while supplementing the environmental information available for this metalloid colorimetric methods exist for sb determination in practical terms they range from simple with 1 or two reagents and analytical steps to complex with up to a dozen reagents or analytical steps and exhibit a range of actual and potential detection limits from ng ml 1 to µg ml 1 christopher and west 1966 fauchon 1937 fredrick 1941 matulis and guyon 1965 mcchesney 1946 rath et al 1997 tripathi and patel 1998 thus while colorimetric approaches have played a very minor role in the analysis and research of sb in the environment careful selection adaption and trialling of a colorimetric method is required to provide the desired ability to rapidly cheaply and accurately detect sb under a set of given field conditions in natural waters sb predominantly exists in inorganic form the sb iii species is generally considered to be up to 10 times more toxic than sb v luo et al 2015 smichowski et al 1998 but this statement remains contentious macphee and ruelle 1969 obiakor et al 2017b quiroz et al 2013 takayanagi 2001 which illustrates the dearth of information on the behaviour of this metalloid the sb species present depends on a number of factors including ph redox and co occurring oxidants reductants within a system co occurring ions particularly aqueous species of mn al fe and ca have been shown to influence the mobility and solubility of sb within the soil water system by oxidising reducing adsorbed or precipitated sb species johnson et al 2005 wan et al 2013a wan et al 2013b thus while sb v is typically dominant often even under reducing conditions mitsunobu et al 2006 it is difficult to simply infer speciation from environmental conditions field based speciation methods have been developed that have been shown to accurately represent the species ratio of elements such as arsenic as present at the time of sampling watts et al 2010 the application of such a technique to sb has not been published but coupled with a rapid colorimetric approach to sb quantification should provide an important move forward in sb determination for both research and monitoring the aim of this study was firstly to assess a simple colorimetric method based on the development of the yellow potassium iodoantimonite ksbi4 complex in the presence of sb fauchon 1937 mcchesney 1946 for the rapid quantification of total sb in waters with highly variable sb concentrations up to 25 μg ml 1 secondly this study aimed to combine this colorimetric method with a field speciation technique to provide a rapid indication of sb speciation 2 materials and methods experimental procedures were undertaken in two sequences firstly the colorimetric method was assessed in terms of linearity recoveries effects of co occurring ions and field application secondly the method was coupled with an anionic spe column for sb speciation screening and sb preconcentration 2 1 general colorimetric procedure a summary of the general colorimetric procedure used throughout this work follows the potassium iodide ki reagent was made by dissolving 5 g of crystalline ascorbic acid and 28 g of potassium iodide in 250 ml of deionised water for a final concentration of 11 2 w w as used by mcchesney 1946 adapted from fauchon 1937 the ki reagent was stable for 1 month and was used within that timeframe concentrated h2so4 0 5 ml was added to 2 5 ml of each standard solution and sample to be analysed producing a final acid concentration of 9 09 this was followed by 2 5 ml of the ki reagent after five minutes to allow full colour development each sample was read at 425 nm in a spectro biochrom libra s11 spectrophotometer cell length 1 cm colour development using this method is stable for 48 h as determined by mcchesney 1946 the inclusion of ascorbic acid was found to be essential for colour stabilisation the yellow colour developed in this method is indicative of the potassium iodoantimonite ksbi4 complex all reagents were analytical grade purity deionised water tka micropure germany was used throughout the experimental procedure all sb standard solutions and reagents were prepared the day of analysis or the day prior to analysis with the exception of ki reagent antimony v and iii standards were prepared from ksb oh 6 sigma aldrich usa and ksbc4h4o6 ajax chemicals australia respectively using final concentration ranges as referenced in the following sections all analytical runs included an initial and final calibration curve a drift sample and blank samples approximately every ten samples 2 2 initial method assessment the initial assessments of the colorimetric method focused on linearity of calibration curves differences in repeatability of sb iii and sb v as standard solutions method detection limits and sb recovery and precision linearity was checked using a high range calibration set 0 25 µg ml 1 of sb v and a low range set 0 2 5 µg ml 1 of sb v each sb standard solution was measured in duplicate to determine the repeatability of the analytical reads for different sb species calibration curves were generated from solutions of 0 5 µg ml 1 sb iii and sb v these solutions were measured in triplicate the method detection limit mdl was calculated from seven replicate analyses of the mid range standard using the high and low sb v calibration solutions nepc 2013 the mdl was also calculated using the same approach with 0 5 µg ml 1 sb for both sb iii and sb v solutions as part of the sb iii and sb v repeatability assessment the limit of reporting lr was established at 5 times the mdl nepc 2013 analytical precision was measured by the relative standard deviation rsd which was considered acceptable when less than 10 recoveries were calculated for each mdl analysis based on the spiked value and a baseline analytical instrumental uncertainty was calculated using the instrumental limit of uncertainty and standard error propagation methods as per skoog et al 2014 and expressed as a uncertainty relative to a 0 5 µg ml 1 spike of sb 2 3 influence of co occurring ions on sb quantification the effect of co occurring ions on the determination of sb at 0 5 µg ml 1 of sb v was tested for al 0 5 μg ml 1 as 2 5 μg ml 1 ca 500 μg ml 1 fe 0 1 μg ml 1 mn 2 5 μg ml 1 and s 550 μg ml 1 concentrations of these co occurring ions were selected based on previous values obtained from adit waters for the bracken resources pty ltd hillgrove antimony gold mine 30 34 s 151 54 e approximately 25 km east of armidale new south wales australia to represent median to high yet realistic values picone 2011 all co occurring ion solutions were made from commercially provided standards australian chemical reagents moorooka qld aluminium fe and mn standard solutions were made from the respective metals assumed to be present as al3 fe3 and mn2 respectively in solution the as iii standard was made from as2o3 the s and ca standards were made from nh4 2so4 and caco3 respectively and can be assumed to be so4 2 and ca2 in solution all standards used high purity source materials and were provided in a 2 nitric acid background solution and while assumed to be present initially in the above ionic forms will be referred to using elemental symbols hereafter given the reducing nature of the colorimetric method tests were undertaken with each single ion and on 4 combinations of ions using the concentrations above the first combination of ions contained as fe mn s al ca and s the second mix contained as s ca the third contained as and ca while the fourth contained as and s each test was replicated 6 times and values were determined as recoveries of sb 2 4 field testing of the colorimetric procedure field testing of the colorimetric procedure was undertaken on samples from five old and current mine adits sites a b c d and e at the bracken resources pty ltd hillgrove antimony gold mine the hillgrove mineral field is variably comprised of current and historic mine workings associated with stibnite quartz veins breccias in metasedimentary and granite rocks the area consists of gorges and plateaus with local relief of up to 300 m from ore processing areas to the valley floors the mineral field has an intermittent mining and environmental degradation history spanning back to the late 1800s with several water seepages within the mine lease area containing low to very high concentrations of sb up to 50 μg ml 1 sb has been recorded further details on the history and environmental context of the hillgrove mine and associated historic mine workings can be found in ashley et al ashley et al 2006 ashley et al 2007 at each site approximately 1 l of water was sampled using a 1 l acid washed teflon bottle following standard field sampling protocols standards australia 2005 samples were collected in triplicate at each site and were filtered through a pre washed 0 45 µm membrane using a nalgene hand pumped water filter apparatus approximately 50 ml of filtrate was collected for each sample and stored in acid washed containers at 5 c rinsate and field blanks were collected at each site water samples were returned to room temperature and analysed within 2 h of field sampling using the general colorimetric procedure blank samples and a 10 µg ml 1 sb v drift sample were included every 10 samples all analytical values were corrected using the field rinsate blank absorbance values for each site all samples were split prior to analysis with half of each sample being acidified with nitric acid transported and analysed for sb via icp ms at a nata accredited commercial laboratory australian laboratory services brisbane 2 5 general procedure for anionic column use anionic spe columns grace pure spe anion x 500 mg 3 ml were used in the speciation and preconcentration trials columns were prewashed with 5 ml of deionised water with 5 ml of sample subsequently passed through the column similar to the approach of watts et al watts et al 2010 the flow rate used in trials was approximately 2 ml min 1 to elute the columns following sample pass through 5 ml of 2 m h2so4 was passed through the columns at a flow rate of 2 ml min 1 with the eluent collected for sb determination both eluent and aliquots of sample following pass through were analysed using the colorimetric method procedure described above several investigations were undertaken to determine the feasibility and efficacy of using the columns to separate sb v and sb iii species in water samples as well as using the columns to preconcentrate low concentrations of sb prior to colorimetric analysis 2 6 column capacity and specificity for sb v to test the capacity of an anionic spe column to retain sb v 10 ml of 1 µg ml 1 sb v solution was passed through a column for a total of 10 µg sb v loaded the filtrate was collected and analysed for sb using the colorimetric procedure this process was repeated in increments of 10 ml until a total of 300 µg sb v was passed through the same column with each filtrate increment analysed in 10 ml volumes to determine the efficacy of the column in not absorbing sb iii the same process as above was undertaken using an sb iii solution until a total of 50 μg of sb iii had been passed through the column both the sb v and sb iii tests included duplicate blanks and duplicate analysis of control samples 1 µg ml 1 sb analysed without filtering following the individual tests of sb v and sb iii retention the capacity of the anionic spe columns to simultaneously retain sb v and exclude sb iii was tested using two different ratios of sb iii sb v the ratios tested were 1 µg ml 1 sb iii to 5 µg ml 1 sb v referred to as 1 5 and 1 µg ml 1 sb iii to 10 µg ml 1 sb v referred to as 1 10 columns were loaded in triplicate with 5 ml of solution for the ratios 1 5 and 1 10 this gave total loadings of 15 µg sb v for the ratio 1 5 and 30 µg sb v for the ratio 1 10 on each column the ratios tested were representative of those typically found in natural waters mitsunobu et al 2006 picone 2011 ritchie et al 2013 each test was duplicated the sb concentration of the filtrate was tested using the colorimetric method with the inclusion of a control sample at 1 µg ml 1 sb iii and blanks every 10 samples 2 7 influence of as v ca and s on the column capacity to retain sb v species to determine the ability of the columns to retain sb v in the presence of other ions combined solutions of sb v with as v ca and s were passed through the anion columns with the filtrate analysed colorimetrically for sb as described above concentrations of as ca and s were selected as being similar to the highest values of the three ions found in surface waters around the hillgrove mineralised zone picone 2011 the effect of as v on sb v was tested at 3 ratios of sb to as 5 5 5 0 05 and 20 1 5 μg ml 1 two controls of sb v only were also used of 5 and 20 μg ml 1 each column was loaded with 5 ml of combined solution 4 times resulting in a total volume of 20 ml being passed through each column and then tested as one combined filtrate each test was replicated 4 times the effect of ca on sb v retention was tested at 5 500 and 0 5 500 sb ca μg ml 1 while the effect of s was tested at 5 550 and 0 5 550 sb s μg ml 1 each column was loaded with 5 ml of combined solution 3 times in succession with the filtrate of each 5 ml tested separately to determine the effect of increased loading on each column two controls of 5 and 0 5 μg ml 1 sb were also tested in the same fashion in addition 5 ml aliquots of each ratio of sb ca and sb s were passed through 3 separate columns to determine the repeatability of the sb retention at each ratio 2 8 field testing of anionic columns a pilot field assessment was undertaken to i determine whether the anionic spe columns could potentially separate sb species in field waters in conjunction with the colorimetric method described and ii determine the feasibility of using the columns to preconcentrate sb to improve the detection limit of the colorimetric method the trial was undertaken using waters from bracken resources pty ltd hillgrove antimony gold mine lease area samples were collected from one mine adit for speciation assessment site a and one creek site for preconcentration assessment site b sampling and column use was undertaken as described previously with the only modification being that 250 ml of sample was initially filtered through a 0 45 µm filter prior to analysis approximately 50 ml of the filtrate from each sample was subsampled for colorimetric determination of total sb for the speciation assessment site a 5 ml of the filtered sample was loaded onto an anionic spe column with the filtrate collected into an appropriately labelled and acid washed container for analysis this process was repeated for each sample and for a field rinsate blank for the preconcentration assessment site b 30 ml aliquots triplicate and 50 ml aliquots duplicate were loaded onto separate anionic columns in the field with the filtrate from each aliquot collected for subsequent analysis aliquots and columns were then stored on ice and transported to the laboratory no preservation agents were added to any sample samples were allowed to return to room temperature and were analysed within 2 h of sample collection all water samples for total sb speciation of sb site a and preconcentration site b were tested using the colorimetric procedure as described blanks field total field filtrate and eluted solution blanks were analysed with the relevant blank matched and subtracted from each aliquot result 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial method assessment all calibration curves had a linear response r2 0 99 between concentration and absorbance readings for both low and high range sb fig 1 and for both sb iii and sb v based solutions there was good agreement between calibration curves developed using sb v or sb iii as well as linearity over a wide concentration range figs 1 and 2 as per the initial method mcchesney 1946 this indicates the colour development approximates what would be expected via beer s law across a wide range of concentrations and that sb v was quantitatively reduced to sb iii in the method this is as expected due to the acidic ph and high concentration of iodide in the method which also allowed the formation of the iodoantimonite complex colour development in low range solutions was low with precisions constrained by the precision of the equipment standard deviations of duplicate reads equalled 0 0007 absorbance units this corresponded to a 0 001 change in absorbance units between duplicates which was the limit of the equipment used this equated to rsds at all non zero calibration points of 3 6 and for subsequent spiking experiments resulted in a conservative instrumental analytical rsd of 10 on a 0 5 µg ml 1 spike following standard instrumental error propagation as per skoog et al 2014 high range sb samples produced strong colour development and variation between duplicate reads were similar to low range absorbance readings this equated to rsds at all non zero calibration points of 1 4 it was apparent that lower sb concentrations particularly 1 μg ml 1 only induced weak colour development of the potassium iodoantimonite complex the small decrease in analytical precision at lower sb concentrations was due to limits of precision of the equipment rather than any absolute increase in variation in the raw absorbance units being recorded the high range calibration had a mdl of 0 297 µg ml 1 sb while low range samples had a mdl of 0 113 µg ml 1 sb table 1 the latter mdl was similar to the previously published rhodamine b mdl of 0 1 µg ml 1 maren 1947 and much lower than the original 1 0 μg ml 1 determined by mcchesney 1946 who originally stated the sensitivity of the colorimetric method may be improved with the advent of more advanced analytical instruments and this appears to be the case compared with other spectrophotometric methods for determining sb the reported mdls in this study are more typical while one method has produced an mdl of 3 ng ml 1 tripathi and patel 1998 other methods range from 0 43 μg ml 1 down to 0 02 μg ml 1 fredrick 1941 matulis and guyon 1965 rath et al 1997 the methods with lower detection limits typically require 3 to 9 chemical reagents and anywhere from 1 to 12 analytical steps including preconcentration chelation or phase extractions the ki method trialled here has two reagents ki and h2so4 and essentially one step the differences in detection limits between sb iii and sb v were notable table 1 but the recoveries of spiked sb were all similar and deemed acceptable the previous development and application of the ki method used potassium antimony tartrate as the standard solution mcchesney 1946 the presence of tartrate in sb iii stock may have interfered with the detection of sb compared with ksb oh 6 used in the sb v solutions a study by mehlig 1939 determined that tartrate affected colour development in the detection of manganese by decolourising the solution there are no studies examining the influence of tartrate on the colorimetric detection of sb but such an investigation appears to be warranted it is likely that the acidic nature of the method ph 2 means the tartrate present cannot inhibit the formation of the iodoantimonite complex while there has been some work on the general stability of sb iii tartrate complexes e g de la calle guntiñas et al 1992 confirmation of the species interactions or lack thereof at acidic ph should be experimentally confirmed from a practical standpoint concentrations of sb 0 5 µg ml 1 produced weak colour development of the potassium iodoantimonite complex even a small variation in absorbance readings affected the estimated sb values at these low concentrations in reporting values in this work we use the mdl as the lower limit of detection but we have also calculated the lr for conservative consideration of this method for future routine environmental monitoring the lr was established at 5 times the mdl with a maximum lr of 1 5 µg ml 1 sb and a minimum lr of 0 57 µg ml 1 sb using the 0 297 and 0 113 µg ml 1 sb mdl s of the high and low range calibrations these values were deemed the lowest practical quantitation limits accounting for potential variability within the colorimetric method nepc 2013 in australia the anzecc armcanz guidelines for fresh and marine water quality are set at a low reliability value of 9 µg l 1 for sb ashley et al 2007 thus without a preconcentration step this colorimetric method is not sensitive enough to reliably detect low concentrations of sb 0 6 µg ml 1 sb in uncontaminated waters at sites such as the mineralised zone investigated in this study concentrations of sb have been detected at 50 µg ml 1 in the mine water seepages21 antimony concentrations ranging from 330 to 11400 µg l 1 sb have been determined in waters from an sb mine and smelter in xikuangshan china liu et al 2010 and sb between 699 and 55000 µg l 1 measured in tailings surface waters and porewaters in kantishna hills district alaska ritchie et al 2013 thus the lr of this simple colorimetric procedure is low enough for analysis of highly contaminated samples including mine seepages tailings waters and the detection of spills related to mining activities as stated previously this method has the added advantage of not requiring numerous and sometimes unstable reagents or complicated processing steps mcchesney 1946 rath et al 1997 tripathi and patel 1998 3 2 influence of co occurring ions on sb quantification table 2 shows the influence of single and combination co occurring ions on the recovery of sb as sb v for all single ions except fe sb recoveries were within 80 to 120 table 2 aluminium spiked solutions produced a recovery of 92 3 with an rsd of the recovery value of 17 all other rsds were 11 which included a baseline instrument analytical error calculated from standard error propagation principles as 10 on a 0 5 µg ml 1 sb solution it is worth noting that while the rsd s of recoveries varied up to 17 this still equates to a small absolute absorbance unit change e g 0 001 0 004 between replicates and is partially an artefact of the high detection limits and relatively low sb spike concentration that is both analytical uncertainty and overall rsds may decrease by either decreasing instrumental uncertainty or increasing colour development such as via preconcentration iron increased sb measurements 122 indicating a small potential interference with the colour development at 0 1 μg ml 1 fe such a value of fe is considered high in the areas of neutral ph the values were based upon ashley et al 2007 picone 2011 but in other situations particularly more acidic environments high dissolved fe concentrations may interfere with the method this requires further investigation analysis with all combinations of ions spiked into solution produced recoveries of sb within 80 120 of expected values this included the solution with fe at 0 1 μg ml 1 this may indicate that any interference from fe in the method is reduced when the fe occurs in combination with other ions the mechanism explaining this phenomenon is unclear but there may be some form of competition in which fe interacts with the other ions present rather than the formation of the potassium iodoantimonite complex itself none of the blanks that included co occurring ions singly or in combination without sb produced elevated signals which indicated that no pure solution of individual or combined co occurring ion resulted in false positive colour development other sb colorimetric studies have reported some interferences from co occurring elements mcchesney s original work identified a gross interference of bismuth where sb recovery increased up to a factor of 2 5 with bi present mcchesney 1946 iron produced a 1 change in sb estimation in that work numerous other interferences have been reported for colorimetric methods but all appear specific to the method the indicator complex formed and the concentrations of sb and interferent in the mix christopher and west 1966 fredrick 1941 matulis and guyon 1965 from the little information available there does not appear to be a systematic set of interfering ions for sb colorimetric methods arsenic did not produce any detectable interferences in the method it is probable that as does form a similar iodide complex to sb but it does not have the same absorption wavelength site specific knowledge and some interference piloting would be required before application of any colorimetric method for sb in this work while a set of common co occurring elements were tested for interferences further work may be required depending on the environment the method may be deployed in in particular work on phosphate nitrate and dissolved organic substances may need specific investigation effects of chloride may need to be considered in saline environments in the presence of any detected interferences complexation or precipitation steps to remove interferences may be required harvey et al 1953 tripathi and patel 1998 3 3 field testing of the colorimetric procedure the field blank and field rinsate blank produced detectable interference in the colorimetric method equating to apparent sb of 0 226 µg ml 1 and 0 511 µg ml 1 respectively contamination from the filter apparatus was possible which may have included fibres from the 0 45 µm membrane or colloidal particles not otherwise removed this may have been exacerbated by the weak colour development at low sb concentrations noted earlier despite this there was good and strong linear agreement between the colorimetric determination of sb and the independent analysis table 3 site b had sb values below the determined mdl at the other sites the colorimetric method shows potential for field application with highly comparable quantification of total sb 80 88 to the icp ms analysis and generally high precision when values were above the mdl this field analysis confirmed the very limited potential interferences identified via pure solutions for this locality 3 4 spe column capacity and specificity for sb v passing up to 300 μg of sb v through an spe anionic column in 10 ml increments produced no detectable sb in any of the filtrate aliquots similarly sb iii up to 50 μg was not retained by the column with between 94 and 105 recovery of sb iii found in the column filtrates in a similar fashion passing aliquots of sb iii sb v solutions through the columns produced acceptable recoveries of sb iii in aliquots with no apparent loss of specificity of the columns for sb v table 4 there was a small but noticeable decrease in sb iii recovered in the first aliquot of filtrate passed through the column at both ratios of iii v examined while these values are still within the acceptable range of recovery one potential cause may be inadequate prewashing of columns in previous work lack of pre washing of columns was found to affect the retention of as watts et al 2010 3 5 influence of as v ca and s on the column capacity to retain sb v species there was no loss of retention of sb v with any of the combined as v sb v solutions passed through the columns thus with a maximum of 20 μg of as v and 20 μg sb v loaded onto a column no sb v was found in the filtrate in contrast the columns appeared to lose their ability to retain sb v when the solutions contained high yet realistic values of ca or s table 5 ashley et al 2007 picone 2011 the effect was small with 5 ml of solution passed through the column but between 75 and 102 of sb v was not retained after 15 ml of solution had been passed through the column the effect appeared highest at high concentrations of both sb and the competing ion but was very significant even at low 0 5 µg ml 1 concentrations of sb for s as so4 2 this may be due to the anionic binding sites being overloaded or possibly some complexation reaction between sb v and so4 2 that reduces the ability of the column to bind sb v as the so4 2 standard was made from nh4 2so4 it is possible that the addition of n and conversion to nitrate in the sample also contributed to the anionic binding sites being overloaded in the case of ca as ca2 it seems unlikely that a swamping of anionic binding sites is the cause of this loss of specificity of the column for sb v but some complexation between sb and ca2 filella et al 2002b filella and williams 2012 may be reducing the efficacy of the column as the ca2 standard included carbonate this may also have affected the anionic binding site capacity the interactions of background ions needs to be more fully investigated if this method is to move beyond a speciation screening approach 3 6 field testing of anionic columns despite the loss of sb v retention evidenced in lab solutions with ca or s the two field sites examined showed reasonable agreement between the total sb in water samples and the sum of the two species detected in filtrate and by eluting the sb retained on the column respectively table 6 site a with its higher total concentration produced a 91 8 recovery in particular without independent validation of species present in the samples the specificity of the column to retain sb v cannot be confirmed particularly in the presence of other ions that may alter the column s retention capability as indicated in the previous section this small amount of pilot work needs further expansion in conjunction with other sb species analysis but shows potential for rapid field screening for sb species site b produced variable results when 30 ml or 50 ml of sample was preconcentrated table 6 this equated to detected concentrations of 0 79 and 0 76 µg ml 1 sb v in this sample a preconcentration factor of approximately 8 which when applied to the method detection limit effectively reduces the limit from 0 113 to 0 014 µg ml 1 however the recoveries were noticeably different between the 30 and 50 ml sample 130 and 75 2 respectively this difference was due to variation in the concentrations of sb v detected as sb iii remained so low as to have very little influence on the total recovery calculation this is in contrast to the pure solutions with ca or s spiked because no large amounts of bleed through of sb v was evident when passing up to 50 ml of field sample through a column the differences in apparent concentration between 30 ml and 50 ml of sample preconcentrated and the previous potential issues raised in relation to potential column saturation or sb v complexation in waters indicates the spe approach to preconcentration for sb needs much more investigation nevertheless these initial results suggest that the application of spe columns or similar preconcentration techniques such as anion exchange resins or feo impregnated filter paper strips andersson et al 2015 chardon et al 1996 may dramatically improve the detection limits of the colorimetric method with minimal additional effort 4 conclusion using the conservative lr the adapted colorimetric method could successfully quantify total sb at concentrations 0 6 µg ml 1 sb in routine applications and could be confidently applied for highly contaminated water samples including the adit waters of a known mineralized zone that has a long history of active mining this method is applicable for low cost rapid monitoring of current and historic mine sites and as a first response to potential spills or compliance issues the potential for such a method is even higher when considered in conjunction with the advent of robust field portable spectrophotometers baker et al 2004 the method is robust to interferences although specific tests and checks are recommended based on site chemistry the use of anionic field columns such as the spe solid cartridge investigated here also shows potential for rapid speciation of sb however it is apparent that volumes filtered and the water chemistry of the sample itself play significant roles in the potential accuracy of such columns for sb speciation further testing is recommended in conjunction with independent speciation measurements for field samples the use of anionic columns or similar anionic absorption equipment appears promising for the rapid preconcentration of sb in samples thus extending the use of the colorimetric method examined here or similar methods into more dilute field samples acknowledgments this study was made possible by a university of new england seeding grant thanks are extended to

7128,a colorimetric method based on the development of the yellow potassium iodoantimonite complex previously developed for biological matrices was applied to successfully quantify total sb in contaminated waters that were collected from an sb mineralised zone in nsw australia the method showed good repeatability and little interference from co occurring ions such as as iii ca2 fe iii and so4 2 field testing demonstrated good precisions and recoveries making the method truly quantitative under the given conditions the method s detection limit and limit of reporting 0 6 µg ml 1 made it applicable in areas of high sb concentration and for rapid response to sb contamination preliminary investigations into extending the method to rapid sb speciation screening was trialled using anionic spe columns that retained sb v and excluded sb iii in isolation and in combined solutions antimony v retention was compromised in the presence of ions such as ca2 and so4 2 spiked at realistic field concentrations despite this the coupling of the colorimetric determination with the anionic columns showed no gross interferences during field trialling and the columns showed potential for rapid screening of sb species as well as rapid preconcentration of sb from water samples the latter process lowered the effective detection limit of the colorimetric method almost 10 fold both the colorimetric method and the combination of this with rapid speciation techniques show great potential for expanding rapid sb analysis capability applicable especially for screening water samples with known or suspected sb content keywords antimony colorimetric method speciation anion columns 1 introduction global production of antimony sb from mining has been increasing in recent years given its numerous industrial uses including as a fire retardant semi conductor and even as a medical agent wilson et al 2010 this group 15 element predominantly occurs as 3 iii or 5 v species in the environment there is no known human requirement for antimony which has carcinogenic potential and is known to be clastogenic in its 3 form denys et al 2008 filella et al 2002a obiakor et al 2017a wilson et al 2010 antimony is analytically problematic many laboratory techniques are used for total sb and its speciation analysis including hplc icpms icp oes hplc hgaas and electrochemical methods such as differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry nash et al 2000 quentel and filella 2002 smichowski et al 1998 telford et al 2009 these are often expensive time consuming and may be quite complex this can cause problems in situations such as environmental monitoring and spill response vanhoof et al 2013 or in remote areas where the more typical laboratory analyses of sb are not feasible in particular the ability to both rapidly detect sb in environmental waters and to have some preliminary indication of species present would reduce research and monitoring costs and increase response times while supplementing the environmental information available for this metalloid colorimetric methods exist for sb determination in practical terms they range from simple with 1 or two reagents and analytical steps to complex with up to a dozen reagents or analytical steps and exhibit a range of actual and potential detection limits from ng ml 1 to µg ml 1 christopher and west 1966 fauchon 1937 fredrick 1941 matulis and guyon 1965 mcchesney 1946 rath et al 1997 tripathi and patel 1998 thus while colorimetric approaches have played a very minor role in the analysis and research of sb in the environment careful selection adaption and trialling of a colorimetric method is required to provide the desired ability to rapidly cheaply and accurately detect sb under a set of given field conditions in natural waters sb predominantly exists in inorganic form the sb iii species is generally considered to be up to 10 times more toxic than sb v luo et al 2015 smichowski et al 1998 but this statement remains contentious macphee and ruelle 1969 obiakor et al 2017b quiroz et al 2013 takayanagi 2001 which illustrates the dearth of information on the behaviour of this metalloid the sb species present depends on a number of factors including ph redox and co occurring oxidants reductants within a system co occurring ions particularly aqueous species of mn al fe and ca have been shown to influence the mobility and solubility of sb within the soil water system by oxidising reducing adsorbed or precipitated sb species johnson et al 2005 wan et al 2013a wan et al 2013b thus while sb v is typically dominant often even under reducing conditions mitsunobu et al 2006 it is difficult to simply infer speciation from environmental conditions field based speciation methods have been developed that have been shown to accurately represent the species ratio of elements such as arsenic as present at the time of sampling watts et al 2010 the application of such a technique to sb has not been published but coupled with a rapid colorimetric approach to sb quantification should provide an important move forward in sb determination for both research and monitoring the aim of this study was firstly to assess a simple colorimetric method based on the development of the yellow potassium iodoantimonite ksbi4 complex in the presence of sb fauchon 1937 mcchesney 1946 for the rapid quantification of total sb in waters with highly variable sb concentrations up to 25 μg ml 1 secondly this study aimed to combine this colorimetric method with a field speciation technique to provide a rapid indication of sb speciation 2 materials and methods experimental procedures were undertaken in two sequences firstly the colorimetric method was assessed in terms of linearity recoveries effects of co occurring ions and field application secondly the method was coupled with an anionic spe column for sb speciation screening and sb preconcentration 2 1 general colorimetric procedure a summary of the general colorimetric procedure used throughout this work follows the potassium iodide ki reagent was made by dissolving 5 g of crystalline ascorbic acid and 28 g of potassium iodide in 250 ml of deionised water for a final concentration of 11 2 w w as used by mcchesney 1946 adapted from fauchon 1937 the ki reagent was stable for 1 month and was used within that timeframe concentrated h2so4 0 5 ml was added to 2 5 ml of each standard solution and sample to be analysed producing a final acid concentration of 9 09 this was followed by 2 5 ml of the ki reagent after five minutes to allow full colour development each sample was read at 425 nm in a spectro biochrom libra s11 spectrophotometer cell length 1 cm colour development using this method is stable for 48 h as determined by mcchesney 1946 the inclusion of ascorbic acid was found to be essential for colour stabilisation the yellow colour developed in this method is indicative of the potassium iodoantimonite ksbi4 complex all reagents were analytical grade purity deionised water tka micropure germany was used throughout the experimental procedure all sb standard solutions and reagents were prepared the day of analysis or the day prior to analysis with the exception of ki reagent antimony v and iii standards were prepared from ksb oh 6 sigma aldrich usa and ksbc4h4o6 ajax chemicals australia respectively using final concentration ranges as referenced in the following sections all analytical runs included an initial and final calibration curve a drift sample and blank samples approximately every ten samples 2 2 initial method assessment the initial assessments of the colorimetric method focused on linearity of calibration curves differences in repeatability of sb iii and sb v as standard solutions method detection limits and sb recovery and precision linearity was checked using a high range calibration set 0 25 µg ml 1 of sb v and a low range set 0 2 5 µg ml 1 of sb v each sb standard solution was measured in duplicate to determine the repeatability of the analytical reads for different sb species calibration curves were generated from solutions of 0 5 µg ml 1 sb iii and sb v these solutions were measured in triplicate the method detection limit mdl was calculated from seven replicate analyses of the mid range standard using the high and low sb v calibration solutions nepc 2013 the mdl was also calculated using the same approach with 0 5 µg ml 1 sb for both sb iii and sb v solutions as part of the sb iii and sb v repeatability assessment the limit of reporting lr was established at 5 times the mdl nepc 2013 analytical precision was measured by the relative standard deviation rsd which was considered acceptable when less than 10 recoveries were calculated for each mdl analysis based on the spiked value and a baseline analytical instrumental uncertainty was calculated using the instrumental limit of uncertainty and standard error propagation methods as per skoog et al 2014 and expressed as a uncertainty relative to a 0 5 µg ml 1 spike of sb 2 3 influence of co occurring ions on sb quantification the effect of co occurring ions on the determination of sb at 0 5 µg ml 1 of sb v was tested for al 0 5 μg ml 1 as 2 5 μg ml 1 ca 500 μg ml 1 fe 0 1 μg ml 1 mn 2 5 μg ml 1 and s 550 μg ml 1 concentrations of these co occurring ions were selected based on previous values obtained from adit waters for the bracken resources pty ltd hillgrove antimony gold mine 30 34 s 151 54 e approximately 25 km east of armidale new south wales australia to represent median to high yet realistic values picone 2011 all co occurring ion solutions were made from commercially provided standards australian chemical reagents moorooka qld aluminium fe and mn standard solutions were made from the respective metals assumed to be present as al3 fe3 and mn2 respectively in solution the as iii standard was made from as2o3 the s and ca standards were made from nh4 2so4 and caco3 respectively and can be assumed to be so4 2 and ca2 in solution all standards used high purity source materials and were provided in a 2 nitric acid background solution and while assumed to be present initially in the above ionic forms will be referred to using elemental symbols hereafter given the reducing nature of the colorimetric method tests were undertaken with each single ion and on 4 combinations of ions using the concentrations above the first combination of ions contained as fe mn s al ca and s the second mix contained as s ca the third contained as and ca while the fourth contained as and s each test was replicated 6 times and values were determined as recoveries of sb 2 4 field testing of the colorimetric procedure field testing of the colorimetric procedure was undertaken on samples from five old and current mine adits sites a b c d and e at the bracken resources pty ltd hillgrove antimony gold mine the hillgrove mineral field is variably comprised of current and historic mine workings associated with stibnite quartz veins breccias in metasedimentary and granite rocks the area consists of gorges and plateaus with local relief of up to 300 m from ore processing areas to the valley floors the mineral field has an intermittent mining and environmental degradation history spanning back to the late 1800s with several water seepages within the mine lease area containing low to very high concentrations of sb up to 50 μg ml 1 sb has been recorded further details on the history and environmental context of the hillgrove mine and associated historic mine workings can be found in ashley et al ashley et al 2006 ashley et al 2007 at each site approximately 1 l of water was sampled using a 1 l acid washed teflon bottle following standard field sampling protocols standards australia 2005 samples were collected in triplicate at each site and were filtered through a pre washed 0 45 µm membrane using a nalgene hand pumped water filter apparatus approximately 50 ml of filtrate was collected for each sample and stored in acid washed containers at 5 c rinsate and field blanks were collected at each site water samples were returned to room temperature and analysed within 2 h of field sampling using the general colorimetric procedure blank samples and a 10 µg ml 1 sb v drift sample were included every 10 samples all analytical values were corrected using the field rinsate blank absorbance values for each site all samples were split prior to analysis with half of each sample being acidified with nitric acid transported and analysed for sb via icp ms at a nata accredited commercial laboratory australian laboratory services brisbane 2 5 general procedure for anionic column use anionic spe columns grace pure spe anion x 500 mg 3 ml were used in the speciation and preconcentration trials columns were prewashed with 5 ml of deionised water with 5 ml of sample subsequently passed through the column similar to the approach of watts et al watts et al 2010 the flow rate used in trials was approximately 2 ml min 1 to elute the columns following sample pass through 5 ml of 2 m h2so4 was passed through the columns at a flow rate of 2 ml min 1 with the eluent collected for sb determination both eluent and aliquots of sample following pass through were analysed using the colorimetric method procedure described above several investigations were undertaken to determine the feasibility and efficacy of using the columns to separate sb v and sb iii species in water samples as well as using the columns to preconcentrate low concentrations of sb prior to colorimetric analysis 2 6 column capacity and specificity for sb v to test the capacity of an anionic spe column to retain sb v 10 ml of 1 µg ml 1 sb v solution was passed through a column for a total of 10 µg sb v loaded the filtrate was collected and analysed for sb using the colorimetric procedure this process was repeated in increments of 10 ml until a total of 300 µg sb v was passed through the same column with each filtrate increment analysed in 10 ml volumes to determine the efficacy of the column in not absorbing sb iii the same process as above was undertaken using an sb iii solution until a total of 50 μg of sb iii had been passed through the column both the sb v and sb iii tests included duplicate blanks and duplicate analysis of control samples 1 µg ml 1 sb analysed without filtering following the individual tests of sb v and sb iii retention the capacity of the anionic spe columns to simultaneously retain sb v and exclude sb iii was tested using two different ratios of sb iii sb v the ratios tested were 1 µg ml 1 sb iii to 5 µg ml 1 sb v referred to as 1 5 and 1 µg ml 1 sb iii to 10 µg ml 1 sb v referred to as 1 10 columns were loaded in triplicate with 5 ml of solution for the ratios 1 5 and 1 10 this gave total loadings of 15 µg sb v for the ratio 1 5 and 30 µg sb v for the ratio 1 10 on each column the ratios tested were representative of those typically found in natural waters mitsunobu et al 2006 picone 2011 ritchie et al 2013 each test was duplicated the sb concentration of the filtrate was tested using the colorimetric method with the inclusion of a control sample at 1 µg ml 1 sb iii and blanks every 10 samples 2 7 influence of as v ca and s on the column capacity to retain sb v species to determine the ability of the columns to retain sb v in the presence of other ions combined solutions of sb v with as v ca and s were passed through the anion columns with the filtrate analysed colorimetrically for sb as described above concentrations of as ca and s were selected as being similar to the highest values of the three ions found in surface waters around the hillgrove mineralised zone picone 2011 the effect of as v on sb v was tested at 3 ratios of sb to as 5 5 5 0 05 and 20 1 5 μg ml 1 two controls of sb v only were also used of 5 and 20 μg ml 1 each column was loaded with 5 ml of combined solution 4 times resulting in a total volume of 20 ml being passed through each column and then tested as one combined filtrate each test was replicated 4 times the effect of ca on sb v retention was tested at 5 500 and 0 5 500 sb ca μg ml 1 while the effect of s was tested at 5 550 and 0 5 550 sb s μg ml 1 each column was loaded with 5 ml of combined solution 3 times in succession with the filtrate of each 5 ml tested separately to determine the effect of increased loading on each column two controls of 5 and 0 5 μg ml 1 sb were also tested in the same fashion in addition 5 ml aliquots of each ratio of sb ca and sb s were passed through 3 separate columns to determine the repeatability of the sb retention at each ratio 2 8 field testing of anionic columns a pilot field assessment was undertaken to i determine whether the anionic spe columns could potentially separate sb species in field waters in conjunction with the colorimetric method described and ii determine the feasibility of using the columns to preconcentrate sb to improve the detection limit of the colorimetric method the trial was undertaken using waters from bracken resources pty ltd hillgrove antimony gold mine lease area samples were collected from one mine adit for speciation assessment site a and one creek site for preconcentration assessment site b sampling and column use was undertaken as described previously with the only modification being that 250 ml of sample was initially filtered through a 0 45 µm filter prior to analysis approximately 50 ml of the filtrate from each sample was subsampled for colorimetric determination of total sb for the speciation assessment site a 5 ml of the filtered sample was loaded onto an anionic spe column with the filtrate collected into an appropriately labelled and acid washed container for analysis this process was repeated for each sample and for a field rinsate blank for the preconcentration assessment site b 30 ml aliquots triplicate and 50 ml aliquots duplicate were loaded onto separate anionic columns in the field with the filtrate from each aliquot collected for subsequent analysis aliquots and columns were then stored on ice and transported to the laboratory no preservation agents were added to any sample samples were allowed to return to room temperature and were analysed within 2 h of sample collection all water samples for total sb speciation of sb site a and preconcentration site b were tested using the colorimetric procedure as described blanks field total field filtrate and eluted solution blanks were analysed with the relevant blank matched and subtracted from each aliquot result 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial method assessment all calibration curves had a linear response r2 0 99 between concentration and absorbance readings for both low and high range sb fig 1 and for both sb iii and sb v based solutions there was good agreement between calibration curves developed using sb v or sb iii as well as linearity over a wide concentration range figs 1 and 2 as per the initial method mcchesney 1946 this indicates the colour development approximates what would be expected via beer s law across a wide range of concentrations and that sb v was quantitatively reduced to sb iii in the method this is as expected due to the acidic ph and high concentration of iodide in the method which also allowed the formation of the iodoantimonite complex colour development in low range solutions was low with precisions constrained by the precision of the equipment standard deviations of duplicate reads equalled 0 0007 absorbance units this corresponded to a 0 001 change in absorbance units between duplicates which was the limit of the equipment used this equated to rsds at all non zero calibration points of 3 6 and for subsequent spiking experiments resulted in a conservative instrumental analytical rsd of 10 on a 0 5 µg ml 1 spike following standard instrumental error propagation as per skoog et al 2014 high range sb samples produced strong colour development and variation between duplicate reads were similar to low range absorbance readings this equated to rsds at all non zero calibration points of 1 4 it was apparent that lower sb concentrations particularly 1 μg ml 1 only induced weak colour development of the potassium iodoantimonite complex the small decrease in analytical precision at lower sb concentrations was due to limits of precision of the equipment rather than any absolute increase in variation in the raw absorbance units being recorded the high range calibration had a mdl of 0 297 µg ml 1 sb while low range samples had a mdl of 0 113 µg ml 1 sb table 1 the latter mdl was similar to the previously published rhodamine b mdl of 0 1 µg ml 1 maren 1947 and much lower than the original 1 0 μg ml 1 determined by mcchesney 1946 who originally stated the sensitivity of the colorimetric method may be improved with the advent of more advanced analytical instruments and this appears to be the case compared with other spectrophotometric methods for determining sb the reported mdls in this study are more typical while one method has produced an mdl of 3 ng ml 1 tripathi and patel 1998 other methods range from 0 43 μg ml 1 down to 0 02 μg ml 1 fredrick 1941 matulis and guyon 1965 rath et al 1997 the methods with lower detection limits typically require 3 to 9 chemical reagents and anywhere from 1 to 12 analytical steps including preconcentration chelation or phase extractions the ki method trialled here has two reagents ki and h2so4 and essentially one step the differences in detection limits between sb iii and sb v were notable table 1 but the recoveries of spiked sb were all similar and deemed acceptable the previous development and application of the ki method used potassium antimony tartrate as the standard solution mcchesney 1946 the presence of tartrate in sb iii stock may have interfered with the detection of sb compared with ksb oh 6 used in the sb v solutions a study by mehlig 1939 determined that tartrate affected colour development in the detection of manganese by decolourising the solution there are no studies examining the influence of tartrate on the colorimetric detection of sb but such an investigation appears to be warranted it is likely that the acidic nature of the method ph 2 means the tartrate present cannot inhibit the formation of the iodoantimonite complex while there has been some work on the general stability of sb iii tartrate complexes e g de la calle guntiñas et al 1992 confirmation of the species interactions or lack thereof at acidic ph should be experimentally confirmed from a practical standpoint concentrations of sb 0 5 µg ml 1 produced weak colour development of the potassium iodoantimonite complex even a small variation in absorbance readings affected the estimated sb values at these low concentrations in reporting values in this work we use the mdl as the lower limit of detection but we have also calculated the lr for conservative consideration of this method for future routine environmental monitoring the lr was established at 5 times the mdl with a maximum lr of 1 5 µg ml 1 sb and a minimum lr of 0 57 µg ml 1 sb using the 0 297 and 0 113 µg ml 1 sb mdl s of the high and low range calibrations these values were deemed the lowest practical quantitation limits accounting for potential variability within the colorimetric method nepc 2013 in australia the anzecc armcanz guidelines for fresh and marine water quality are set at a low reliability value of 9 µg l 1 for sb ashley et al 2007 thus without a preconcentration step this colorimetric method is not sensitive enough to reliably detect low concentrations of sb 0 6 µg ml 1 sb in uncontaminated waters at sites such as the mineralised zone investigated in this study concentrations of sb have been detected at 50 µg ml 1 in the mine water seepages21 antimony concentrations ranging from 330 to 11400 µg l 1 sb have been determined in waters from an sb mine and smelter in xikuangshan china liu et al 2010 and sb between 699 and 55000 µg l 1 measured in tailings surface waters and porewaters in kantishna hills district alaska ritchie et al 2013 thus the lr of this simple colorimetric procedure is low enough for analysis of highly contaminated samples including mine seepages tailings waters and the detection of spills related to mining activities as stated previously this method has the added advantage of not requiring numerous and sometimes unstable reagents or complicated processing steps mcchesney 1946 rath et al 1997 tripathi and patel 1998 3 2 influence of co occurring ions on sb quantification table 2 shows the influence of single and combination co occurring ions on the recovery of sb as sb v for all single ions except fe sb recoveries were within 80 to 120 table 2 aluminium spiked solutions produced a recovery of 92 3 with an rsd of the recovery value of 17 all other rsds were 11 which included a baseline instrument analytical error calculated from standard error propagation principles as 10 on a 0 5 µg ml 1 sb solution it is worth noting that while the rsd s of recoveries varied up to 17 this still equates to a small absolute absorbance unit change e g 0 001 0 004 between replicates and is partially an artefact of the high detection limits and relatively low sb spike concentration that is both analytical uncertainty and overall rsds may decrease by either decreasing instrumental uncertainty or increasing colour development such as via preconcentration iron increased sb measurements 122 indicating a small potential interference with the colour development at 0 1 μg ml 1 fe such a value of fe is considered high in the areas of neutral ph the values were based upon ashley et al 2007 picone 2011 but in other situations particularly more acidic environments high dissolved fe concentrations may interfere with the method this requires further investigation analysis with all combinations of ions spiked into solution produced recoveries of sb within 80 120 of expected values this included the solution with fe at 0 1 μg ml 1 this may indicate that any interference from fe in the method is reduced when the fe occurs in combination with other ions the mechanism explaining this phenomenon is unclear but there may be some form of competition in which fe interacts with the other ions present rather than the formation of the potassium iodoantimonite complex itself none of the blanks that included co occurring ions singly or in combination without sb produced elevated signals which indicated that no pure solution of individual or combined co occurring ion resulted in false positive colour development other sb colorimetric studies have reported some interferences from co occurring elements mcchesney s original work identified a gross interference of bismuth where sb recovery increased up to a factor of 2 5 with bi present mcchesney 1946 iron produced a 1 change in sb estimation in that work numerous other interferences have been reported for colorimetric methods but all appear specific to the method the indicator complex formed and the concentrations of sb and interferent in the mix christopher and west 1966 fredrick 1941 matulis and guyon 1965 from the little information available there does not appear to be a systematic set of interfering ions for sb colorimetric methods arsenic did not produce any detectable interferences in the method it is probable that as does form a similar iodide complex to sb but it does not have the same absorption wavelength site specific knowledge and some interference piloting would be required before application of any colorimetric method for sb in this work while a set of common co occurring elements were tested for interferences further work may be required depending on the environment the method may be deployed in in particular work on phosphate nitrate and dissolved organic substances may need specific investigation effects of chloride may need to be considered in saline environments in the presence of any detected interferences complexation or precipitation steps to remove interferences may be required harvey et al 1953 tripathi and patel 1998 3 3 field testing of the colorimetric procedure the field blank and field rinsate blank produced detectable interference in the colorimetric method equating to apparent sb of 0 226 µg ml 1 and 0 511 µg ml 1 respectively contamination from the filter apparatus was possible which may have included fibres from the 0 45 µm membrane or colloidal particles not otherwise removed this may have been exacerbated by the weak colour development at low sb concentrations noted earlier despite this there was good and strong linear agreement between the colorimetric determination of sb and the independent analysis table 3 site b had sb values below the determined mdl at the other sites the colorimetric method shows potential for field application with highly comparable quantification of total sb 80 88 to the icp ms analysis and generally high precision when values were above the mdl this field analysis confirmed the very limited potential interferences identified via pure solutions for this locality 3 4 spe column capacity and specificity for sb v passing up to 300 μg of sb v through an spe anionic column in 10 ml increments produced no detectable sb in any of the filtrate aliquots similarly sb iii up to 50 μg was not retained by the column with between 94 and 105 recovery of sb iii found in the column filtrates in a similar fashion passing aliquots of sb iii sb v solutions through the columns produced acceptable recoveries of sb iii in aliquots with no apparent loss of specificity of the columns for sb v table 4 there was a small but noticeable decrease in sb iii recovered in the first aliquot of filtrate passed through the column at both ratios of iii v examined while these values are still within the acceptable range of recovery one potential cause may be inadequate prewashing of columns in previous work lack of pre washing of columns was found to affect the retention of as watts et al 2010 3 5 influence of as v ca and s on the column capacity to retain sb v species there was no loss of retention of sb v with any of the combined as v sb v solutions passed through the columns thus with a maximum of 20 μg of as v and 20 μg sb v loaded onto a column no sb v was found in the filtrate in contrast the columns appeared to lose their ability to retain sb v when the solutions contained high yet realistic values of ca or s table 5 ashley et al 2007 picone 2011 the effect was small with 5 ml of solution passed through the column but between 75 and 102 of sb v was not retained after 15 ml of solution had been passed through the column the effect appeared highest at high concentrations of both sb and the competing ion but was very significant even at low 0 5 µg ml 1 concentrations of sb for s as so4 2 this may be due to the anionic binding sites being overloaded or possibly some complexation reaction between sb v and so4 2 that reduces the ability of the column to bind sb v as the so4 2 standard was made from nh4 2so4 it is possible that the addition of n and conversion to nitrate in the sample also contributed to the anionic binding sites being overloaded in the case of ca as ca2 it seems unlikely that a swamping of anionic binding sites is the cause of this loss of specificity of the column for sb v but some complexation between sb and ca2 filella et al 2002b filella and williams 2012 may be reducing the efficacy of the column as the ca2 standard included carbonate this may also have affected the anionic binding site capacity the interactions of background ions needs to be more fully investigated if this method is to move beyond a speciation screening approach 3 6 field testing of anionic columns despite the loss of sb v retention evidenced in lab solutions with ca or s the two field sites examined showed reasonable agreement between the total sb in water samples and the sum of the two species detected in filtrate and by eluting the sb retained on the column respectively table 6 site a with its higher total concentration produced a 91 8 recovery in particular without independent validation of species present in the samples the specificity of the column to retain sb v cannot be confirmed particularly in the presence of other ions that may alter the column s retention capability as indicated in the previous section this small amount of pilot work needs further expansion in conjunction with other sb species analysis but shows potential for rapid field screening for sb species site b produced variable results when 30 ml or 50 ml of sample was preconcentrated table 6 this equated to detected concentrations of 0 79 and 0 76 µg ml 1 sb v in this sample a preconcentration factor of approximately 8 which when applied to the method detection limit effectively reduces the limit from 0 113 to 0 014 µg ml 1 however the recoveries were noticeably different between the 30 and 50 ml sample 130 and 75 2 respectively this difference was due to variation in the concentrations of sb v detected as sb iii remained so low as to have very little influence on the total recovery calculation this is in contrast to the pure solutions with ca or s spiked because no large amounts of bleed through of sb v was evident when passing up to 50 ml of field sample through a column the differences in apparent concentration between 30 ml and 50 ml of sample preconcentrated and the previous potential issues raised in relation to potential column saturation or sb v complexation in waters indicates the spe approach to preconcentration for sb needs much more investigation nevertheless these initial results suggest that the application of spe columns or similar preconcentration techniques such as anion exchange resins or feo impregnated filter paper strips andersson et al 2015 chardon et al 1996 may dramatically improve the detection limits of the colorimetric method with minimal additional effort 4 conclusion using the conservative lr the adapted colorimetric method could successfully quantify total sb at concentrations 0 6 µg ml 1 sb in routine applications and could be confidently applied for highly contaminated water samples including the adit waters of a known mineralized zone that has a long history of active mining this method is applicable for low cost rapid monitoring of current and historic mine sites and as a first response to potential spills or compliance issues the potential for such a method is even higher when considered in conjunction with the advent of robust field portable spectrophotometers baker et al 2004 the method is robust to interferences although specific tests and checks are recommended based on site chemistry the use of anionic field columns such as the spe solid cartridge investigated here also shows potential for rapid speciation of sb however it is apparent that volumes filtered and the water chemistry of the sample itself play significant roles in the potential accuracy of such columns for sb speciation further testing is recommended in conjunction with independent speciation measurements for field samples the use of anionic columns or similar anionic absorption equipment appears promising for the rapid preconcentration of sb in samples thus extending the use of the colorimetric method examined here or similar methods into more dilute field samples acknowledgments this study was made possible by a university of new england seeding grant thanks are extended to

7129,sustainable river basin planning and management is a complex and uncertain phenomenon involving social economic environmental and several technical criteria despite global advancement the problems associated sustainability have not been sufficiently addressed due to mismanaged governance poorly implemented policies lack of suitable data and over exploitation of river resources therefore major rivers basins across the globe need an integrative and comprehensive strategic approach considering the diverse stakeholder s perspective and conflicting criteria pertaining to sustainable management the present study develops a decision support framework to assess the sustainability by coupling an improved fuzzy based hybridized strength weakness opportunities and threats model fh swot with a geostatistical approach to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model ganges river basin india has been taken as a case study the novelty of the study is to devise six different hybrid mechanisms under fh swot framework to reach best possible strategic alternatives along with nominal optimistic and pessimistic perspectives of the stakeholders to enhance the model s productivity it is coupled with weighted overlay geo statistical approach to identify prioritize the most vulnerable critical locations which needs suitable implementation of strategic alternatives derived using fh swot model the fh swot model developed herein simultaneously delineates strategic alternatives and corresponding priority zones while addressing the uncertainties related to stakeholder s conflicts and imprecise data to reach optimal pessimistic and nominal viewpoints which leads to development of an innovative and comprehensive decision support framework for assessing sustainability the key policies derived from the study involve enforcing regulations on disposal of heavy metals developing hydropower adaptation of organic farming education and participation of stakeholders regulations on dams and barrages with a score of 0 2453 0 2205 0 2088 0 1898 and 0 1288 respectively also kanpur varanasi stretch has been delineated as very high priority zone followed by regions located along the banks of ganges sensitivity analysis proves that the model is robust and can be used by the environment managers towards sustainable planning and management of any river basin lakes wetlands or any major water body of the world keywords decision support systems fuzzy swot method geographical information systems river basin planning sustainability water resources management 1 introduction over the past three decades the accelerated industrialization and urbanization across the globe have been posing a huge challenge to the water resource policy makers to formulate strategies which ensure sustainable development of water resources koop et al 2017 in many developing countries such as india and china water bodies are heavily polluted and availability of freshwater resources is becoming limited goonetilleke and vithanage 2017 wrg 2009 estimated 40 shortage of freshwater by the year 2030 over abstraction of river water resources and heavy pollution caused from industrial and domestic sources solid wastes and agricultural runoffs will be significantly affecting 15 of the global population ligtvoet et al 2014 although it is evident that there is a need to strike a balance between so called developmental activities and sustainability still most of the river basins are under constant threat due to mismanaged government bodies inadequate knowledge about the fundamentals of the riverine ecosystems and its dynamics poorly implemented policies and lack of in depth planning mencio et al 2010 sustainability of a river basin depends on many inter related factors some of these fundamental factors are river water discharge sediments and bio diversity arthington et al 2010 liu et al 2017 an integrated study of these factors is essential for developing suitable policies however there is a general lack of awareness even amongst the experts to assess the impact of any development project on these essential factors of the river as a result river ecosystem gets imbalanced with time giving rise to numerous problems such as water scarcity reduced self purifying capacity flood risks loss of delta formation toxicity and extinction of aquatics meeting such challenges needs a suitable combination of good governance local general mass and expert stakeholders who can effectively manage the long term uncertain and imperfectly known risks related to sustainability of a river basin moreover there are multiple decision makers with contrasting interests and objectives and thus the strategic policies should reflect the viewpoint of all the stakeholders towards the perspective of sustainability and development since there are several factors associated with uncertainty and conflicts amongst stakeholders there is no single best solution to address the issues related to river basin an integrative approach which provides all possible alternative solutions along with their relevance is needed patterson et al 2013 the approach should be flexible enough to adapt to the changing environment which helps in designing the proposed strategies reflecting the individual participation from the bottommost level of regional stakeholders bryan et al 2010 these days integrated river basin planning and management irbpm is found to be an effective approach as it involves comprehensive viewpoints of multifaceted decision makers karamouz et al 2009 srinivas et al 2017 however successful implementation of irbpm needs stakeholder involvement along with proper consideration of all social indicators such as ethical and cultural norms and institutional attitude towards sustainability belay et al 2010 the process develops a systematic plan for a river basin while considering socio economic ecological and environmental criteria it is also important to develop a suitable mathematical model which can evaluate the performance of these criteria by incorporating the experience knowledge and perception of inter disciplinary experts having conflicting judgements therefore a multi criteria group decision making mcgdm framework is needed to implement irbpm where strategists stakeholders define realistic alternatives possibility of outcomes risk of data error and conflicts in stakeholder s criteria mergias et al 2007 garfi et al 2011 determining policies for sustainable management of a river is a complex process as the mathematical model involves numerous environmental discharge water quality and river ecosystem and human economic social educational and political criteria as well as diverse decision makers therefore multi criteria assessment models are generally preferred over traditional optimization models phillis and andriantiatsaholiniaina 2001 bick et al 2018 developing models involving multiple criteria and group decision making using classical optimization makes the process tedious and complex as optimization models do not offer the flexibility to incorporate the opinion of several decision makers simultaneously moreover as the number of criteria increases formulation of multiple objective functions and constraints becomes difficult also it is not possible to perform pairwise comparison among various criteria using optimization modeling however in case of criteria assessment models pairwise comparison group decision making and incorporation of diverse opinion of decision makers can be easily performed in order to formulate objective function and constraints of an optimization model there must exist some relationship amongst the criteria unlike criteria assessment models where such pre requisite is not needed one of the major drawback of optimization model is although it can give number of optimal solutions but it doesn t mathematically explain the degree of acceptability of each solution based on the preferences of decision makers and doesn t assign rankings to the solution set while determining the optimal solution set such models generally assign weightages to each objective function rather than criteria and it is quite difficult to assess the impact of each criterion on the optimal solution especially when decision criteria and experts are more in number on the other hand criteria assessment models assess the importance of criteria and determine the degree of impact of each criterion on the final decision solution also each criterion can be assigned weights depending on its ideal value srinivas and singh 2018 such flexibility is limited to objective functions in case of optimization models therefore criteria assessment models are preferred by the experts over optimization models for framing sustainable policies many times the quantitative environmental and socio economical information is available in fragmentary form and very exhaustive nature of such information hampers its direct usefulness in formulating policies phillis and andriantiatsaholiniaina 2001 not only there are no common dimensions of measurement for such parameters of sustainability but quantitative criteria for certain values are missing and cannot be modeled using optimization tools hence a comprehensive model which combines multidimensional components while addressing the uncertainty is needed on the other hand model should be flexible to add remove sustainability parameters in order to obtain a better assessment of the policies azarnivand et al 2015 sustainable river basin management problems are often subjected to uncertainties caused due to randomness and imprecision rehana and mujumdar 2009 srinivas and singh 2018 randomness is mainly caused by the random nature of data such as water quality stream flow and other environmental data the uncertainty due to imprecision is induced by the conflicting judgements of various stakeholders towards the criteria and strategic alternatives recently fuzzy based mcgdm techniques have emerged as one of the best approaches to deal with the uncertainties singh et al 2007 2015 pan et al 2017 srinivas and singh 2017 fuzzy logic plays an emphatic role in framing irbpm policies by classifying and quantifying the uncertainties using membership functions defined over appropriate fuzzy scale singh et al 2017 srinivas et al 2017 fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp has been intensively applied to formulate strategies focused on environmental conservation and water resource management such as flood risk assessment zou et al 2013 geological environmental impact assessment and pollution assessment of groundwater resources azarnivand et al 2015 recent research is specifically directed towards enhancing the existing fuzzy mcgdm methodologies to handle the uncertainties in an effective manner qin 2012 expressed uncertainties as fuzzy parameterized stochastic distributions to assess risks associated with environmental pollution control problems wang et al 2014 developed fuzzy binary comparison method fbcm and applied the theory of variable fuzzy sets vfs for assessing the water quality of tseng wen river qin and xu 2015 developed superiority inferiority based sequential fuzzy programming sisfp model for supporting water supply demand analysis under uncertainty for tianjin binhai new area china srinivas and singh 2017 developed group decision making framework using interval valued fuzzy sets and evaluated the impact of industrial wastewater on ganges river basin india despite advancements in fuzzy techniques limited research has been performed wherein conflicts of decision makers and imprecise data can be simultaneously addressed while considering the probability distribution of the fuzzy numbers used to represent decision maker s viewpoint thus the present study develops an improved fuzzy approach which addresses these limitations by calculating the optimal pessimistic and nominal viewpoints of the stakeholders towards sustainable policies in addition to using modified fuzzy techniques irbpm decision making framework can be further enhanced by inseminating the geographical information system gis the primary objective of irbpm approach is to identify hot spot priority areas with high problem intensity which can be very well achieved by using overlay analysis of gis mcdonnell 2008 even in the absence of complete understanding of the parameters and their inter relationships or of adequate data gis develops geostatistical maps to frame consensus amongst the stakeholders another unique contribution of gis in irbpm is its ability to aggregate geographical data and expert judgments which provides a flexible framework to the experts to explore understand and redefine a decision problem boroushaki and malczewski 2010 júnez ferreira and herrera 2013 abdalla et al 2014 developed a gis supported fuzzy set approach for flood risk assessment in the red river in southern manitoba canada singh and katpatal 2017 developed a simplified approach using multicriteria analysis weighted overlay analytical hierarchical process fuzzy and geo statistical kriging to design groundwater level network of the wain ganga sub basin india therefore coupling fuzzy based mcgdm techniques with gis is an emphatic irbpm approach to address the issues pertaining to sustainable development procuring and analyzing the viewpoints of stakeholders can be performed in numerous ways safaei et al 2013 one of the suitable ways is to analyze the base line river basin for identification and categorization of internal strengths weakness and external influence of possible opportunities threats using a strength weakness opportunity threats swot model belay et al 2010 bunting et al 2016 swot model derives hybrid mechanisms based on optimal usage of internal strengths opportunities against external weaknesses threats using swot tows matrix thus swot model provides a managerial and structural strategic framework to devise possible strategic alternatives for sustainable river basin planning also coupling fuzzy set theory with swot framework addresses the uncertainties these uncertainties are addressed by quantifying the stakeholder s preferences using a membership function defined over a fuzzy scale for example a particular stakeholder may consider an alternative to be good however he is uncertain about to what degree the alternative is good fuzzy logic quantifies the linguistic judgement good of the stakeholder using a suitable membership function by defining an uncertainty range for the set good over a fuzzy scale this gives latitude to the decision maker to quantify how good an alternative is based on above discussion authors have devised an innovative decision support framework for assessing sustainability of ganges river basin india using an improved fuzzy based hybridized swot fh swot model linked with geostatistical approach the framework identifies the suitable alternatives for sustainable river basin development while considering the uncertainties associated with data and decision maker preferences conflicts a distinctive characteristic of fh swot model is the derivation of hybrid mechanisms using the swot analysis based on the judgements of multiple stakeholders which gives concrete foundation to generate strategic alternatives such unique and efficient approach of deriving alternatives leads to effective use of the sustainability information strengths weakness opportunities and threats also nominal optimistic and pessimistic perspectives of the stakeholders towards the alternatives have been evaluated moreover coupling of overlaying technique of gis reveals the critical priority zones which facilitates the experts to implement derived strategies this not only enhances decision making but also provides a holistic tool to the experts to apply the model results in the given priority zones on immediate basis another exclusive feature of the model is its flexibility which allows the decision makers to modify add delete sustainability parameters with time and their intensity 2 methodology the methodology adopted in this study is an amalgamation of three models namely hybridized swot model improved fuzzy model and geostatistical approach for better clarity the same has been represented diagrammatically fig 1 2 1 selection of appropriate stakeholders for developing swot model since sustainable river basin planning and management is a complex phenomenon there is always some uncertainty associated with the forecasting of future scenario however most likely possibility can be determined by appropriate planning and management an effective decision making system involves multi disciplinary inputs therefore group decision making multiple stakeholders is considered as most desirable and sound approach srinivas and singh 2017 hence preliminary step of a swot model is to choose appropriate expert stakeholders 2 2 selection of criteria for sustainable development for swot model in swot model the experts stakeholders categorize the governing factors into two distinctive categories the factors that can be influenced by governing and management authorities are considered as internal factors while those that can influence the basin management but are not under the control of governing authorities are considered as external factors these factors are decided based on the decision criteria chosen for the river basin in general the various criteria pertaining to sustainability are classified into four categories namely social economic environmental and technical category however selection of appropriate criteria depends on the nature of the river basin taken into consideration garfi et al 2011 2 3 developing swot and hybridized matrix the internal and external factors defined by the stakeholders are represented in the form of swot matrix internal factors include internals strength s and internal weakness w while the external factors comprise of external opportunities o and external threats t these factors are systematically analyzed by the stakeholders to formulate strategies which are represented using hybridized matrix hybridized matrix formulation follows the principle of interlinking internal and external factors that complement each other and thus utilize the positive characteristics to diminish maximum negative characteristics an exclusive feature of the model is derivation of appropriate hybrid mechanisms to address the problems of a river basin these mechanisms are used to derive possible alternatives for most optimal utilization of internal and external factors for example one of the mechanism could be strength opportunity threats sot mechanism where internal strengths are used to take advantage of external opportunities and reduce external threats in similar manner other hybrid mechanisms can be derived the stakeholders give their expert judgments based on the environmental data provided by the governmental agencies the robustness and flexibility of swot model provides latitude to the decision makers to customize the strategic alternatives suitable for the intended problem based on stakeholder s feedback the possible alternatives are given preference scores against each sustainability criteria for prioritizing alternatives strategically and dealing with the uncertainties the hybridized swot model is analyzed using modified fuzzy framework where nominal optimistic and pessimistic perspective of the stakeholders is evaluated 2 4 coupling hybridized swot model with modified fuzzy approach and overlay analysis 2 4 1 modified fuzzy approach as discussed earlier the sustainability criteria and decision alternatives derived using hybridized swot model need to be evaluated and ranked by incorporating the various uncertainties therefore swot model is integrated with a modified fuzzy based multi criteria decision making tool traditional fuzzy analytical process fahp has been modified to have better assessment of the sustainability 2 4 1 1 obtaining pairwise comparison and aggregate decision matrices pairwise comparison of the decision criteria and alternatives is performed using the fuzzy scales provided in table 1 the interval φ between the elements of fuzzy triplets a c has been taken as 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 to obtain three different kinds of membership functions against each linguistic scale these intervals are decided based on the data values of the input parameters and the degree up to which the decision makers want to access the uncertainty for illustration an interval value φ of 0 5 1 0 1 5 has been chosen so as to provide latitude to the decision makers to access various uncertainty ranges in a balanced manner however very low and high values 0 5 and 1 5 would lead to too many and too less linguistic representations of the data therefore any value can be taken between 0 5 and 1 5 singh et al 2015 if i and j are two criteria then each element of the pairwise comparison matrix is represented in the form of a fuzzy triplet mij for illustration the matrix formulated based on the opinion on 1st stakeholder is represented as a1 using eq 1 1 a 1 1 m 12 m 1 n 1 m 12 1 m 2 n 1 m 1 n 1 m 2 n 1 since there are multiple stakeholders all matrices need to be aggregated to obtain an aggregated decision matrix aij for the criteria and alternatives each element of the matrix is calculated by computing the geometric mean of the opinion of all the stakeholders as represented by eq 2 given below 2 a ij k 1 p x ij k 1 n k 1 p y ij k 1 n k 1 p z ij k 1 n a ij k x ij k y ij k z ij k for i j 1 n and k 1 p where a ij k is a fuzzy triplet that represents the opinion of a particular stakeholder and k k 1 k 2 k p represents the set of decision makers consider a 1 x ij y ij z ij and i j 1 n then a ij s k 1 p x ij 1 n b ij s k 1 p y ij 1 n c ij s k 1 p z ij 1 n a s j 1 n x ij s b s j 1 n y ij s and c s j 1 n z ij s 2 4 1 2 obtaining weights of criteria and alternatives the final weights of the decision criteria are calculated using the eq 3 given below 3 w i a ij s c s b ij s b s c ij s a s the aggregated decision matrix for the alternatives corresponding to each criterion is computed from the opinion of the individual stakeholders towards each alternative fuzzy weightage of each alternative j corresponding to criterion i u ij is also evaluated using eq 3 the overall fuzzy weightage of each alternative f j of each alternative is calculated by using eq 4 as given below 4 f j j 1 n w i u ij these fuzzified weightages are defuzzified to obtain quantifiable results consider two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers namely u 1 a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 and u 2 a 2 b 2 c 2 d 2 then the process of defuzzification follows the following laws represented using eq 5 5 u 1 u 2 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 c 1 c 2 d 1 d 2 t u 1 u 2 a 1 a 2 r 1 r 2 b 1 b 2 c 1 c 2 d 1 d 2 v 1 v 2 r 1 b 1 a 1 b 2 a 2 r 2 a 2 b 1 a 1 a 1 b 2 a 2 v 1 d 1 c 1 d 2 c 2 v 2 d 2 d 1 c 1 d 1 d 2 c 2 in order to convert the trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to triangular fuzzy numbers terms b 1 c 1 andb 2 c 2 can be assumed if t t 1 t 2 then the membership function t t 1 t 2 can be obtained using table 2 when a 1 a 2 x b 1 b 2 x i can be calculated using the eq 6 as given below 6 x i r i 1 α 2 r i 1 α a i for i 1 2 thus x can be calculated using the eq 7 as given below 7 x r 11 r 21 α 2 r 12 r 22 α a 1 a 2 similarly when c 1 c 2 x d 1 d 2 then eq 8 can be used 8 x v 11 v 21 α 2 v 12 v 22 α d 1 d 2 2 4 2 obtaining nominal optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints of the stakeholders the improved fuzzy methodology uses center of gravity method for defuzzification the nominal defuzzified score of an alternative can be calculated by using eq 9 9 z nominal f a d x μ f x dx a d μ f x dx where z nominal f is the defuzzified of f and μ f x is the membership function of f the results obtained using eq 9 represent the general or neutral viewpoint of the stakeholders as fuzzy number represents uncertain values it is important to consider the overall possibility distribution in its evaluation moreover the evaluation of a fuzzy number can be easily affected by an evaluation viewpoint such as decision makers preference thus the results can be further improved by considering the overall probability distributions of the fuzzy numbers lee kwang and jee hyong 1999 therefore optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints of the stakeholders towards each alternative is obtained by using eqs 10 and 11 as given below 10 z optimistic f a d x 2 μ f x dx a d μ f x dx 11 z pessimistic f a d 2 x x 2 μ f x dx a d μ f x dx 2 4 3 geo statistical approach weighted overlay analysis the strategic alternatives obtained from fh swot model can be implemented swiftly by identifying the priority zones in the basin which need immediate attention of the decision makers therefore entire river basin has been classified based on priorities of different zones using weighted overlay geo statistical approach these priority zones are obtained based on certain parameters which affect the sustainability criteria of the river representing the state of river basin in gis framework not only explains the criticality of ecological issues in a better way but also gives an extensive scope to arrive at productive useful and accurate decisions weighted overlay method involves overlapping of more than one layer in the form of raster mapping based on weightages and priorities overlay output raster is classified into corresponding priority zones esri 2011 the methodology represents all the parameters in raster thematic map which is georeferenced on a common coordinate projection the combined output layer is further classified using gis soft tool based on weights and individual features of each thematic raster the schematic procedure of weighted overlay method has been explained in fig 2 based on opinion of expert stakeholders all the weightages w i are integrated with each raster layer which takes care of the intensity of influence caused by each parameter priority zone classification function eq 12 considers the assigned weights from every overlay thematic raster and also the priorities p i of the parameters 12 priority region i 1 n p i w i 3 case study ganges river basin of india fig 3 has been declared as one of the ten most polluted basins of the world wwf international switzerland ganges is the largest river in india draining 26 3 of the total geographical area of the country the basin lies between east longitudes 73 2 89 5 and north latitudes 21 6 31 21 with a total length of about 2525 km the river possesses excellent self cleansing ability which allows for assimilation and treatment of biological waste however excessive withdrawals for irrigation industrial and power generation purposes and discharge of hazardous effluents have inevitably contaminated the river thus river water has become breeding ground of many water borne diseases such as cancer kidney problems brain hemorrhage and other gastro intestinal problems the lower stretches of the river especially kanpur varanasi are no longer considered as life supportive and it has become a serious challenge for decision makers to resuscitate the river on the other hand the upper stretches are over crowded with dams and barrages leading to a huge diversion of water which reduces its discharge to mere 15 billion m3 year as a result during dry season discharge at kanpur allahabad and varanasi is merely 90 386 m3 s 279 997 m3 s 278 1160 m3 s respectively the existing sewage and effluent treatment plants lack adequate technology and capacity to treat the waste and nearly 50 of untreated wastewaters are discharged into river over 1 3 billion litres of sewage 260 million litres of industrial waste runoff consisting 6 million tonnes of fertilizers and 9000 tonnes of pesticides used in agriculture and very large quantities of solid waste open defecation are daily released into river cpcb 2017 there are constant endeavors from governmental organizations to restore the water quality of ganges but due to lack of public awareness and sufficient knowledge about river system poor participation from stakeholders and corruption the policies and solutions are not implemented properly sustainability of the river is under a severe threat and needs an immediate attention therefore swot analysis performed based on potential criteria plays a crucial role in identifying the major problems critical locations and prospective solutions 3 1 selection of stakeholders and sustainability criteria the study procures the feedback of multiple stakeholders belonging to four different institutions namely research and scientific organization of the basin pollution control agencies non governmental organization industrial experts and representative of local communities ten year environmental data 2005 2015 of various sustainability criteria have been obtained from central pollution control board cpcb 2017 the potential sustainability criteria chosen for the study have been classified into five different categories as listed in table 3 each of these criteria have been chosen by conducting an in depth study of the river basin previous policies of sustainability and secondary literature cwc 2016 mowr 2017 srinivas and singh 2018 some of the primary reasons behind choosing each criterion have been listed in the second column of table 3 these criteria form the basis for formulating hybridized swot matrix and appropriate strategic alternatives each criterion is evaluated by the stakeholders based on the sustainability goals set by the water resource river development and ganga rejuvenation ministry of the country mowr 2017 3 2 formulation of swot matrix the 4 expert stakeholders chosen for formulating the strategies for ganges river basin have obtained a total of 43 significant factors which are categorized using swot matrix table 4 the strengths 9 factors are derived based on the excellent natural characteristics of the river basin and governmental focus on improving the river s ecosystem weaknesses 13 factors are obtained due to insufficient knowledge poor administration mismanagement and over exploitation of river due to human intervention opportunities 11 factors are primarily related to usage of latest technology for treating the wastewater appropriate budget allocation by the government rising concern amongst people and political arena finally threats 10 factors are caused due to over abstraction of water by the multi purpose projects climate change lack of funds economic crisis and conflicts among state governments 4 results and discussion 4 1 deriving strategic alternatives from hybridized swot matrix the swot matrix has been reviewed systematically by the expert stakeholders based on their experience previous literature garousi et al 2013 srinivas and singh 2017 available data cwc 2016 and governmental analysis cpcb 2017 the foundational principle and robustness of swot model have been utilized to address ganges river basin issues the model connects internal and external characteristics together to formulate most feasible alternatives taking advantage of flexibility nature of swot model six hybrid mechanisms have been developed these mechanisms are described briefly as given below strength opportunity threats mechanism sot using internal strengths to take advantage of external opportunities and reduce external threats strength opportunity so using internal strengths to take advantage of external opportunities strength opportunity weakness threat mechanism sowt using internal strengths and external opportunities to remove internal weakness and assess upcoming threats strength threats mechanism st using internal strengths to act strategically against potential threats opportunity threat weakness mechanism otw exterminating threats by using internal opportunities and indirectly removing internal weakness that caused potential threat weakness opportunity mechanism wo removing internal weakness using external opportunities a total of 11 alternatives have been devised based on these hybrid mechanisms table 5 although swot model is capable of formulating appropriate strategies for a water resource planning and management problem it does not provide any mathematical ground to determine the relative importance of the factors to obtain the most appropriate strategy alternative s for sustainable development hybridized matrices of the swot model are integrated with a modified fuzzy multi criteria group decision making technique therefore the decision support framework is termed as fuzzy based hybridized swot model fh swot modified fuzzy approach not only provides a buffer for uncertainties but also evaluates nominal optimistic and pessimistic view points of the group of stakeholders each of these alternatives is now rated under five sustainable development decision criteria chosen in the previous section 4 2 outcomes of modified fuzzy approach the relative fuzzy weightages of each decision criterion and each alternative with respect to all criteria are obtained by using pairwise comparisons matrices which are formulated under the guidance of expert stakeholders the subjective objective opinions of the four experts are obtained using a questionnaire their opinions are fuzzified using fuzzy scale provided in table 1 and pairwise comparison matrix for each expert is derived using eq 1 table 6 represents the aggregated pairwise comparison decision matrix of all criteria where each element of the matrix represents an aggregated fuzzy triangular number a c obtained using eq 2 the weightages of each criteria are obtained by using table 6 and eq 3 in similar way pairwise comparison decision matrix is derived for all alternatives against each criterion table 7 represents aggregated fuzzy ratings of all the alternatives corresponding to each decision criteria where each element fuzzy triangular number of the matrix x y z represents aggregated judgement of the experts to obtain the aggregated fuzzy weightages of all the alternatives certain parameters described using eq 5 are calculated the values of these parameters r1 r2 v1 v2 are listed in table 8 the aggregated fuzzy weightages along with the nominal optimistic and pessimistic scores are obtained for each alternative using eqs 6 8 the values of x represented using eqs 6 8 are substituted in eqs 9 11 to obtain the formulas of modified evaluated components given below using eqs 13 15 13 z nominal a b x r 1 x 2 r 2 x a dx c d x v 1 x 2 v 2 x d dx a b r 1 x 2 r 2 x a dx c d v 1 x 2 v 2 x d dx 14 z optimistic a b x 2 r 1 x 2 r 2 x a dx c d x 2 v 1 x 2 v 2 x d dx a b r 1 x 2 r 2 x a dx c d v 1 x 2 v 2 x d dx 15 z pessimistic a b 2 x x 2 r 1 x 2 r 2 x a dx c d 2 x x 2 v 1 x 2 v 2 x d dx a b r 1 x 2 r 2 x a dx c d v 1 x 2 v 2 x d dx the results corresponding to nominal optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints of the stakeholders are presented in the table 9 it can be clearly inferred that in all three cases alternatives obtain similar rankings but their scores degree of goodness differ in each case in addition the results reveal interesting facts pertaining to sustainable development and risk assessment these results have been validated by comparing them with the recent works of governmental organizations cwc 2014 cpcb 2017 and few secondary sources chaudhary et al 2017 srinivas et al 2017 the goal of the policy makers is to assess the risks associated with ganges river basin which would serve as a foundation to formulate best strategies for sustainable planning and implementation according to the analysis enforcing strict regulations on heavy metals and sewage disposal and open defecation a10 is the best way of reviving river ecosystem with a score of 0 2453 nominal 0 0654 optimistic and 0 4251 pessimistic on the scale of 0 1 0 0 25 good 0 25 0 50 moderately good 0 50 0 75 very good 0 75 1 absolutely good it is very interesting to note that despite obtaining highest rank alternative a10 falls in the preliminary categories of good it is because of the divergent interests of the stakeholders for example local mass is not so much in favor of reducing open defection due to cultural reasons and industrial experts were not so inclined towards enforcing strict regulations on heavy metals and sewage disposal researchers and scientists were equipoised towards the opinion of local mass and industrial experts however governmental organizations were keen towards giving absolute importance to a10 the fuzzy methodology very nicely accommodates the opinion of all stakeholders to reach best possible outcome while satisfying all decision makers the observations of upjn uppcb and cpcb 2017 on the open drains of river ganges demonstrate that the concentration of chromium in the wastewater collected from tanneries in the study area is 1000 times more than the prescribed standard of who these heavy metals accumulate in the body of the aquatics and destroy river ecosystem and ultimately humans consume these metals through food chain in addition the average concentration of bod in the open drains at kanpur allahabad and varanasi is 140 39 and 34 mg l respectively as compared to prescribed standard of 30 mg l cpcb 2017 a very high concentration of chromium and fluoride are also found in the groundwater near the industrial area of kanpur sinha et al 2016 70 of the kanpur varanasi stretch does not have proper sanitation infrastructure with more than 15 of householders in varanasi practicing open defecation along the banks of ganges resulting in high number of fecal coliform 40 000 mpn 100 ml bacteria in the river body cpcb 2017 therefore sustainable river basin management is highly dependent on enforcing regulations on such practices by providing adequate sanitation facilities also establishing effluent treatment plant must be made compulsory for all industrial units to reduce heavy metal concentration the alternative a5 obtains second rank score of 0 2205 0 0530 0 3881 which focuses on allocating funds for the development of hydro power as ganges has tremendous potential of 20711 mw astonishingly a5 too falls in the category of good and moderately good in spite of getting second rank such observations are due to lack of sound knowledge about the hydropower stations among the local mass and too much inclination of the downstream industrial experts towards enforcing regulations on hydropower and encouraging thermal power on the other hand there were mixed responses from the stakeholders of governmental organizations towards allocating funds for hydropower development for example cwc had positive opinion about the same cse had neutral opinion at present total installed capacity of 4987 20 mw is in operation and a total installed capacity of about 1307 0 mw are in various stages of construction cwc 2016 according to world bank hydropower potential not only promises clean energy and employment but is also considered as one of the most important strategic assets for economic development moreover over dependence on producing electricity from coal has resulted in india becoming one of largest emitter of co2 which causes global warming therefore regular allocation of funds for hydropower development can surely address problems of global warming lack of clean energy and economic development in similar manner the degree of goodness of each alternative can be interpreted the alternative a8 focuses on adopting extensive organic farming not only to control non point source pollution but also to improve crop production organic management greatly reduces soil loss and increases soil organic matter the biochemical and ecological characteristics and water holding capacity of the soil also improve which results in much larger yields compared to inorganic farming gomiero et al 2011 the inorganic chemicals enter into the river as runoff filling the water with dangerous cancer causing chemicals such as dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane ddt and hexachlorocyclohexane hch which kill many fish populations and other aquatics the organic soils abstract less water from the rivers and thus prevent the phenomenon of intensive wasteful irrigation at present 50 of the water abstracted from the ganges for irrigation is lost before it can nourish a single crop cpcb 2017 this is mainly because of poor infrastructure including cracked and poorly assembled pipelines andunsustainable inorganic agricultural practices organic farming thus supports the river to regain its flow as organic farms require optimum water another important strategy towards sustainable development is to introduce education pertaining to water resource development at all levels a9 this would not only bring the behavioral shift in the youth but also gives scope to promote extensive systematic and structured participation of various stakeholders in the process of planning monitoring and decision implementation for formulating comprehensive policies for sustainable water resource management jonsson 2007 educating and incorporating the viewpoints of local water users and ngos is an essential initiative towards efficient decision making muro and jeffrey 2012 abdullaev and rakhmatullaev 2015 although dams and barrages constructed in the upstream of river ganges are significantly impacting its e flow and resulting in deteriorated water quality even in the upstream stretches still the strategy a7 gets comparatively lower ranking i e 7 this might be due to lack of proper awareness and education amongst the stakeholders about the impact of multi purpose projects on the riverine ecosystem also such projects are considered as future sources of clean energy therefore a balanced approach is needed to re engineer the dams and barrages so that e flow of the river is maintained and at the same time they can serve as renewable source of energy in addition to discharge of mammoth quantities of wastewater in the river the industries located in the basin effect the flow of the river as they consume a lot of water for performing various operations if the usage of the river water for industries is reduced by providing an alternate means of water supply such as rain water harvesting it can significantly contribute towards the restoration of flow and thus improve the self purifying capacity of the river therefore decentralized rainwater harvesting and its utilization a11 has been considered as an ecologically sound solution ishaku et al 2013 rainwater can be stored in appropriate reservoirs which can be utilized to fulfill the objectives such as supplying water for industries irrigation domestic and commercial use and power generation liuzzo et al 2016 the least popular alternatives are a4 scores 0 0754 0 0062 0 1446 and a6 0 0563 0 0035 0 1092 these alternatives focus on accepting foreign investments to improve the existing technologies for wastewater treatment and to develop more hydrological monitoring stations the possible explanation behind not promoting too much technological intervention is to reduce the total daily maximum loadings at etp s and stp s the aim is to discourage wastewater generation itself not to bring more technology so that more wastewater can be treated also mismanaged governance and administration problems such as corruption cwc 2016 have made significant impact on the thought process of all stakeholders while ranking these strategies 4 3 sensitivity analysis in order to assess the robustness and applicability of hybridized fuzzy model in global scenario sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine the response of alternatives strategies when the membership function f is changed the impact of changing membership function on the ranking of the suitable alternatives has been investigated by incorporating two changes in the membership function i e μ 0 5 and μ 1 5 the results of sensitivity analysis have been represented in the table 10 the results clearly justify the robustness of the model as all the rankings remain the same although there are some minute variations in the defuzzified scores but it doesn t affect the ranking pattern of the alternatives fig 4 therefore the model is considered as an emphatic tool for decision makers to address the global uncertainty issues pertaining to sustainable management of river basin to assess and rank suitable strategies 4 4 outcomes of weighted overlaying geo statistical approach there are several impact parameters which affect overall dynamics of river ganges accordingly the parameters have been selected which govern the dynamics of river system such as e flow population quality etc and hence influencing the identification of priority zones within the basin the priority zones have been classified for two cases viz i focusing primarily on the top five strategic alternatives ii a separate analysis only for the alternative a5 rank 2 the parameters considered for case i are annual rainfall ar ground elevation ge soil erosion se groundwater recharge gr population density per km2 pd and observation stations os the parameters considered for case ii are existing dam location edl population density pd soil erosion se stream width sw annual average watershed yield aawy and ground elevation ge the relationship amongst these influencing parameters are assigned weightages in pursuance to their effectiveness and expert opinion using ahp technique that means parameters with higher weights have more influence as compared a parameter with lower weights on the selection of the suitable priority zones thus the priority zones provide essential guidance to the experts towards effective implementation of best strategies arc gis version 10 2 has been used to perform the weighted overlaying of the thematic maps the schematic procedure has been already explained in fig 3 six thematic maps for each case of the selected parameters have been generated by using arc gis figs 5 and 6 and figs 7 and 8 are used for case i and case ii respectively the six thematic maps are integrated using weighted overlay method to delineate the priority zones for implementing the strategies proposed by fh swot model the integrated maps representing the priority zones are shown in figs 9 and 10 experts have assigned weightages to each parameter based on heterogeneity relevance available data and the strategies obtained using fh swot model depending on the scores obtained using overlay operation priority zones have been classified into four categories for case i and five categories for case ii where black color indicates very high priority and green color represents very low priority fig 9 clearly indicates that kanpur varanasi stretch obtains very high priority black color according to cpcb 2017 this stretch has more than 1000 grossly polluting industries which lead to point source of pollution in the ganges also open defecation and inorganic farming practices leads to non point source pollution srinivas and singh 2018 moreover high population density in this stretch necessitates the need of introducing education about water resource planning and management to involve stakeholders at all levels in the decision making process therefore implementation of alternative a2 a8 a9 and a10 must be carried out first in very high priority zone on the other hand almost entire stretch of the basin near the river banks attains high priority zone red color indicating serious issues of sewage and industrial pollution lack of education about rivers and disturbance of river e flow due to dams and barrages tare et al 2017 although northern region is relatively free from industrial pollution but presence of many dams and barrages have destroyed the riverine ecosystem the basin area situated little far from ganges river acquires moderate priority yellow color in similar manner fig 10 classifies the priority zones for locating future hydro power stations which is considered as sustainable source of energy thus the results obtained from geo statistical approach prioritize the basin area thereby guiding stakeholders to plan the suitable implementation of strategic alternatives obtained from fh swot model 5 conclusions the present work proposes an advanced irbpm approach by coupling fuzzy based hybridized swot model with a geostatistical approach to formulate strategies for sustainable river basin planning and management along with identification of suitable priority zones the innovation of fh swot model is its ability to simultaneously address four important issues faced by decision makers while planning for sustainability of a river basin i e i uncertainties and conflicting interests among experts of different disciplines while analyzing huge data sets ii identification and prioritization of critical zones for implementing policies iii reliability on the model results with changes in time and preferences and iv obtaining optimistic pessimistic and nominal viewpoints of the decision makers another innovative feature of this study is to develop six different hybrid mechanisms which form a concrete basis to derive suitable strategic alternatives for optimal utilization of internal and external factors the flexible nature of these hybrids provide a latitude to the decision makers to customize the strategic alternatives suitable for the intended problem the model developed herein is superior than traditional optimization models due to its ability to address the uncertainties which arises due to conflicting interests of the stakeholders the uniqueness of the computerized gis and fuzzy based model developed in this paper is its flexible nature which makes it better than other static optimization models it means the model allows addition removal or adjustment in the data values of the environmental parameters which gives a very wide scope to the experts to change their opinion due to any concerns pertaining to sustainability with time the integration of fuzzy logic with a weighted overlay geostatistical approach has facilitated more effective and efficient planning as it delineates the priority zones where the best strategic alternatives derived from the study can be implemented immediately thus the proposed model is a comprehensive and pragmatic tool to deal with divergent interests multiple objectives and subjective assessments of sustainable water management group decision making has been performed by incorporating the opinion of stakeholders belonging to different disciplines based on monitored environmental data of 10 years and essential criteria although the methodology described in this study is applied to ganges river basin but the approach as well as strategic policies derived are important for sustainable management of any major water body of the world the robustness and global applicability of the model is justifiable as none of the alternatives sensitive to the changes in membership function values 0 5 or 1 5 amongst all strategies enforcement of strict regulations on heavy metal and sewage discharge and open defection have been found to be most suitable strategy followed by developing hydro power and adaptation of organic farming also a significant emphasis has been given to educate people about the scenario of indian rivers and thus incorporate opinion of wide range of stakeholders in the decision making process although other strategies obtain comparatively lower ranks their relevance towards achieving sustainability cannot be minimized as very less variation is observed in their overall scores as compared to other alternatives these strategies address certain essential ecological issues like e flow of rivers conservation of biodiversity around the river adopting strict regulation on dams and barrages practicing rainwater harvesting etc and thus contribute tremendously towards sustainable management of any river basin of the world the decision support framework proposed in this paper can be applied to many diverse and complex problems related to sustainable development of river basins where data availability is not constrained the study can be further advanced or refined by using more accurate and wide range of inter related data sets and further advanced fuzzy techniques such as interval valued fuzzy sets also results can be made more credible by using more relevant and accurate thematic maps for delineating the priority zones of the of the river basin appendix a supplementary data supplementary data associated with this

7129,sustainable river basin planning and management is a complex and uncertain phenomenon involving social economic environmental and several technical criteria despite global advancement the problems associated sustainability have not been sufficiently addressed due to mismanaged governance poorly implemented policies lack of suitable data and over exploitation of river resources therefore major rivers basins across the globe need an integrative and comprehensive strategic approach considering the diverse stakeholder s perspective and conflicting criteria pertaining to sustainable management the present study develops a decision support framework to assess the sustainability by coupling an improved fuzzy based hybridized strength weakness opportunities and threats model fh swot with a geostatistical approach to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model ganges river basin india has been taken as a case study the novelty of the study is to devise six different hybrid mechanisms under fh swot framework to reach best possible strategic alternatives along with nominal optimistic and pessimistic perspectives of the stakeholders to enhance the model s productivity it is coupled with weighted overlay geo statistical approach to identify prioritize the most vulnerable critical locations which needs suitable implementation of strategic alternatives derived using fh swot model the fh swot model developed herein simultaneously delineates strategic alternatives and corresponding priority zones while addressing the uncertainties related to stakeholder s conflicts and imprecise data to reach optimal pessimistic and nominal viewpoints which leads to development of an innovative and comprehensive decision support framework for assessing sustainability the key policies derived from the study involve enforcing regulations on disposal of heavy metals developing hydropower adaptation of organic farming education and participation of stakeholders regulations on dams and barrages with a score of 0 2453 0 2205 0 2088 0 1898 and 0 1288 respectively also kanpur varanasi stretch has been delineated as very high priority zone followed by regions located along the banks of ganges sensitivity analysis proves that the model is robust and can be used by the environment managers towards sustainable planning and management of any river basin lakes wetlands or any major water body of the world keywords decision support systems fuzzy swot method geographical information systems river basin planning sustainability water resources management 1 introduction over the past three decades the accelerated industrialization and urbanization across the globe have been posing a huge challenge to the water resource policy makers to formulate strategies which ensure sustainable development of water resources koop et al 2017 in many developing countries such as india and china water bodies are heavily polluted and availability of freshwater resources is becoming limited goonetilleke and vithanage 2017 wrg 2009 estimated 40 shortage of freshwater by the year 2030 over abstraction of river water resources and heavy pollution caused from industrial and domestic sources solid wastes and agricultural runoffs will be significantly affecting 15 of the global population ligtvoet et al 2014 although it is evident that there is a need to strike a balance between so called developmental activities and sustainability still most of the river basins are under constant threat due to mismanaged government bodies inadequate knowledge about the fundamentals of the riverine ecosystems and its dynamics poorly implemented policies and lack of in depth planning mencio et al 2010 sustainability of a river basin depends on many inter related factors some of these fundamental factors are river water discharge sediments and bio diversity arthington et al 2010 liu et al 2017 an integrated study of these factors is essential for developing suitable policies however there is a general lack of awareness even amongst the experts to assess the impact of any development project on these essential factors of the river as a result river ecosystem gets imbalanced with time giving rise to numerous problems such as water scarcity reduced self purifying capacity flood risks loss of delta formation toxicity and extinction of aquatics meeting such challenges needs a suitable combination of good governance local general mass and expert stakeholders who can effectively manage the long term uncertain and imperfectly known risks related to sustainability of a river basin moreover there are multiple decision makers with contrasting interests and objectives and thus the strategic policies should reflect the viewpoint of all the stakeholders towards the perspective of sustainability and development since there are several factors associated with uncertainty and conflicts amongst stakeholders there is no single best solution to address the issues related to river basin an integrative approach which provides all possible alternative solutions along with their relevance is needed patterson et al 2013 the approach should be flexible enough to adapt to the changing environment which helps in designing the proposed strategies reflecting the individual participation from the bottommost level of regional stakeholders bryan et al 2010 these days integrated river basin planning and management irbpm is found to be an effective approach as it involves comprehensive viewpoints of multifaceted decision makers karamouz et al 2009 srinivas et al 2017 however successful implementation of irbpm needs stakeholder involvement along with proper consideration of all social indicators such as ethical and cultural norms and institutional attitude towards sustainability belay et al 2010 the process develops a systematic plan for a river basin while considering socio economic ecological and environmental criteria it is also important to develop a suitable mathematical model which can evaluate the performance of these criteria by incorporating the experience knowledge and perception of inter disciplinary experts having conflicting judgements therefore a multi criteria group decision making mcgdm framework is needed to implement irbpm where strategists stakeholders define realistic alternatives possibility of outcomes risk of data error and conflicts in stakeholder s criteria mergias et al 2007 garfi et al 2011 determining policies for sustainable management of a river is a complex process as the mathematical model involves numerous environmental discharge water quality and river ecosystem and human economic social educational and political criteria as well as diverse decision makers therefore multi criteria assessment models are generally preferred over traditional optimization models phillis and andriantiatsaholiniaina 2001 bick et al 2018 developing models involving multiple criteria and group decision making using classical optimization makes the process tedious and complex as optimization models do not offer the flexibility to incorporate the opinion of several decision makers simultaneously moreover as the number of criteria increases formulation of multiple objective functions and constraints becomes difficult also it is not possible to perform pairwise comparison among various criteria using optimization modeling however in case of criteria assessment models pairwise comparison group decision making and incorporation of diverse opinion of decision makers can be easily performed in order to formulate objective function and constraints of an optimization model there must exist some relationship amongst the criteria unlike criteria assessment models where such pre requisite is not needed one of the major drawback of optimization model is although it can give number of optimal solutions but it doesn t mathematically explain the degree of acceptability of each solution based on the preferences of decision makers and doesn t assign rankings to the solution set while determining the optimal solution set such models generally assign weightages to each objective function rather than criteria and it is quite difficult to assess the impact of each criterion on the optimal solution especially when decision criteria and experts are more in number on the other hand criteria assessment models assess the importance of criteria and determine the degree of impact of each criterion on the final decision solution also each criterion can be assigned weights depending on its ideal value srinivas and singh 2018 such flexibility is limited to objective functions in case of optimization models therefore criteria assessment models are preferred by the experts over optimization models for framing sustainable policies many times the quantitative environmental and socio economical information is available in fragmentary form and very exhaustive nature of such information hampers its direct usefulness in formulating policies phillis and andriantiatsaholiniaina 2001 not only there are no common dimensions of measurement for such parameters of sustainability but quantitative criteria for certain values are missing and cannot be modeled using optimization tools hence a comprehensive model which combines multidimensional components while addressing the uncertainty is needed on the other hand model should be flexible to add remove sustainability parameters in order to obtain a better assessment of the policies azarnivand et al 2015 sustainable river basin management problems are often subjected to uncertainties caused due to randomness and imprecision rehana and mujumdar 2009 srinivas and singh 2018 randomness is mainly caused by the random nature of data such as water quality stream flow and other environmental data the uncertainty due to imprecision is induced by the conflicting judgements of various stakeholders towards the criteria and strategic alternatives recently fuzzy based mcgdm techniques have emerged as one of the best approaches to deal with the uncertainties singh et al 2007 2015 pan et al 2017 srinivas and singh 2017 fuzzy logic plays an emphatic role in framing irbpm policies by classifying and quantifying the uncertainties using membership functions defined over appropriate fuzzy scale singh et al 2017 srinivas et al 2017 fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp has been intensively applied to formulate strategies focused on environmental conservation and water resource management such as flood risk assessment zou et al 2013 geological environmental impact assessment and pollution assessment of groundwater resources azarnivand et al 2015 recent research is specifically directed towards enhancing the existing fuzzy mcgdm methodologies to handle the uncertainties in an effective manner qin 2012 expressed uncertainties as fuzzy parameterized stochastic distributions to assess risks associated with environmental pollution control problems wang et al 2014 developed fuzzy binary comparison method fbcm and applied the theory of variable fuzzy sets vfs for assessing the water quality of tseng wen river qin and xu 2015 developed superiority inferiority based sequential fuzzy programming sisfp model for supporting water supply demand analysis under uncertainty for tianjin binhai new area china srinivas and singh 2017 developed group decision making framework using interval valued fuzzy sets and evaluated the impact of industrial wastewater on ganges river basin india despite advancements in fuzzy techniques limited research has been performed wherein conflicts of decision makers and imprecise data can be simultaneously addressed while considering the probability distribution of the fuzzy numbers used to represent decision maker s viewpoint thus the present study develops an improved fuzzy approach which addresses these limitations by calculating the optimal pessimistic and nominal viewpoints of the stakeholders towards sustainable policies in addition to using modified fuzzy techniques irbpm decision making framework can be further enhanced by inseminating the geographical information system gis the primary objective of irbpm approach is to identify hot spot priority areas with high problem intensity which can be very well achieved by using overlay analysis of gis mcdonnell 2008 even in the absence of complete understanding of the parameters and their inter relationships or of adequate data gis develops geostatistical maps to frame consensus amongst the stakeholders another unique contribution of gis in irbpm is its ability to aggregate geographical data and expert judgments which provides a flexible framework to the experts to explore understand and redefine a decision problem boroushaki and malczewski 2010 júnez ferreira and herrera 2013 abdalla et al 2014 developed a gis supported fuzzy set approach for flood risk assessment in the red river in southern manitoba canada singh and katpatal 2017 developed a simplified approach using multicriteria analysis weighted overlay analytical hierarchical process fuzzy and geo statistical kriging to design groundwater level network of the wain ganga sub basin india therefore coupling fuzzy based mcgdm techniques with gis is an emphatic irbpm approach to address the issues pertaining to sustainable development procuring and analyzing the viewpoints of stakeholders can be performed in numerous ways safaei et al 2013 one of the suitable ways is to analyze the base line river basin for identification and categorization of internal strengths weakness and external influence of possible opportunities threats using a strength weakness opportunity threats swot model belay et al 2010 bunting et al 2016 swot model derives hybrid mechanisms based on optimal usage of internal strengths opportunities against external weaknesses threats using swot tows matrix thus swot model provides a managerial and structural strategic framework to devise possible strategic alternatives for sustainable river basin planning also coupling fuzzy set theory with swot framework addresses the uncertainties these uncertainties are addressed by quantifying the stakeholder s preferences using a membership function defined over a fuzzy scale for example a particular stakeholder may consider an alternative to be good however he is uncertain about to what degree the alternative is good fuzzy logic quantifies the linguistic judgement good of the stakeholder using a suitable membership function by defining an uncertainty range for the set good over a fuzzy scale this gives latitude to the decision maker to quantify how good an alternative is based on above discussion authors have devised an innovative decision support framework for assessing sustainability of ganges river basin india using an improved fuzzy based hybridized swot fh swot model linked with geostatistical approach the framework identifies the suitable alternatives for sustainable river basin development while considering the uncertainties associated with data and decision maker preferences conflicts a distinctive characteristic of fh swot model is the derivation of hybrid mechanisms using the swot analysis based on the judgements of multiple stakeholders which gives concrete foundation to generate strategic alternatives such unique and efficient approach of deriving alternatives leads to effective use of the sustainability information strengths weakness opportunities and threats also nominal optimistic and pessimistic perspectives of the stakeholders towards the alternatives have been evaluated moreover coupling of overlaying technique of gis reveals the critical priority zones which facilitates the experts to implement derived strategies this not only enhances decision making but also provides a holistic tool to the experts to apply the model results in the given priority zones on immediate basis another exclusive feature of the model is its flexibility which allows the decision makers to modify add delete sustainability parameters with time and their intensity 2 methodology the methodology adopted in this study is an amalgamation of three models namely hybridized swot model improved fuzzy model and geostatistical approach for better clarity the same has been represented diagrammatically fig 1 2 1 selection of appropriate stakeholders for developing swot model since sustainable river basin planning and management is a complex phenomenon there is always some uncertainty associated with the forecasting of future scenario however most likely possibility can be determined by appropriate planning and management an effective decision making system involves multi disciplinary inputs therefore group decision making multiple stakeholders is considered as most desirable and sound approach srinivas and singh 2017 hence preliminary step of a swot model is to choose appropriate expert stakeholders 2 2 selection of criteria for sustainable development for swot model in swot model the experts stakeholders categorize the governing factors into two distinctive categories the factors that can be influenced by governing and management authorities are considered as internal factors while those that can influence the basin management but are not under the control of governing authorities are considered as external factors these factors are decided based on the decision criteria chosen for the river basin in general the various criteria pertaining to sustainability are classified into four categories namely social economic environmental and technical category however selection of appropriate criteria depends on the nature of the river basin taken into consideration garfi et al 2011 2 3 developing swot and hybridized matrix the internal and external factors defined by the stakeholders are represented in the form of swot matrix internal factors include internals strength s and internal weakness w while the external factors comprise of external opportunities o and external threats t these factors are systematically analyzed by the stakeholders to formulate strategies which are represented using hybridized matrix hybridized matrix formulation follows the principle of interlinking internal and external factors that complement each other and thus utilize the positive characteristics to diminish maximum negative characteristics an exclusive feature of the model is derivation of appropriate hybrid mechanisms to address the problems of a river basin these mechanisms are used to derive possible alternatives for most optimal utilization of internal and external factors for example one of the mechanism could be strength opportunity threats sot mechanism where internal strengths are used to take advantage of external opportunities and reduce external threats in similar manner other hybrid mechanisms can be derived the stakeholders give their expert judgments based on the environmental data provided by the governmental agencies the robustness and flexibility of swot model provides latitude to the decision makers to customize the strategic alternatives suitable for the intended problem based on stakeholder s feedback the possible alternatives are given preference scores against each sustainability criteria for prioritizing alternatives strategically and dealing with the uncertainties the hybridized swot model is analyzed using modified fuzzy framework where nominal optimistic and pessimistic perspective of the stakeholders is evaluated 2 4 coupling hybridized swot model with modified fuzzy approach and overlay analysis 2 4 1 modified fuzzy approach as discussed earlier the sustainability criteria and decision alternatives derived using hybridized swot model need to be evaluated and ranked by incorporating the various uncertainties therefore swot model is integrated with a modified fuzzy based multi criteria decision making tool traditional fuzzy analytical process fahp has been modified to have better assessment of the sustainability 2 4 1 1 obtaining pairwise comparison and aggregate decision matrices pairwise comparison of the decision criteria and alternatives is performed using the fuzzy scales provided in table 1 the interval φ between the elements of fuzzy triplets a c has been taken as 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 to obtain three different kinds of membership functions against each linguistic scale these intervals are decided based on the data values of the input parameters and the degree up to which the decision makers want to access the uncertainty for illustration an interval value φ of 0 5 1 0 1 5 has been chosen so as to provide latitude to the decision makers to access various uncertainty ranges in a balanced manner however very low and high values 0 5 and 1 5 would lead to too many and too less linguistic representations of the data therefore any value can be taken between 0 5 and 1 5 singh et al 2015 if i and j are two criteria then each element of the pairwise comparison matrix is represented in the form of a fuzzy triplet mij for illustration the matrix formulated based on the opinion on 1st stakeholder is represented as a1 using eq 1 1 a 1 1 m 12 m 1 n 1 m 12 1 m 2 n 1 m 1 n 1 m 2 n 1 since there are multiple stakeholders all matrices need to be aggregated to obtain an aggregated decision matrix aij for the criteria and alternatives each element of the matrix is calculated by computing the geometric mean of the opinion of all the stakeholders as represented by eq 2 given below 2 a ij k 1 p x ij k 1 n k 1 p y ij k 1 n k 1 p z ij k 1 n a ij k x ij k y ij k z ij k for i j 1 n and k 1 p where a ij k is a fuzzy triplet that represents the opinion of a particular stakeholder and k k 1 k 2 k p represents the set of decision makers consider a 1 x ij y ij z ij and i j 1 n then a ij s k 1 p x ij 1 n b ij s k 1 p y ij 1 n c ij s k 1 p z ij 1 n a s j 1 n x ij s b s j 1 n y ij s and c s j 1 n z ij s 2 4 1 2 obtaining weights of criteria and alternatives the final weights of the decision criteria are calculated using the eq 3 given below 3 w i a ij s c s b ij s b s c ij s a s the aggregated decision matrix for the alternatives corresponding to each criterion is computed from the opinion of the individual stakeholders towards each alternative fuzzy weightage of each alternative j corresponding to criterion i u ij is also evaluated using eq 3 the overall fuzzy weightage of each alternative f j of each alternative is calculated by using eq 4 as given below 4 f j j 1 n w i u ij these fuzzified weightages are defuzzified to obtain quantifiable results consider two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers namely u 1 a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 and u 2 a 2 b 2 c 2 d 2 then the process of defuzzification follows the following laws represented using eq 5 5 u 1 u 2 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 c 1 c 2 d 1 d 2 t u 1 u 2 a 1 a 2 r 1 r 2 b 1 b 2 c 1 c 2 d 1 d 2 v 1 v 2 r 1 b 1 a 1 b 2 a 2 r 2 a 2 b 1 a 1 a 1 b 2 a 2 v 1 d 1 c 1 d 2 c 2 v 2 d 2 d 1 c 1 d 1 d 2 c 2 in order to convert the trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to triangular fuzzy numbers terms b 1 c 1 andb 2 c 2 can be assumed if t t 1 t 2 then the membership function t t 1 t 2 can be obtained using table 2 when a 1 a 2 x b 1 b 2 x i can be calculated using the eq 6 as given below 6 x i r i 1 α 2 r i 1 α a i for i 1 2 thus x can be calculated using the eq 7 as given below 7 x r 11 r 21 α 2 r 12 r 22 α a 1 a 2 similarly when c 1 c 2 x d 1 d 2 then eq 8 can be used 8 x v 11 v 21 α 2 v 12 v 22 α d 1 d 2 2 4 2 obtaining nominal optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints of the stakeholders the improved fuzzy methodology uses center of gravity method for defuzzification the nominal defuzzified score of an alternative can be calculated by using eq 9 9 z nominal f a d x μ f x dx a d μ f x dx where z nominal f is the defuzzified of f and μ f x is the membership function of f the results obtained using eq 9 represent the general or neutral viewpoint of the stakeholders as fuzzy number represents uncertain values it is important to consider the overall possibility distribution in its evaluation moreover the evaluation of a fuzzy number can be easily affected by an evaluation viewpoint such as decision makers preference thus the results can be further improved by considering the overall probability distributions of the fuzzy numbers lee kwang and jee hyong 1999 therefore optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints of the stakeholders towards each alternative is obtained by using eqs 10 and 11 as given below 10 z optimistic f a d x 2 μ f x dx a d μ f x dx 11 z pessimistic f a d 2 x x 2 μ f x dx a d μ f x dx 2 4 3 geo statistical approach weighted overlay analysis the strategic alternatives obtained from fh swot model can be implemented swiftly by identifying the priority zones in the basin which need immediate attention of the decision makers therefore entire river basin has been classified based on priorities of different zones using weighted overlay geo statistical approach these priority zones are obtained based on certain parameters which affect the sustainability criteria of the river representing the state of river basin in gis framework not only explains the criticality of ecological issues in a better way but also gives an extensive scope to arrive at productive useful and accurate decisions weighted overlay method involves overlapping of more than one layer in the form of raster mapping based on weightages and priorities overlay output raster is classified into corresponding priority zones esri 2011 the methodology represents all the parameters in raster thematic map which is georeferenced on a common coordinate projection the combined output layer is further classified using gis soft tool based on weights and individual features of each thematic raster the schematic procedure of weighted overlay method has been explained in fig 2 based on opinion of expert stakeholders all the weightages w i are integrated with each raster layer which takes care of the intensity of influence caused by each parameter priority zone classification function eq 12 considers the assigned weights from every overlay thematic raster and also the priorities p i of the parameters 12 priority region i 1 n p i w i 3 case study ganges river basin of india fig 3 has been declared as one of the ten most polluted basins of the world wwf international switzerland ganges is the largest river in india draining 26 3 of the total geographical area of the country the basin lies between east longitudes 73 2 89 5 and north latitudes 21 6 31 21 with a total length of about 2525 km the river possesses excellent self cleansing ability which allows for assimilation and treatment of biological waste however excessive withdrawals for irrigation industrial and power generation purposes and discharge of hazardous effluents have inevitably contaminated the river thus river water has become breeding ground of many water borne diseases such as cancer kidney problems brain hemorrhage and other gastro intestinal problems the lower stretches of the river especially kanpur varanasi are no longer considered as life supportive and it has become a serious challenge for decision makers to resuscitate the river on the other hand the upper stretches are over crowded with dams and barrages leading to a huge diversion of water which reduces its discharge to mere 15 billion m3 year as a result during dry season discharge at kanpur allahabad and varanasi is merely 90 386 m3 s 279 997 m3 s 278 1160 m3 s respectively the existing sewage and effluent treatment plants lack adequate technology and capacity to treat the waste and nearly 50 of untreated wastewaters are discharged into river over 1 3 billion litres of sewage 260 million litres of industrial waste runoff consisting 6 million tonnes of fertilizers and 9000 tonnes of pesticides used in agriculture and very large quantities of solid waste open defecation are daily released into river cpcb 2017 there are constant endeavors from governmental organizations to restore the water quality of ganges but due to lack of public awareness and sufficient knowledge about river system poor participation from stakeholders and corruption the policies and solutions are not implemented properly sustainability of the river is under a severe threat and needs an immediate attention therefore swot analysis performed based on potential criteria plays a crucial role in identifying the major problems critical locations and prospective solutions 3 1 selection of stakeholders and sustainability criteria the study procures the feedback of multiple stakeholders belonging to four different institutions namely research and scientific organization of the basin pollution control agencies non governmental organization industrial experts and representative of local communities ten year environmental data 2005 2015 of various sustainability criteria have been obtained from central pollution control board cpcb 2017 the potential sustainability criteria chosen for the study have been classified into five different categories as listed in table 3 each of these criteria have been chosen by conducting an in depth study of the river basin previous policies of sustainability and secondary literature cwc 2016 mowr 2017 srinivas and singh 2018 some of the primary reasons behind choosing each criterion have been listed in the second column of table 3 these criteria form the basis for formulating hybridized swot matrix and appropriate strategic alternatives each criterion is evaluated by the stakeholders based on the sustainability goals set by the water resource river development and ganga rejuvenation ministry of the country mowr 2017 3 2 formulation of swot matrix the 4 expert stakeholders chosen for formulating the strategies for ganges river basin have obtained a total of 43 significant factors which are categorized using swot matrix table 4 the strengths 9 factors are derived based on the excellent natural characteristics of the river basin and governmental focus on improving the river s ecosystem weaknesses 13 factors are obtained due to insufficient knowledge poor administration mismanagement and over exploitation of river due to human intervention opportunities 11 factors are primarily related to usage of latest technology for treating the wastewater appropriate budget allocation by the government rising concern amongst people and political arena finally threats 10 factors are caused due to over abstraction of water by the multi purpose projects climate change lack of funds economic crisis and conflicts among state governments 4 results and discussion 4 1 deriving strategic alternatives from hybridized swot matrix the swot matrix has been reviewed systematically by the expert stakeholders based on their experience previous literature garousi et al 2013 srinivas and singh 2017 available data cwc 2016 and governmental analysis cpcb 2017 the foundational principle and robustness of swot model have been utilized to address ganges river basin issues the model connects internal and external characteristics together to formulate most feasible alternatives taking advantage of flexibility nature of swot model six hybrid mechanisms have been developed these mechanisms are described briefly as given below strength opportunity threats mechanism sot using internal strengths to take advantage of external opportunities and reduce external threats strength opportunity so using internal strengths to take advantage of external opportunities strength opportunity weakness threat mechanism sowt using internal strengths and external opportunities to remove internal weakness and assess upcoming threats strength threats mechanism st using internal strengths to act strategically against potential threats opportunity threat weakness mechanism otw exterminating threats by using internal opportunities and indirectly removing internal weakness that caused potential threat weakness opportunity mechanism wo removing internal weakness using external opportunities a total of 11 alternatives have been devised based on these hybrid mechanisms table 5 although swot model is capable of formulating appropriate strategies for a water resource planning and management problem it does not provide any mathematical ground to determine the relative importance of the factors to obtain the most appropriate strategy alternative s for sustainable development hybridized matrices of the swot model are integrated with a modified fuzzy multi criteria group decision making technique therefore the decision support framework is termed as fuzzy based hybridized swot model fh swot modified fuzzy approach not only provides a buffer for uncertainties but also evaluates nominal optimistic and pessimistic view points of the group of stakeholders each of these alternatives is now rated under five sustainable development decision criteria chosen in the previous section 4 2 outcomes of modified fuzzy approach the relative fuzzy weightages of each decision criterion and each alternative with respect to all criteria are obtained by using pairwise comparisons matrices which are formulated under the guidance of expert stakeholders the subjective objective opinions of the four experts are obtained using a questionnaire their opinions are fuzzified using fuzzy scale provided in table 1 and pairwise comparison matrix for each expert is derived using eq 1 table 6 represents the aggregated pairwise comparison decision matrix of all criteria where each element of the matrix represents an aggregated fuzzy triangular number a c obtained using eq 2 the weightages of each criteria are obtained by using table 6 and eq 3 in similar way pairwise comparison decision matrix is derived for all alternatives against each criterion table 7 represents aggregated fuzzy ratings of all the alternatives corresponding to each decision criteria where each element fuzzy triangular number of the matrix x y z represents aggregated judgement of the experts to obtain the aggregated fuzzy weightages of all the alternatives certain parameters described using eq 5 are calculated the values of these parameters r1 r2 v1 v2 are listed in table 8 the aggregated fuzzy weightages along with the nominal optimistic and pessimistic scores are obtained for each alternative using eqs 6 8 the values of x represented using eqs 6 8 are substituted in eqs 9 11 to obtain the formulas of modified evaluated components given below using eqs 13 15 13 z nominal a b x r 1 x 2 r 2 x a dx c d x v 1 x 2 v 2 x d dx a b r 1 x 2 r 2 x a dx c d v 1 x 2 v 2 x d dx 14 z optimistic a b x 2 r 1 x 2 r 2 x a dx c d x 2 v 1 x 2 v 2 x d dx a b r 1 x 2 r 2 x a dx c d v 1 x 2 v 2 x d dx 15 z pessimistic a b 2 x x 2 r 1 x 2 r 2 x a dx c d 2 x x 2 v 1 x 2 v 2 x d dx a b r 1 x 2 r 2 x a dx c d v 1 x 2 v 2 x d dx the results corresponding to nominal optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints of the stakeholders are presented in the table 9 it can be clearly inferred that in all three cases alternatives obtain similar rankings but their scores degree of goodness differ in each case in addition the results reveal interesting facts pertaining to sustainable development and risk assessment these results have been validated by comparing them with the recent works of governmental organizations cwc 2014 cpcb 2017 and few secondary sources chaudhary et al 2017 srinivas et al 2017 the goal of the policy makers is to assess the risks associated with ganges river basin which would serve as a foundation to formulate best strategies for sustainable planning and implementation according to the analysis enforcing strict regulations on heavy metals and sewage disposal and open defecation a10 is the best way of reviving river ecosystem with a score of 0 2453 nominal 0 0654 optimistic and 0 4251 pessimistic on the scale of 0 1 0 0 25 good 0 25 0 50 moderately good 0 50 0 75 very good 0 75 1 absolutely good it is very interesting to note that despite obtaining highest rank alternative a10 falls in the preliminary categories of good it is because of the divergent interests of the stakeholders for example local mass is not so much in favor of reducing open defection due to cultural reasons and industrial experts were not so inclined towards enforcing strict regulations on heavy metals and sewage disposal researchers and scientists were equipoised towards the opinion of local mass and industrial experts however governmental organizations were keen towards giving absolute importance to a10 the fuzzy methodology very nicely accommodates the opinion of all stakeholders to reach best possible outcome while satisfying all decision makers the observations of upjn uppcb and cpcb 2017 on the open drains of river ganges demonstrate that the concentration of chromium in the wastewater collected from tanneries in the study area is 1000 times more than the prescribed standard of who these heavy metals accumulate in the body of the aquatics and destroy river ecosystem and ultimately humans consume these metals through food chain in addition the average concentration of bod in the open drains at kanpur allahabad and varanasi is 140 39 and 34 mg l respectively as compared to prescribed standard of 30 mg l cpcb 2017 a very high concentration of chromium and fluoride are also found in the groundwater near the industrial area of kanpur sinha et al 2016 70 of the kanpur varanasi stretch does not have proper sanitation infrastructure with more than 15 of householders in varanasi practicing open defecation along the banks of ganges resulting in high number of fecal coliform 40 000 mpn 100 ml bacteria in the river body cpcb 2017 therefore sustainable river basin management is highly dependent on enforcing regulations on such practices by providing adequate sanitation facilities also establishing effluent treatment plant must be made compulsory for all industrial units to reduce heavy metal concentration the alternative a5 obtains second rank score of 0 2205 0 0530 0 3881 which focuses on allocating funds for the development of hydro power as ganges has tremendous potential of 20711 mw astonishingly a5 too falls in the category of good and moderately good in spite of getting second rank such observations are due to lack of sound knowledge about the hydropower stations among the local mass and too much inclination of the downstream industrial experts towards enforcing regulations on hydropower and encouraging thermal power on the other hand there were mixed responses from the stakeholders of governmental organizations towards allocating funds for hydropower development for example cwc had positive opinion about the same cse had neutral opinion at present total installed capacity of 4987 20 mw is in operation and a total installed capacity of about 1307 0 mw are in various stages of construction cwc 2016 according to world bank hydropower potential not only promises clean energy and employment but is also considered as one of the most important strategic assets for economic development moreover over dependence on producing electricity from coal has resulted in india becoming one of largest emitter of co2 which causes global warming therefore regular allocation of funds for hydropower development can surely address problems of global warming lack of clean energy and economic development in similar manner the degree of goodness of each alternative can be interpreted the alternative a8 focuses on adopting extensive organic farming not only to control non point source pollution but also to improve crop production organic management greatly reduces soil loss and increases soil organic matter the biochemical and ecological characteristics and water holding capacity of the soil also improve which results in much larger yields compared to inorganic farming gomiero et al 2011 the inorganic chemicals enter into the river as runoff filling the water with dangerous cancer causing chemicals such as dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane ddt and hexachlorocyclohexane hch which kill many fish populations and other aquatics the organic soils abstract less water from the rivers and thus prevent the phenomenon of intensive wasteful irrigation at present 50 of the water abstracted from the ganges for irrigation is lost before it can nourish a single crop cpcb 2017 this is mainly because of poor infrastructure including cracked and poorly assembled pipelines andunsustainable inorganic agricultural practices organic farming thus supports the river to regain its flow as organic farms require optimum water another important strategy towards sustainable development is to introduce education pertaining to water resource development at all levels a9 this would not only bring the behavioral shift in the youth but also gives scope to promote extensive systematic and structured participation of various stakeholders in the process of planning monitoring and decision implementation for formulating comprehensive policies for sustainable water resource management jonsson 2007 educating and incorporating the viewpoints of local water users and ngos is an essential initiative towards efficient decision making muro and jeffrey 2012 abdullaev and rakhmatullaev 2015 although dams and barrages constructed in the upstream of river ganges are significantly impacting its e flow and resulting in deteriorated water quality even in the upstream stretches still the strategy a7 gets comparatively lower ranking i e 7 this might be due to lack of proper awareness and education amongst the stakeholders about the impact of multi purpose projects on the riverine ecosystem also such projects are considered as future sources of clean energy therefore a balanced approach is needed to re engineer the dams and barrages so that e flow of the river is maintained and at the same time they can serve as renewable source of energy in addition to discharge of mammoth quantities of wastewater in the river the industries located in the basin effect the flow of the river as they consume a lot of water for performing various operations if the usage of the river water for industries is reduced by providing an alternate means of water supply such as rain water harvesting it can significantly contribute towards the restoration of flow and thus improve the self purifying capacity of the river therefore decentralized rainwater harvesting and its utilization a11 has been considered as an ecologically sound solution ishaku et al 2013 rainwater can be stored in appropriate reservoirs which can be utilized to fulfill the objectives such as supplying water for industries irrigation domestic and commercial use and power generation liuzzo et al 2016 the least popular alternatives are a4 scores 0 0754 0 0062 0 1446 and a6 0 0563 0 0035 0 1092 these alternatives focus on accepting foreign investments to improve the existing technologies for wastewater treatment and to develop more hydrological monitoring stations the possible explanation behind not promoting too much technological intervention is to reduce the total daily maximum loadings at etp s and stp s the aim is to discourage wastewater generation itself not to bring more technology so that more wastewater can be treated also mismanaged governance and administration problems such as corruption cwc 2016 have made significant impact on the thought process of all stakeholders while ranking these strategies 4 3 sensitivity analysis in order to assess the robustness and applicability of hybridized fuzzy model in global scenario sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine the response of alternatives strategies when the membership function f is changed the impact of changing membership function on the ranking of the suitable alternatives has been investigated by incorporating two changes in the membership function i e μ 0 5 and μ 1 5 the results of sensitivity analysis have been represented in the table 10 the results clearly justify the robustness of the model as all the rankings remain the same although there are some minute variations in the defuzzified scores but it doesn t affect the ranking pattern of the alternatives fig 4 therefore the model is considered as an emphatic tool for decision makers to address the global uncertainty issues pertaining to sustainable management of river basin to assess and rank suitable strategies 4 4 outcomes of weighted overlaying geo statistical approach there are several impact parameters which affect overall dynamics of river ganges accordingly the parameters have been selected which govern the dynamics of river system such as e flow population quality etc and hence influencing the identification of priority zones within the basin the priority zones have been classified for two cases viz i focusing primarily on the top five strategic alternatives ii a separate analysis only for the alternative a5 rank 2 the parameters considered for case i are annual rainfall ar ground elevation ge soil erosion se groundwater recharge gr population density per km2 pd and observation stations os the parameters considered for case ii are existing dam location edl population density pd soil erosion se stream width sw annual average watershed yield aawy and ground elevation ge the relationship amongst these influencing parameters are assigned weightages in pursuance to their effectiveness and expert opinion using ahp technique that means parameters with higher weights have more influence as compared a parameter with lower weights on the selection of the suitable priority zones thus the priority zones provide essential guidance to the experts towards effective implementation of best strategies arc gis version 10 2 has been used to perform the weighted overlaying of the thematic maps the schematic procedure has been already explained in fig 3 six thematic maps for each case of the selected parameters have been generated by using arc gis figs 5 and 6 and figs 7 and 8 are used for case i and case ii respectively the six thematic maps are integrated using weighted overlay method to delineate the priority zones for implementing the strategies proposed by fh swot model the integrated maps representing the priority zones are shown in figs 9 and 10 experts have assigned weightages to each parameter based on heterogeneity relevance available data and the strategies obtained using fh swot model depending on the scores obtained using overlay operation priority zones have been classified into four categories for case i and five categories for case ii where black color indicates very high priority and green color represents very low priority fig 9 clearly indicates that kanpur varanasi stretch obtains very high priority black color according to cpcb 2017 this stretch has more than 1000 grossly polluting industries which lead to point source of pollution in the ganges also open defecation and inorganic farming practices leads to non point source pollution srinivas and singh 2018 moreover high population density in this stretch necessitates the need of introducing education about water resource planning and management to involve stakeholders at all levels in the decision making process therefore implementation of alternative a2 a8 a9 and a10 must be carried out first in very high priority zone on the other hand almost entire stretch of the basin near the river banks attains high priority zone red color indicating serious issues of sewage and industrial pollution lack of education about rivers and disturbance of river e flow due to dams and barrages tare et al 2017 although northern region is relatively free from industrial pollution but presence of many dams and barrages have destroyed the riverine ecosystem the basin area situated little far from ganges river acquires moderate priority yellow color in similar manner fig 10 classifies the priority zones for locating future hydro power stations which is considered as sustainable source of energy thus the results obtained from geo statistical approach prioritize the basin area thereby guiding stakeholders to plan the suitable implementation of strategic alternatives obtained from fh swot model 5 conclusions the present work proposes an advanced irbpm approach by coupling fuzzy based hybridized swot model with a geostatistical approach to formulate strategies for sustainable river basin planning and management along with identification of suitable priority zones the innovation of fh swot model is its ability to simultaneously address four important issues faced by decision makers while planning for sustainability of a river basin i e i uncertainties and conflicting interests among experts of different disciplines while analyzing huge data sets ii identification and prioritization of critical zones for implementing policies iii reliability on the model results with changes in time and preferences and iv obtaining optimistic pessimistic and nominal viewpoints of the decision makers another innovative feature of this study is to develop six different hybrid mechanisms which form a concrete basis to derive suitable strategic alternatives for optimal utilization of internal and external factors the flexible nature of these hybrids provide a latitude to the decision makers to customize the strategic alternatives suitable for the intended problem the model developed herein is superior than traditional optimization models due to its ability to address the uncertainties which arises due to conflicting interests of the stakeholders the uniqueness of the computerized gis and fuzzy based model developed in this paper is its flexible nature which makes it better than other static optimization models it means the model allows addition removal or adjustment in the data values of the environmental parameters which gives a very wide scope to the experts to change their opinion due to any concerns pertaining to sustainability with time the integration of fuzzy logic with a weighted overlay geostatistical approach has facilitated more effective and efficient planning as it delineates the priority zones where the best strategic alternatives derived from the study can be implemented immediately thus the proposed model is a comprehensive and pragmatic tool to deal with divergent interests multiple objectives and subjective assessments of sustainable water management group decision making has been performed by incorporating the opinion of stakeholders belonging to different disciplines based on monitored environmental data of 10 years and essential criteria although the methodology described in this study is applied to ganges river basin but the approach as well as strategic policies derived are important for sustainable management of any major water body of the world the robustness and global applicability of the model is justifiable as none of the alternatives sensitive to the changes in membership function values 0 5 or 1 5 amongst all strategies enforcement of strict regulations on heavy metal and sewage discharge and open defection have been found to be most suitable strategy followed by developing hydro power and adaptation of organic farming also a significant emphasis has been given to educate people about the scenario of indian rivers and thus incorporate opinion of wide range of stakeholders in the decision making process although other strategies obtain comparatively lower ranks their relevance towards achieving sustainability cannot be minimized as very less variation is observed in their overall scores as compared to other alternatives these strategies address certain essential ecological issues like e flow of rivers conservation of biodiversity around the river adopting strict regulation on dams and barrages practicing rainwater harvesting etc and thus contribute tremendously towards sustainable management of any river basin of the world the decision support framework proposed in this paper can be applied to many diverse and complex problems related to sustainable development of river basins where data availability is not constrained the study can be further advanced or refined by using more accurate and wide range of inter related data sets and further advanced fuzzy techniques such as interval valued fuzzy sets also results can be made more credible by using more relevant and accurate thematic maps for delineating the priority zones of the of the river basin appendix a supplementary data supplementary data associated with this
