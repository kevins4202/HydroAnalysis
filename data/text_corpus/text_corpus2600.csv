utilization technology were used as an efficient method for water purification 1 2 the use of this technology accounts for about 50 of all processes to produce drinking water some advantages of using membranes in water purification are low cost ease of use high removal capacity reduced chemicals etc separating membranes are mainly polymeric polymer membranes have more flexibility a simple cavitation mechanism lower cost and smaller installation space than mineral membranes polyacrylonitrile pan is a synthetic semi crystalline polymeric structure by the c3h3n n chemical composition though this is a thermoplastic polymeric structure it does not melt under standard states further pan is infusible and insolvable in common solvents 3 structurally all pan mixtures are copolymers composed of monomers with acrylonitrile as the cardinal atomic part technically the pan matrix phase change from solid to liquid at t 573 k if the temperature change values are 50 k min 4 this thermal behaviour the possibility of recycling and the high stability and mechanical properties of these materials are essential in many homes industrial and manufacturing applications such as automobile industries textile industries high temperature industrial plants medicine construction etc 5 today this polymeric structure is a versatile compound that generates various productions like ultra filtration membranes fibres for textiles oxidized pan fibres etc 6 7 past studies show that pan based polymers due to the presence of a bis amide group have a significant capacity to remove various ions such as manganese cobalt copper chromium magnesium etc and wastewater treatment 8 recently increasing attention has been given to low cost membrane materials such as pan nanostructures for the water purification process for instance lee et al 9 examined the water purification process using a pan membrane this study investigates various factors such as diameter porosity and size of membrane pores in the water treatment process the results reveal that the use of pan membrane is effective in water treatment also other studies such as jang et al 10 chang et al 11 prakash et al 12 etc was performed to examine the usage of pan membranes in the water purification process the results show that these pan matrices are good candidates for removing heavy metal ions from water today the use of nanostructures has improved the behaviour of conventional materials in various fields therefore the study of structures with low dimensions in different areas of science is routinely done 13 17 in addition to experimental methods computer simulations like molecular dynamics simulation mds efficiently describe nanostructures behaviour in various aims such as the purification process 18 20 several studies have examined the water treatment process by the mds method for instance nalaparaju et al 21 rizzuto et al 22 lin et al 23 ebro et al 23 etc examined the water treatment in the presence of different nanoparticles using molecular mds these papers show that using the mds method has many advantages over other theoretical and experimental methods and can simulate the water treatment process well different values related to system dynamics can be calculated using time averages in this method also another advantage of this method is its application as an experimental tool to study a system that has deviated from equilibrium 24 25 also previous studies show that mds is an appropriate method for studying polymeric structures 26 29 based on previous research it can be said that the water purification process using a pan based membrane was not studied by using the mds method since pan membranes have excellent mechanical properties these structures are an appropriate candidate for water purification for instance ala et al 30 examined the mechanical properties of pan membranes at various concentrations in the range of 0 05 0 3 wt the results reveal that increasing the pan membrane to 0 3 improves the tensile strength and mechanical properties mataram et al 31 examined pan membranes physical and mechanical attributes the results revealed that this membrane shows good resistance at room temperature wang et al 32 examined the mechanical characteristics of the pan membrane for wastewater treatment this membrane is suitable for water treatment since water purifying requires membranes with high mechanical strength high flux good durability and contaminant repellency according to the previous studies about waste water and purification of water 33 36 and the efficiency of the mds method in simulating the water treatment process in this work we use the mds approach to describe pan membrane performance in the h2o purification process from the h2o as mixture for the first time our md study on this topic is novel and can design water purification applications further this polymeric membrane s mechanical behaviour changes after the water purification process are reported these calculations could be used in industrial applications for optimized pan based membrane design 2 theory method 2 1 mds method this study investigates the separation of water molecules by the pan matrix using the mds method the mds method is a suitable technique for describing the different particles physical behaviour as a time time stages function based on newton law in this method the particles interacted for a certain period giving the complete vision for structural development in the present study mds was performed by lammps package released using sandia national laboratories 37 40 generally many parameters can affect the accuracy of the outputs of an mds since the interaction between particles is the most important part of any simulation the potential function s choice is significant generally the interactions of particles are defined by the potential function 41 in this mds the interaction between n h o as and c based particles were studied using dreiding force field 42 a subset of the lennard jones lj potential function this force field potential was utilized to calculate the interaction of different atoms in pan membrane 42 1 u r ij 4 ε σ r ij 12 σ r ij 6 r ij r c where σ ε rc and rij represent the finite distance the depth of the potential well cut off radius and the distance among the atoms these atomic interaction constants for various particles in the md box are reported in table 1 the bonded interactions can be computed by computing the simple bond and angular bond terms in our mds with an ordinary angular harmonic oscillator simple bond and angular bond of the bonded interactions in the pan membrane can be computed 43 2 e ½ k r r r 0 2 3 e ½ k θ θ θ 0 2 where kr r0 kθ and θ0 represent the constant of the harmonic oscillator the atomic bond length the constant of the angular oscillator and the angle s balance amount these constants of interaction for different atoms in the md box are reported in table 2 we used the tip3p charmm model for an aqueous environment appropriately describing h2o molecules behaviour 42 in this atomic pattern three situates are considered for interactions of electrostatic a negative charge is sited on the oxygen atom this negative charge has been utilized to equilibrium the hydrogen atoms partial positive charges numerically in the tip3p charmm pattern the r0 of oh interaction is equal to 0 9572 å and θ0 of h o h interaction is equal to 104 52 42 the other atomic interaction parameters for h2o molecules in the tip3p charmm model are represented in table 3 42 the computational procedure was fulfilled after describing the potential function for simulated samples in the md box equation of newton s second law is solved as the gradient of the potential function to describe the particle evolution in terms of time 44 4 f i i j f ij m i d 2 r i d t 2 m i d v i dt 5 f ij grad v ij in the above mi ri dt and vij represent the atomic mass the position of atom i md time stage and the potential function respectively and the velocity verlet algorithm accomplishes the association of motion equations 45 46 2 2 present simulation this simulation is performed in the following 2 stages stage a atomic purification performance of pan membrane initially the pristine pan membrane was modelled in the md box with 200 å lengths in x y and z directions in this simulation boundary situations in y and z orientations are considered periodically and those in x are considered fixed ones the nose hoover thermostat was used to set the temperature at t 300 k as primary temperature 47 49 the canonical ensemble nvt was used to examine the thermal equilibration of atomic structures after equilibrium phase detection as atoms separation from h2o molecules was done with the pan matrix in this step the grand canonical ensemble npt is used the simulation time is 20 ns 10 ns for the equilibration process and 10 ns for the separation process this atomic process reports calculated physical parameters such as filtration value permeability and polymeric matrix selectivity stage b mechanical behaviour of pan membrane next the process of mechanical deforming was applied to pristine and after filtration pan matrix for 10 000 000 time steps 10 ns after the tensile test physical factors like stress strain curve young s modulus ym and ultimate strength us were stated to describe the atomic behaviour of pristine and final after purification polymeric membranes 3 results and discussion 3 1 atomic purification performance of pan membrane in the first stage of current research the atomic evolution of the pan membrane and h2o as mixture was studied the atomic arrangement of these structures for the water purification process simulation is depicted in fig 1 the geometry of these atomic mixtures was optimized by the conjugate gradient cg method before the equilibration phase 50 51 this procedure is frequently applied as an iterative algorithm applicable to sparse systems that are too large to be handled using a direct implementation or other direct procedures like the cholesky decomposition after geometry optimization the balance procedure is accomplished in the md box computationally for the balance phase implemented in the simulated membrane this structure temperature increases from 275 k to 500 k for 5 ns next the atomic compound temperature decreases to 300 k for t 5 ns these simulations show that the glass transition temperature of the pan sample is 370 k which is consistent with previous reports 47 finally mds continued for 10 ns later to converge the total system temperature to t 300 k as initial temperature see fig 1 fig 2 shows the total energy of the pan membrane and liquid mixture as an md time this atomic parameter equals the summation of simulated structures potential energy and kinetic energy fig 2 shows that the total energy converged to 1 028 440 kj mol in the final step physically this balance situation stems from atomic oscillation reducing over md time which displays the correctness of the primary atomic arrangement and suitability of the utilized interatomic potentials in our computational work next to validate our computational procedure in the current simulations we calculate the radial distribution function rdf and density of water in the md box the rdf of simulated samples can define their atomic arrangement of them computationally rdf indicated in eq 6 by g r defines the probability of finding particle atom at r distance from other atoms 48 6 g r 1 4 πρ d n r dr here ρ and dn r represent the atomic density and a function that computes the number of atoms within a shell of thickness dr fig 3a displays the rdf of o atoms in h2o molecules which is consistent with previous reports 49 further the density of h2o molecules in defined regions converged to the density of this fluid in standard conditions as depicted in fig 3b 997 15 kg m3 50 so these calculations show the validity of our md simulation settings in the current computational work after equilibrium phase detection atomic structure evolution was done to study h2o molecule purification from the h2o as mixture fig 4 displays the development of atomic structures after 1 000 000 time stages δt 1 fs also the number of filtered water molecules variation in terms of mds time at t 300 k is reported in fig 5 from this figure it can be concluded the md simulation time is long enough for the atomic purification process detection in the md box after this atomic phase the number of as atoms that passed from the pan membrane was reported see fig 6 numerically the number of filtered h2o molecules reaches 614 molecules which this calculated value shows the appropriate behaviour of the pan membrane in the water purification process also computed value of as atoms which passed from the pristine membrane is 5 atoms physically by h2o as mixture diffusion into pan membrane the attraction force implemented to as atoms cause trapping of them by this phenomenon occurs the water purification process is fulfilled temperature is an essential parameter in various atomic evolutions such as the atomic purification process we describe this physical parameter s effect in the water purification process via pan membrane our results show the atomic interaction between membrane and as atoms decreases as temperature enlarges so the efficiency of pan membrane in the water purification process decreases so the temperature enlarging in the current atomic procedure is a disruptive parameter physically this atomic behaviour stems from as mobility increases in the md box further our simulations affect the permeability of atomic structures by temperature changes permeability in fluid mechanics and the atomic purification process measure a porous material s ability to allow fluids to pass through it computationally this physical parameter is represented as below 7 p kd h here d represents the membrane s diffusion constant k represents the solubilities ratio and h represents the thickness of the atomic membrane from fig 7 we can say the maximum amount of this physical factor reaches 68 and 85 l cm2 day mpa using temperature enhancement from 275 k to 350 k respectively from these computed results we can conclude that increasing temperature disrupts the accuracy of the atomic purification process and increases this procedure s speed see table 4 finally the atomic interaction between the membrane and h2o molecules is reported by temperature increasing in md box interatomic interaction changes from 26 150 kj mol å to 30 680 kj mol å this parameter increase shows the atomic absorption enlarging in simulated systems with h2o molecules absorption increasing the purification process occurs effectively further the atomic interaction force between the atomic membrane and as atoms doesn t change effectively by increasing temperature in the md box as reported in table 5 therefore we conclude that the pan polymer can be used as an atoms separation process from h2o molecules in industrial applications 52 53 3 2 mechanical behaviour of pan membrane the pristine pan matrix was simulated for the mechanical investigation in this step after the equilibration process the density variation in npt simulation t 300 k and p 1 bar time is reported in fig 8 we derive that the mds time is long sufficient for the atomic sample to reach the balance phase from the mass density variation curve next the tensile test was applied to the pristine polymeric structure see fig 9 the stress strain curve is utilized to study the mechanical attributes of structures like the ym and the us as the force increases the structures deformation values are measured and finally the stress strain curve is obtained using these values the deformation of a sample will depend on its elastic modulus and geometry length and cross section thus the load values are converted to stress and the deformation values to strain computationally stress value calculated with compute p command of lammps package and strain value calculated from eq 11 34 11 strain l l 0 l 0 where l and l0 are the primary and final lengths of simulated structure in the deformation test the stress strain curves of the mechanical test are shown in fig 10 theoretically the constants of mechanical like the ym and the pan matrix s us can be computed from this curve from our md outcomes young s pristine pan membrane s modulus is obtained 321 27 gpa up to 2 5 strain this computed amount is comparable to prior theoretical and experimental studies also calculated amount for this polymeric matrix s us is 98 68 mpa which agrees with previous reports the previous study reported the us around 118 mpa 54 and in the range of 90 to 150 mpa 55 in the final step of the current computational study the pan matrix s mechanical behaviour after the purification process is described by an external deformation force implemented to the polymeric membrane the mechanical test results of this atomic structure are depicted in fig 11 after the atomic equilibration procedure t 20 ns the polymeric membrane was expanded to estimate its mechanical properties the stress strain curve of the pan membrane s tensile test in the z direction is presented in fig 12 these mechanical constants were computed using least square approximation implemented to reduce information oscillations numerically by h2o as mixture diffusion to pristine pan membrane the mechanical properties ym and us of the final membrane reduced and reached 288 50 gpa and 91 78 mpa respectively see table 6 this is due to the swelling of the membrane after the purification process and the reduction of the mechanical properties and thus the reduction of permeability 56 these results show that diffusing h2o molecules to the pan membrane weakens the pristine membrane s mechanical properties the atomic interaction between the polymer chains and h2o as mixture in the common zone significantly influences structural integrity the h2o as mixture diffusing to the pristine membrane reduces the atomic structure s mechanical strength by the repulsive force with van der waals type in practical cases the results obtained in this section of our md simulations should be considered in pan based membranes design 4 conclusion in this work we utilize a computational approach to explain the purification performance of polyacrylonitrile pan membrane in an aqueous environment in the presence of arsenide as atoms for the first time this purification phenomenon is described by molecular dynamics md in atomic systems mds outcomes are as follows dreiding and tip3p charmm model are suitable functions to mds of pan based membrane and h2o as mixture md simulations predicted that the number of h2o molecules and atoms passed from the pan membrane was 643 and 8 after 1 ns numerically the pan membrane s permeability reaches 85 l cm2 day mpa at t 300 k after 1 ns increasing temperature parameters in pan membrane cause the accuracy decrease and performance speed increase in the purification process pan membrane was weakened mechanically after the purification process numerically the ultimate strength of the pristine membrane decreases from 98 68 mpa to 91 78 mpa after h2o as mixture diffusion into the polymeric membrane the young s module of the pristine membrane decreases from 321 27 gpa to 288 50 gpa after the atomic purification process the atomic porosity ratio of the simulated membrane is an important parameter

purification phenomenon is described by molecular dynamics md in atomic systems mds outcomes are as follows dreiding and tip3p charmm model are suitable functions to mds of pan based membrane and h2o as mixture md simulations predicted that the number of h2o molecules and atoms passed from the pan membrane was 643 and 8 after 1 ns numerically the pan membrane s permeability reaches 85 l cm2 day mpa at t 300 k after 1 ns increasing temperature parameters in pan membrane cause the accuracy decrease and performance speed increase in the purification process pan membrane was weakened

13001,the performance of a tidal flow constructed wetland tfcw following wastewater treatment in a package plant designed for two households was studied in a nine month field trial and its design evaluated through process modelling and pumping tests the tfcw is operated by filling and draining periods lasting five to nine days depending on wastewater production by users the effects of passive aeration temperature influent concentration of nutrients and bacteria as well as hydraulic loading on the treatment efficacy of the tfcw system were studied results showed that the tfcw system removed ammonium nitrogen nh4 n 76 phosphate phosphorus po4 p 56 total inorganic nitrogen tin 28 and reduced water ph by15 the removal efficiency of tin was significantly improved in the summer 50 the average influent concentration of total phosphorus tp was low after the preceding package plant treatment 1 12 mg l 1 but the tfcw showed ability to further reduce tp to the average concentration of 0 57 mg l 1 a coupled reactive transport model was developed in the comsol multiphysics 5 6 software to predict processes of water flow and was validated against the actual data from the field the modelling exhibited a satisfactory prediction accuracy and capability to capture behavior of effluent po4 p nh4 n and dissolved oxygen concentration moreover modelling processes helped to understand the defects of water flow and adsorption processes within the treatment wetland graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nitrogen phosphorus porous media reactive transport modelling wetland design 1 introduction in europe the popularity of constructed wetlands have been amplified by two factors 1 the first factor is resilience to fluctuating hydraulic loading of domestic wastewater and stability in treatment performance during summer and winter seasons the second factor is economic and ecological benefits which are provided due to low energy requirements maintenance costs and ability to integrate natural biological chemical and physical mechanisms for pollutants degradation in the filtration beds microorganisms and planted macrophytes the types of sub surface flow cws recently in use range from passive wetlands to more advanced engineered wetlands 2 however performance of cws have been limited by the deficiency of oxygen transfer to the filtration beds due to the continuous saturation of filter media during cold season and large loading 3 4 for that reason a so called tidal flow cw with rhythmic cycle of flood drain with wastewater has been suggested to provide better oxic anoxic conditions for nitrification and denitrification processes 5 9 substantial variation in the phosphorus p removal has been observed among different types of cws however superior removal performance was found in studies on aerated systems 10 the aeration method with tidal flow i e hydroperiods with flood and drain should then be a technical solution imitating nutrient removal processes in natural flooding wetlands 11 hamisi et al 12 designed and operated a treatment step of wastewater as a tidal flow constructed wetland tfcw after a package treatment plant ptp in our previous works the same wetland construction has been called sequencing batch constructed wetland sbcw but to follow a more common terminology it has been changed to tfcw the use of ptps for onsite wastewater treatment has increased during the past two decades in the nordic countries 13 15 treatment systems are bioreactors with and without filter media or chemical precipitation for phosphorus p removal however there are concerns about their environmental impact 15 16 the tfcw technology as an add on system to ptps would help to improve the overall nutrient treatment performance but also the removal of emerging organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides hormones surfactants flame retardants and plasticizers 17 the current problems to be solved and investigated in this paper is the insufficiency of the ptps using reactive filter media to remove nitrogen and reduce ph of the alkaline effluent in a post treatment step consisting of a constructed wetland moreover the increasing p concentration in the effluent must be considered as the filter mass ages the removal capacities of the reactive materials have been tested by many researchers during the past two decades and various inorganic materials has particularly been investigated in laboratory experiments or in full scale on site wastewater systems owt 18 21 several companies have adopted the idea of so called p filters as an integrated unit of manufactured ptps 15 the treatment mechanisms in ptps are mainly provided by biofilm growth in biofiltration tanks and precipitation of p due to oversaturation of calcium ca2 ions in the alkaline filter material during the life of the filter significant amounts of crystalline calcium phosphates accumulate 20 the unsolved problem with the ptp technology is still how to reduce high ph 9 in treated wastewater in a simple and cost effective way as it can affect the survival of sensitive biota in aquatic ecosystems 21 environmental authorities in sweden have increased the restrictions on permits for wastewater discharge from on site treatment plants by requiring discharge ph of between 6 5 and 9 and high removal of p 90 and nitrogen n 50 in sensitive areas reducing the adverse effects of high ph effluents capturing ca2 ions release from alkaline filter media and improving post treatment of n and p by installing a tidal flow constructed wetland tfcw can help to tackle these problems 18 22 the tfcw system used in our study had filling up and draining phases of water the periodicity depends on the production of wastewater in the households connected to the system 11 the determinant mechanisms for pollutants removal in the tfcw depend on a greater oxygen transfer capacity and a longer contact time to supplement affinity for fully nitrification and phosphorus adsorption in the wetland substrate other mechanisms are plant uptakes straining and attachment of the colloidal particulates in the layer of biofilm coverage in porous substrates plant roots and rhizomes 23 24 although the tfcw has been successfully constructed 12 its performance due to effects of fluctuating climate conditions summer and winter inflow water borne pollutant accumulation and concentration and aeration need to be fully understood for process optimization of the tfcw we used two approaches to evaluate the performance of a tfcw 1 in situ monitoring of the treatment performance of a full scale tfcw over a nine month period assessing the influence of four environmental abiotic factors dissolved oxygen do redox potential temperature and ph on n and p removal 2 use of process modelling in the comsol multiphysics platform to describe mechanisms on nutrient adsorption and transport and predict long term propagation of n p and do concentration in the porous sand filter medium different process models predicting the fate of pollutants in the cws have been developed over the past two decades 25 29 however the majority assume relatively simple geometry and consider first order reaction transport of single pollutant in one dimensional 1d or two dimensional 2d domains without iterating the effects of abiotic factors and processes for water flow reaction transport and heat transfer in the filtration beds 30 32 an attempt to develop such a coupled three dimensional 3d water flow and reactive transport model is demonstrated in this paper for engineered tfcw designs the main objective of the study was to conduct an in depth investigation of the treatment performance of tfcw and discuss the possible contribution to optimize owts in sweden besides assessing the treatment performance of the studied tfcw we also assessed the effects of the present wetland design and the fill drain management we assumed that an tfcw is highly efficient and reliable for owts if it fulfils the present discharge criteria for sensitive water recipients 90 for tot p or 1 mg l 1 50 for tot n or 40 mg l 1 and 9 for ph in sweden 33 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of pilot tfcw system a pilot scale owts plant was designed and constructed in autumn 2017 for domestic wastewater treatment from two households fig 1a the owt system consists of three treatment systems 1 septic tank st clarifier 2 ptp and 3 tfcw system as an add on unit for post treatment of effluent from the ptp system fig 1b the tfcw system was commissioned and pre tested in winter and spring 2018 and monitored its performance over nine month from summer 2018 through winter 2019 the average daily volume of wastewater produced by two households 4 persons connected to the system was 0 65 m3 0 2 m3 however the system is dimensioned for 10 person equivalents and a daily wastewater flow of 1 6 m3 the wetland comprises a total bed volume of 35 6 m3 and is subdivided into three sections the first section 3 72 m3 is an inlet area filled with crushed granite coarse gravel 16 32 mm where wastewater influent from the ptp system is distributed uniformly to the wetland through perforated pipes placed at a depth of 0 15 m fig 1 the second section 25 5 m3 is a filter bed with 50 tons of sand brought from a local gravel pit the well graded sand is characterized by a particle size distribution d50 of 0 8 mm a uniformity coefficient of 5 94 cu d60 d10 and porosity ø of 28 66 the hydraulic conductivity of the sand filter was measured using a falling head permeameter and found to be 2 48 m d 1 in the sand filter 27 small sampling pipes diameter 16 mm were installed for taking samples from the top 0 0 2 m middle 0 2 0 4 m and deep 0 4 0 6 m sand filter layers fig 1b the third section 6 4 m3 is the drainage layer i e the bottom of the whole tfcw where all water from the wetland is collected through perforated pipes and transported to the outlet well diameter 0 55 m depth 1 0 m the wetland is lined with impermeable plastic sheeting 4 mm to prevent water flow between the tfcw and the surrounding soil the wetland was planted with cattail typha latifolia in autumn 2017 at a plant spacing of 100 cm and cattail growth was measured for the first time in september 2018 the wetland was loaded intermittently filling and draining the beds using the influent wastewater from the ptp system filling up the system takes 5 9 days which means that water in the near bottom layers will have longer hydraulic retention time hrt than the surface layers the tfcw drains automatically after the water level reaches 0 1 m depth below the soil surface i e when the wetland is saturated treated water is pumped to a tile drainage system in an adjacent agricultural field which discharges to a ditch a pump with a capacity of about 75 l min 1 is installed at the outlet sampling well fig 1c and operates batch wise in 35 40 min until the wetland is drained the start of monitoring was delayed to june 2018 due to severe winter conditions in 2017 2018 and sampling was extended up to february 2019 detailed description of the whole system is provided by hamisi et al 12 2 2 sampling and analysis grab samples were taken from the small sampling pipes and outlet well in the tfcw before and after emptying the wetland through pumping events every 5 9 days samples were taken in 100 ml acid washed bottles at the outlet before pumping and after pumping and transported to the kth seed water centre laboratory for chemical analyses they were analyzed for different species of inorganic nitrogen nh4 n no3 n no2 n and p po4 p total p using a seal auto analyzer aa3 seal analytical inc mequon wisconsin usa total inorganic nitrogen tin was calculated as the sum of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n since the water samples collected from the tfcw sampling points were very turbid they were filtered through munktell filter paper followed by 0 45 μm sartorius filters water temperature c ph do electrical conductivity ec μscm 1 and redox potential mv were measured in situ on each sampling occasion using a hach hq40d multimeter hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany all probes connected to the instrument were calibrated prior to analysis percentage mass removal of nutrients was calculated based on the flow rate equation eq 1 1 mass removal efficiency 1 c e q e c i q i 100 where c e is the effluent concentration mg l 1 c i is the influent concentration mg l 1 q i is the influent rate l d 1 and q e is the effluent rate l d 1 2 3 modelling of fluid flow and reactive transport 2 3 1 water flow the hydraulic water flow in variably saturated sand filter was simulated by a closed set of van genuchten parameters the permeability model of water flow in the porous soil matrix was based on the measured hydraulic conductivities of the sand fine 2 85 m d 1 and porosity ø 43 gravel coarse 452 m d 1 and porosity ø 28 clay 0 0002 m d 1 and porosity ø 42 fig 2 the tfcw design was optimized by assessing on how a given change of the hydraulic conductivity and abiotic factors do temperature and redox conditions electrical conductivity ec was affecting the adsorption capacity of the sand materials the three horizontal sand filter domains top middle deep were used to model the behavior of water flow accumulation at different depths richard s equation was implemented in the comsol multiphysics 5 6 software as the main governing equation for modelling water flow in the variably saturated porous filters 2 3 2 reactive transport and adsorption the add on modules of multi components reactive transport model was used to simulate the water flow biogeochemical reaction and adsorption of p and n species in the saturated porous media the comsol multiphysics 5 6 software was selected to implement this model because of its solver performance and typical functionality of software to couple any physics interface the transport and adsorption were simulated into two phases mobile aqueous phase c k and immobile solid phase s k of k th species eq 2 2 θ c k t ρ s k t x i θ d ij c k x i x i q i c k r i where θ is the water content l3 l 3 k is the subscript to represent the k th species concentration in the liquid phase k 1 2 3 m c k is the concentration of mobile k th species in the aqueous liquid solution phase m l 3 ρ is the bulk density of the immobile soil materials m l 3 s k is the concentration of k th species captured in the immobile solid phase m l 3 d ij is the dispersion coefficient for the liquid l3 t 1 q i is the volumetric flux discharged from the system l t 1 r i is the reaction rate of the k th species m l 3 t 1 space dependency of the chemical species was introduced after coupling reaction engineering with the transport interface for water flow and species transport in porous media 2 3 3 nutrients and microbial transformation the governing reaction rates for ammonium nitrification and hydrolysis of organics i e conversion of slowly degradable into readily soluble organics were formulated as monod kinetics according to expressions from the constructed wetland no 2 cwm2 for dual permeability and transport of water flow eqs 3 and 4 the model was run for transient variably saturated and unsaturated sand filter conditions transformation of two pools of inorganic n nh4 n no3 n and one pool of inorganic p po4 p was considered in this study these inorganic n and p species were multiplied in the monod rate equation as the nutrient factor for n transformation via nitrification in unsaturated aerobic nitrified media and denitrification in saturated anaerobic denitrified media nh4 n oxidation in the reaction engineering interface was modelled based on the chemical equations s a1 3 r nh 4 d c nh 4 dt μ ans c o 2 k ans o 2 c o 2 c nh 4 k ans nh 4 c nh 4 c po 4 3 k ans po 4 3 c po 4 3 c ans 4 r c s d c s dt k h c cs c xh k x c cs c

concentration of heterotrophic bacteria mg l 1 k h is hydrolysis rate constant l d and k x is the half saturation coefficient for organic matter hydrolysis nh4 n oxidation was modelled in a two step process from ammonium nh4 n over nitrate no3 n to nitrite no2 n to solve eq 3 the bulk concentrations of nh4 do and po4 p species determined in field measurements table 1 were defined as the initial boundary condition in the aqueous bulk solution it was assumed that all n and p species were transported in the dissolved solution except for nitrifying bacteria which were modelled as a solid phase these transported species were assumed to undergo reaction with do and to be removed by adsorption in the pore interfacial region between the solid sand phase immobile and aqueous liquid phase mobile it was also assumed that nh4 n was the most mobile species in reducing conditions and that no2 n was the least mobile in oxidizing conditions nitrosomonas and nitrobacter oxidizing bacteria were assumed to use do to nitrify nh 4 n into no2 the bacteria were assumed to attach to the pores of sand filter layers and form biofilm in saturated conditions the sand filters were assumed to be under anoxic reducing conditions when the water flow was relatively steady in anoxic conditions the retained bacteria use no2 as an electron acceptor and it undergoes hydrolysis eq 3 whereby slowly biodegradable organics are decomposed into readily biodegradable organic forms 23 partial differential equations describing transport mechanisms of convective water flow and dispersive and mass transfer of dissolved species in the porous sand filter eq 2 were solved using the finite element method in the comsol multiphysics 5 6 software 2 3 4 geometry and boundary conditions the geometry of the tfcw domains fig 2 was created in comsol and discretized into 114 952 finite elements of minimum length 0 144 m and maximum length 0 802 m a physical memory of 3 09 gb and virtual memory of 4 09 were needed to run discretized model using a multifrontal massively parallel sparse direct solver mumps at time steps of 2 days and free meshing time of 6 06 s the water uptake by plants was not simulated in this model because the planted cattail typha latifolia was not well established in the wetland after only one growing season however it will be added in the future as a sink term for nutrients in the reactive transport equation eq 2 to model the effects of time and space variable loading regime of solute transport the concentration gradient second type of boundary condition neuman condition was set at the outlet boundary the concentration fluxes third type boundary condition cauchy condition was defined at the boundary along the inlet boundary to simulate the state variable of input concentration the constant head first type boundary condition dirichlet condition was set to the saturated layer near the outlet boundary 2 4 model calibration and validation sensitivity analysis was performed to assist the model calibration in identifying parameters with the greatest influence in fitting the measured concentration of nh4 n no3 n and po4 p from the pumping tests to investigate the effects of wetland design on treatment performance sensitivity analysis was performed by adjusting the value of 14 parameters by 10 above and below the default value the parameters tested included partition coefficient k d influent concentration c i molecular diffusive coefficient d mol permeability k m media saturation maximum sorption capacity s d and the hydrolysis rate constant k h the influence of each parameter was evaluated by visual comparison of model response in matching the measured concentration of tin and nh4 n we adjusted one parameter at a time and ran the model while keeping other parameters constant the goal was to determine how a given change in the parameter influenced the model in reproducing and matching the measured data sensitivity coefficient was calculated as the ratio between the relative change of model outputs and parameter tested 34 sl c c p p where sl is the local sensitivity coefficient c is state variable output and p is the parameter tested 2 5 statistical analysis two way analysis of variance was performed in ibm spss statistics version 26 ibm 2021 new york usa to identify significant differences between means of chemical samples collected from three sampling locations tfcw sand filter layers the outlet well and pumping tests the linear relationship between the mean of independent variables was evaluated using pearson correlation coefficient to assess the main effects of interactions between the mean variables post hoc tests of multivariate variables were quantified using the least significant difference lsd model of variance analysis the model was tested at a high degree of confidence intervals ci 95 and significance level p 0 05 in all tests the descriptive statistics box plots of mean values were used to display patterns and describe the normal distribution of the data and uncertainty and compare the treatment performance of the tfcw designs the total number of samples analyzed are listed in table 1 3 results 3 1 overall performance of the wastewater treatment system the wastewater parameters of fluatuating domestic wastewater flow through from the ptp system to the tfcw system are shown in table 1 these influents are usually characterized by high ph 9 55 0 92 s a2 and high concentration of nh4 n 38 67 21 18 mg l 1 do 3 99 3 11 mg l 1 and positive redox potential 152 38 31 52 mv the wastewater parameters at the wetland outlet well showed that the entire pilot scale owt system was efficient in removing nh4 n 75 74 and po4 p 56 1 and lowering ph from 9 55 to 8 08 15 table 1 the do concentration in the tfcw was relatively low 2 22 2 16 mg l 1 and redox potential decreased from the aerobic conditions in the top layer 123 70 4 15 mv to the anaerobic and anoxic conditions in the middle layer 79 16 25 32 mv and deep layer 52 11 21 29 mv table 1 the efficacy of thetfcw system during the nine months of field experiments showed similar trend of tin removal in the top and middle 49 layer and slightly reduced efficiency shown in the deep layer 47 the average concentration of no3 n achieved in the top 24 06 14 45 mg l 1 layer and in the middle 23 71 15 68 mg l 1 layer are indicative of oxidized nh4 n because of diffused oxygen from atmospheric air the deep layer was slightly higher 25 99 14 38 mg l 1 and increased during pumping periods similarly the average temperature in the tfcw displayed a decreasing trend from the top 13 66 1 71 c to the deep 10 20 1 27 c layer 3 1 1 phosphorus removal the po4 p removal rate at the tfcw outlet well was 45 in summer and 53 in winter and the efficiency severely reduced during pumping test to 20 in summer and 10 in winter fig 3a and b the influent total p concentration from the reactive p filter to the tfcw ranged in winter and summer from 0 02 to 4 40 mg l 1 mean 1 46 mg l 1 and 0 01 to 3 17 mg l 1 mean 0 78 mg l 1 respectively mean mass removal rate of total p concentration was consistently stable 70 in the top and middle sand filter layers during summer and decreased severely towards the deep layer 30 during the winter season the average concentration of dissolved po4 p measured at the tfcw outlet well was 0 58 mg l 1 in summer and 0 34 mg l 1 in the winter season fig 4a and b the po4 p concentration monitored during the summer season showed a stable performance which corresponded to a mean efficiency of 76 in the top layer 80 in middle layer and 94 in deep layer fig 4a the total p concentration in the tfcw sand filter displayed a clear trend of increasing concentration from 1 26 mg l 1 in the top layer 1 71 mg l 1 in the middle layer to 2 61 mg l 1 in the deep layer during the winter season fig 4b however the average concentration of dissolved po4 p in the three sand layers was below 0 5 mg l 1 in the summer and winter 3 1 2 nitrogen removal the rate of n removal in the tfcw sand filtration beds showed fluctuating average concentration of nitrified ammonium nitrogen nh4 n into nitrate nitrogen no3 n and nitrite nitrogen no2 n fig 5a showed the significant mass removal rate of nh4 n concentration during summer 87 and during winter 15 despite that the mean influent was quite high 54 mg l 1 in the winter the mean removal rates of no3 n and no2 n no3 n concentration in the tfcw sand filtration beds was consistently stable in the summer and winter fig 5a and b also showed the highest removal of oxidized nh4 n during summer 88 and winter 70 to mainly no3 n in the aerated biofiltration tank bf the average mass removal efficiencies in the tfcw outlet well were higher in summer for nh4 n 60 and moderate lower in the winter 32 the mean effluents of nitrogen parameters in the tfcw outlet well were higher for tin 47 mg l 1 and nh4 n 15 mg l 1 in the summer than the winter season fig 5a and b the most surprising aspect of wetland performance was the increase in no2 n concentration 0 28 mg l 1 at the tfcw outlet well the effects of preferential flow in the tfcw filtration beds are clearly apparent in fig 5a and b where the performance of top layer middle layer and deep layer showed a negative treatment efficacy and an erratic patterns of tin distribution the concentration of no2 n no3 n which is immobilized by microbes nitrosomonas spp from nh4 n also displayed an erratic trend fig 5a and b with most immobilization occurring at the top and middle sand filter layers the mean tin concentration was consistently stable in the top and middle sand filter beds 27 mg l 1 and slightly increased in the deep layer 31 mg l 1 none of these differences was statistically significant p 0 05 however there were significant differences between the tfcw outlet well and the top sand filter layer p 0 038 the middle layer p 0 029 and the deep layer p 0 037 it is interesting to observe the similar concentration of tin no2 n no3 n and no3 n in the tfcw deep sand filter layer for summer 33 mg l 1 and winter 22 mg l 1 season fig 6a and b these corresponded to the treatment efficacy of tin concentration at the tfcw deep sand filter in the summer 63 and winter tin 45 the overall reduction in nh4 n and tin concentration at the tfcw outlet was 54 and 75 in the summer and winter respectively fig 6a and b 3 1 3 observations of ph do ec temperature redox potential and turbidity the variations of wastewater quality parameters drained from the tfcw outlet to the recipient ditch are shown in fig 7 a e for the summer season and fig 7 f j for the winter season the temporal changes are shown in s 1 fig 7a and b shows that the tfcw system received wastewater effluent from an alkaline p filter material where ph in the summer and winter was 10 and 9 respectively in the summer season trends showed that ph was successfully decreased from the top layer ph 8 24 to the middle layer ph 7 60 and slightly increased in the deep sand filter in the winter season fig 7f the tfcw also displayed stable ability of reducing ph by 19 to the nearly neutral conditions mean ph 7 28 in sand filter layers the transfer of dissolved oxygen do concentration showed to be more variable in the tfcw sand filter beds fig 7b in summer the average do concentration in the tfcw sand filtration beds were rather low around 2 81 mg l 1 in the top layer 1 14 mg l 1 in the middle layer and 1 88 mg l 1 in the deep layer the sampling campaigns for measurements of do concentrations were not performed in the severe winter conditions from december 2018 until february 2019 fig 7g mean oxygen concentration from the aerated bf and p filter bag showed varying concentrations with those from the p filter bag deviating most between 1 mg l 1 and 9 5 mg l 1 mean 4 24 mg l 1 in the summer in winter do concentrations varied between 0 5 mg l 1 and 7 mg l 1 mean 0 93 mg l 1 fig 7b and g the do in the tfcw outlet water had an average concentration of 1 16 mg l 1 in the summer and increased to november resulting in a mean concentration of around 2 6 mg l 1 in the winter the wastewater treated in the owt system showed diurnal variations and decreasing trend of mean ec values in both seasons in summer the ec in the influent septic tank was 1930 μs cm 1 and effluents at the tfcw outlet was 1685 μs cm 1 fig 7c and h mean ec of influent wastewater to the wetland was similar to that of the 1721 μs cm 1 tfcw effluent in july 2018 when the sand filter material was fresh the mean ec at the tfcw outlet was low 1685 μs cm 1 in both seasons there were minor diurnal variations in ec during the measurements fig 7 c h mean ec in the wetland also decreased from the top layer 1735 69 87 μs cm 1 to the middle layer 1584 374 88 μs cm 1 and deep layer 1525 237 μs cm 1 at the tfcw outlet the measured temperature during the summer increased from 15 c in july to 24 c in august in the winter season the mean temperature in the tfcw outlet was relatively low 4 4 c fig 7d and i in both seasons the effluents water from the tfcw outlet was very clear with a turbidity below 2 ntu fig 7e and j 3 1 4 mass of phosphorus and nitrogen removal the mass balance analyses in table 2 showed the retained mass of nutrients in the sand filter bed varied over the course of nine months our results showed that the amount of retained tin was much higher in the summer 124 79 g m 2 than in the winter 106 20 g m 2 season most interesting was that we observed that the retained mass of total p was six times higher 6 93 g m 2 in winter than in summer table 2 our results also showed that the mass of retained po4 p was elevated from the top 0 05 g m 2 layer middle 0 37 g m 2 layer to the deep 0 42 g m 2 layer however the quantity of retained tin was similar in the top and middle 71 69 g m 2 layer and slightly increased towards the deep layer 87 62 g m 2 comparisons of the sand filter beds in summer revealed statistically significant differences p 0 05 with those values in winter 3 2 optimization of tfcw system during pumping tests and reactive transport modelling 3 2 1 pumping tests fig 8 a d shows temporal variation of the wastewater quality parameters no3 n no2 n ph do redox potential and ec discharged to the recipient ditch the invaluable information displayed in fig 8a showed a consecutive peak of no3 n concentration during 100 days of the tfcw operation despite the constant discharge this fluctuation is no surprise because of seasonal variation of influent wastewater generated by users of the owt system the no2 n concentration decreased in a step before it was depleted completely in the wetland after 50 days during the pumping test in august the ph was elevated with a mean value of 9 4 fig 8b after september the ph was 8 in all pumping tests there were more peaks and variations in ph in the pumping test in october but a linear change in ph in the pumping test in november as the pumping time increased the ph became consistently stable in the pumping test in august the ph showed a decreasing trend from 8 6 to 8 during 80 min of pumping period in august and september the whole wetland was in oxidizing conditions however the oxidizing conditions differed between pumping periods e g redox potential decreased in august from 200 mv to 190 mv due to oxygen depletion fig 8c redox potential decreased during the low temperature season from 165 mv to 145 mv in september indicating that the wetland was transforming from aerobic to anoxic conditions there was a peak in redox potential at the pumping test on september 6 due to downward diffusive and advective transport of oxidized water to the effluent tfcw well the ec values ranged from 1560 10 75 μs cm 1 for the pumping test in august when the sand filter material was fresh to 1800 15 60 μs cm 1 for the pumping test in october on both occasions there were minor diurnal variations in ec during the pumping tests mean ec in the wetland decreased from the top layer 1735 69 87 μs cm 1 to the middle layer 1584 374 88 μs cm 1 and deep layer 1525 237 μs cm 1 the ec of influent wastewater to the wetland was 1576 72 70 μs cm 1 and that in the tfcw effluent was 1604 68 00 μs cm 1 fig 8d 3 2 2 reactive transport model calibration and validation the behavior of the predicted tin nh4 n po4 p and do concentration showed good agreement with the experimental data at the tfcw outlet during pumping fig 8 e h trends of simulated tin was essentially not captured well by the model due to the seasonal variations of nitrified no3 n and no2 n the concentration of nh4 n matched quite well with experimental observation where the magnitude of nh4 n depleted after 150 days of wetland operation while the tin concentration decreased by 51 from 49 5 mg l 1 to 24 2 mg l 1 fig 8 e f the do in the outlet water initially had an average concentration of 1 8 mg l 1 then the do concentration increased exponentially from 2 5 to 8 4 mg l 1 in the first 20 min of each pumping occasion fig 8g indicative of the effects of pumping rates for oxygen transfer in the filter beds the progressive increase of do concentration was then stabilized and met the wetland oxygen saturation at 9 mg l 1 after one hour 60 min of constant pumping rate 75 l min 1 this saturation was required for several competing processes such as nitrification mineralization and immobilization of n and p concentration this increased from september but was still low around 3 mg l 1 fig 8h showed the concentration of effluent phosphorus po4 p was increased in the first 20 min of each pumping occasion and the effluent concentration decreased stepwise with an increased pumping circle 3 2 3 modelling water flow pattern different zones of water flow i e active dead and intermediate zones and preferential flow along the vertical sampling pipes in the filter bed were observed fig 9 in this tfcw design high water flow velocity occurred in the area near to the deep layer which is classified as a denitrified zone represented by red color the wetland revealed a slight increase of water flow in the dead zone and the inlet zone these phenomena also had the advantage of increasing diffusive flux of oxidized water transfer between the inlet and outlet the tfcw design had a long travel time of water to the outlet while the inlet domain and middle layer experienced more process of water circulation after 3 to 7 days fig 9 the behavior of fully developed water saturation in the model did not differ from the experimental observation in the field where the sand filter bed reached saturation after 7 days with a saturated filter media the wetland experienced low oxygen transfer to the middle and deep layer the homogeneous distribution of water flow in the wetland with micro zonation and excess water flow was observed in the inlet and middle layer due to the effects of vertical up feeding mode 3 2 4 parameter sensitivity analysis the calibrated value for linear adsorption coefficient k d was in agreement 10th percentile table 3 with published values from 35 the modelling revealed that the water in the tfcw exhibited different water flow pathways and micro zonation of water accumulation with e g long flow path and good mixing behavior in tfcw design 1 dead micro zones and partial water mixing and short flow paths and uniformity of water flow behavior in tfcw design langergraber 36 presented a 2d model and discussed the success and challenges of applying a cw2d process model to simulate the processes of nh4 n and organic transformation in an indoor vertical flow cw our model showed good ability to reproduce the exponential increase in do and po4 p concentrations of the parameters adjusted during model calibration table 3 few adjustments were made to the parameter for maximum growth of oxidizing bacteria μans and hydrolysis rate constant k h because we found these to be least sensitive for capturing the response of po4 p concentration however they were observed to be the source of po4 p release to solution as fig 8 shows the model successfully reproduced the exponential trends in do and po4 p and the decreasing trends in tin and nh4 n concentrations the randomness of po4 p and do concentrations measured during the pumping tests fig 8 a d demonstrates the classical behavior of variably saturated conditions of the sand filter in the tfcw filter bed however in the pumping tests revealed that the concentrations of do po4 p and tin stabilized the longer the pumping lasted indicating a well mixed solution and lower gradients in species concentrations the modelling results revealed a decreasing trend in tin concentration from 49 mg l 1 to 20 mg l 1 after simulating the wetland with different influent for 300 days runtime fig 8e 4 discussion 4 1 nitrogen and phosphorus removal we used two approaches to investigate the performance of the tfcw i e monitoring its performance in the field and using a process model and pumping tests to investigate the effects of design on its hydraulic behavior and its nutrient removal capacity we found the highest mean concentration of 47 mg l 1 for tin which means that the swedish limit value for effluent tot n concentration of 40 mg l 1 will be exceed at least during the summer months the main factor of n removal in the top layer is probably direct contact between the wetland surface and atmospheric air increasing diffusive transport of oxygen to the porous top layer and by the plants and their roots under establishment 39 the two convective aeration pipes installed in the tfcw helped to transport oxygen to the bottom layer especially during the pumping and draining of the wetland we found no significant difference in nh4 n removal between the three sand filter layers p 0 05 although the top and deep layers were more effective in numerical terms there were a few erratic changes in nh4 n concentration in the middle zone of the tfcw this could be attributed to preferential flow due to extracellular development of biofilms in the sand pores at the inlet zone and prevailing strong anoxic conditions in the middle zone in anoxic conditions the no3 produced by nitrification of nh4 is consumed by heterotrophic bacteria as an electron acceptor in the denitrification process 40 these findings demonstrate that the current design of the tfcw which is operated intermittently i e filling and draining the wetland favors oxygen availability in the filter bed enhancing n removal however the availability of oxygen in the bulk water increased strongly after the wetland became saturated oxygen is the most limiting element for effective removal of n in the tfcw oxidizing conditions and ph close to neutral were found by morvannou et al 41 to be preferable in cws to maintain stable forms of p bound in the wetland substrate our results indicate that most p was bound in the bottom layer where low concentrations of oxygen occurred during winter the gradient observed for both n and p with increasing concentrations from surface to bottom layer was related to the difference in hrt i e longer time and more volume of water passing during fill and drain periods however the erratic patterns in nh4 n distribution at some sampling points indicate problems of preferential flow in those areas or incomplete nitrification due to low oxygen concentration caused by clogging of the inlet zone or high ec of incoming water gains and losses of water in the wetland caused by increases in temperature and rainwater could contribute to erratic nh4 n concentrations the effects of the cattail plants on nutrient uptake oxygen transfer and organics transformation were not investigated because the plants were not yet fully established at the time of the study and probably did not contribute much to p uptake and storage 22 on the other hand the total p mass in the tfcw was much lower in the summer than in the winter which can possibly indicate some p uptake by the cattail plants the mass balance approach table 2 revealed that the tfcw is capable to remove po4 p 56 16 from an influent concentration of 1 46 1 70 mg l 1 to an effluent concentration of 0 64 0 30 mg l 1 which is less than the threshold value for on site wastewater discharge 1 mg l 1 in sensitive environments 12 the treatment efficiency of the tfcw is much higher than previous estimates of dissolved po4 p removal reported for an aerated vertical flow wetland 48 22 or an infiltration sand filter 22 28 however the vertical flow wetland received wastewater with a concentration of 45 mg l 1 while corresponding value for the tfcw was 1 12 mg l 1 the sand filter on the other hand operates with un saturated wastewater flow and the sand material can differ in physico chemical properties depending on origin several bench scale and field trials have demonstrated that high concentrations of cations such as fe2 al3 and ca2 are the key drivers of high po4 p removal in sand filters 19 42 in mid september 2018 many grab samples from the inlet sampling pipes had a dark color strong odor and layer of white precipitated calcium carbonates this indicates that most of the lost organic matter and ca2 ions from the ptp were captured in the inlet zone which is thus greatly at risk of clogging according to vidal et al 12 clogging can occur very quickly in fine sand filters because extracellular bacterial slime accumulates rapidly in the sand pores other studies show that the adsorption capacity of sand filters is not very strong and permanent due to the low content of iron fe and aluminum al for p precipitation 43 19 there is considerable evidence that small particle size can increase the binding surface areas of filter materials 34 4 2 effects of temperature ph redox potential do and ec on nutrient removal environmental factors limited transformation degradation and removal of organics and nutrients in the tfcw among these temperature precipitation ph redox potential ec and do concentration are the most influential abiotic factors modifying physical chemical transformation of pollutants in tfcw tests on the effects of these parameters in the tfcw during pumping between august 22 and november 14 2018 revealed that treatment performance of the wetland in the field was probably most affected by variations in weather conditions i e temperature and precipitation which normally cause water loss during the high temperature season and water gain during the rainy or snowy season both have great impacts on the processes responsible for n and p transformation 44 45 the ability of the tfcw to respond in these parameters is the issue for future studies especially on the removal of n and organics is low in winter due to effects of low temperature 18 22 many studies have demonstrated that temperature plays a critical role in improving the p adsorption capacity of filter media and modifying growth of the autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria responsible for nutrient uptake and decomposition 46 47 overall the pumping tests showed that pumping has a positive benefit in improving oxygen transfer from the inlet and the wetland surface this indicates that the present design of this wetland provides sufficient oxygen for nitrification but not for p removal in the deep layer where oxygen deficit occurs increased p removal could be expected if oxygen was available and the redox potential was positive in that layer however the p binding to the sand gravel matrix can decrease and completely cease with time despite oxygenated conditions 48 in the pumping test in august 2018 the ph was elevated with a mean value of 9 4 after september 2018 the ph was 8 in all pumping tests there were more peaks and variations in ph in the pumping test in october 2018 and there was a linear change in ph in the pumping test in november 2018 high ph values of the wastewater can lead to nitrogen being released as ammonia which is not desirable on the other hand the elevated ph is in favor of the phosphorus removal which is driven by the ca enriched water released from the purification stage p bag prior the wetland the effluent problem with high alkaline filter materials ph 12 has been addressed before when used as substrate in cws 49 however the idea of the tfcw investigated is to reduce ph simultaneously with n and p post removal a recent study by bove et al 50 demonstrated that the use of passive co2 acidification can reduce the ph from 11 to 7 5 but that approach is somewhat difficult to implement in on site wastewater treatment and where weather conditions are very dynamic in the present study tfcw treatment performance improved during summer and declined during winter when the wetland water volume was much higher the effect of temperature in improving performance of subsurface flow cw was reported previously by kahl et al 51 the do concentration in the tfcw was a key driver for oxidizing nh4 n hydrolysis and aerobic mineralization of organics however the concentration varied from 2 5 to 9 mg l 1 depending on three factors temperature filter depth and filter saturation condition high removal efficiency of nh4 n was observed in the top and middle layers of the sand filter where the redox measurements indicated aerobic conditions the nh4 n removal efficiency decreased in the deep layer located near the tfcw outlet well because of anoxic conditions kim et al 52 observed that the redox potential was affected by the water saturation level and the feeding resting periods of a vertical flow cw they concluded that the system cope with periodical flooding without loss in performance anoxic conditions occurred in parts of the tfcw and the reason for this do absence should be further investigated however we observed that weakly pumping causes a flow from the infiltration section of the wetland which increase the risk for insufficient treated wastewater to reach the deep layer and the outlet zone decomposition of accumulated waterborne particulate organic matter in the bottom of the wetland cause with time oxygen consumption and anaerobic conditions we suggest that it is probably necessary to modify the length and location of drainage pipes in order to increase water retention recirculation of water oxygenation of the deep filter layers and the above mentioned short circuit in the wetland the high ec values recorded during sampling and throughout the pumping tests are unusual for on site wastewater and was due to the salinity of tap water houses in rural areas in the nordic countries rely heavily on private wells for their water supply 53 the two houses connected to the tfcw system use groundwater from one deep well which has elevated levels of salt this is a common situation in the coastal areas and has implications not only for the consumption of water but also for the function of wastewater treatment systems 54 for instance it is known that wastewater with high salinity inhibit po4 p removal in systems using filter materials 22 and manufacturers of onsite treatment systems have reported that activated sludge biofilters are affected by salt water k g niska pers comm problems in the treatment function of small scale treatment plants should also include the impact of salt whether it comes from salt groundwater via drinking water wells or from softening plants commonly used in individual houses 5 conclusion the present constructed wetland design exhibited to be an appropriate technology for post treatment of nitrogen phosphorus and buffering high ph from the package treatment plant however less p removal is compromised between the summer and winter season with respect to the variations of volumetric wastewater from private houses and lower temperature in the sand filter layers during winter a stand of cattail has been planted but the plants are still small so sand filtration was probably the most important nutrient removal process in the tfcw system at this moment to optimize performance of the tfcw system design the multiple component reactive transport model was successfully developed calibrated and validated using the pumping tests data from the pilot tfcw experiment the modelling results fitted to the pumping experiments this implies that operating the wetland intermittently by filling and draining will improve exponentially the oxygen supply to deep sand filter layers and regenerate the binding charge of sand filter materials the modelling results have reliably simulated the uniformity behavior of hydraulic water flow velocity and active adsorption of phosphorus in the middle layer an improvement of the nutrient removal performance can be solved by changes in the present placement of the drainage pipes future studies of the tfcw system will reveal comprehensive information and provide a detailed understanding of its

13001,the performance of a tidal flow constructed wetland tfcw following wastewater treatment in a package plant designed for two households was studied in a nine month field trial and its design evaluated through process modelling and pumping tests the tfcw is operated by filling and draining periods lasting five to nine days depending on wastewater production by users the effects of passive aeration temperature influent concentration of nutrients and bacteria as well as hydraulic loading on the treatment efficacy of the tfcw system were studied results showed that the tfcw system removed ammonium nitrogen nh4 n 76 phosphate phosphorus po4 p 56 total inorganic nitrogen tin 28 and reduced water ph by15 the removal efficiency of tin was significantly improved in the summer 50 the average influent concentration of total phosphorus tp was low after the preceding package plant treatment 1 12 mg l 1 but the tfcw showed ability to further reduce tp to the average concentration of 0 57 mg l 1 a coupled reactive transport model was developed in the comsol multiphysics 5 6 software to predict processes of water flow and was validated against the actual data from the field the modelling exhibited a satisfactory prediction accuracy and capability to capture behavior of effluent po4 p nh4 n and dissolved oxygen concentration moreover modelling processes helped to understand the defects of water flow and adsorption processes within the treatment wetland graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nitrogen phosphorus porous media reactive transport modelling wetland design 1 introduction in europe the popularity of constructed wetlands have been amplified by two factors 1 the first factor is resilience to fluctuating hydraulic loading of domestic wastewater and stability in treatment performance during summer and winter seasons the second factor is economic and ecological benefits which are provided due to low energy requirements maintenance costs and ability to integrate natural biological chemical and physical mechanisms for pollutants degradation in the filtration beds microorganisms and planted macrophytes the types of sub surface flow cws recently in use range from passive wetlands to more advanced engineered wetlands 2 however performance of cws have been limited by the deficiency of oxygen transfer to the filtration beds due to the continuous saturation of filter media during cold season and large loading 3 4 for that reason a so called tidal flow cw with rhythmic cycle of flood drain with wastewater has been suggested to provide better oxic anoxic conditions for nitrification and denitrification processes 5 9 substantial variation in the phosphorus p removal has been observed among different types of cws however superior removal performance was found in studies on aerated systems 10 the aeration method with tidal flow i e hydroperiods with flood and drain should then be a technical solution imitating nutrient removal processes in natural flooding wetlands 11 hamisi et al 12 designed and operated a treatment step of wastewater as a tidal flow constructed wetland tfcw after a package treatment plant ptp in our previous works the same wetland construction has been called sequencing batch constructed wetland sbcw but to follow a more common terminology it has been changed to tfcw the use of ptps for onsite wastewater treatment has increased during the past two decades in the nordic countries 13 15 treatment systems are bioreactors with and without filter media or chemical precipitation for phosphorus p removal however there are concerns about their environmental impact 15 16 the tfcw technology as an add on system to ptps would help to improve the overall nutrient treatment performance but also the removal of emerging organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides hormones surfactants flame retardants and plasticizers 17 the current problems to be solved and investigated in this paper is the insufficiency of the ptps using reactive filter media to remove nitrogen and reduce ph of the alkaline effluent in a post treatment step consisting of a constructed wetland moreover the increasing p concentration in the effluent must be considered as the filter mass ages the removal capacities of the reactive materials have been tested by many researchers during the past two decades and various inorganic materials has particularly been investigated in laboratory experiments or in full scale on site wastewater systems owt 18 21 several companies have adopted the idea of so called p filters as an integrated unit of manufactured ptps 15 the treatment mechanisms in ptps are mainly provided by biofilm growth in biofiltration tanks and precipitation of p due to oversaturation of calcium ca2 ions in the alkaline filter material during the life of the filter significant amounts of crystalline calcium phosphates accumulate 20 the unsolved problem with the ptp technology is still how to reduce high ph 9 in treated wastewater in a simple and cost effective way as it can affect the survival of sensitive biota in aquatic ecosystems 21 environmental authorities in sweden have increased the restrictions on permits for wastewater discharge from on site treatment plants by requiring discharge ph of between 6 5 and 9 and high removal of p 90 and nitrogen n 50 in sensitive areas reducing the adverse effects of high ph effluents capturing ca2 ions release from alkaline filter media and improving post treatment of n and p by installing a tidal flow constructed wetland tfcw can help to tackle these problems 18 22 the tfcw system used in our study had filling up and draining phases of water the periodicity depends on the production of wastewater in the households connected to the system 11 the determinant mechanisms for pollutants removal in the tfcw depend on a greater oxygen transfer capacity and a longer contact time to supplement affinity for fully nitrification and phosphorus adsorption in the wetland substrate other mechanisms are plant uptakes straining and attachment of the colloidal particulates in the layer of biofilm coverage in porous substrates plant roots and rhizomes 23 24 although the tfcw has been successfully constructed 12 its performance due to effects of fluctuating climate conditions summer and winter inflow water borne pollutant accumulation and concentration and aeration need to be fully understood for process optimization of the tfcw we used two approaches to evaluate the performance of a tfcw 1 in situ monitoring of the treatment performance of a full scale tfcw over a nine month period assessing the influence of four environmental abiotic factors dissolved oxygen do redox potential temperature and ph on n and p removal 2 use of process modelling in the comsol multiphysics platform to describe mechanisms on nutrient adsorption and transport and predict long term propagation of n p and do concentration in the porous sand filter medium different process models predicting the fate of pollutants in the cws have been developed over the past two decades 25 29 however the majority assume relatively simple geometry and consider first order reaction transport of single pollutant in one dimensional 1d or two dimensional 2d domains without iterating the effects of abiotic factors and processes for water flow reaction transport and heat transfer in the filtration beds 30 32 an attempt to develop such a coupled three dimensional 3d water flow and reactive transport model is demonstrated in this paper for engineered tfcw designs the main objective of the study was to conduct an in depth investigation of the treatment performance of tfcw and discuss the possible contribution to optimize owts in sweden besides assessing the treatment performance of the studied tfcw we also assessed the effects of the present wetland design and the fill drain management we assumed that an tfcw is highly efficient and reliable for owts if it fulfils the present discharge criteria for sensitive water recipients 90 for tot p or 1 mg l 1 50 for tot n or 40 mg l 1 and 9 for ph in sweden 33 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of pilot tfcw system a pilot scale owts plant was designed and constructed in autumn 2017 for domestic wastewater treatment from two households fig 1a the owt system consists of three treatment systems 1 septic tank st clarifier 2 ptp and 3 tfcw system as an add on unit for post treatment of effluent from the ptp system fig 1b the tfcw system was commissioned and pre tested in winter and spring 2018 and monitored its performance over nine month from summer 2018 through winter 2019 the average daily volume of wastewater produced by two households 4 persons connected to the system was 0 65 m3 0 2 m3 however the system is dimensioned for 10 person equivalents and a daily wastewater flow of 1 6 m3 the wetland comprises a total bed volume of 35 6 m3 and is subdivided into three sections the first section 3 72 m3 is an inlet area filled with crushed granite coarse gravel 16 32 mm where wastewater influent from the ptp system is distributed uniformly to the wetland through perforated pipes placed at a depth of 0 15 m fig 1 the second section 25 5 m3 is a filter bed with 50 tons of sand brought from a local gravel pit the well graded sand is characterized by a particle size distribution d50 of 0 8 mm a uniformity coefficient of 5 94 cu d60 d10 and porosity ø of 28 66 the hydraulic conductivity of the sand filter was measured using a falling head permeameter and found to be 2 48 m d 1 in the sand filter 27 small sampling pipes diameter 16 mm were installed for taking samples from the top 0 0 2 m middle 0 2 0 4 m and deep 0 4 0 6 m sand filter layers fig 1b the third section 6 4 m3 is the drainage layer i e the bottom of the whole tfcw where all water from the wetland is collected through perforated pipes and transported to the outlet well diameter 0 55 m depth 1 0 m the wetland is lined with impermeable plastic sheeting 4 mm to prevent water flow between the tfcw and the surrounding soil the wetland was planted with cattail typha latifolia in autumn 2017 at a plant spacing of 100 cm and cattail growth was measured for the first time in september 2018 the wetland was loaded intermittently filling and draining the beds using the influent wastewater from the ptp system filling up the system takes 5 9 days which means that water in the near bottom layers will have longer hydraulic retention time hrt than the surface layers the tfcw drains automatically after the water level reaches 0 1 m depth below the soil surface i e when the wetland is saturated treated water is pumped to a tile drainage system in an adjacent agricultural field which discharges to a ditch a pump with a capacity of about 75 l min 1 is installed at the outlet sampling well fig 1c and operates batch wise in 35 40 min until the wetland is drained the start of monitoring was delayed to june 2018 due to severe winter conditions in 2017 2018 and sampling was extended up to february 2019 detailed description of the whole system is provided by hamisi et al 12 2 2 sampling and analysis grab samples were taken from the small sampling pipes and outlet well in the tfcw before and after emptying the wetland through pumping events every 5 9 days samples were taken in 100 ml acid washed bottles at the outlet before pumping and after pumping and transported to the kth seed water centre laboratory for chemical analyses they were analyzed for different species of inorganic nitrogen nh4 n no3 n no2 n and p po4 p total p using a seal auto analyzer aa3 seal analytical inc mequon wisconsin usa total inorganic nitrogen tin was calculated as the sum of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n since the water samples collected from the tfcw sampling points were very turbid they were filtered through munktell filter paper followed by 0 45 μm sartorius filters water temperature c ph do electrical conductivity ec μscm 1 and redox potential mv were measured in situ on each sampling occasion using a hach hq40d multimeter hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany all probes connected to the instrument were calibrated prior to analysis percentage mass removal of nutrients was calculated based on the flow rate equation eq 1 1

2 3 modelling of fluid flow and reactive transport 2 3 1 water flow the hydraulic water flow in variably saturated sand filter was simulated by a closed set of van genuchten parameters the permeability model of water flow in the porous soil matrix was based on the measured hydraulic conductivities of the sand fine 2 85 m d 1 and porosity ø 43 gravel coarse 452 m d 1 and porosity ø 28 clay 0 0002 m d 1 and porosity ø 42 fig 2 the tfcw design was optimized by assessing on how a given change of the hydraulic conductivity and abiotic factors do temperature and redox conditions electrical conductivity ec was affecting the adsorption capacity of the sand materials the three horizontal sand filter domains top middle deep were used to model the behavior of water flow accumulation at different depths richard s equation was implemented in the comsol multiphysics 5 6 software as the main governing equation for modelling water flow in the variably saturated porous filters 2 3 2 reactive transport and adsorption the add on modules of multi components reactive transport model was used to simulate the water flow biogeochemical reaction and adsorption of p and n species in the saturated porous media the comsol multiphysics 5 6 software was selected to implement this model because of its solver performance and typical functionality of software to couple any physics interface the transport and adsorption were simulated into two phases mobile aqueous phase c k and immobile solid phase s k of k th species eq 2 2 θ c k t ρ s k t x i θ d ij c k x i x i q i c

coefficient for the liquid l3 t 1 q i is the volumetric flux discharged from the system l t 1 r i is the reaction rate of the k th species m l 3 t 1 space dependency of the chemical species was introduced after coupling reaction engineering with the transport interface for water flow and species transport in porous media 2 3 3 nutrients and microbial transformation the governing reaction rates for ammonium nitrification and hydrolysis of organics i e conversion of slowly degradable into readily soluble organics were formulated as monod kinetics according to expressions from the constructed wetland no 2 cwm2 for dual permeability and transport of water flow eqs 3 and 4 the model was run for transient variably saturated and unsaturated sand filter conditions transformation of two pools of inorganic n nh4 n no3 n and one pool of inorganic p po4 p was considered in this study these inorganic n and p species were multiplied in the monod rate equation as the nutrient factor for n transformation via nitrification in unsaturated aerobic nitrified media and denitrification in saturated anaerobic denitrified media nh4 n oxidation in the reaction engineering interface was modelled based on the chemical equations s a1 3 r nh 4 d c nh 4 dt μ ans c o 2 k ans o 2 c o 2 c nh 4 k ans nh 4 c nh 4 c po 4 3 k ans po 4 3 c po 4 3 c ans 4 r c s d c s dt k h c cs c xh k x c cs c

concentration of heterotrophic bacteria mg l 1 k h is hydrolysis rate constant l d and k x is the half saturation coefficient for organic matter hydrolysis nh4 n oxidation was modelled in a two step process from ammonium nh4 n over nitrate no3 n to nitrite no2 n to solve eq 3 the bulk concentrations of nh4 do and po4 p species determined in field measurements table 1 were defined as the initial boundary condition in the aqueous bulk solution it was assumed that all n and p species were transported in the dissolved solution except for nitrifying bacteria which were modelled as a solid phase these transported species were assumed to undergo reaction with do and to be removed by adsorption in the pore interfacial region between the solid sand phase immobile and aqueous liquid phase mobile it was also assumed that nh4 n was the most mobile species in reducing conditions and that no2 n was the least mobile in oxidizing conditions nitrosomonas and nitrobacter oxidizing bacteria were assumed to use do to nitrify nh 4 n into no2 the bacteria were assumed to attach to the pores of sand filter layers and form biofilm in saturated conditions the sand filters were assumed to be under anoxic reducing conditions when the water flow was relatively steady in anoxic conditions the retained bacteria use no2 as an electron acceptor and it undergoes hydrolysis eq 3 whereby slowly biodegradable organics are decomposed into readily biodegradable organic forms 23 partial differential equations describing transport mechanisms of convective water flow and dispersive and mass transfer of dissolved species in the porous sand filter eq 2 were solved using the finite element method in the comsol multiphysics 5 6 software 2 3 4 geometry and boundary conditions the geometry of the tfcw domains fig 2 was created in comsol and discretized into 114 952 finite elements of minimum length 0 144 m and maximum length 0 802 m a physical memory of 3 09 gb and virtual memory of 4 09 were needed to run discretized model using a multifrontal massively parallel sparse direct solver mumps at time steps of 2 days and free meshing time of 6 06 s the water uptake by plants was not simulated in this model because the planted cattail typha latifolia was not well established in the wetland after only one growing season however it will be added in the future as a sink term for nutrients in the reactive transport equation eq 2 to model the effects of time and space variable loading regime of solute transport the concentration gradient second type of boundary condition neuman condition was set at the outlet boundary the concentration fluxes third type boundary condition cauchy condition was defined at the boundary along the inlet boundary to simulate the state variable of input concentration the constant head first type boundary condition dirichlet condition was set to the saturated layer near the outlet boundary 2 4 model calibration and validation sensitivity analysis was performed to assist the model calibration in identifying parameters with the greatest influence in fitting the measured concentration of nh4 n no3 n and po4 p from the pumping tests to investigate the effects of wetland design on treatment performance sensitivity analysis was performed by adjusting the value of 14 parameters by 10 above and below the default value the parameters tested included partition coefficient k d influent concentration c i molecular diffusive coefficient d mol permeability k m media saturation maximum sorption capacity s d and the hydrolysis rate constant k h the influence of each parameter was evaluated by visual comparison of model response in matching the measured concentration of tin and nh4 n we adjusted one parameter at a time and ran the model while keeping other parameters constant the goal was to determine how a given change in the parameter influenced the model in reproducing and matching the measured data sensitivity coefficient was calculated as the ratio between the relative change of model outputs and parameter tested 34 sl c c p p where sl is the local sensitivity coefficient c is state variable output and p is the parameter tested 2 5 statistical analysis two way analysis of variance was performed in ibm spss statistics version 26 ibm 2021 new york usa to identify significant differences between means of chemical samples collected from three sampling locations tfcw sand filter layers the outlet well and pumping tests the linear relationship between the mean of independent variables was evaluated using pearson correlation coefficient to assess the main effects of interactions between the mean variables post hoc tests of multivariate variables were quantified using the least significant difference lsd model of variance analysis the model was tested at a high degree of confidence intervals ci 95 and significance level p 0 05 in all tests the descriptive statistics box plots of mean values were used to display patterns and describe the normal distribution of the data and uncertainty and compare the treatment performance of the tfcw designs the total number of samples analyzed are listed in table 1 3 results 3 1 overall performance of the wastewater treatment system the wastewater parameters of fluatuating domestic wastewater flow through from the ptp system to the tfcw system are shown in table 1 these influents are usually characterized by high ph 9 55 0 92 s a2 and high concentration of nh4 n 38 67 21 18 mg l 1 do 3 99 3 11 mg l 1 and positive redox potential 152 38 31 52 mv the wastewater parameters at the wetland outlet well showed that the entire pilot scale owt system was efficient in removing nh4 n 75 74 and po4 p 56 1 and lowering ph from 9 55 to 8 08 15 table 1 the do concentration in the tfcw was relatively low 2 22 2 16 mg l 1 and redox potential decreased from the aerobic conditions in the top layer 123 70 4 15 mv to the anaerobic and anoxic conditions in the middle layer 79 16 25 32 mv and deep layer 52 11 21 29 mv table 1 the efficacy of thetfcw system during the nine months of field experiments showed similar trend of tin removal in the top and middle 49 layer and slightly reduced efficiency shown in the deep layer 47 the average concentration of no3 n achieved in the top 24 06 14 45 mg l 1 layer and in the middle 23 71 15 68 mg l 1 layer are indicative of oxidized nh4 n because of diffused oxygen from atmospheric air the deep layer was slightly higher 25 99 14 38 mg l 1 and increased during pumping periods similarly the average temperature in the tfcw displayed a decreasing trend from the top 13 66 1 71 c to the deep 10 20 1 27 c layer 3 1 1 phosphorus removal the po4 p removal rate at the tfcw outlet well was 45 in summer and 53 in winter and the efficiency severely reduced during pumping test to 20 in summer and 10 in winter fig 3a and b the influent total p concentration from the reactive p filter to the tfcw ranged in winter and summer from 0 02 to 4 40 mg l 1 mean 1 46 mg l 1 and 0 01 to 3 17 mg l 1 mean 0 78 mg l 1 respectively mean mass removal rate of total p concentration was consistently stable 70 in the top and middle sand filter layers during summer and decreased severely towards the deep layer 30 during the winter season the average concentration of dissolved po4 p measured at the tfcw outlet well was 0 58 mg l 1 in summer and 0 34 mg l 1 in the winter season fig 4a and b the po4 p concentration monitored during the summer season showed a stable performance which corresponded to a mean efficiency of 76 in the top layer 80 in middle layer and 94 in deep layer fig 4a the total p concentration in the tfcw sand filter displayed a clear trend of increasing concentration from 1 26 mg l 1 in the top layer 1 71 mg l 1 in the middle layer to 2 61 mg l 1 in the deep layer during the winter season fig 4b however the average concentration of dissolved po4 p in the three sand layers was below 0 5 mg l 1 in the summer and winter 3 1 2 nitrogen removal the rate of n removal in the tfcw sand filtration beds showed fluctuating average concentration of nitrified ammonium nitrogen nh4 n into nitrate nitrogen no3 n and nitrite nitrogen no2 n fig 5a showed the significant mass removal rate of nh4 n concentration during summer 87 and during winter 15 despite that the mean influent was quite high 54 mg l 1 in the winter the mean removal rates of no3 n and no2 n no3 n concentration in the tfcw sand filtration beds was consistently stable in the summer and winter fig 5a and b also showed the highest removal of oxidized nh4 n during summer 88 and winter 70 to mainly no3 n in the aerated biofiltration tank bf the average mass removal efficiencies in the tfcw outlet well were higher in summer for nh4 n 60 and moderate lower in the winter 32 the mean effluents of nitrogen parameters in the tfcw outlet well were higher for tin 47 mg l 1 and nh4 n 15 mg l 1 in the summer than the winter season fig 5a and b the most surprising aspect of wetland performance was the increase in no2 n concentration 0 28 mg l 1 at the tfcw outlet well the effects of preferential flow in the tfcw filtration beds are clearly apparent in fig 5a and b where the performance of top layer middle layer and deep layer showed a negative treatment efficacy and an erratic patterns of tin distribution the concentration of no2 n no3 n which is immobilized by microbes nitrosomonas spp from nh4 n also displayed an erratic trend fig 5a and b with most immobilization occurring at the top and middle sand filter layers the mean tin concentration was consistently stable in the top and middle sand filter beds 27 mg l 1 and slightly increased in the deep layer 31 mg l 1 none of these differences was statistically significant p 0 05 however there were significant differences between the tfcw outlet well and the top sand filter layer p 0 038 the middle layer p 0 029 and the deep layer p 0 037 it is interesting to observe the similar concentration of tin no2 n no3 n and no3 n in the tfcw deep sand filter layer for summer 33 mg l 1 and winter 22 mg l 1 season fig 6a and b these corresponded to the treatment efficacy of tin concentration at the tfcw deep sand filter in the summer 63 and winter tin 45 the overall reduction in nh4 n and tin concentration at the tfcw outlet was 54 and 75 in the summer and winter respectively fig 6a and b 3 1 3 observations of ph do ec temperature redox potential and turbidity the variations of wastewater quality parameters drained from the tfcw outlet to the recipient ditch are shown in fig 7 a e for the summer season and fig 7 f j for the winter season the temporal changes are shown in s 1 fig 7a and b shows that the tfcw system received wastewater effluent from an alkaline p filter material where ph in the summer and winter was 10 and 9 respectively in the summer season trends showed that ph was successfully decreased from the top layer ph 8 24 to the middle layer ph 7 60 and slightly increased in the deep sand filter in the winter season fig 7f the tfcw also displayed stable ability of reducing ph by 19 to the nearly neutral conditions mean ph 7 28 in sand filter layers the transfer of dissolved oxygen do concentration showed to be more variable in the tfcw sand filter beds fig 7b in summer the average do concentration in the tfcw sand filtration beds were rather low around 2 81 mg l 1 in the top layer 1 14 mg l 1 in the middle layer and 1 88 mg l 1 in the deep layer the sampling campaigns for measurements of do concentrations were not performed in the severe winter conditions from december 2018 until february 2019 fig 7g mean oxygen concentration from the aerated bf and p filter bag showed varying concentrations with those from the p filter bag deviating most between 1 mg l 1 and 9 5 mg l 1 mean 4 24 mg l 1 in the summer in winter do concentrations varied between 0 5 mg l 1 and 7 mg l 1 mean 0 93 mg l 1 fig 7b and g the do in the tfcw outlet water had an average concentration of 1 16 mg l 1 in the summer and increased to november resulting in a mean concentration of around 2 6 mg l 1 in the winter the wastewater treated in the owt system showed diurnal variations and decreasing trend of mean ec values in both seasons in summer the ec in the influent septic tank was 1930 μs cm 1 and effluents at the tfcw outlet was 1685 μs cm 1 fig 7c and h mean ec of influent wastewater to the wetland was similar to that of the 1721 μs cm 1 tfcw effluent in july 2018 when the sand filter material was fresh the mean ec at the tfcw outlet was low 1685 μs cm 1 in both seasons there were minor diurnal variations in ec during the measurements fig 7 c h mean ec in the wetland also decreased from the top layer 1735 69 87 μs cm 1 to the middle layer 1584 374 88 μs cm 1 and deep layer 1525 237 μs cm 1 at the tfcw outlet the measured temperature during the summer increased from 15 c in july to 24 c in august in the winter season the mean temperature in the tfcw outlet was relatively low 4 4 c fig 7d and i in both seasons the effluents water from the tfcw outlet was very clear with a turbidity below 2 ntu fig 7e and j 3 1 4 mass of phosphorus and nitrogen removal the mass balance analyses in table 2 showed the retained mass of nutrients in the sand filter bed varied over the course of nine months our results showed that the amount of retained tin was much higher in the summer 124 79 g m 2 than in the winter 106 20 g m 2 season most interesting was that we observed that the retained mass of total p was six times higher 6 93 g m 2 in winter than in summer table 2 our results also showed that the mass of retained po4 p was elevated from the top 0 05 g m 2 layer middle 0 37 g m 2 layer to the deep 0 42 g m 2 layer however the quantity of retained tin was similar in the top and middle 71 69 g m 2 layer and slightly increased towards the deep layer 87 62 g m 2 comparisons of the sand filter beds in summer revealed statistically significant differences p 0 05 with those values in winter 3 2 optimization of tfcw system during pumping tests and reactive transport modelling 3 2 1 pumping tests fig 8 a d shows temporal variation of the wastewater quality parameters no3 n no2 n ph do redox potential and ec discharged to the recipient ditch the invaluable information displayed in fig 8a showed a consecutive peak of no3 n concentration during 100 days of the tfcw operation despite the constant discharge this fluctuation is no surprise because of seasonal variation of influent wastewater generated by users of the owt system the no2 n concentration decreased in a step before it was depleted completely in the wetland after 50 days during the pumping test in august the ph was elevated with a mean value of 9 4 fig 8b after september the ph was 8 in all pumping tests there were more peaks and variations in ph in the pumping test in october but a linear change in ph in the pumping test in november as the pumping time increased the ph became consistently stable in the pumping test in august the ph showed a decreasing trend from 8 6 to 8 during 80 min of pumping period in august and september the whole wetland was in oxidizing conditions however the oxidizing conditions differed between pumping periods e g redox potential decreased in august from 200 mv to 190 mv due to oxygen depletion fig 8c redox potential decreased during the low temperature season from 165 mv to 145 mv in september indicating that the wetland was transforming from aerobic to anoxic conditions there was a peak in redox potential at the pumping test on september 6 due to downward diffusive and advective transport of oxidized water to the effluent tfcw well the ec values ranged from 1560 10 75 μs cm 1 for the pumping test in august when the sand filter material was fresh to 1800 15 60 μs cm 1 for the pumping test in october on both occasions there were minor diurnal variations in ec during the pumping tests mean ec in the wetland decreased from the top layer 1735 69 87 μs cm 1 to the middle layer 1584 374 88 μs cm 1 and deep layer 1525 237 μs cm 1 the ec of influent wastewater to the wetland was 1576 72 70 μs cm 1 and that in the tfcw effluent was 1604 68 00 μs cm 1 fig 8d 3 2 2 reactive transport model calibration and validation the behavior of the predicted tin nh4 n po4 p and do concentration showed good agreement with the experimental data at the tfcw outlet during pumping fig 8 e h trends of simulated tin was essentially not captured well by the model due to the seasonal variations of nitrified no3 n and no2 n the concentration of nh4 n matched quite well with experimental observation where the magnitude of nh4 n depleted after 150 days of wetland operation while the tin concentration decreased by 51 from 49 5 mg l 1 to 24 2 mg l 1 fig 8 e f the do in the outlet water initially had an average concentration of 1 8 mg l 1 then the do concentration increased exponentially from 2 5 to 8 4 mg l 1 in the first 20 min of each pumping occasion fig 8g indicative of the effects of pumping rates for oxygen transfer in the filter beds the progressive increase of do concentration was then stabilized and met the wetland oxygen saturation at 9 mg l 1 after one hour 60 min of constant pumping rate 75 l min 1 this saturation was required for several competing processes such as nitrification mineralization and immobilization of n and p concentration this increased from september but was still low around 3 mg l 1 fig 8h showed the concentration of effluent phosphorus po4 p was increased in the first 20 min of each pumping occasion and the effluent concentration decreased stepwise with an increased pumping circle 3 2 3 modelling water flow pattern different zones of water flow i e active dead and intermediate zones and preferential flow along the vertical sampling pipes in the filter bed were observed fig 9 in this tfcw design high water flow velocity occurred in the area near to the deep layer which is classified as a denitrified zone represented by red color the wetland revealed a slight increase of water flow in the dead zone and the inlet zone these phenomena also had the advantage of increasing diffusive flux of oxidized water transfer between the inlet and outlet the tfcw design had a long travel time of water to the outlet while the inlet domain and middle layer experienced more process of water circulation after 3 to 7 days fig 9 the behavior of fully developed water saturation in the model did not differ from the experimental observation in the field where the sand filter bed reached saturation after 7 days with a saturated filter media the wetland experienced low oxygen transfer to the middle and deep layer the homogeneous distribution of water flow in the wetland with micro zonation and excess water flow was observed in the inlet and middle layer due to the effects of vertical up feeding mode 3 2 4 parameter sensitivity analysis the calibrated value for linear adsorption coefficient k d was in agreement 10th percentile table 3 with published values from 35 the modelling revealed that the water in the tfcw exhibited different water flow pathways and micro zonation of water accumulation with e g long flow path and good mixing behavior in tfcw design 1 dead micro zones and partial water mixing and short flow paths and uniformity of water flow behavior in tfcw design langergraber 36 presented a 2d model and discussed the success and challenges of applying a cw2d process model to simulate the processes of nh4 n and organic transformation in an indoor vertical flow cw our model showed good ability to reproduce the exponential increase in do and po4 p concentrations of the parameters adjusted during model calibration table 3 few adjustments were made to the parameter for maximum growth of oxidizing bacteria μans and hydrolysis rate constant k h because we found these to be least sensitive for capturing the response of po4 p concentration however they were observed to be the source of po4 p release to solution as fig 8 shows the model successfully reproduced the exponential trends in do and po4 p and the decreasing trends in tin and nh4 n concentrations the randomness of po4 p and do concentrations measured during the pumping tests fig 8 a d demonstrates the classical behavior of variably saturated conditions of the sand filter in the tfcw filter bed however in the pumping tests revealed that the concentrations of do po4 p and tin stabilized the longer the pumping lasted indicating a well mixed solution and lower gradients in species concentrations the modelling results revealed a decreasing trend in tin concentration from 49 mg l 1 to 20 mg l 1 after simulating the wetland with different influent for 300 days runtime fig 8e 4 discussion 4 1 nitrogen and phosphorus removal we used two approaches to investigate the performance of the tfcw i e monitoring its performance in the field and using a process model and pumping tests to investigate the effects of design on its hydraulic behavior and its nutrient removal capacity we found the highest mean concentration of 47 mg l 1 for tin which means that the swedish limit value for effluent tot n concentration of 40 mg l 1 will be exceed at least during the summer months the main factor of n removal in the top layer is probably direct contact between the wetland surface and atmospheric air increasing diffusive transport of oxygen to the porous top layer and by the plants and their roots under establishment 39 the two convective aeration pipes installed in the tfcw helped to transport oxygen to the bottom layer especially during the pumping and draining of the wetland we found no significant difference in nh4 n removal between the three sand filter layers p 0 05 although the top and deep layers were more effective in numerical terms there were a few erratic changes in nh4 n concentration in the middle zone of the tfcw this could be attributed to preferential flow due to extracellular development of biofilms in the sand pores at the inlet zone and prevailing strong anoxic conditions in the middle zone in anoxic conditions the no3 produced by nitrification of nh4 is consumed by heterotrophic bacteria as an electron acceptor in the denitrification process 40 these findings demonstrate that the current design of the tfcw which is operated intermittently i e filling and draining the wetland favors oxygen availability in the filter bed enhancing n removal however the availability of oxygen in the bulk water increased strongly after the wetland became saturated oxygen is the most limiting element for effective removal of n in the tfcw oxidizing conditions and ph close to neutral were found by morvannou et al 41 to be preferable in cws to maintain stable forms of p bound in the wetland substrate our results indicate that most p was bound in the bottom layer where low concentrations of oxygen occurred during winter the gradient observed for both n and p with increasing concentrations from surface to bottom layer was related to the difference in hrt i e longer time and more volume of water passing during fill and drain periods however the erratic patterns in nh4 n distribution at some sampling points indicate problems of preferential flow in those areas or incomplete nitrification due to low oxygen concentration caused by clogging of the inlet zone or high ec of incoming water gains and losses of water in the wetland caused by increases in temperature and rainwater could contribute to erratic nh4 n concentrations the effects of the cattail plants on nutrient uptake oxygen transfer and organics transformation were not investigated because the plants were not yet fully established at the time of the study and probably did not contribute much to p uptake and storage 22 on the other hand the total p mass in the tfcw was much lower in the summer than in the winter which can possibly indicate some p uptake by the cattail plants the mass balance approach table 2 revealed that the tfcw is capable to remove po4 p 56 16 from an influent concentration of 1 46 1 70 mg l 1 to an effluent concentration of 0 64 0 30 mg l 1 which is less than the threshold value for on site wastewater discharge 1 mg l 1 in sensitive environments 12 the treatment efficiency of the tfcw is much higher than previous estimates of dissolved po4 p removal reported for an aerated vertical flow wetland 48 22 or an infiltration sand filter 22 28 however the vertical flow wetland received wastewater with a concentration of 45 mg l 1 while corresponding value for the tfcw was 1 12 mg l 1 the sand filter on the other hand operates with un saturated wastewater flow and the sand material can differ in physico chemical properties depending on origin several bench scale and field trials have demonstrated that high concentrations of cations such as fe2 al3 and ca2 are the key drivers of high po4 p removal in sand filters 19 42 in mid september 2018 many grab samples from the inlet sampling pipes had a dark color strong odor and layer of white precipitated calcium carbonates this indicates that most of the lost organic matter and ca2 ions from the ptp were captured in the inlet zone which is thus greatly at risk of clogging according to vidal et al 12 clogging can occur very quickly in fine sand filters because extracellular bacterial slime accumulates rapidly in the sand pores other studies show that the adsorption capacity of sand filters is not very strong and permanent due to the low content of iron fe and aluminum al for p precipitation 43 19 there is considerable evidence that small particle size can increase the binding surface areas of filter materials 34 4 2 effects of temperature ph redox potential do and ec on nutrient removal environmental factors limited transformation degradation and removal of organics and nutrients in the tfcw among these temperature precipitation ph redox potential ec and do concentration are the most influential abiotic factors modifying physical chemical transformation of pollutants in tfcw tests on the effects of these parameters in the tfcw during pumping between august 22 and november 14 2018 revealed that treatment performance of the wetland in the field was probably most affected by variations in weather conditions i e temperature and precipitation which normally cause water loss during the high temperature season and water gain during the rainy or snowy season both have great impacts on the processes responsible for n and p transformation 44 45 the ability of the tfcw to respond in these parameters is the issue for future studies especially on the removal of n and organics is low in winter due to effects of low temperature 18 22 many studies have demonstrated that temperature plays a critical role in improving the p adsorption capacity of filter media and modifying growth of the autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria responsible for nutrient uptake and decomposition 46 47 overall the pumping tests showed that pumping has a positive benefit in improving oxygen transfer from the inlet and the wetland surface this indicates that the present design of this wetland provides sufficient oxygen for nitrification but not for p removal in the deep layer where oxygen deficit occurs increased p removal could be expected if oxygen was available and the redox potential was positive in that layer however the p binding to the sand gravel matrix can decrease and completely cease with time despite oxygenated conditions 48 in the pumping test in august 2018 the ph was elevated with a mean value of 9 4 after september 2018 the ph was 8 in all pumping tests there were more peaks and variations in ph in the pumping test in october 2018 and there was a linear change in ph in the pumping test in november 2018 high ph values of the wastewater can lead to nitrogen being released as ammonia which is not desirable on the other hand the elevated ph is in favor of the phosphorus removal which is driven by the ca enriched water released from the purification stage p bag prior the wetland the effluent problem with high alkaline filter materials ph 12 has been addressed before when used as substrate in cws 49 however the idea of the tfcw investigated is to reduce ph simultaneously with n and p post removal a recent study by bove et al 50 demonstrated that the use of passive co2 acidification can reduce the ph from 11 to 7 5 but that approach is somewhat difficult to implement in on site wastewater treatment and where weather conditions are very dynamic in the present study tfcw treatment performance improved during summer and declined during winter when the wetland water volume was much higher the effect of temperature in improving performance of subsurface flow cw was reported previously by kahl et al 51 the do concentration in the tfcw was a key driver for oxidizing nh4 n hydrolysis and aerobic mineralization of organics however the concentration varied from 2 5 to 9 mg l 1 depending on three factors temperature filter depth and filter saturation condition high removal efficiency of nh4 n was observed in the top and middle layers of the sand filter where the redox measurements indicated aerobic conditions the nh4 n removal efficiency decreased in the deep layer located near the tfcw outlet well because of anoxic conditions kim et al 52 observed that the redox potential was affected by the water saturation level and the feeding resting periods of a vertical flow cw they concluded that the system cope with periodical flooding without loss in performance anoxic conditions occurred in parts of the tfcw and the reason for this do absence should be further investigated however we observed that weakly pumping causes a flow from the infiltration section of the wetland which increase the risk for insufficient treated wastewater to reach the deep layer and the outlet zone decomposition of accumulated waterborne particulate organic matter in the bottom of the wetland cause with time oxygen consumption and anaerobic conditions we suggest that it is probably necessary to modify the length and location of drainage pipes in order to increase water retention recirculation of water oxygenation of the deep filter layers and the above mentioned short circuit in the wetland the high ec values recorded during sampling and throughout the pumping tests are unusual for on site wastewater and was due to the salinity of tap water houses in rural areas in the nordic countries rely heavily on private wells for their water supply 53 the two houses connected to the tfcw system use groundwater from one deep well which has elevated levels of salt this is a common situation in the coastal areas and has implications not only for the consumption of water but also for the function of wastewater treatment systems 54 for instance it is known that wastewater with high salinity inhibit po4 p removal in systems using filter materials 22 and manufacturers of onsite treatment systems have reported that activated sludge biofilters are affected by salt water k g niska pers comm problems in the treatment function of small scale treatment plants should also include the impact of salt whether it comes from salt groundwater via drinking water wells or from softening plants commonly used in individual houses 5 conclusion the present constructed wetland design exhibited to be an appropriate technology for post treatment of nitrogen phosphorus and buffering high ph from the package treatment plant however less p removal is compromised between the summer and winter season with respect to the variations of volumetric wastewater from private houses and lower temperature in the sand filter layers during winter a stand of cattail has been planted but the plants are still small so sand filtration was probably the most important nutrient removal process in the tfcw system at this moment to optimize performance of the tfcw system design the multiple component reactive transport model was successfully developed calibrated and validated using the pumping tests data from the pilot tfcw experiment the modelling results fitted to the pumping experiments this implies that operating the wetland intermittently by filling and draining will improve exponentially the oxygen supply to deep sand filter layers and regenerate the binding charge of sand filter materials the modelling results have reliably simulated the uniformity behavior of hydraulic water flow velocity and active adsorption of phosphorus in the middle layer an improvement of the nutrient removal performance can be solved by changes in the present placement of the drainage pipes future studies of the tfcw system will reveal comprehensive information and provide a detailed understanding of its

13002,we conducted experiments and reactive transport simulations to assess the removal of high concentrations of toxic metals 100 mg l commonly found in produced water from high saline waters 45 000 115 000 mg l using dolomite filters made of compressed powdered dolomite the focus was on ba sr cd pb and as as well as on guar gum as a metal complexing additive we found that salinity has a significant impact on the removal of sr and ba but a mild impact on the removal of cd an increase of ph due the dissolution of dolomite increases the removal of cd more significantly than the removal of ba and sr the formation of guar gum complexes of metals in the aqueous phase attenuates the removal of sr ba and cd by dolomite filtration this attenuation process is more significant for cd than for sr and ba the affinity sequence for the sorption of toxic metals at salinity levels of pw is pb cd as ba sr higher removal levels predicted for sr than for ba and over predictions of cd removal using previously proposed surface complexation models for dolomite highlights the necessity of further experimental research to incorporate molecular scale surface crystal structure parameters into surface complexation models graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords petroleum produced water mixture toxic metals sorption dolomite filtration 1 introduction produced water pw from conventional and unconventional oil and gas reservoirs contains high concentrations of dissolved salts mostly nacl caco3 mgco3 and organic and inorganic contaminants heavy metals alkaline earth metals metalloids and naturally occurring radioactive materials norm constitute the most abundant inorganic contaminants in pw 1 their concentrations greatly exceed the maximum contaminant levels established by the usa environmental protection agency epa for drinking water 2 to prevent contamination of surface and underground sources of drinking water usdw pw is frequently disposed by injection into deep saline aquifers 3 the depth of disposal wells ranges between few hundreds to thousands of meters depending on the geology of the play for instance since the discovery of oil and gas in oklahoma usa huge volumes of pw have been injected into dolomite saline aquifers of the arbuckle group according to clark and veil 4 in 2007 the total volume of pw in oklahoma was 2 2 bbbl and the total volume of pw in u s was 20 bbbl year which ranked oklahoma fifth in the u s in pw however according to a more recent study conducted in 2020 5 oklahoma might rank first in pw in the u s the medium depth of pw injection into the arbuckle group is 2088 m and the volumes of pw injection has substantially increased between 2009 and 2014 from 434 mmbbl to more than 1046 mmbbl 6 pw injection into deep geological formations synchronized with increasing seismic events in oklahoma consequently public concerns have grown regarding the possibility of usdw contamination by contaminants present in pw mechanical failures of the injection well and naturally or induced basement fractures can facilitate the upward migration of contaminants present in pw to usdw previous studies on the transport of toxic metals present in pw aimed to elucidate the chemical and physical factors controlling the transport of ba in dolomite saline aquifers 7 9 in light of those studies showing that dolomite has a superior sorption capacity for ba than other natural rock materials e g sandstone and given the observed retarding effect of guar gum on the transport of ba through dolomite cores the goal of this study is twofold first is to fill the knowledge gap regarding the chemical and physical factors controlling the removal of mixture toxic metals by dolomite and second is to assess the feasibility of removing high concentrations of mixture toxic metals from pw by using dolomite filters made of compressed powdered dolomite and guar gum as metal complexing agent previous studies on the removal of metals by dolomite focused on the removal of trace concentrations of single metals from low salinity waters 10 12 the focus of this study is on alkaline earth metals ba and sr and a heavy metal cd whose concentrations in pw can be in the order of hundreds of mg l ba sr and cd are commonly found in pw from oklahoma usa 13 15 and post a risk to human health and the environment long time exposure of cd results in kidney dysfunction and high levels of exposure will result in death sr and ba are also toxic when ingested in high amount 16 according to the world health organization who high sr intakes can cause phosphorus deficiency and an increase in bone density 17 and the scientific committee on health and environmental risk scher showed that chronic exposure to high ba can cause tachycardia hypertension muscle weakness and paralysis in the proposed dolomite filtration method guar gum trapped in small pore throats of the dolomite filter is expected to work as a secondary filtration media to increase the removal of mixture toxic metals from pw other methods to improve the removal of toxic metals by dolomite include thermal activation of dolomite 18 and the use of phosphatized dolomite 19 compared to those methods guar gum is an inexpensive polymer commonly used as a viscosifying additive of hydraulic fracturing fluids 20 21 the positive outlook on this treatment method of pw is on the following scientific and practical considerations 1 dolomite represent a superior sorption capacity for toxic metals than other natural rock materials such as sandstone 2 removal of toxic metals via sorption in dolomite filters presents flexibility in operation since the sorption capacity of the dolomite filter can be restored by back washing the filter and 3 dolomite are abundant in the arbuckle group of oklahoma and kansas where oil and natural gas activities are intensive conventional technologies that could be used to remove toxic metals from pw include chemical precipitation sorption ion exchange electrochemical deposition electrodialysis and biosorption 22 however cost limits the application of these technologies to remove toxic metals from pw since the high salinity of pw cause severe fouling problems as well as inhibition of sorption ion exchange and precipitation reactions 23 the implementation of this new economic technology could reduce the cost of using conventional technologies enabling the integration of pw into industrial and agricultural uses in a previous study we showed a removal level of 1 25 mg ba g dolomite 24 this removal level of ba is comparable to removal levels attained with pecan shell based activated carbon pbac 1 85 mg ba g pbac 25 and mxene nanosheet material 9 3 mg ba g mxene 26 which are expensive to prepare and or synthetize sorption of metals occurs along with dissolution precipitation reactions that are a function of many chemical e g ph ionic strength surface chemistry and composition and physical e g injection flow rate grain size surface area factors therefore our approach to elucidate the chemical and physical factors controlling the removal of mixture toxic metals from water at salinity levels of pw consists of core flooding experiments to assess the effect of individual chemical and physical factors and reactive transport modeling and simulations to assess the effect of combined chemical and physical factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 dolomite samples dolomite samples were collected from a road cuts in south west missouri the site is an extension of the arbuckle group where oil and gas production is prominent 27 x ray and petrographic analyses showed that dolomite collected from this site is composed of 98 dolomite and 2 blocky calcite cement and amorphous silica fig 1 the peaks

between planar euhedral to subhedral and non planner layers with different crystal sizes ranging between 0 1 mm to 0 6 mm fig 1 scanning electron microscopy analysis shows that pore diameter is greater than 0 25 mm image not shown and the pores are poorly connected one another due to calcite cementation 2 2 dolomite filters collected dolomite samples from the arbuckle group were used to prepare dolomite filters 1 5 inch diameter and 6 inch length of same grain size powdered dolomite of same grain size was obtained crushing pulverizing and sieving fig 2 prior to its utilization to prepare dolomite filters to remove dust the obtained powdered dolomite of same grain sizes 600 850 μm and 350 600 μm was washed several times with deionized water in an ultrasonic bath and then dried by air at room temperature the procedure to prepare the dolomite filters consisted of mixing 200 g of powdered dolomite of uniform grain size with 10 g of deionized water the resulting aggregate was poured into a stainless steel cylindrical mold then the aggregate was compressed at 4320 psi for 1 h using a uniaxial compaction apparatus carver laboratory presser model 4387 to assess the effect of guar gum on the removal of mixture toxic metals additional dolomite filters were prepared mixing 200 g of powdered dolomite with 0 5 g and 1 0 g of guar gum fig 2 includes a picture of the prepared dolomite filter following the described procedure 2 3 synthetic produced water synthetic pw was employed to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of results regarding the chemical factors controlling the removal of mixture toxic metals from pw by dolomite filtration synthetic pw was prepared by adding nacl cacl2 2h2o mgc2 6h2o and two groups of metal salts to deionized water group 1 included src2 6h2o bac2 2h2o and cdh8n2o10 group 2 included src2 6h2o bac2 2h2o cdh8n2o10 pbcl2 and ascl3 fisher scientific co with purity of 99 9 this work focuses on pw where the concentration of bicarbonate and sulfate anions is practically negligible compared to the concentration of chlorine anions this is a common type of pw in oklahoma and surrounding states us mid continent 30 the rational for using an arsenic salt ascl3 instead of arsenate salt is that pw originates from an anaerobic environment and that the oxidation of arsenic to arsenate in the presence of air is very slow employed concentrations of ca 6000 mg l and mg 1000 mg l correspond to typical concentrations found in pw from western united states 1 and they were kept constant in all experiments to assess the competition of mixture toxic metals for hydration sites of dolomite and complexation reactions with chlorine ions in the aqueous phase the concentration of sr ba cd pb and as was kept the same 100 mg l in all experiments nacl constitute the main salt compound in pw as such variable concentrations of nacl were employed to obtain synthetic pw of different salinity in this sense the term salinity in the present study refers to the concentration of nacl experiments were conducted with guar gum added to the synthetic pw and with guar gum added to the dolomite filter during its preparation for the experiments conducted with guar gum added to the synthetic pw 0 5 g l of guar gum was added to the synthetic pw 24 h prior to its use to ensure hydration the employed guar gum was provided by pfp technology that supplies additives to hydraulic fracturing and oil field completion companies in the usa 2 4 core flooding experiments core flooding filtration experiments were conducted using a hassler type core holder rch series of core laboratory the experimental procedure consisted of placing two prepared dolomite filters into the core holder under a confining pressure of 2300 psi injection of synthetic pw containing toxic metals was done through the bottom of the core holder at a constant flow rate injection was done using a 260 dual syringe pump teledyne isco through a floating piston accumulator containing 1 l of synthetic pw temperature was ambient temperature 20 c and the injection pressure of synthetic pw into the dolomite filter was monitored through the pressure transducer of the syringe pump samples collected at the inlet and outlet of the core holder were analyzed for ca mg sr ba cd pb and as by icp oes analysis meaning that measured concentrations correspond to the total concentrations of metals in solution fig 3 shows a schematic representation of the experimental setup used to conduct the experiments most experiments were repeated at least two times to verify the reproducibility of results 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of salinity and competition of cations sorption of toxic metals on dolomite is a function of salinity of water and competition of cations for hydration sites of dolomite 7 11 to bridge the knowledge gap regarding the competition of ba sr and cd for hydration sites of dolomite at salinity levels of pw we conducted core flooding experiments at an injection rate of 0 5 ml min using synthetic pw of three different salinities and dolomite filters made of 600 850 μm grain size fig 4 shows attained removal levels of 100 mg l of sr ba and cd from 1 l of synthetic pw of 0 g nacl l 11 55 g nacl l and 115 4 g nacl l salinities at a relatively low salinity level of 11 5 g nacl l attained removal levels of sr ba and cd were 4 9 13 6 and 35 6 respectively whereas at a salinity level of pw 115 4 g nacl l attained removal levels of sr ba and cd decreased to 1 8 4 4 and 28 4 respectively the results show that alkaline earth metals as well as heavy metals sorption on dolomite decreases with increasing salinity however the results reveal that salinity has a different impact on the sorption of alkaline earth metals and heavy metals on dolomite while an increase of salinity from 0 g nacl l to 115 4 g nacl l has a significant impact on the removal of sr and ba the same increase of salinity has a mild impact on the removal of cd removal of sr and ba decreases around 65 by increasing salinity from 0 g nacl l to 115 4 g nacl l whereas removal of cd only decreases around 20 by the same increase of salinity to verify that dolomite has a larger affinity for heavy metals than for alkaline earth metals we conducted experiments using synthetic pw containing 100 mg l of sr ba cd pb and as fig 5 shows attained removal levels from 100 ml 250 ml 500 ml and 1 l of synthetic pw highest removal levels attained for pb and cd confirm that dolomite has a larger affinity for heavy metals than for alkaline earth metals a higher removal level attained for as than for sr and ba indicate that dolomite has a larger affinity for metalloids than alkaline earth metals furthermore practically constant removal levels of sr ba cd pb and as after 250 ml suggest surface availability is not a controlling factor otherwise removal levels should decrease with increasing filtered volumes the inhibitory effect of salinity on the sorption of metals on dolomite can be attributed to complexation reactions with chlorine ions in the aqueous phase chlorine complexes are less prone to be electrostatically attracted by negatively charged hydration sites of dolomite than free divalent cations 7 the larger affinity of dolomite for heavy metals than for alkaline earth metals might be due to the extent of complexation by chlorine in solution which might be larger for alkaline earth metals than for heavy metals and or due to the extent of surface complexation reactions which might be larger for heavy metals than for alkaline earth metals despite of the common occurrence of carbonate minerals like dolomite previous studies have overwhelmingly focused on metal oxyhydro oxides 31 those studies have shown that alkaline earth metals sr and ba form weaker surface complexes than heavy metals pb and cd and they have pointed out the affinity sequence for metal oxyhydro oxides is pb cd and sr ba 32 33 according to our experiments this affinity sequence holds for heavy metals but not for alkaline earth metals sorption on dolomite the affinity sequence for the sorption of alkaline earth metals on dolomite at salinity levels of pw is ba sr fig 4 fig 6 shows changes of ph in discrete volumes of filtered pw containing pb sr ba as and cd in accordance to previous studies using a single metal ba and the same dolomite sample ph increases due to the dissolution of dolomite 7 8 an increase of ph is known to increase the removal of metal cations as the concentration of protons competing for hydration sites of dolomite decreases due an increased concentration of bicarbonate ions derived from the dissolution of dolomite 34 36 this implies that dolomite would be more effective removing toxic metals from pw of alkaline ph 3 2 effect of flow velocity and grain size to determine whether or not sorption of sr ba and cd on dolomite are equilibrium reactions and to assess the degree to which flow velocity and or grain size affect the removal of mixture toxic metals from pw by dolomite filtration we conducted core flooding experiments at three different injection rates 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 ml min using dolomite filters made of two different grain sizes 600 850 μm and 350 600 μm and synthetic pw of two different salinities 42 g nacl l and 115 4 g nacl l fig 7 shows the obtained results removal levels of sr ba and cd increase with decreasing the injection rate of pw into the dolomite filter at both salinity and grain size conditions for instance at 0 5 ml min injection rate removal levels of sr ba and cd from synthetic pw of 115 4 g nacl l salinity is only 0 5 1 2 and 21 3 respectively whereas at 0 1 ml min injection rate removal of sr ba and cd from synthetic pw of the same salinity increases to 6 11 3 and 55 respectively fig 7 i this result suggests that sorption of toxic metals on dolomite are kinetic reactions while removal levels of sr and ba are higher with synthetic pw of 42 g nacl l salinity fig 6 ii than with synthetic pw of 115 4 g nacl l salinity fig 7 i removal levels of cd remain practically the same this result confirm that salinity has higher inhibitory effect on alkaline earth metals sorption than on heavy metals sorption and thus dolomite filters are more efficient removing cd than sr and ba from high salinity waters although dolomite filters made of 350 600 μm grain size have a larger pore surface area than dolomite filters made of 600 850 μm grain size similar removal levels of sr ba and cd are attained with filters made of 600 850 μm figure 7 ii and 350 600 μm figure 7 iii grain sizes this result confirms that sorption reactions of sr ba and cd on dolomite are kinetically controlled reactions affected by the dissolution of dolomite the dissolution of dolomite was reflected by an increase of ph however concentration of ca and mg in the filtered pw remained practically the same ph profiles over time and at different salinities can be seen in a previous study where the same dolomite was employed 7 8 3 3 effect of guar gum a previous study on the effect of guar gum on the transport of ba in dolomite suggested that guar gum trapped in small pore throats works as a secondary filtration media retarding the transport of ba 7 based on that finding we conducted core flooding experiments to assess the feasibility of using guar gum as an aiding agent to enhance the removal of a mixture of toxic metals from pw by dolomite filtration we tested two guar gum utilization methods one where guar gum is added to pw prior to its injection into the dolomite filter and other where guar gum is mixed with powdered dolomite to prepare dolomite filters fig 8 shows obtained removal levels of sr ba and cd at three injection rates 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 ml min using synthetic pw of 42 g nacl l salinity containing 0 5 g guar gum l addition of guar gum to pw did not enhance the removal of sr ba or cd interestingly while removal levels of sr and ba are practically the same with and without the addition of guar gum the removal level of cd decreases with the addition of guar gum for instance removal of cd decreased from 53 fig 7 iii to 25 4 fig 8 due to the addition of guar gum guar gum is known to form complexes with metal ions and metal surfaces through its cooh functional group 37 in fact this property of guar gum has been used to develop a treatment method to remove pd from conventional wastewater 38 our results indicate a higher degree of complexation of guar gum with heavy metals cd than with alkaline earth metals sr and ba in the aqueous phase apparently if pore throats of the dolomite filter are too large to physically trap the formed guar gum complex of metal ions guar gum addition to pw can result in low removal levels of sr ba and cd because guar gum complexes of metal ions form weaker bonds with hydration sites of dolomite than dissolved ions contrary to previous results obtained using low porosity dolomite cores where the trapping of guar gum complexes of metal ions was reflected by pressure buildup at the inlet of the core holder 7 the free flow of gum complexes of metal ions in dolomite filters made of 350 600 and 600 850 μm grain size did not result in a pressure buildup at the inlet of the core holder fig 9 compares removal levels of sr ba and cd obtained with dolomite filters prepared mixing powdered dolomite and guar gum similar removal levels attained with and without the presence of guar gum in the dolomite filter suggest that guar gum has less complexation capacity towards heavy metals and alkaline earth metals than towards dolomite to verify the capacity of dolomite filters to effectively remove sr ba and cd from pw we conducted additional experiments where 1 l of synthetic pw of 42 g nacl l salinity was injected into five dolomite filters 1 5 inch diameter and 6 inch length of the same grain size 350 600 μm sequentially obtained removal levels of sr ba and cd were 9 4 31 6 and 91 8 respectively suggesting that a complete removal of sr ba and cd can be obtained by optimizing the relationship between the injection rate and volume of the dolomite filter to prevent the inhibition of sorption reactions by dissolved oil hydrocarbons which are generally present in pw can be remove by microbiological methods that consists of the stimulation of indigenous oil degrading methanogenic microbial communities by combining the supply of protein rich matter and co2 39 the remaining trace concentrations of oil hydrocarbons and toxic metals can be removed in subsequent stages using conventional technologies e g membrane filtration 3 4 modeling and simulation different removal levels of heavy metals and alkaline earth metals can be attributed to the different surface complexation of heavy metals and alkaline earth metals on dolomite and or to the different complexation of heavy metals and alkaline earth metals by chlorine ions in the aqueous phase to elucidate the relevance of both type of complexation reactions on the removal of mixture toxic metals from pw by dolomite filtration we conducted 3d reactive transport simulations using a model calibrated to simulate the reactive transport of ba in dolomite 24 briefly the 3d reactive transport model accounts for the kinetic dissolution of dolomite as well as for all possible complexation reactions of ions in the aqueous phase this is an important feature of the model as it determines the availability of cations h ca2 mg2 sr2 ba2 and cd2 to form surface complexes with the three types of hydration sites caoho mgoho and co3ho of dolomite the sorption preference of dolomite for the cations is captured by using an intrinsic stability constant kint s function of the concentration of cations in the aqueous phase and the concentration of available and occupied hydration sites of dolomite 1 k int s c o 3 ms h c o 3 h 0 ms 2 where denotes the activity of ms ca2 mg2 sr2 ba2 and cd2 at the mineral solution interface 40 intrinsic stability constants have been experimentally measured for ca and mg and fitted to batch sorption experimental results for ba 24 to bridge the knowledge gap regarding the intrinsic stability constants for sr and cd simulations are conducted assuming that sr ba and cd have the same intrinsic stability constants pb and as are not included in the simulations because their intrinsic stability constants are not available in literature the kinetic dissolution precipitation reaction of dolomite is represented by a kinetic model formulated based on the transition state theory tst 41 2 r dol min a h 0 5 k 1 ω where a is the surface area of the mineral k is the kinetic coefficient of the reaction and ω is the saturation index of the reaction table 1 shows all surface complexation reactions included in the model along with the employed intrinsic stability constant values the model is implemented in toughreact reactive transport simulator which includes a thermodynamic data base of gas aqueous and mineral phase reactions toughreact has been extensively employed to study various types of reactive transport processes in subsurface porous media 42 45 tables 2 and 3 show all aqueous phase complexation reactions and mineral phase dissolution precipitation reactions along with their corresponding constants table 4 shows reported and measured parameters we employed to simulate the reactive transport of sr ba and cd in dolomite the preparation procedure of dolomite filters involves the mixing of deionized water and powdered dolomite and compression therefore the pore space of the dolomite filter is initially occupied with water and the initial composition of water corresponds to an equilibrium condition with dolomite generally porosity increases with decreasing grain sizes therefore a porosity of 20 for well sorted 350 600 μm grain size 46 was used for simulations table 2 show all other parameters needed to run the simulations fig 10 shows simulated removal levels of sr ba and cd from 1 l of synthetic pw of 40 g nacl l salinity at three different injection rates the model captures the higher removal levels measured for cd than for ba and sr as well as the increase of cd ba and sr removal with decreasing the injection rate simulated removal levels of sr ba and cd at 0 5 ml min injection rate are 13 0 6 2 and 95 02 respectively decreasing the injection rate to 0 1 ml min increases the removal of sr and ba to 15 6 and 8 8 respectively while cd removal remains practically the same 95 09 considering that the model captured the preferential removal of cd over ba and sr using the same intrinsic stability constant value for cd ba and sr table 1 our simulation results reveal that removal of sr ba and cd from pw by dolomite filtration is largely controlled by the complexation of sr ba and cd by chlorine in the aqueous phase the smaller the equilibrium constant of the metal ion chloro complex table 2 the higher removal of sr ba and cd by dolomite filtration furthermore considering that surface complexation reactions in the model are equilibrium reactions our simulation results reveal that higher removal levels at low injection rates are due to the kinetic dissolution of dolomite dolomite dissolution is reflected by an increases of ph and thus by a reduction of the concentration of protons in solution which results in an increase the concentration of surface species e g co3sr co3ba and co3cd according to eq 1 however the model overpredicts the removal levels of cd ba and sr and the predicted affinity sequences of alkaline earth metals is opposite sr ba to the observed one ba sr this is attributed to the surface crystal morphology of dolomite whose effect is yet to be assessed and due to the intrinsic stability constants of sr and cd whose values are yet to be measured at salinity levels of pw higher removal levels simulated for sr than for ba suggest a smaller intrinsic stability constant for ba than for sr in a follow up study intrinsic stability constant will be estimated from surface titration and electrokinetic measurements 35 40 and in situ molecular characterization of metals uptake will be done by x ray adsorption fine structure spectroscopy exafs 31 figs 11 and 12 show representative 3d concentration distributions of aqueous species sr2 ba2 cd2 ca2 mg2 and cl surface species co3sr co3ba and co3cd and ph in a dolomite filter after 0 1 days of injecting synthetic produced pw at 0 1 ml min into a dolomite filter made of 350 600 μm grain size as expected concentrations of aqueous species in the dolomite filter gradually increases from the two inlet points at the bottom to the outlet point at the top fig 11 highest concentrations of sr ba and ca surface species occur near the bottom of the dolomite filter while highest concentrations of cd and mg surface species occur near the top of the filter fig 12 this behavior is related to the ph which gradually increases from the bottom to the top of the filter due to the dissolution of dolomite the simulated increase of ph at the outlet of dolomite filter is in accordance with the experimental results fig 7 apparently the smaller the ability of cations to form chloro complexes the lower the enhancing effect of alkaline ph levels on the removal of divalent cations by dolomite 4 conclusions salinity has a significant impact on the removal of sr and ba but a mild impact on the removal of cd by dolomite filtration dolomite filters are more effective removing heavy metals e g pb and cd than alkaline earth metals e g ba and sr at salinity levels of pw the affinity sequence for the sorption of mixture metals on dolomite is pb cd as ba sr opposite to metal oxyhydro oxides the affinity sequence for dolomite at salinity levels of pw is ba sr removal of sr ba and cd from pw by dolomite filtration are kinetically controlled reactions where an increase of ph due to the dissolution of dolomite increases the removal of sr ba and cd this increase is higher for cd than for sr and ba sr ba and cd complexation by guar gum in the aqueous phase hinders their removal by dolomite filters made of large grain size e g 350 600 μm where trapping of guar gum in small pore throats is not possible a complete removal of sr ba and cd can be obtained by optimizing the relationship between the injection rate and size of the dolomite filter overestimated removal levels of cd and higher removal levels of sr than ba by the formulated reactive transport model highlights

13002,we conducted experiments and reactive transport simulations to assess the removal of high concentrations of toxic metals 100 mg l commonly found in produced water from high saline waters 45 000 115 000 mg l using dolomite filters made of compressed powdered dolomite the focus was on ba sr cd pb and as as well as on guar gum as a metal complexing additive we found that salinity has a significant impact on the removal of sr and ba but a mild impact on the removal of cd an increase of ph due the dissolution of dolomite increases the removal of cd more significantly than the removal of ba and sr the formation of guar gum complexes of metals in the aqueous phase attenuates the removal of sr ba and cd by dolomite filtration this attenuation process is more significant for cd than for sr and ba the affinity sequence for the sorption of toxic metals at salinity levels of pw is pb cd as ba sr higher removal levels predicted for sr than for ba and over predictions of cd removal using previously proposed surface complexation models for dolomite highlights the necessity of further experimental research to incorporate molecular scale surface crystal structure parameters into surface complexation models graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords petroleum produced water mixture toxic metals sorption dolomite filtration 1 introduction produced water pw from conventional and unconventional oil and gas reservoirs contains high concentrations of dissolved salts mostly nacl caco3 mgco3 and organic and inorganic contaminants heavy metals alkaline earth metals metalloids and naturally occurring radioactive materials norm constitute the most abundant inorganic contaminants in pw 1 their concentrations greatly exceed the maximum contaminant levels established by the usa environmental protection agency epa for drinking water 2 to prevent contamination of surface and underground sources of drinking water usdw pw is frequently disposed by injection into deep saline aquifers 3 the depth of disposal wells ranges between few hundreds to thousands of meters depending on the geology of the play for instance since the discovery of oil and gas in oklahoma usa huge volumes of pw have been injected into dolomite saline aquifers of the arbuckle group according to clark and veil 4 in 2007 the total volume of pw in oklahoma was 2 2 bbbl and the total volume of pw in u s was 20 bbbl year which ranked oklahoma fifth in the u s in pw however according to a more recent study conducted in 2020 5 oklahoma might rank first in pw in the u s the medium depth of pw injection into the arbuckle group is 2088 m and the volumes of pw injection has substantially increased between 2009 and 2014 from 434 mmbbl to more than 1046 mmbbl 6 pw injection into deep geological formations synchronized with increasing seismic events in oklahoma consequently public concerns have grown regarding the possibility of usdw contamination by contaminants present in pw mechanical failures of the injection well and naturally or induced basement fractures can facilitate the upward migration of contaminants present in pw to usdw previous studies on the transport of toxic metals present in pw aimed to elucidate the chemical and physical factors controlling the transport of ba in dolomite saline aquifers 7 9 in light of those studies showing that dolomite has a superior sorption capacity for ba than other natural rock materials e g sandstone and given the observed retarding effect of guar gum on the transport of ba through dolomite cores the goal of this study is twofold first is to fill the knowledge gap regarding the chemical and physical factors controlling the removal of mixture toxic metals by dolomite and second is to assess the feasibility of removing high concentrations of mixture toxic metals from pw by using dolomite filters made of compressed powdered dolomite and guar gum as metal complexing agent previous studies on the removal of metals by dolomite focused on the removal of trace concentrations of single metals from low salinity waters 10 12 the focus of this study is on alkaline earth metals ba and sr and a heavy metal cd whose concentrations in pw can be in the order of hundreds of mg l ba sr and cd are commonly found in pw from oklahoma usa 13 15 and post a risk to human health and the environment long time exposure of cd results in kidney dysfunction and high levels of exposure will result in death sr and ba are also toxic when ingested in high amount 16 according to the world health organization who high sr intakes can cause phosphorus deficiency and an increase in bone density 17 and the scientific committee on health and environmental risk scher showed that chronic exposure to high ba can cause tachycardia hypertension muscle weakness and paralysis in the proposed dolomite filtration method guar gum trapped in small pore throats of the dolomite filter is expected to work as a secondary filtration media to increase the removal of mixture toxic metals from pw other methods to improve the removal of toxic metals by dolomite include thermal activation of dolomite 18 and the use of phosphatized dolomite 19 compared to those methods guar gum is an inexpensive polymer commonly used as a viscosifying additive of hydraulic fracturing fluids 20 21 the positive outlook on this treatment method of pw is on the following scientific and practical considerations 1 dolomite represent a superior sorption capacity for toxic metals than other natural rock materials such as sandstone 2 removal of toxic metals via sorption in dolomite filters presents flexibility in operation since the sorption capacity of the dolomite filter can be restored by back washing the filter and 3 dolomite are abundant in the arbuckle group of oklahoma and kansas where oil and natural gas activities are intensive conventional technologies that could be used to remove toxic metals from pw include chemical precipitation sorption ion exchange electrochemical deposition electrodialysis and biosorption 22 however cost limits the application of these technologies to remove toxic metals from pw since the high salinity of pw cause severe fouling problems as well as inhibition of sorption ion exchange and precipitation reactions 23 the implementation of this new economic technology could reduce the cost of using conventional technologies enabling the integration of pw into industrial and agricultural uses in a previous study we showed a removal level of 1 25 mg ba g dolomite 24 this removal level of ba is comparable to removal levels attained with pecan shell based activated carbon pbac 1 85 mg ba g pbac 25 and mxene nanosheet material 9 3 mg ba g mxene 26 which are expensive to prepare and or synthetize sorption of metals occurs along with dissolution precipitation reactions that are a function of many chemical e g ph ionic strength surface chemistry and composition and physical e g injection flow rate grain size surface area factors therefore our approach to elucidate the chemical and physical factors controlling the removal of mixture toxic metals from water at salinity levels of pw consists of core flooding experiments to assess the effect of individual chemical and physical factors and reactive transport modeling and simulations to assess the effect of combined chemical

and competition of cations for hydration sites of dolomite 7 11 to bridge the knowledge gap regarding the competition of ba sr and cd for hydration sites of dolomite at salinity levels of pw we conducted core flooding experiments at an injection rate of 0 5 ml min using synthetic pw of three different salinities and dolomite filters made of 600 850 μm grain size fig 4 shows attained removal levels of 100 mg l of sr ba and cd from 1 l of synthetic pw of 0 g nacl l 11 55 g nacl l and 115 4 g nacl l salinities at a relatively low salinity level of 11 5 g nacl l attained removal levels of sr ba and cd were 4 9 13 6 and 35 6 respectively whereas at a salinity level of pw 115 4 g nacl l attained removal levels of sr ba and cd decreased to 1 8 4 4 and 28 4 respectively the results show that alkaline earth metals as well as heavy metals sorption on dolomite decreases with increasing salinity however the results reveal that salinity has a different impact on the sorption of alkaline earth metals and heavy metals on dolomite while an increase of salinity from 0 g nacl l to 115 4 g nacl l has a significant impact on the removal of sr and ba the same increase of salinity has a mild impact on the removal of cd removal of sr and ba decreases around 65 by increasing salinity from 0 g nacl l to 115 4 g nacl l whereas removal of cd only decreases around 20 by the same increase of salinity to verify that dolomite has a larger affinity for heavy metals than for alkaline earth metals we conducted experiments using synthetic pw containing 100 mg l of sr ba cd pb and as fig 5 shows attained removal levels from 100 ml 250 ml 500 ml and 1 l of synthetic pw highest removal levels attained for pb and cd confirm that dolomite has a larger affinity for heavy metals than for alkaline earth metals a higher removal level attained for as than for sr and ba indicate that dolomite has a larger affinity for metalloids than alkaline earth metals furthermore practically constant removal levels of sr ba cd pb and as after 250 ml suggest surface availability is not a controlling factor otherwise removal levels should decrease with increasing filtered volumes the inhibitory effect of salinity on the sorption of metals on dolomite can be attributed to complexation reactions with chlorine ions in the aqueous phase chlorine complexes are less prone to be electrostatically attracted by negatively charged hydration sites of dolomite than free divalent cations 7 the larger affinity of dolomite for heavy metals than for alkaline earth metals might be due to the extent of complexation by chlorine in solution which might be larger for alkaline earth metals than for heavy metals and or due to the extent of surface complexation reactions which might be larger for heavy metals than for alkaline earth metals despite of the common occurrence of carbonate minerals like dolomite previous studies have overwhelmingly focused on metal oxyhydro oxides 31 those studies have shown that alkaline earth metals sr and ba form weaker surface complexes than heavy metals pb and cd and they have pointed out the affinity sequence for metal oxyhydro oxides is pb cd and sr ba 32 33 according to our experiments this affinity sequence holds for heavy metals but not for alkaline earth metals sorption on dolomite the affinity sequence for the sorption of alkaline earth metals on dolomite at salinity levels of pw is ba sr fig 4 fig 6 shows changes of ph in discrete volumes of filtered pw containing pb sr ba as and cd in accordance to previous studies using a single metal ba and the same dolomite sample ph increases due to the dissolution of dolomite 7 8 an increase of ph is known to increase the removal of metal cations as the concentration of protons competing for hydration sites of dolomite decreases due an increased concentration of bicarbonate ions derived from the dissolution of dolomite 34 36 this implies that dolomite would be more effective removing toxic metals from pw of alkaline ph 3 2 effect of flow velocity and grain size to determine whether or not sorption of sr ba and cd on dolomite are equilibrium reactions and to assess the degree to which flow velocity and or grain size affect the removal of mixture toxic metals from pw by dolomite filtration we conducted core flooding experiments at three different injection rates 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 ml min using dolomite filters made of two different grain sizes 600 850 μm and 350 600 μm and synthetic pw of two different salinities 42 g nacl l and 115 4 g nacl l fig 7 shows the obtained results removal levels of sr ba and cd increase with decreasing the injection rate of pw into the dolomite filter at both salinity and grain size conditions for instance at 0 5 ml min injection rate removal levels of sr ba and cd from synthetic pw of 115 4 g nacl l salinity is only 0 5 1 2 and 21 3 respectively whereas at 0 1 ml min injection rate removal of sr ba and cd from synthetic pw of the same salinity increases to 6 11 3 and 55 respectively fig 7 i this result suggests that sorption of toxic metals on dolomite are kinetic reactions while removal levels of sr and ba are higher with synthetic pw of 42 g nacl l salinity fig 6 ii than with synthetic pw of 115 4 g nacl l salinity fig 7 i removal levels of cd remain practically the same this result confirm that salinity has higher inhibitory effect on alkaline earth metals sorption than on heavy metals sorption and thus dolomite filters are more efficient removing cd than sr and ba from high salinity waters although dolomite filters made of 350 600 μm grain size have a larger pore surface area than dolomite filters made of 600 850 μm grain size similar removal levels of sr ba and cd are attained with filters made of 600 850 μm figure 7 ii and 350 600 μm figure 7 iii grain sizes this result confirms that sorption reactions of sr ba and cd on dolomite are kinetically controlled reactions affected by the dissolution of dolomite the dissolution of dolomite was reflected by an increase of ph however concentration of ca and mg in the filtered pw remained practically the same ph profiles over time and at different salinities can be seen in a previous study where the same dolomite was employed 7 8 3 3 effect of guar gum a previous study on the effect of guar gum on the transport of ba in dolomite suggested that guar gum trapped in small pore throats works as a secondary filtration media retarding the transport of ba 7 based on that finding we conducted core flooding experiments to assess the feasibility of using guar gum as an aiding agent to enhance the removal of a mixture of toxic metals from pw by dolomite filtration we tested two guar gum utilization methods one where guar gum is added to pw prior to its injection into the dolomite filter and other where guar gum is mixed with powdered dolomite to prepare dolomite filters fig 8 shows obtained removal levels of sr ba and cd at three injection rates 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 ml min using synthetic pw of 42 g nacl l salinity containing 0 5 g guar gum l addition of guar gum to pw did not enhance the removal of sr ba or cd interestingly while removal levels of sr and ba are practically the same with and without the addition of guar gum the removal level of cd decreases with the addition of guar gum for instance removal of cd decreased from 53 fig 7 iii to 25 4 fig 8 due to the addition of guar gum guar gum is known to form complexes with metal ions and metal surfaces through its cooh functional group 37 in fact this property of guar gum has been used to develop a treatment method to remove pd from conventional wastewater 38 our results indicate a higher degree of complexation of guar gum with heavy metals cd than with alkaline earth metals sr and ba in the aqueous phase apparently if pore throats of the dolomite filter are too large to physically trap the formed guar gum complex of metal ions guar gum addition to pw can result in low removal levels of sr ba and cd because guar gum complexes of metal ions form weaker bonds with hydration sites of dolomite than dissolved ions contrary to previous results obtained using low porosity dolomite cores where the trapping of guar gum complexes of metal ions was reflected by pressure buildup at the inlet of the core holder 7 the free flow of gum complexes of metal ions in dolomite filters made of 350 600 and 600 850 μm grain size did not result in a pressure buildup at the inlet of the core holder fig 9 compares removal levels of sr ba and cd obtained with dolomite filters prepared mixing powdered dolomite and guar gum similar removal levels attained with and without the presence of guar gum in the dolomite filter suggest that guar gum has less complexation capacity towards heavy metals and alkaline earth metals than towards dolomite to verify the capacity of dolomite filters to effectively remove sr ba and cd from pw we conducted additional experiments where 1 l of synthetic pw of 42 g nacl l salinity was injected into five dolomite filters 1 5 inch diameter and 6 inch length of the same grain size 350 600 μm sequentially obtained removal levels of sr ba and cd were 9 4 31 6 and 91 8 respectively suggesting that a complete removal of sr ba and cd can be obtained by optimizing the relationship between the injection rate and volume of the dolomite filter to prevent the inhibition of sorption reactions by dissolved oil hydrocarbons which are generally present in pw can be remove by microbiological methods that consists of the stimulation of indigenous oil degrading methanogenic microbial communities by combining the supply of protein rich matter and co2 39 the remaining trace concentrations of oil hydrocarbons and toxic metals can be removed in subsequent stages using conventional technologies e g membrane filtration 3 4 modeling and simulation different removal levels of heavy metals and alkaline earth metals can be attributed to the different surface complexation of heavy metals and alkaline earth metals on dolomite and or to the different complexation of heavy metals and alkaline earth metals by chlorine ions in the aqueous phase to elucidate the relevance of both type of complexation reactions on the removal of mixture toxic metals from pw by dolomite filtration we conducted 3d reactive transport simulations using a model calibrated to simulate the reactive transport of ba in dolomite 24 briefly the 3d reactive transport model accounts for the kinetic dissolution of dolomite as well as for all possible complexation reactions of ions in the aqueous phase this is an important feature of the model as it determines the availability of cations h ca2 mg2 sr2 ba2 and cd2 to form surface complexes with the three types of hydration sites caoho mgoho and co3ho of dolomite the sorption preference of dolomite for the cations is captured by using an intrinsic stability constant kint s function of the concentration of cations in the aqueous phase and the concentration of available and occupied hydration sites of dolomite 1 k int s c o 3 ms h c o 3 h 0 ms 2 where denotes the activity of ms ca2 mg2 sr2 ba2 and cd2 at the mineral solution interface 40 intrinsic stability constants have been experimentally measured for ca and mg and fitted to batch sorption experimental results for ba 24 to bridge the knowledge gap regarding the intrinsic stability constants for sr and cd simulations are conducted assuming that sr ba and cd have the same intrinsic stability constants pb and as are not included in the simulations because their intrinsic stability constants are not available in literature the kinetic dissolution precipitation reaction of dolomite is represented by a kinetic model formulated based on the transition state theory tst 41 2 r dol min a h 0 5 k 1 ω where a is the surface area of the mineral k is the kinetic coefficient of the reaction and ω is the saturation index of the reaction table 1 shows all surface complexation reactions included in the model along with the employed intrinsic stability constant values the model is implemented in toughreact reactive transport simulator which includes a thermodynamic data base of gas aqueous and mineral phase reactions toughreact has been extensively employed to study various types of reactive transport processes in subsurface porous media 42 45 tables 2 and 3 show all aqueous phase complexation reactions and mineral phase dissolution precipitation reactions along with their corresponding constants table 4 shows reported and measured parameters we employed to simulate the reactive transport of sr ba and cd in dolomite the preparation procedure of dolomite filters involves the mixing of deionized water and powdered dolomite and compression therefore the pore space of the dolomite filter is initially occupied with water and the initial composition of water corresponds to an equilibrium condition with dolomite generally porosity increases with decreasing grain sizes therefore a porosity of 20 for well sorted 350 600 μm grain size 46 was used for simulations table 2 show all other parameters needed to run the simulations fig 10 shows simulated removal levels of sr ba and cd from 1 l of synthetic pw of 40 g nacl l salinity at three different injection rates the model captures the higher removal levels measured for cd than for ba and sr as well as the increase of cd ba and sr removal with decreasing the injection rate simulated removal levels of sr ba and cd at 0 5 ml min injection rate are 13 0 6 2 and 95 02 respectively decreasing the injection rate to 0 1 ml min increases the removal of sr and ba to 15 6 and 8 8 respectively while cd removal remains practically the same 95 09 considering that the model captured the preferential removal of cd over ba and sr using the same intrinsic stability constant value for cd ba and sr table 1 our simulation results reveal that removal of sr ba and cd from pw by dolomite filtration is largely controlled by the complexation of sr ba and cd by chlorine in the aqueous phase the smaller the equilibrium constant of the metal ion chloro complex table 2 the higher removal of sr ba and cd by dolomite filtration furthermore considering that surface complexation reactions in the model are equilibrium reactions our simulation results reveal that higher removal levels at low injection rates are due to the kinetic dissolution of dolomite dolomite dissolution is reflected by an increases of ph and thus by a reduction of the concentration of protons in solution which results in an increase the concentration of surface species e g co3sr co3ba and co3cd according to eq 1 however the model overpredicts the removal levels of cd ba and sr and the predicted affinity sequences of alkaline earth metals is opposite sr ba to the observed one ba sr this is attributed to the surface crystal morphology of dolomite whose effect is yet to be assessed and due to the intrinsic stability constants of sr and cd whose values are yet to be measured at salinity levels of pw higher removal levels simulated for sr than for ba suggest a smaller intrinsic stability constant for ba than for sr in a follow up study intrinsic stability constant will be estimated from surface titration and electrokinetic measurements 35 40 and in situ molecular characterization of metals uptake will be done by x ray adsorption fine structure spectroscopy exafs 31 figs 11 and 12 show representative 3d concentration distributions of aqueous species sr2 ba2 cd2 ca2 mg2 and cl surface species co3sr co3ba and co3cd and ph in a dolomite filter after 0 1 days of injecting synthetic produced pw at 0 1 ml min into a dolomite filter made of 350 600 μm grain size as expected concentrations of aqueous species in the dolomite filter gradually increases from the two inlet points at the bottom to the outlet point at the top fig 11 highest concentrations of sr ba and ca surface species occur near the bottom of the dolomite filter while highest concentrations of cd and mg surface species occur near the top of the filter fig 12 this behavior is related to the ph which gradually increases from the bottom to the top of the filter due to the dissolution of dolomite the simulated increase of ph at the outlet of dolomite filter is in accordance with the experimental results fig 7 apparently the smaller the ability of cations to form chloro complexes the lower the enhancing effect of alkaline ph levels on the removal of divalent cations by dolomite 4 conclusions salinity has a significant impact on the removal of sr and ba but a mild impact on the removal of cd by dolomite filtration dolomite filters are more effective removing heavy metals e g pb and cd than alkaline earth metals e g ba and sr at salinity levels of pw the affinity sequence for the sorption of mixture metals on dolomite is pb cd as ba sr opposite to metal oxyhydro oxides the affinity sequence for dolomite at salinity levels of pw is ba sr removal of sr ba and cd from pw by dolomite filtration are kinetically controlled reactions where an increase of ph due to the dissolution of dolomite increases the removal of sr ba and cd this increase is higher for cd than for sr and ba sr ba and cd complexation by guar gum in the aqueous phase hinders their removal by dolomite filters made of large grain size e g 350 600 μm where trapping of guar gum in small pore throats is not possible a complete removal of sr ba and cd can be obtained by optimizing the relationship between the injection rate and size of the dolomite filter overestimated removal levels of cd and higher removal levels of sr than ba by the formulated reactive transport model highlights

13003,arsenic as is a contaminant of global concern due to its negative impact on environmental systems where as occurs mainly as two inorganic species arsenite as iii and arsenate as v thus the simultaneously removal of both as iii and as v from groundwater is a challenging issue in this paper zero valent iron nanoparticles nzvi with high surface active sites were used to simultaneously remove both as iii and as v species from groundwater with removal efficiencies 99 9 for an initial concentration 100 μg l 1 ion chromatography atomic fluorescence ic afs analysis indicated that during removal as iii was oxidized to as v while x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps showed that the as species were adsorbed on to the surface of nzvi by a complexation reaction furthermore thermodynamic studies of the adsorption process indicated that adsorption was a spontaneous and endothermic chemisorption process finally practical removal of both as species by nzvi from real groundwaters was demonstrated with removal efficiencies of 99 9 and 70 9 for as v and as iii respectively the presence of other coexisting ions affected the removal efficiency with phosphate and carbonate decreasing the removal efficiencies of both as iii and as v due competition with active binding sites on the surface of nzvi overall this work demonstrated that nzvi was a promising adsorbent for the practical removal of inorganic as species from complex environmental matrices such as groundwater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords arsenate arsenite groundwater nzvi remediation 1 introduction arsenic as is a toxic metalloid widely distributed in both natural water and groundwater as mainly exists in two common forms either as iii or as v 1 for example as contamination in mining areas may lead to the discharge of as containing wastewater into surrounding ecosystems 2 and this may subsequently affect human and environmental health the presence of as in groundwater mainly originates from anthropogenic activities such as agriculture mining medicinal wastes feed additives and waste leachate 3 where long term exposure to as may lead to various diseases including lung liver kidney and skin cancers 3 4 for this reason the development of technologies for the efficient treatment of as contamination has recently gained much more attention currently conventional methods for as removal from groundwater include adsorption reduction surface precipitation chemical precipitation ion exchange membrane technology and flocculation coagulation 1 3 of these methods adsorption has the advantage of being applicable over a wide ph range of low cost easy to operate simple to manage 5 6 able to be reused and or regenerated 4 and routinely exhibits a relatively high as removal efficiency however some adsorbents including commercially activated carbon activated alumina layered double hydroxide have distinct disadvantages for as removal including poor efficiency and selectivity 4 7 which has limited their practical applications for example the removal of high concentrations of as in actual wastewater such as groundwater would be very inefficient using these adsorbents for this reason it is particularly important to find alternative as adsorbents with good selectivity and high adsorption efficiency zero valent iron nanoparticles nzvi that are low in cost have a large specific surface area and excellent reactivity have been widely reported in environmental remediation studies 8 9 especially for the removal of as species in groundwater 4 for example nzvi was recently reported to successfully remove as iii from groundwater in the presence of several different oxidants 10 similarly as v removal from contaminated groundwater from the chacopampean plain of argentina was reported as being very effective when nzvi was used 11 another advantage of nzvi is that it has great potential for as removal from groundwater when applied via both in situ and ex situ remediation strategies 12 for example unsupported nzvi was successfully used for the in situ removal of as from groundwater in the presence of humic acid 13 while yet another report confirmed that montmorillonite supported nzvi could also be successfully used as an in situ groundwater as adsorbent 14 however most literature reports have only considered either the removal of as iii or as v from groundwater and few have considered groundwater contaminated with mixed as species and removal from real groundwaters in the vicinity of mining areas this is important because groundwater in mining areas often contains high levels of both as iii and as v species as well as a variety of heavy metal ions which make it much more difficult to remediate than other groundwater consequently remediation methods capable of the simultaneous removal of as iii and as v from groundwater in the vicinity of the mine area are urgently required in this study the potential for the simultaneous removal of as iii and as v from groundwater by nzvi was evaluated the objectives were to determine 1 whether nzvi can be used to simultaneously remove as iii and as v from groundwater and 2 the main ions in groundwater which could potentially impact the removal of as iii and as v during practical application during this study the removal of as iii and as v by nzvi in isolation and as a mixed solution was evaluated using liquid chromatography atomic fluorescence spectrometry lc afs to determine the residual concentration of each as species advanced material characterization of nzvi was also carried out before and after the removal of as iii and as v to further understand the role of any nzvi surface and or composition changes on as removal efficiency as well as any role in oxidation or reduction of as finally the application of nzvi to groundwater was practically evaluated where the effects of various coexisting anions on the simultaneous removal of as iii and as v were evaluated

dissolved in an aqueous ethanol solution 50 ml 40 ml ethanol and 10 ml water and dispersed by ultrasound to prepare a homogeneous ferric chloride solution an aqueous solution of sodium borohydride was separately prepared by dissolving sodium borohydride 4 08 g in deionized water 100 ml the freshly prepared sodium borohydride solution was then added dropwise to the ferric chloride solution with continual stirring under the protection of a nitrogen atmosphere under the protection of nitrogen the resulting black particles were filtered quickly and washed with absolute ethanol subsequently the washed black particles were dried at 60 c in vacuum drying oven for 24 h before being ground to pass through a 120 mesh sieve to prepare the final nzvi 2 3 characterizations the morphological characteristics and elemental composition of nzvi before and after removal were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy combined with an energy spectrum disperser sem eds jeol jsm s4800 japan using

solutions were filtered through a 0 22 μm aqueous phase filter membrane prior to measurement 2 5 adsorption experiments 2 5 1 simultaneous removal of as iii and as v by nzvi experiments to evaluate the simultaneous removal of as iii and as v by nzvi were performed in 250 ml conical flasks the initial contaminant concentrations were 100 μg l 1 of as iii and 100 μg l 1 of as v as a mixed solution the nzvi dose 0 02 g l 1 was then added to the mixed contaminant solution 100 ml and placed on a mechanical shaking shaker at 250 rpm and 303 k thereafter during reaction at specific time intervals 5 10 20 30 60 120 180 and 360 min an aliquot of the mixed solution 1 5 ml was removed from the conical flask filtered 0 22 μm into a sample vial and the residual concentrations of both as iii and as v in the mixed solution determined via lc afs the nzvi removal experiments for as iii or as v alone were also performed in 250 ml conical flasks under identical conditions except that the initial concentration of contaminants was either 100 μg l 1 as iii or 100 μg l 1 as v 2 5 2 batch condition experiments in order to elucidate the effect of different experimental conditions on the simultaneous removal of as iii and as v by nzvi batch experiments with largely fixed conditions were conducted this involved repeating experiments under identical condition but where one variable at a time was varied the four parameters varied include ph 4 7 and 10 temperature 293 303 and 313 k nzvi dose 0 01 0 02 and 0 05 g l 1 and the initial concentration of the as iii as v mixed contaminants 50 100 and 200 μg l 1 otherwise all batch studies were performed as described above section 2 5 1 using exactly the same procedures 2 5 3 regeneration experiments the cyclic regeneration experiments for the simultaneous removal of as iii and as v by nzvi were performed under the following conditions dose 0 5 g l 1 initial concentration of as iii and as v mixed solution of 1 mg l 1 each and ph 7 where nzvi was added to the mixed as species solution at a constant temperature 303k and reacted for 6 h after 6 h an aliquot was removed filtered 0 22 μm and analyzed for residual as species the adsorbed nzvi was then regenerated by desorption with 0 1 m hcl for 3 h and the regenerated nzvi was reintroduced into a fresh solution with the same initial concentration of as species solution for another 6 h of adsorption the above steps were repeated four times all adsorption experiments were performed in triplicate and all results reported were averaged 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of as iii and as v the performance of nzvi for simultaneous removal of as iii and as v is shown in fig 1b after contact with nzvi for 6 h the removal efficiency of both as v and as iii reached 99 9 where comparison of the slopes of the removal curves of as iii and as v showed that the removal of as iii was much faster than as v in the early stages of the reaction during the later stages of reaction the removal rate was not as fast as as v this was because under the experimental conditions used as iii exists mainly in an electrically neutral form h3aso3 while as v exists in a negatively charged form h2aso4 and haso4 2 1 in addition the strong affinity of the adsorbent for as v 1 2 lead to faster as v adsorption the removal of as iii or as v by nzvi was also studied in isolation using ion chromatography under exactly the same conditions as used in fig 1b to determine whether there was a redox process occurring the removal efficiency of as iii alone by nzvi was 88 1 after 1 h and 98 8 after 3 h fig 1c in comparison the removal efficiency of as iii in a mixed solution was 83 6 after 1 h and 92 3 after 3 h fig 1b in comparison the removal efficiency of as v alone reached 99 9 after 1 h fig 1c compared to only 89 0 as v after 1 h in the mixed solution fig 1b this suggested there was a competitive adsorption process between as species during simultaneous removal 19 in the chromatogram fig 1d corresponding to the removal of as iii alone as removal time increased the characteristic peak area of as iii diminished gradually and a characteristic peak attributable to as v appeared indicating oxidation of as iii to as v during removal the likely oxidation process is described by eqs 1 2 and 3 2 20 where under oxygen containing conditions nzvi and dissolved oxygen generate h2o2 which further combines with the corrosion product fe2 and fe3 on the surface of nzvi this produces active oxides oh and o2 and hence as iii is further oxidized to as v and subsequently removed 2 20 previous studies of the role of dissolved oxygen in the removal of as iii and as v by nzvi indicated that as iii and as v speciation did not significnay change with dissolved oxygen levels which further confirmed that oxidation of as iii was caused directly by nzvi and not by changes in dissolved oxygen content 21 22 also in the ion chromatograms fig 1e obtained for the removal of as v alone no characteristic peak attributable to as iii appeared with increasing time which confirmed that as v removal did not involve reduction 1 fe 0 o 2 2 h fe 2 h 2 o 2 2 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 3 fe 2 o 2 fe 3 o 2 the above analysis showed that the process of simultaneous removal of as iii and as v by nzvi involved competitive adsorption and oxidation of the more toxic as iii to as v subsequently the role that each component of nzvi played in simultaneous as removal was verified by advanced material characterization 3 2 characterization 3 2 1 sem eds the morphology of nzvi before simultaneous removal of as iii and as v fig 2a was similar to that previously reported showing regular spherical particles 2 8 11 23 with a particle size distribution fig 2e yielding an average nzvi particle size of 48 9 nm this indicated some agglomeration due to nzvi having strong magnetic properties 2 furthermore eds analysis fig 2c showed that the nzvi surface mainly contained iron and a small amount of oxygen and no elemental as potentially indicating partial iron oxidation during nzvi synthesis after simultaneous as removal fig 2b nzvi showed a more irregular shape with viscous material interwoven between the nzvi particles the particle size distribution fig 2f also changed so that the average nzvi particle size increased slightly to 66 11 nm indicating slightly more agglomeration eds showed fig 2d that the iron content decreased slightly while element oxygen content increased significantly which was caused by the loss of fe and an increase in oxidation after contaminant contact with nzvi 23 in addition elemental as became a significant presence confirming that as iii and as v were adsorbed on to the surface of nzvi thus the overall changes in the proportions of all elements before and after simultaneous removal strongly supports the adsorption of as species on to the surface of nzvi due to a combination of simultaneous oxidation and adsorption 3 2 2 hr tem hr tem analysis fig 3 provided a more detailed examination of the changes in nzvi morphology and crystallinity before and after as removal before as removal fig 3a and c nzvi show a clearly spherical particle shape with obvious agglomeration with a d spacing of 0 2021 nm corresponding to the high crystallinity of the 011 plane of fe0 15 24 after removal fig 3b and d nzvi agglomeration was more severe due the apparent adsorption of pollutants as a slimy layer on the nzvi surface in addition lattice d spacings of 0 2021 and 0 2522 nm were both observed corresponding to the high crystallinity of the original 011 plane of fe0 and the 311 plane of fe3o4 respectively 2 24 this indicated that new phases were being generated in nzvi after as removal and the occurrence of adsorption and oxidation processes during as removal 3 2 3 xrd the xrd pattern of nzvi before and after simultaneous removal of as iii and as v is shown in fig 4a prior to removal the 011 002 and 112 crystalline planes of nzvi were clearly evident at 44 8 65 2 and 82 5 respectively 2 15 24 pdf 96 900 6590 confirming the successful synthesis of nzvi the material presented a body centered cubic structure with a good crystal form 24 there was also a small peak at 35 5 characteristic of fe3o4 15 and indicating that some iron oxidation occurred during the synthesis of nzvi in agreement with the eds results after simultaneous as removal in addition to the nzvi characteristic peaks which remained new peaks appeared at 30 2 57 2 and 62 9 corresponding to the 220 511 and 440 crystalline planes of fe3o4 pdf 98 015 8743 respectively meanwhile the diffraction peak at 35 5 which has been attributed to the 311 crystalline plane of fe3o4 pdf 98 015 8743 15 also remained but the peak intensity increased significantly these results strongly suggested that a significant change in the crystalline phase of nzvi occurred probably due to a chemical reaction between the contaminant and nzvi however despite this since the overall characteristic peaks attributable to nzvi still existed this indicated that nzvi largely retained stability during the simultaneous removal process this was due to the core shell structure of nzvi 8 20 therefore xrd analysis further confirmed that both an adsorption and redox processes were likely responsible for the simultaneous removal of as iii and as v by nzvi 3 2 4 bet the n2 adsorption and desorption curves of nzvi before and after removal are shown in fig 4b a h3 hysteresis loops was observed for nzvi both before and after removal which was a characteristic isotherm associated with mesoporous materials the specific surface area of nzvi before removal was 100 9 m2 g 1 which was much higher than that of commercial nzvi nanofer 25s with a specific surface area of only 20 m2 g 1 25 and nzvi synthesized by similar methods s3 nzvi with a specific surface area of 63 m2 g 1 11 after removal the specific surface area of nzvi decreased to 34 1 m2 g 1 and the pore volume decreased from 0 18 before to 0 06 after cm3 g 1 which was attributed to blockage of some pores of nzvi after the adsorption of as and hence inaccessibility to n2 molecules 3 2 5 xps the full scale xps scan of nzvi before and after simultaneous removal of as iii and as v fig 4c clearly showed that the surface of nzvi contained mainly fe and o after simultaneous removal elemental as was also observed which confirmed successful adsorption of one or more as species which can be better seen in fig 4f in the fe 2p spectrum fig 4d and in agreement with xrd analysis the peak at 706 71 ev was a characteristic peak for fe0 26 the other peaks present at 710 11 and 723 40 ev were associated with orbital splitting peaks of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 of fe2 26 27 while peaks at 711 41 and 724 77 ev corresponded to the fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 peaks of fe3 26 27 and the satellite peak at 719 20 ev was attributed to γ fe2o3 26 collectively the occurrence of multiple peaks in the fe 2p spectrum supported the occurrence of oxidation during the synthesis of nzvi after as removal while all of the characteristic peaks of all fe elements were still present their binding energies were shifted slightly the characteristic peaks of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 for fe2 now occurred at 710 31 and 725 31 ev the characteristic peaks of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 for fe3 now occurred at 711 68 and 724 92 ev while the satellite peak at 719 13 ev still corresponded to γ fe2o3 26 27 in addition a slight increase in the area of each characteristic peak indicates an increase in the oxidation of fe and the adsorption of contaminants by the nzvi surface through complexation 28 in slight contrast to the xrd analysis section 3 2 3 the characteristic peak attributable to fe0 disappeared after reaction with as which may be due to the larger thickness of the oxide layer and xps being primarily a surface analysis in the o 1 s spectrum fig 4e before as removal only two main peaks were fitted at 530 05 and 531 51 ev indicating the presence of o2 and oh groups 29 corresponding to characteristic peaks associated with feo feooh and h2o 8 30 31 in combination with the speciation indicated by analysis of the fe 2p spectrum this suggested that before removal the nzvi surface was mainly composed of fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh with a fe0 inner core 8 31 after removal in addition to these two characteristic o 1 s peaks a new peak appeared at 532 10 ev which was characteristic of as oh 32 again indicating that as was being adsorbed on the surface of nzvi via complexation in the as 3d spectrum fig 4f no characteristic peak attributable to as appeared on the nzvi surface before removal however after removal two characteristic peaks were obtained at 45 61 and 44 81 ev corresponding to as v and as iii and the characteristic peaks of as v o and as iii o 33 34 respectively overall the observed changes in existing peak intensities areas and shifts in the binding energies of individual characteristic together with the appearance of new characteristic peaks post reaction strongly suggest that the as species were being adsorbed onto the nzvi surface through chemical complexation thus xps analysis further confirmed that nzvi can simultaneous removal of as iii and as v by adsorption and oxidation processes 3 3 factors affecting the removal as iii and as v the impact of four common reaction parameters temperature solution ph initial as concentration and nzvi dose on the adsorption removal efficiency and hence adsorption mechanism were examined the influence of solution ph fig 5a was assessed at three solution phs 4 7 and 10 during simultaneous removal of as iii and as v when the solution ph was 4 or 7 the removal of as v reached 99 9 compared to only 78 8 within 2 h when the ph was 10 this was because as v exists in different forms at different ph in the ph range 3 6 as v exists in solution as a singly negatively charges species h2aso4 whereas in the ph range 8 10 5 as v exist as a double charged negative species haso4 2 35 since the isoelectric point of nzvi is 8 4 8 at solution ph 8 4 the nzvi would be positively charges and electrostatic attract the negative charged as v complexations reactions are then likely with the nzvi surface since the nzvi surface produces feooh groups through the following three eqs 4 5 and 6 8 at ph 4 and 7 however at solution ph 8 4 ie at ph 10 the surface of nzvi becomes negatively charged and as v removal is diminished due to electrostatic repulsion between the nzvi surface and the even more negatively charged as v in solution consequently the removal efficiency of as v at ph 10 was not as high as that observed at either ph 4 or 7 4 4 fe 0 3 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 feooh 5 4 fe 3 o 4 o 2 6 h 2 o 12 feooh 6 fe 2 o 3 h 2 o 2 feooh for as iii when the solution ph was 10 the removal efficiency reached 99 9 within 2 h but when the solution ph was either 4 or 7 the removal efficiency only reached 91 3 and 92 9 respectively within 2 h and took 6 h to reach 97 1 and 99 9 respectively this was also caused by different forms of as iii being present in solution at different phs at ph 9 2 as iii primarily exists as an uncharged species h3aso3 and a single negative species h2aso3 in the ph range 9 12 35 thus in the entire ph range of 4 to 10 considered here as iii removal is favored by a combination of electrostatic interaction and surface feooh complexation 8 resulting in increased as iii removal efficiencies the influence of three different experimental temperature 293 303 and 313 k on as species removal efficiencies is shown in fig 5b for as v at either 303 or 313 k the removal efficiencies reached 99 9 within 2 h while at 293 k removal reached only 78 8 within 2 h for as iii the 2 h removal efficiency increased with temperature reaching 86 0 at 293 k 91 6 at 303 k and 97 6 at 313 k overall since removal efficiency gradually increased with an increase in reaction temperature this suggested that the removal process was endothermic 36 higher reaction temperatures can also provide greater kinetic energy to the containments enhancing their diffusion through the solution making it more likely that an interaction with the nzvi surface can occur furthermore elevated temperature can also overcome the activation energy of the adsorbent 19 leading to greater surface adsorption and hence contaminant removal the effect of three nzvi doses 0 01 0 02 and 0 05 g l 1 on the as species removal efficiencies is shown in fig 5c irrespective of the dose used removal reached 99 9 within 6 h however the greater the dose the faster the removal thus as dose increased from 0 01 to 0 02 to 0 05 g l 1 the 1 h removal efficiencies for as v increased in the order 76 0 90 5 and 99 9 while the removal efficiencies for as iii increased in the order 76 7 82 4 and 98 3 respectively this was because when the solution contained more nzvi both the oxidation capacity and available adsorption sites increased 36 thereby improving the removal of both as v and as iii the influence of three initial as species concentration 50 100 and 200 μg l 1 on the final removal efficiencies is shown in fig 5d at the two lower concentrations both as iii and as v removal efficiencies reached 99 9 within 6 h while for the higher concentration 200 μg l 1 the 6 h removal efficiencies for as iii and as v were 97 2 and 91 3 respectively the lower the initial contaminant concentration the faster was the contaminant removal thus as the initial as concentration increased in the order 50 100 and 200 μg l 1 the 1 h as iii removal efficiencies decreased in the order 86 9 82 4 and 74 1 while the 1 h as v removal efficiencies decreases in the order 99 9 90 5 and 71 3 respectively this was because for a fixed dose the adsorption sites and oxidation capacity provided by nzvi was finite which limited removal capacity as contaminant concentration increased 36 collectively these four condition experiments allowed optimal conditions for as species to be determined for an initial as species concentration of 100 μg l 1 the optimal removal conditions were 313 k ph 10 and 0 02 g l 1 nzvi for as iii and 313 k ph 4 and 0 02 g l 1 nzvi for as v taking into account both economic and removal time factors 3 4 adsorption isotherms and kinetics adsorption isotherms were determined in the contaminant concentration range of 100 1000 μg l 1 where in order to better understand the mechanism of simultaneous removal of as iii and as v by nzvi the obtained data was fitted to either the langmuir eq 7 or freundlich eq 8 adsorption isotherm models respectively 7 c e q e c e q m 1 q m k l 8 ln q e ln k f ln c e n where qe mg g 1 is the amount of as adsorbed to nzvi at equilibrium ce mg l 1 is the residual concentration of as in solution at equilibrium and qm mg g 1 is the theoretical maximum amount of as adsorbed corresponding to the maximum adsorption capacity and kl mg l 1 and kf mg g 1 are the equilibrium adsorption constants for the langmuir and freundlich models respectively and n is an exponential parameter the best fit results of the two models are summarized in table 1 irrespective of the temperature the langmuir model consistently described the adsorption behavior of both as iii and as v better than the freundlich model thus based on the underlying assumptions of the langmuir model this indicated that both as species were adsorbed on the nzvi surface mainly via monomolecular layer adsorption involving chemisorption which is more stable than simple physical adsorption 35 36 37 the maximum adsorption capacity gradually also increased with increasing temperature table 1 which indicated that temperature influenced the adsorption process in order to further understand the mechanism of the simultaneous removal of the two as species by nzvi the experimental data was also fitted to either the pseudo first order eq 9 or pseudo second order eq 10 kinetic models 9 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 10 t q t t q e 1 k 2 q e 2 where qe mg l 1 and qt mg l 1 are the adsorption capacities of as iii and as v at equilibrium and at time t respectively and k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 are the rate constants for the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order kinetic models respectively the best fit results table 2 showed that the correlation coefficients of the pseudo second order kinetic model were consistently higher than the pseudo first order kinetic model this indicates that the adsorption processes of both as iii and as v by nzvi followed pseudo second order kinetics thus in agreement with the best fit of the data to the langmuir adsorption isotherm model and based on the underlying assumptions of the pseudo second order kinetic model the adsorption process most likely proceeds through chemisorption 35 37 the magnitude of the rate constant for the pseudo second order kinetic model also increased with temperature indicating that increased temperature favored as adsorption by nzvi which was consistent with the temperature variation experiments the thermodynamic of a process can also provide insight into the dominant mechanism and was studied here using eqs 11 and 12 to derive best fit thermodynamic parameters table 3 11 g rt ln k 12 ln k h rt s r where r is the universal molar gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 k is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant g is the change in gibbs free energy kj mol 1 h is the enthalpy change kj mol 1 and s is the entropy change j mol 1 k 1 irrespective of the temperature for both as species g was negative and h positive indicating that overall the removal of both as species was a spontaneous and endothermic process the relatively low values of h 15 kj mol 1 indicated that electrostatic effects had a greater influence on the adsorption process 37 the positive value of s also indicated that the as species had a good affinity for nzvi during the removal process as contaminant disorder in solution increased 36 37 which generally facilitates removal the as adsorption capacity of nzvi fabricated here was also compared with the maximum as adsorption capacity previously obtained for different adsorbents table 4 this comparison clearly showed that the as adsorption capacity of nzvi was much higher than that of the previously reported materials and suggested that nzvi would be a promising material for the removal of as species from aqueous solutions 3 5 application 3 5 1 removal of as from groundwater the practical application potential of nzvi was explored by treating an actual mining groundwater having the ion composition before and after removal shown in table 5 the original concentration of as v in the mining groundwater 22 μg l 1 was reduced by 59 1 to 9 μg l 1 after treatment with nzvi since this was below the chinese class iii groundwater quality standard gb t14848 2017 of 10 μg l 1 this indicated that nzvi exhibited a high practical as removal efficiency in addition the removal of sb v ba ii and cr vi by nzvi was 28 6 39 5 and 98 9 respectively while the removal of other ions was not significant since the amount of elemental as in the original groundwater was relatively small a better evaluation of the potential of nzvi was obtained by spiking the original groundwater with a standard concentrations of 50 and 100 μg l 1 the comparative removal efficiencies of 100 μg l 1 as by nzvi in laboratory deionized water and groundwater is shown in fig 6a in deionized water the removal efficiencies of both as iii and as v reached 99 9 after 6 h in contrast in groundwater while the removal efficiency of as v reached 99 9 after 6 h the removal efficiency of as iii was only 70 9 in the same period when compared with deionized water while the removal efficiency of as iii was 30 lower it was still relative high and suitable for practical applications in the spiking experiment fig 6b at an as concentration of 50 μg l 1 the removal efficiency of as v also reached 99 9 after 6 h while the removal rate of as iii only reached 60 6 during this process as iii can easily be oxidized to as v where this become advantageous because nzvi has a greater adsorption capacity for as v and hence can removing greater amounts of total as from groundwater 3 5 2 influence of ionic composition of groundwater on as removal real mining groundwaters are often a rich mixture of many different ions which can all potentially impact the removal efficiency of specific contaminants by adsorption thus in order to evaluate the effect of coexisting ions in the groundwater on as removal by nzvi the effects of seven common coexisting ions on as removal were explored at four different concentrations between 0 and 5000 μg l 1 fig 7 cations had very little effect on the removal of as this was because irrespective of the dominate as species present or the prevailing ph in solution the existing as forms were either present as as oxy anions or neutral species 8 35 thus when cations and as species coexist there is no competitive adsorption for the active sites on nzvi and in fact cations would be electrostatically repelled from the positively charged nzvi surface in contrast for coexisting anions some competitive adsorption between as species and the anions might be expected leading to a reduction in as removal however for as iii chloride sulfate and nitrate had little effect on removal while carbonate and phosphate significantly affected effect the removal of as iii likewise for as v chloride sulfate and nitrate exerted little effect on as v removal but again carbonate and phosphate significantly affected as v removal consistent with previous reports 39 40 this was attributed to both phosphate and carbonate forming an inner sphere complex with nzvi through internal adsorption thus significantly competing with both as v and as iii for finite adsorption sites 3 5 3 reuse experiment for any practical application the ability to regenerate and reuse adsorbents multiple times is critical to verify the regeneration of nzvi a reuse experiment of nzvi with simultaneous removal of as iii and as v was performed fig 8 after four cycles the adsorption efficiencies of nzvi for as v were 99 9 94 7 76 3 and 67 6 while for as iii they were 99 9 70 9 61 4 and 49 7 respectively thus although the removal efficiency decreased with each cycle of reuse this may be related to the occupation or passivation of the active site of nzvi over time 27 40 the results did however clearly show that nzvi can be repeatedly used for the removal of as iii and as v and also has some regeneration ability this certainly suggests that in practical terms the material is suitable for practical applications 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that nzvi can be successfully used to simultaneously remove both as iii and as v from aqueous solutions and mining affected groundwaters with high removal efficiencies the removal process followed the langmuir adsorption isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics both suggesting that chemisorption was involved where xps confirmed that both as iii and as v were adsorbed on the nzvi by surface complexation furthermore for as iii removal lc afs indicated that oxidation was also involved while the removal efficiency was unaffected by most common ions coexisting ions such as phosphate and carbonate decreased the removal efficiency however nzvi exhibited good stability and regeneration ability after four reuse cycles thus overall this work shows that nzvi can be successfully used for the simultaneous removal of both as iii and as v from groundwater in the vicinity of the mine impacted areas declaration of competing interest

13003,arsenic as is a contaminant of global concern due to its negative impact on environmental systems where as occurs mainly as two inorganic species arsenite as iii and arsenate as v thus the simultaneously removal of both as iii and as v from groundwater is a challenging issue in this paper zero valent iron nanoparticles nzvi with high surface active sites were used to simultaneously remove both as iii and as v species from groundwater with removal efficiencies 99 9 for an initial concentration 100 μg l 1 ion chromatography atomic fluorescence ic afs analysis indicated that during removal as iii was oxidized to as v while x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps showed that the as species were adsorbed on to the surface of nzvi by a complexation reaction furthermore thermodynamic studies of the adsorption process indicated that adsorption was a spontaneous and endothermic chemisorption process finally practical removal of both as species by nzvi from real groundwaters was demonstrated with removal efficiencies of 99 9 and 70 9 for as v and as iii respectively the presence of other coexisting ions affected the removal efficiency with phosphate and carbonate decreasing the removal efficiencies of both as iii and as v due competition with active binding sites on the surface of nzvi overall this work demonstrated that nzvi was a promising adsorbent for the practical removal of inorganic as species from complex environmental matrices such as groundwater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords arsenate arsenite groundwater nzvi remediation 1 introduction arsenic as is a toxic metalloid widely distributed in both natural water and groundwater as mainly exists in two common forms either as iii or as v 1 for example as contamination in mining areas may lead to the discharge of as containing wastewater into surrounding ecosystems 2 and this may subsequently affect human and environmental health the presence of as in groundwater mainly originates from anthropogenic activities such as agriculture mining medicinal wastes feed additives and waste leachate 3 where long term exposure to as may lead to various diseases including lung liver kidney and skin cancers 3 4 for this reason the development of technologies for the efficient treatment of as contamination has recently gained much more attention currently conventional methods for as removal from groundwater include adsorption reduction surface precipitation chemical precipitation ion exchange membrane technology and flocculation coagulation 1 3 of these methods adsorption has the advantage of being applicable over a wide ph range of low cost easy to operate simple to manage 5 6 able to be reused and or regenerated 4 and routinely exhibits a relatively high as removal efficiency however some adsorbents including commercially activated carbon activated alumina layered double hydroxide have distinct disadvantages for as removal including poor efficiency and selectivity 4 7 which has limited their practical applications for example the removal of high concentrations of as in actual wastewater such as groundwater would be very inefficient using these adsorbents for this reason it is particularly important to find alternative as adsorbents with good selectivity and high adsorption efficiency zero valent iron nanoparticles nzvi that are low in cost have a large specific surface area and excellent reactivity have been widely reported in environmental remediation studies 8 9 especially for the removal of as species in groundwater 4 for example nzvi was recently reported to successfully remove as iii from groundwater in the presence of several different oxidants 10 similarly as v removal from contaminated groundwater from the chacopampean plain of argentina was reported as being very effective when nzvi was used 11 another advantage of nzvi is that it has great potential for as removal from groundwater when applied via both in situ and ex situ remediation strategies 12 for example unsupported nzvi was successfully used for the in situ removal of as from groundwater in the presence of humic acid 13 while yet another report confirmed that montmorillonite supported nzvi could also be successfully used as an in situ groundwater as adsorbent 14 however most literature reports have only considered either the removal of as iii or as v from groundwater and few have considered groundwater contaminated with mixed as species and removal from real groundwaters in the vicinity of mining areas this is important because groundwater in mining areas often contains high levels of both as iii and as v species as well as a variety of heavy metal ions which make it much more difficult to remediate than other groundwater consequently remediation methods capable of the simultaneous removal of as iii and as v from groundwater in the vicinity of the mine area are urgently required in this study the potential for the simultaneous removal of as iii and as v from groundwater by nzvi was evaluated the objectives were to determine 1 whether nzvi can be used to simultaneously remove as iii and as v from groundwater and 2 the main ions in groundwater which could potentially impact the removal of as iii and as v during practical application during this study the removal of as iii and as v by nzvi in isolation and as a mixed solution was evaluated using liquid chromatography atomic fluorescence spectrometry lc afs to determine the residual concentration of each as species advanced material characterization of nzvi was also carried out before and after the removal of as iii and as v to further understand the role of any nzvi surface and or composition changes on as removal efficiency as well as any role in oxidation or reduction of as finally the application of nzvi to groundwater was practically evaluated where the effects of various coexisting anions on the simultaneous removal of as iii and as v were evaluated

continual stirring under the protection of a nitrogen atmosphere under the protection of nitrogen the resulting black particles were filtered quickly and washed with absolute ethanol subsequently the washed black particles were dried at 60 c in vacuum drying oven for 24 h before being ground to pass through a 120 mesh sieve to prepare the final nzvi 2 3 characterizations the morphological characteristics and elemental composition of nzvi before and after removal were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy combined with an energy spectrum disperser sem eds jeol jsm s4800 japan using

solutions were filtered through a 0 22 μm aqueous phase filter membrane prior to measurement 2 5 adsorption experiments 2 5 1 simultaneous removal of as iii and as v by nzvi experiments to evaluate the simultaneous removal of as iii and as v by nzvi were performed in 250 ml conical flasks the initial contaminant concentrations were 100 μg l 1 of as iii and 100 μg l 1 of as v as a mixed solution the nzvi dose 0 02 g l 1 was then added to the mixed contaminant solution 100 ml and placed on a mechanical shaking shaker at 250 rpm and 303 k thereafter during reaction at specific time intervals 5 10 20 30 60 120 180 and 360 min an aliquot of the mixed solution 1 5 ml was removed from the conical flask filtered 0 22 μm into a sample vial and the residual concentrations of both as iii and as v in the mixed solution determined via lc afs the nzvi removal experiments for as iii or as v alone were also performed in 250 ml conical flasks under identical conditions except that the initial concentration of contaminants was either 100 μg l 1 as iii or 100 μg l 1 as v 2 5 2 batch condition experiments in order to elucidate the effect of different experimental conditions on the simultaneous removal of as iii and as v by nzvi batch experiments with largely fixed conditions were conducted this involved repeating experiments under identical condition but where one variable at a time was varied the four parameters varied include ph 4 7 and 10 temperature 293 303 and 313 k nzvi dose 0 01 0 02 and 0 05 g l 1 and the initial concentration of the as iii as v mixed contaminants 50 100 and 200 μg l 1 otherwise all batch studies were performed as described above section 2 5 1 using exactly the same procedures 2 5 3 regeneration experiments the cyclic regeneration experiments for the simultaneous removal of as iii and as v by nzvi were performed under the following conditions dose 0 5 g l 1 initial concentration of as iii and as v mixed solution of 1 mg l 1 each and ph 7 where nzvi was added to the mixed as species solution at a constant temperature 303k and reacted for 6 h after 6 h an aliquot was removed filtered 0 22 μm and analyzed for residual as species the adsorbed nzvi was then regenerated by desorption with 0 1 m hcl for 3 h and the regenerated nzvi was reintroduced into a fresh solution with the same initial concentration of as species solution for another 6 h of adsorption the above steps were repeated four times all adsorption experiments were performed in triplicate and all results reported were averaged 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of as iii and as v the performance of nzvi for simultaneous removal of as iii and as v is shown in fig 1b after contact with nzvi for 6 h the removal efficiency of both as v and as iii reached 99 9 where comparison of the slopes of the removal curves of as iii and as v showed that the removal of as iii was much faster than as v in the early stages of the reaction during the later stages of reaction the removal rate was not as fast as as v this was because under the experimental conditions used as iii exists mainly in an electrically neutral form h3aso3 while as v exists in a negatively charged form h2aso4 and haso4 2 1 in addition the strong affinity of the adsorbent for as v 1 2 lead to faster as v adsorption the removal of as iii or as v by nzvi was also studied in isolation using ion chromatography under exactly the same conditions as used in fig 1b to determine whether there was a redox process occurring the removal efficiency of as iii alone by nzvi was 88 1 after 1 h and 98 8 after 3 h fig 1c in comparison the removal efficiency of as iii in a mixed solution was 83 6 after 1 h and 92 3 after 3 h fig 1b in comparison the removal efficiency of as v alone reached 99 9 after 1 h fig 1c compared to only 89 0 as v after 1 h in the mixed solution fig 1b this suggested there was a competitive adsorption process between as species during simultaneous removal 19 in the chromatogram fig 1d corresponding to the removal of as iii alone as removal time increased the characteristic peak area of as iii diminished gradually and a characteristic peak attributable to as v appeared indicating oxidation of as iii to as v during removal the likely oxidation process is described by eqs 1 2 and 3 2 20 where under oxygen containing conditions nzvi and dissolved oxygen generate h2o2 which further combines with the corrosion product fe2 and fe3 on the surface of nzvi this produces active oxides oh and o2 and hence as iii is further oxidized to as v and subsequently removed 2 20 previous studies of the role of dissolved oxygen in the removal of as iii and as v by nzvi indicated that as iii and as v speciation did not significnay change with dissolved oxygen levels which further confirmed that oxidation of as iii was caused directly by nzvi and not by changes in dissolved oxygen content 21 22 also in the ion chromatograms fig 1e obtained for the removal of as v alone no characteristic peak attributable to as iii appeared with increasing time which confirmed that as v removal did not involve reduction 1 fe 0 o 2 2 h fe 2 h 2 o 2 2 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 3 fe 2 o 2 fe 3 o 2 the above analysis showed that the process of simultaneous removal of as iii and as v by nzvi involved competitive adsorption and oxidation of the more toxic as iii to as v subsequently the role that each component of nzvi played in simultaneous as removal was verified by advanced material characterization 3 2 characterization 3 2 1 sem eds the morphology of nzvi before simultaneous removal of as iii and as v fig 2a was similar to that previously reported showing regular spherical particles 2 8 11 23 with a particle size distribution fig 2e yielding an average nzvi particle size of 48 9 nm this indicated some agglomeration due to nzvi having strong magnetic properties 2 furthermore eds analysis fig 2c showed that the nzvi surface mainly contained iron and a small amount of oxygen and no elemental as potentially indicating partial iron oxidation during nzvi synthesis after simultaneous as removal fig 2b nzvi showed a more irregular shape with viscous material interwoven between the nzvi particles the particle size distribution fig 2f also changed so that the average nzvi particle size increased slightly to 66 11 nm indicating slightly more agglomeration eds showed fig 2d that the iron content decreased slightly while element oxygen content increased significantly which was caused by the loss of fe and an increase in oxidation after contaminant contact with nzvi 23 in addition elemental as became a significant presence confirming that as iii and as v were adsorbed on to the surface of nzvi thus the overall changes in the proportions of all elements before and after simultaneous removal strongly supports the adsorption of as species on to the surface of nzvi due to a combination of simultaneous oxidation and adsorption 3 2 2 hr tem hr tem analysis fig 3 provided a more detailed examination of the changes in nzvi morphology and crystallinity before and after as removal before as removal fig 3a and c nzvi show a clearly spherical particle shape with obvious agglomeration with a d spacing of 0 2021 nm corresponding to the high crystallinity of the 011 plane of fe0 15 24 after removal fig 3b and d nzvi agglomeration was more severe due the apparent adsorption of pollutants as a slimy layer on the nzvi surface in addition lattice d spacings of 0 2021 and 0 2522 nm were both observed corresponding to the high crystallinity of the original 011 plane of fe0 and the 311 plane of fe3o4 respectively 2 24 this indicated that new phases were being generated in nzvi after as removal and the occurrence of adsorption and oxidation processes during as removal 3 2 3 xrd the xrd pattern of nzvi before and after simultaneous removal of as iii and as v is shown in fig 4a prior to removal the 011 002 and 112 crystalline planes of nzvi were clearly evident at 44 8 65 2 and 82 5 respectively 2 15 24 pdf 96 900 6590 confirming the successful synthesis of nzvi the material presented a body centered cubic structure with a good crystal form 24 there was also a small peak at 35 5 characteristic of fe3o4 15 and indicating that some iron oxidation occurred during the synthesis of nzvi in agreement with the eds results after simultaneous as removal in addition to the nzvi characteristic peaks which remained new peaks appeared at 30 2 57 2 and 62 9 corresponding to the 220 511 and 440 crystalline planes of fe3o4 pdf 98 015 8743 respectively meanwhile the diffraction peak at 35 5 which has been attributed to the 311 crystalline plane of fe3o4 pdf 98 015 8743 15 also remained but the peak intensity increased significantly these results strongly suggested that a significant change in the crystalline phase of nzvi occurred probably due to a chemical reaction between the contaminant and nzvi however despite this since the overall characteristic peaks attributable to nzvi still existed this indicated that nzvi largely retained stability during the simultaneous removal process this was due to the core shell structure of nzvi 8 20 therefore xrd analysis further confirmed that both an adsorption and redox processes were likely responsible for the simultaneous removal of as iii and as v by nzvi 3 2 4 bet the n2 adsorption and desorption curves of nzvi before and after removal are shown in fig 4b a h3 hysteresis loops was observed for nzvi both before and after removal which was a characteristic isotherm associated with mesoporous materials the specific surface area of nzvi before removal was 100 9 m2 g 1 which was much higher than that of commercial nzvi nanofer 25s with a specific surface area of only 20 m2 g 1 25 and nzvi synthesized by similar methods s3 nzvi with a specific surface area of 63 m2 g 1 11 after removal the specific surface area of nzvi decreased to 34 1 m2 g 1 and the pore volume decreased from 0 18 before to 0 06 after cm3 g 1 which was attributed to blockage of some pores of nzvi after the adsorption of as and hence inaccessibility to n2 molecules 3 2 5 xps the full scale xps scan of nzvi before and after simultaneous removal of as iii and as v fig 4c clearly showed that the surface of nzvi contained mainly fe and o after simultaneous removal elemental as was also observed which confirmed successful adsorption of one or more as species which can be better seen in fig 4f in the fe 2p spectrum fig 4d and in agreement with xrd analysis the peak at 706 71 ev was a characteristic peak for fe0 26 the other peaks present at 710 11 and 723 40 ev were associated with orbital splitting peaks of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 of fe2 26 27 while peaks at 711 41 and 724 77 ev corresponded to the fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 peaks of fe3 26 27 and the satellite peak at 719 20 ev was attributed to γ fe2o3 26 collectively the occurrence of multiple peaks in the fe 2p spectrum supported the occurrence of oxidation during the synthesis of nzvi after as removal while all of the characteristic peaks of all fe elements were still present their binding energies were shifted slightly the characteristic peaks of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 for fe2 now occurred at 710 31 and 725 31 ev the characteristic peaks of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 for fe3 now occurred at 711 68 and 724 92 ev while the satellite peak at 719 13 ev still corresponded to γ fe2o3 26 27 in addition a slight increase in the area of each characteristic peak indicates an increase in the oxidation of fe and the adsorption of contaminants by the nzvi surface through complexation 28 in slight contrast to the xrd analysis section 3 2 3 the characteristic peak attributable to fe0 disappeared after reaction with as which may be due to the larger thickness of the oxide layer and xps being primarily a surface analysis in the o 1 s spectrum fig 4e before as removal only two main peaks were fitted at 530 05 and 531 51 ev indicating the presence of o2 and oh groups 29 corresponding to characteristic peaks associated with feo feooh and h2o 8 30 31 in combination with the speciation indicated by analysis of the fe 2p spectrum this suggested that before removal the nzvi surface was mainly composed of fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh with a fe0 inner core 8 31 after removal in addition to these two characteristic o 1 s peaks a new peak appeared at 532 10 ev which was characteristic of as oh 32 again indicating that as was being adsorbed on the surface of nzvi via complexation in the as 3d spectrum fig 4f no characteristic peak attributable to as appeared on the nzvi surface before removal however after removal two characteristic peaks were obtained at 45 61 and 44 81 ev corresponding to as v and as iii and the characteristic peaks of as v o and as iii o 33 34 respectively overall the observed changes in existing peak intensities areas and shifts in the binding energies of individual characteristic together with the appearance of new characteristic peaks post reaction strongly suggest that the as species were being adsorbed onto the nzvi surface through chemical complexation thus xps analysis further confirmed that nzvi can simultaneous removal of as iii and as v by adsorption and oxidation processes 3 3 factors affecting the removal as iii and as v the impact of four common reaction parameters temperature solution ph initial as concentration and nzvi dose on the adsorption removal efficiency and hence adsorption mechanism were examined the influence of solution ph fig 5a was assessed at three solution phs 4 7 and 10 during simultaneous removal of as iii and as v when the solution ph was 4 or 7 the removal of as v reached 99 9 compared to only 78 8 within 2 h when the ph was 10 this was because as v exists in different forms at different ph in the ph range 3 6 as v exists in solution as a singly negatively charges species h2aso4 whereas in the ph range 8 10 5 as v exist as a double charged negative species haso4 2 35 since the isoelectric point of nzvi is 8 4 8 at solution ph 8 4 the nzvi would be positively charges and electrostatic attract the negative charged as v complexations reactions are then likely with the nzvi surface since the nzvi surface produces feooh groups through the following three eqs 4 5 and 6 8 at ph 4 and 7 however at solution ph 8 4 ie at ph 10 the surface of nzvi becomes negatively charged and as v removal is diminished due to electrostatic repulsion between the nzvi surface and the even more negatively charged as v in solution consequently the removal efficiency of as v at ph 10 was not as high as that observed at either ph 4 or 7 4 4 fe 0 3 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 feooh 5 4 fe 3 o 4 o 2 6 h 2 o 12 feooh 6 fe 2 o 3 h 2 o 2 feooh for as iii when the solution ph was 10 the removal efficiency reached 99 9 within 2 h but when the solution ph was either 4 or 7 the removal efficiency only reached 91 3 and 92 9 respectively within 2 h and took 6 h to reach 97 1 and 99 9 respectively this was also caused by different forms of as iii being present in solution at different phs at ph 9 2 as iii primarily exists as an uncharged species h3aso3 and a single negative species h2aso3 in the ph range 9 12 35 thus in the entire ph range of 4 to 10 considered here as iii removal is favored by a combination of electrostatic interaction and surface feooh complexation 8 resulting in increased as iii removal efficiencies the influence of three different experimental temperature 293 303 and 313 k on as species removal efficiencies is shown in fig 5b for as v at either 303 or 313 k the removal efficiencies reached 99 9 within 2 h while at 293 k removal reached only 78 8 within 2 h for as iii the 2 h removal efficiency increased with temperature reaching 86 0 at 293 k 91 6 at 303 k and 97 6 at 313 k overall since removal efficiency gradually increased with an increase in reaction temperature this suggested that the removal process was endothermic 36 higher reaction temperatures can also provide greater kinetic energy to the containments enhancing their diffusion through the solution making it more likely that an interaction with the nzvi surface can occur furthermore elevated temperature can also overcome the activation energy of the adsorbent 19 leading to greater surface adsorption and hence contaminant removal the effect of three nzvi doses 0 01 0 02 and 0 05 g l 1 on the as species removal efficiencies is shown in fig 5c irrespective of the dose used removal reached 99 9 within 6 h however the greater the dose the faster the removal thus as dose increased from 0 01 to 0 02 to 0 05 g l 1 the 1 h removal efficiencies for as v increased in the order 76 0 90 5 and 99 9 while the removal efficiencies for as iii increased in the order 76 7 82 4 and 98 3 respectively this was because when the solution contained more nzvi both the oxidation capacity and available adsorption sites increased 36 thereby improving the removal of both as v and as iii the influence of three initial as species concentration 50 100 and 200 μg l 1 on the final removal efficiencies is shown in fig 5d at the two lower concentrations both as iii and as v removal efficiencies reached 99 9 within 6 h while for the higher concentration 200 μg l 1 the 6 h removal efficiencies for as iii and as v were 97 2 and 91 3 respectively the lower the initial contaminant concentration the faster was the contaminant removal thus as the initial as concentration increased in the order 50 100 and 200 μg l 1 the 1 h as iii removal efficiencies decreased in the order 86 9 82 4 and 74 1 while the 1 h as v removal efficiencies decreases in the order 99 9 90 5 and 71 3 respectively this was because for a fixed dose the adsorption sites and oxidation capacity provided by nzvi was finite which limited removal capacity as contaminant concentration increased 36 collectively these four condition experiments allowed optimal conditions for as species to be determined for an initial as species concentration of 100 μg l 1 the optimal removal conditions were 313 k ph 10 and 0 02 g l 1 nzvi for as iii and 313 k ph 4 and 0 02 g l 1 nzvi for as v taking into account both economic and removal time factors 3 4 adsorption isotherms and kinetics adsorption isotherms were determined in the contaminant concentration range of 100 1000 μg l 1 where in order to better understand the mechanism of simultaneous removal of as iii and as v by nzvi the obtained data was fitted to either the langmuir eq 7 or freundlich eq 8 adsorption isotherm models respectively 7 c e q e c e q m 1 q m k l 8 ln q e ln k f ln c e n where qe mg g 1 is the amount of as adsorbed to nzvi at equilibrium ce mg l 1 is the residual concentration of as in solution at equilibrium and qm mg g 1 is the theoretical maximum amount of as adsorbed corresponding to the maximum adsorption capacity and kl mg l 1 and kf mg g 1 are the equilibrium adsorption constants for the langmuir and freundlich models respectively and n is an exponential parameter the best fit results of the two models are summarized in table 1 irrespective of the temperature the langmuir model consistently described the adsorption behavior of both as iii and as v better than the freundlich model thus based on the underlying assumptions of the langmuir model this indicated that both as species were adsorbed on the nzvi surface mainly via monomolecular layer adsorption involving chemisorption which is more stable than simple physical adsorption 35 36 37 the maximum adsorption capacity gradually also increased with increasing temperature table 1 which indicated that temperature influenced the adsorption process in order to further understand the mechanism of the simultaneous removal of the two as species by nzvi the experimental data was also fitted to either the pseudo first order eq 9 or pseudo second order eq 10 kinetic models 9 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 10 t q t t q e 1 k 2 q e 2 where qe mg l 1 and qt mg l 1 are the adsorption capacities of as iii and as v at equilibrium and at time t respectively and k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 are the rate constants for the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order kinetic models respectively the best fit results table 2 showed that the correlation coefficients of the pseudo second order kinetic model were consistently higher than the pseudo first order kinetic model this indicates that the adsorption processes of both as iii and as v by nzvi followed pseudo second order kinetics thus in agreement with the best fit of the data to the langmuir adsorption isotherm model and based on the underlying assumptions of the pseudo second order kinetic model the adsorption process most likely proceeds through chemisorption 35 37 the magnitude of the rate constant for the pseudo second order kinetic model also increased with temperature indicating that increased temperature favored as adsorption by nzvi which was consistent with the temperature variation experiments the thermodynamic of a process can also provide insight into the dominant mechanism and was studied here using eqs 11 and 12 to derive best fit thermodynamic parameters table 3 11 g rt ln k 12 ln k h rt s r where r is the universal molar gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 k is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant g is the change in gibbs free energy kj mol 1 h is the enthalpy change kj mol 1 and s is the entropy change j mol 1 k 1 irrespective of the temperature for both as species g was negative and h positive indicating that overall the removal of both as species was a spontaneous and endothermic process the relatively low values of h 15 kj mol 1 indicated that electrostatic effects had a greater influence on the adsorption process 37 the positive value of s also indicated that the as species had a good affinity for nzvi during the removal process as contaminant disorder in solution increased 36 37 which generally facilitates removal the as adsorption capacity of nzvi fabricated here was also compared with the maximum as adsorption capacity previously obtained for different adsorbents table 4 this comparison clearly showed that the as adsorption capacity of nzvi was much higher than that of the previously reported materials and suggested that nzvi would be a promising material for the removal of as species from aqueous solutions 3 5 application 3 5 1 removal of as from groundwater the practical application potential of nzvi was explored by treating an actual mining groundwater having the ion composition before and after removal shown in table 5 the original concentration of as v in the mining groundwater 22 μg l 1 was reduced by 59 1 to 9 μg l 1 after treatment with nzvi since this was below the chinese class iii groundwater quality standard gb t14848 2017 of 10 μg l 1 this indicated that nzvi exhibited a high practical as removal efficiency in addition the removal of sb v ba ii and cr vi by nzvi was 28 6 39 5 and 98 9 respectively while the removal of other ions was not significant since the amount of elemental as in the original groundwater was relatively small a better evaluation of the potential of nzvi was obtained by spiking the original groundwater with a standard concentrations of 50 and 100 μg l 1 the comparative removal efficiencies of 100 μg l 1 as by nzvi in laboratory deionized water and groundwater is shown in fig 6a in deionized water the removal efficiencies of both as iii and as v reached 99 9 after 6 h in contrast in groundwater while the removal efficiency of as v reached 99 9 after 6 h the removal efficiency of as iii was only 70 9 in the same period when compared with deionized water while the removal efficiency of as iii was 30 lower it was still relative high and suitable for practical applications in the spiking experiment fig 6b at an as concentration of 50 μg l 1 the removal efficiency of as v also reached 99 9 after 6 h while the removal rate of as iii only reached 60 6 during this process as iii can easily be oxidized to as v where this become advantageous because nzvi has a greater adsorption capacity for as v and hence can removing greater amounts of total as from groundwater 3 5 2 influence of ionic composition of groundwater on as removal real mining groundwaters are often a rich mixture of many different ions which can all potentially impact the removal efficiency of specific contaminants by adsorption thus in order to evaluate the effect of coexisting ions in the groundwater on as removal by nzvi the effects of seven common coexisting ions on as removal were explored at four different concentrations between 0 and 5000 μg l 1 fig 7 cations had very little effect on the removal of as this was because irrespective of the dominate as species present or the prevailing ph in solution the existing as forms were either present as as oxy anions or neutral species 8 35 thus when cations and as species coexist there is no competitive adsorption for the active sites on nzvi and in fact cations would be electrostatically repelled from the positively charged nzvi surface in contrast for coexisting anions some competitive adsorption between as species and the anions might be expected leading to a reduction in as removal however for as iii chloride sulfate and nitrate had little effect on removal while carbonate and phosphate significantly affected effect the removal of as iii likewise for as v chloride sulfate and nitrate exerted little effect on as v removal but again carbonate and phosphate significantly affected as v removal consistent with previous reports 39 40 this was attributed to both phosphate and carbonate forming an inner sphere complex with nzvi through internal adsorption thus significantly competing with both as v and as iii for finite adsorption sites 3 5 3 reuse experiment for any practical application the ability to regenerate and reuse adsorbents multiple times is critical to verify the regeneration of nzvi a reuse experiment of nzvi with simultaneous removal of as iii and as v was performed fig 8 after four cycles the adsorption efficiencies of nzvi for as v were 99 9 94 7 76 3 and 67 6 while for as iii they were 99 9 70 9 61 4 and 49 7 respectively thus although the removal efficiency decreased with each cycle of reuse this may be related to the occupation or passivation of the active site of nzvi over time 27 40 the results did however clearly show that nzvi can be repeatedly used for the removal of as iii and as v and also has some regeneration ability this certainly suggests that in practical terms the material is suitable for practical applications 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that nzvi can be successfully used to simultaneously remove both as iii and as v from aqueous solutions and mining affected groundwaters with high removal efficiencies the removal process followed the langmuir adsorption isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics both suggesting that chemisorption was involved where xps confirmed that both as iii and as v were adsorbed on the nzvi by surface complexation furthermore for as iii removal lc afs indicated that oxidation was also involved while the removal efficiency was unaffected by most common ions coexisting ions such as phosphate and carbonate decreased the removal efficiency however nzvi exhibited good stability and regeneration ability after four reuse cycles thus overall this work shows that nzvi can be successfully used for the simultaneous removal of both as iii and as v from groundwater in the vicinity of the mine impacted areas declaration of competing interest

13004,electrochemical ferrous iron fe2 wastewater treatment is gaining momentum for treating municipal wastewater due to its decreasing costs environmental friendliness and capacity for removal of a wide range of contaminants disinfection by iron electrocoagulation fe ec has been occasionally reported in full scale industrial applications yet controversy remains regarding its underlying elimination mechanisms and kinetics in this study it was demonstrated that substantial inactivation can be achieved for escherichia coli wr1 5 log10 and somatic coliphage φx174 2 3 log10 electrochemically produced fe2 yielded similar inactivation as chemical fe2 reactive oxygen species ros quenching experiments with tempol confirmed that e coli inactivation was related to the production of fenton like intermediates during fe2 oxidation the observed e coli disinfection kinetics could be mathematically related to fe ec current intensity using a chick watson like expression in which the amperage is surrogate for the disinfectant s concentration we hereby show that it is possible to mathematically predict disinfection based on applied fe dosage and dosage speed phage φx174 inactivation could not be described in a similar way because at higher fe dosages 20 mg l little additional inactivation was observed also ros quencher tempol did not completely inhibit phage φx174 removal suggesting that additional pathways are relevant for its elimination graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrocoagulation disinfection reactive oxygen species tempol water reclamation 1 introduction globally agriculture is the largest water consumer worldwide however 3 2 billion people currently inhabit agricultural areas prone to shortages or severe scarcity 38 the use of treated municipal wastewater is a common practice particularly throughout asia where over 200 million farmers make use of raw or treated wastewater for the irrigation of over 2000 km2 of cropland 31 33 in these cases wastewater reuse can reduce the pressure on freshwater resources particularly in water stressed regions in which there can be extreme seasonal fluctuations in agricultural water availability however no matter how attractive municipal wastewater reclamation appears it is still a potential source of a wide range of enteric pathogens these include bacteria viruses protozoa and helminths as well as the emerging concern of antimicrobial resistant bacteria listed as a global health threat by who 9 hence the reuse of municipal effluents demands careful handling of the health risks associated with it these risks will depend on the concentration of pathogens in the treated effluent how the treated effluent will be used and the associated exposure routes and susceptibility of the users after exposure therefore the level of treatment pathogen inactivation for reclamation purposes depends on the particular reuse application and the likelihood and frequency of user exposure in this study we evaluated the disinfection 1 1 disinfection is the process of water treatment to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms elimination mechanisms are inactivation of the microorganism or physical removal of the microorganism from the water matrix capacity of the electrochemical process called iron electrocoagulation fe ec targeting its use as a municipal water reclamation technology and with a special focus on its kinetics fe ec is a process which releases fe2 ions into a water stream in order to induce coagulation as opposed to conventional fe chemical coagulation cc which is usually performed by dosing fecl3 or other fe3 salts fe ec produces the metallic coagulant on site by the electrochemical dissolution of fe or steel plates fe ec has been applied as a treatment for effluents from a wide variety of industries such as paper and pulp petrochemical textile dairy slaughterhouses manure metal plating and others 7 10 28 46 however its use for municipal wastewater applications has been marginal and mainly confined to academic research 1 16 24 25 44 disinfection by fe ec has been occasionally reported in full scale industrial applications yet its underlying inactivation mechanisms are still not clearly understood in general terms three major microbe removal inactivation mechanisms have been proposed for fe ec namely a sorption or entrapment of microbes to the flocculation products with subsequent removal by sedimentation 3 12 b inactivation due to the induced electric field between the plates 8 29 and c chemical inactivation due to reactive oxygen species ros 5 8 12 24 37 or due to the in situ formation of disinfectants and disinfectant by products 24 29 dixon stockwell 5 define ros as a general term that includes several partially reduced molecules containing oxygen such as superoxide o2 peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh they are an integral part in the semi fenton chemistry that takes place when fe ec is conducted under aerobic conditions which comprises the aerobic oxidation pathway of fe2 into fe3 and the cascade of intermediate species formed in the process fig 1 most of these species in particular the radicals have an extremely short half life in the range of 10 6 10 9 s for which their production and degradation can be considered instantaneous 34 in general terms disinfection by ros occurs due to oxidative damage to dna rna enzymes proteins cell membrane constituents and subsequent rupture viral capsids phospholipid envelopes or via the interruption of the respiratory pathway 4 20 41 ros disinfection capacity varies greatly among the different ros species while superoxide and hydrogen peroxide are considered the weakest ros compounds as hydroxyl radicals are considered the most potent hence during fe ec and cc there may be different pathways for inactivation or removal of pathogenic micro organisms at play however to utilize fe coagulation as a disinfection method it is critical to differentiate between these pathways as they require different operational conditions the objective of this study was therefore to isolate the contribution of inactivation by ros formed during fe2 oxidation from other removal pathways such as floc sorption and entrapment as this differentiation is generally lacking in electrocoagulation literature the contribution of ros mediated inactivation was therefore assessed for both a bacterial and a viral enteric indicator organism namely escherichia coli wr1 and somatic coliphage φx174 respectively for this purpose a series of experiments with both chemical and electro chemical dosing of fe2 were conducted either in presence or absence of the fenton inhibitor tempol 14 in this study a differentiation was made between continuous and single spike dosage as it is hypothesized that continuous generation of ros might be beneficial for the disinfection capacity of the fe ec system in addition the dosage rate was assessed to develop a ros inactivation kinetics model for fe ec 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory setup and experimental design experiments were conducted using fe ec and or cc as sources of fe fig 2 all experiments were performed in 2 l cylindrical glass beakers mounted on identical labnico l23 magnetic stirrers and fitted with ptfe coated bars for stirring purposes during all experiments air was supplied continuously using an oase oxymax200 air pump and dissolved oxygen do levels were monitored continuously in order to maintain saturation in the test water depending on the experiment chemical dosing was performed either by spiking the dosage weighing and directly dosing fe salts into the reaction beaker or by continuously adding dosing solutions using a watson marlow 120 u peristaltic pump fecl2 and fecl3 reagent grade salts were supplied by sigma aldrich germany the fe ec setup included a 30 v 3 a tenma 72 10 500 bench dc power supply connected with crocodile clip cables to two s235 steel plates maximum percentages 0 14 carbon 0 10 silicium 0 80 manganese 0 025 phosphorous 0 015 sulphur 0 010 nitrogen 0 20 copper and 0 080 aluminum dimensions of the steel plates were 6 cm 4 cm of which 4 cm 4 cm were submerged 2 cm remained above the test water to connect the clip cables the plates were polished with coarse and fine sand paper before each use and mounted to the end of a plastic tube with carved parallel slots ensuring the plates remained parallel and spaced approximately 1 cm as described elsewhere 1 2 12 26 29 during each individual experiment only two process control parameters were adjusted namely electrical current amperage and electrolysis time these parameter combinations were selected beforehand for each experiment in order to produce a dose of 50 mgfe l under different speeds namely 5 0 2 5 and 1 0 mgfe l min as oxidation kinetics are relevant for this research the maximum fe dosage rate 5 0 mgfe l min was selected based on the capacity of the power supply not to reach exceed its maximum voltage 30 v since experiments were conducted at room temperature the need to minimize spontaneous inactivation of e coli limited the duration of the experiments which in turn defined the lower fe dosage rate 1 0 mgfe l min an intermediate fe dosage speed 2 5 mgfe l min was added as a third dataset four groups of experiments were performed in order to determine the role of oxidizing fe2 in ros mediated disinfection fig 3 and the kinetics involved for all experiments synthetic water containing a buffer solution and indicator microbes was prepared described in section 2 2 the contribution of ros mediated disinfection was assessed in two ways namely 1 comparing inactivation by fe2 or fe3 and 2 ros quenching while dosing fe2 fecl2 see 2 4 to determine whether the source of fe had any impact on ros mediated disinfection a third group of experiments compared microbial inactivation using cc or fe ec as the fe2 source including ros quenching for each case lastly fe ec disinfection kinetics were studied by operating the system at different dosage rates additional information can be found in s i table 1 for all experiments the stirring speed was set to 200 rpm which induced intense mixing and turbulence and prevented the formation of macroscopic flocs samples were collected immediately after the fe dosing was stopped while the stirring was still on in order to avoid any sedimentation collected samples were used immediately for microbiological and physical chemical characterization 2 2 synthetic water matrix for all experiments the synthetic water matrix was either 0 02 m or 0 04 m tris hcl buffer hoch₂ ₃cnh₂ s i table 1 selected by its capacity to buffer at a ph of approximately 7 5 7 7 similar to that of municipal secondary effluents its absence of fe or ros scavengers such as po4 3 co3 2 ca2 and its moderate conductivity avoiding the addition of electrolytes for fe ec 2 3 microbial spike preparation two non pathogenic organisms were used to spike the synthetic effluents namely e coli wr1 nctc 13167 and somatic coliphage φx174 atcc 13706 b1 a bacterial and viral indicator respectively as previously used in 2 e coli wr1 frozen stock was thawed and grown in tygb broth tryptone yeast extract glucose broth for 3 h at 37 c to concentrations of 1 108 cfu ml then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm during 10 min the obtained pellet was re suspended in pbs ph 7 2 to a concentration of 1 109 cfu ml stored at 4 c and used within 24 h phage φx174 was propagated following the iso 10705 2 2000 method water quality detection and enumeration of bacteriophages part 2 enumeration of somatic coliphages to concentrations of approximately 1 109 pfu ml e coli wr1 and phage φx174 were dosed into the test liquid to initial concentrations of 1 105 cfu ml and 1 104 pfu ml respectively 2 4 tempol as quencher for fe2 mediated ros in order to inhibit the disinfection by ros produced following the aerobic oxidation of fe2 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidin 1 oxyl also known as 4 hydroxy tempo or tempol was selected as ros quencher tempol is the most studied of the nitroxides mainly due to its low molecular weight and high cell permeability 43 its most remarkable properties include the superoxide catalysis the catalytic destruction of h2o2 by catalase like reactions and the hindering of toxic hydroxyl radical production the reaction between tempol and fe2 cations was described by 27 1 r r no fe 2 r r noh fe 3 in this reaction the nitroxide indicated by the reducible functional group no reacts on a 1 1 m ratio with fe2 to produce the oxidized oxoammonium noh and fe3 in this way nitroxides accept the electrons from reduced fe complexes therefore outcompeting oxygen and thus preventing the production of oxygenated radicals this equimolar reaction between fe2 and tempol was instrumental during ros quenching experiments later described in this publication during these experiments reagent grade tempol sigma aldrich germany was weighed added directly and diluted into the synthetic water before any addition of fe 2 5 analytical methods e coli screening and quantification was performed by membrane filtration according to apha standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 23rd edition samples were filtered in 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane filters and placed on chromocult coliform agar merck selective media in which e coli wr1 yields distinct purple colonies and incubated at 37 c for 24 h screening of somatic coliphages was performed by pour plate technique following iso 10705 2 2000 total fe was measured with spectroquant iron cell test 1 50 mgfe l using a spectroquant nova60 merck germany photometer while fe2 was measured with hach lck 320 fe test kits 0 2 6 mgfe l hydrogen peroxide measurements were conducted following the ghormley triiodide method 6 with filtered samples 0 45 μm using a genesys 10s uv vis thermo scientific at 350 nm wavelength all samples analyzed for h2o2 were processed within 60 s of extraction for fe ec experiments free chlorine tests were conducted in filtered samples using the dpd method spectroquant supelco in order to rule out the production of cl2 compounds that could account for unwanted disinfection 2 6 data analysis a reduction in the concentration of the microorganisms is expressed as log removal values since this term is widely used but here referred to as either removal or inactivation based on the involved elimination mechanism comparison between data series of somatic coliphage φx174 or e coli concentrations in synthetic effluents under different conditions was performed using spearman s rank order correlation which calculates rank correlation coefficient rs and p value rs determines the strength of the correlation between two datasets rs 0 9 indicates very strong correlation the p value determines the likelihood of two data series to be co relatable by mere chance p value 0 05 shows a strong correlation beyond chance between data sets spearman was preferred over pearson s correlation due to the monotonic behavior of most plots to be correlated section 3 3 results 3 1 inactivation by fe2 or fe3 experiments comparing e coli wr1 and somatic coliphage φx174 inactivation by varying dosages of either fe2 or fe3 are depicted in fig 4 no significant difference in terms of floc characteristics were observed after 1 h of continuous stirring for samples dosed with either fecl2 or fecl3 s i fig 4 for both selected microbial indicators inactivation using fecl3 fe3 was negligible across all assayed dosages yet the response towards fecl2 fe2 was considerably different e coli inactivation increased with increasing fe2 dosage with an approximate 0 05 log10 per mg fe l dosed at the maximum dosage of 100 mg fe l e coli inactivation approached 5 log10 the inactivation of φx174 showed a biphasic pattern up to 10 20 mg fe2 l inactivation was more rapid close to 1 5 log10 which was similar to e coli while at higher fe2 concentrations inactivation levelled off reaching approximately 2 5 log10 at 100 mg fe l all retrieved samples dosed with fecl2 showed full fe2 oxidation after 1 h of stirring fe2 below limit of detection lod though given the relatively high ph and do it is likely that this condition had been achieved within minutes it may be concluded that under intense mixing to prevent sedimentation and aerobic conditions dosage of fe2 demonstrated to have considerable inactivation properties that were not observed for fe3 under identical conditions this indicates that the oxidation of fe2 itself and potentially the production of intermediate ros plays a critical role in fe based disinfection 3 2 ros quenching to investigate the contribution of ros to e coli and φx174 inactivation during fe2 oxidation fe2 was dosed chemically with and without the presence of an equimolar amount of the ros quencher tempol tempol counteracted the bactericidal properties of oxidizing fe2 for e coli with under 1 log10 inactivation at all dosages s i fig 1 according to eq 1 the interaction between tempol and fe2 should lead to oxidation of the latter into fe3 without o2 acting an as electron acceptor avoiding the formation of the superoxide radical and thus halting the ros cascade all samples with and without tempol showed full fe oxidation after 1 h of stirring fe2 below lod inactivation of e coli and phage φx174 under a dose of 50 mgfe l is displayed in fig 5 the complete dosage series is presented in s i fig 1 for both indicators beakers in which only tempol was dosed showed almost identical microbial concentrations as the blank negligible inactivation confirming that the quencher itself did not exhibit inactivation properties e coli inactivation reached approximately 3 log10 when the reaction was not quenched dropping to 0 5 log10 with tempol added these results indicate that the observed inactivation during fe2 oxidation was related to the formation of reactive intermediates and that this inactivation pathway could be almost completely suppressed by the addition of the fenton inhibitor tempol this also indicates that the primary elimination process was inactivation rather than entrapment in flocs phage φx174 demonstrated a similar inactivation as e coli under the presence of fe2 2 8 log10 without tempol while inactivation was still significant after the addition of tempol 1 5 log10 the observation that φx174 disinfection in the presence of tempol is not fully suppressed suggests the contribution of an elimination mechanism other than ros such as entrapment in flocs no production of cl2 based compounds 0 01 mg l total cl2 was detected during these or any of the experiments described in this publication hence this inactivation mechanism was ruled out 3 3 cc versus fe ec to determine the impact of the source of fe2 in inactivation experiments using an identical and constant fe supply rate 1 0 mgfe l min were conducted either by cc or fe ec for e coli wr1 almost identical inactivation was obtained whether the fe source was either chemical fecl2 or electrochemical fig 6a this indicated that the source of fe2 was irrelevant for inactivation as long as the produced fe2 dosage was similar spearman s rank correlation test between averaged data sets determined rs 1 with a p value of 0 001 for both cc and fe ec the fe was dosed in a constant manner instead of in a single spike as instant dosing is not possible with fe ec when comparing fe2 continuous dosing fig 6 a c against instant dosing figs 4 and 5 for inactivation of e coli it is apparent that for constant dosing the same maximum inactivation is achieved after dosing only half the fe dose 50 mgfe l than for the single spike experiments 100 mgfe l for phage φx174 experiments with non quenched fe2 also produced similar inactivation results whether the fe source was chemical fecl2 or electrochemical as depicted in fig 6c this indicated that the source of fe2 is also irrelevant for phage φx174 inactivation as long as the produced fe dosage is similar spearman rs 0 97 p value 0 001 regarding the performance of continuous fe dosing compared to a single spike figs 4 and 5 50 mgfe l continuous dosage yielded similar inactivation of φx174 as a single spike dose 2 log10 inactivation for experiments involving quenched fe2 dosage with added tempol inactivation datasets coming from the e coli experiments with chemical and electrochemical sources still show a statistically strong correlation spearman rs 0 86 p value 0 05 but inactivation is in either case almost completely mitigated under the presence of tempol fig 6b inactivation was 1 log10 at the maximum fe dosage 50 mgfe l data for φx174 experiments involving quenched fe2 dosage fig 6d on chemical versus electrochemical sources again showed a statistically strong correlation spearman rs 0 93 p value 0 02 however as opposed to the strong reduction of the inactivation rate observed for e coli fig 6b versus 6a addition of tempol yielded only a small reduction of the inactivation rate for either of the fe sources fig 6d versus 6c altogether these results conclusively show that irrespective of the type of assay quenched non quenched or the type of microbial indicator there is no statistical difference between inactivation induced by fe2 coming from either cc or fe ec this implies that during fe ec the contribution of electrolysis specific inactivation pathways due to electric fields or to cl2 formation was negligible 3 4 fe ec inactivation kinetics in order to investigate fe ec inactivation kinetics experiments were conducted with three different dosing rates namely 5 0 2 5 and 1 0 mgfe l min fast medium and slow dosage respectively for each of these settings the fe supply was stopped once the cumulative dosage reached 50 mgfe l in order to produce the same end concentration for e coli wr1 the faster the fe dosage the higher the inactivation rate interestingly inactivation stopped abruptly once the electric charge was interrupted which means that the inactivation produced during the fe ec stage offered no residual effect once the current ceased s i fig 2 this implies that disinfectants produced during the supply of fe2 were extremely short lived the plot ln c co versus electrolysis time fig 7a shows a good correlation between the averaged datasets and linear trendlines with the slope being the inactivation rate in which the ratios between the inactivation rates 5 2 3 0 1 0 are similar to the ratios of the current intensity and of fe production speed 5 0 2 5 1 0 when plotted against the fe dosage fig 7b there is an overlap between the ln c co plots indicating that inactivation is directly proportional to the dosed fe for all dosage speeds for phage φx174 results showed different inactivation kinetics than e coli the inactivation rate the slope in fig 7c appeared numerically comparable for all experiments this means that the inactivation rate progressed similarly irrespective of dosing speed as long as the electric current was being applied yet was independent of the magnitude of such current instead of proportional as for e coli since each configuration delivered different amounts of fe per unit time shorter fe dosage times faster dosage speeds yielded less total inactivation than slower dosages as depicted in fig 7d for 50 mgfe l the slow dosage speed 1 0 mgfe l min produced 4 7 ln inactivation 1 8 log10 whereas the fast dosage speed 5 0 mgfe l min reached only 1 2 ln 0 7 log10 the averaged ln c co diagrams for each different charge speed condition show sufficient linearity as to assume a linear regression to provide an adequate fit even though the r2 values were somewhat lower than those obtained for e coli for all cases the decrease in the concentration of phage φx174 ceased abruptly once the electric current supply was interrupted as was the case with e coli once again suggesting that fe ec produced no residual disinfection and that the disinfectants produced were extremely short lived s i fig 3 3 5 fe speciation and h2o2 measurements during the fe ec inactivation kinetics experiments screening of fe2 and fe3 was performed to verify that the conversion of fe2 into fe3 was a steady state process h2o2 screening was performed simultaneously to confirm the onset of the ros cascade fe screening fig 8 showed for all cases a very stable and relatively low fe2 concentration being established and measured during electrolysis simultaneous with a stable fe3 production since fe is electrochemically dosed as fe2 22 and fe3 is produced at a steady rate this means that fe2 is readily converted to fe3 this was expected due to relatively high ph 7 4 7 7 and dissolved oxygen close to saturation 7 5 mgo2 l once the current was interrupted an abrupt drop in the fe2 concentration was observed readily stabilizing at 1 mgfe l for the remainder of the screening it is important to note that in all cases inactivation only occurred during the time in which fe2 was being steadily supplied and steadily oxidized and halted abruptly once fe2 stopped being supplied hence stopped being oxidized for all experiments faradaic efficiency of the fe ec was determined 95 96 based on the measured fe2 plateau ph and dissolved oxygen concentrations during fe ec theoretical fe2 oxidation rates or fe3 production were calculated following the methodology proposed by stumm lee 36 expressed in eq 2 calculations are detailed in s i table 3 2 d fe 2 d t k fe 2 p o 2 oh 2 where k is the kinetic constant 1 5 0 5 1013 l2mol 2atm 1min 1 fe2 is the molar concentration of the fe present in the fe2 form po2 is the partial pressure of oxygen atm oh is the molarity of the oh ion theoretical versus observed oxidation rates are displayed in table 1 these theoretical fe2 oxidation values are numerically very similar to the measured production rate of fe3 in each case 4 69 2 36 and 0 93 mgfe l min respectively confirming that the obtained fe2 concentrations and oxidation rates during the application of electric current corresponded to that of a pseudo steady state samples for h2o2 measurement were collected every 1 2 or 5 min for fast medium and slow dosage respectively and processed according to the ghormley triiodide method after 0 45 μm filtration as turbid samples yield very high false readings the maximum observed value for h2o2 occurred during fast dosage reaching 1 07 mg l 53 7 μm at t 8 min while for the medium and slow dosage experiments the maximum was approximately at 0 25 0 05 mg l 13 9 μm as depicted in fig 9 during slow dosage a sudden drop of h2o2 concentration from 0 27 mg l to below detection was observed once the current was disconnected suggesting that the h2o2 conversion rate into intermediates fig 1 is much faster than the experimental measurement time this could imply that the actual h2o2 value inside of the beaker at the moment of sample extraction could be larger than the value actually measured 60s later this being an important limitation of the h2o2 measurement method it is unlikely however that h2o2 was responsible for disinfection since the required concentrations and exposure time for inactivation are orders of magnitude larger than the ones observed 21 however the production of h2o2 is a necessary intermediate step in the ros cascade mediating in the production of hydroxyl radicals and or ferryl ions the main disinfecting species related to fe ros as depicted in fig 1 4 discussion 4 1 inactivation of e coli and phage φx174 by fe2 oxidation role of ros electrochemically produced fe2 yielded significant inactivation in synthetic secondary effluent at ph 7 5 7 7 at room temperature 20 c under intensive mixing and aeration reaching 5 log10 for e coli at 100 mg l fe2 it was suggested that the oxidation of fe2 promotes the formation of bactericidal ros species 1 while fe3 is unable to do so given its already oxidized state 17 40 this hypothesis was tested by the introduction of the fenton inhibitor tempol in order to verify if the anoxic oxidation of fe2 into fe3 would lose its disinfection capacities as the quencher would theoretically accept the produced electron instead of the o2 preventing the ros formation 23 30 35 indeed the addition of tempol resulted in the almost complete inhibition of the inactivation of e coli underlining the value of dosing fe in its reduced state for phage φx174 electrochemically produced fe2 also resulted in inactivation but the net result was lower than for e coli 2 versus 5 log10 at 100 mg l fe2 a biphasic inactivation pattern was observed for φx174 with faster inactivation up to 10 20 mg l fe2 and slower inactivation between 20 and 100 mg l fe2 for the phage the quencher did reduce inactivation but to a considerably smaller extent than for e coli pointing towards an additional removal pathway other than ros such an alternative pathway was proposed by 18 who determined that un oxidized fe2 achieved measurable ms2 phage inactivation although it proved to be weak under aerobic conditions and relatively low fe2 concentrations as in our experiments 45 found that ms2 bacteriophages adsorb to the fe oxyhydroxide flocs due to their negative surface charge and 19 demonstrated that virus entrapment and inactivation take place during fe ec 12 and 13 proposed that phage inactivation was promoted by longer exposure time of the viruses to the ros which aligns with our findings for different fe ec dosing rates however in our experiments tempol did not fully shield phage φx174 from inactivation fig 6c and d since a decrease in plaque counts was observed even when ros were believed to be suppressed this points to either a separate simultaneous inactivation process or to marginal ros production due to o2 competition for fe2 that could not be sufficiently quenched by tempol 4 2 fe ec inactivation kinetics of phage φx174 and e coli inactivation of phage φx174 increased with apparent linearity with the fe ec dosage time the variation of the value k 0 094 to 0 140 min 1 is relatively small considering the 500 variation of the current intensity meaning that the inactivation rate is largely irresponsive to it with this we conclude that exposure time to oxidizing fe2 is the main driver in phage inactivation 3 ln n n 0 k n t where kn is a first order rate constant ranges from 0 094 to 0 140 min 1 derived from fig 7c t is the electrolysis time min phage φx174 inactivation was found to be dependent of time but not of the dosed fe the ln c co plot for e coli wr1 however clearly showed linearity towards the fe dose therefore the expression linking e coli wr1 inactivation to the dosed fe can be written as follows 4 ln n n 0 k fe dosed where k first order rate constant n concentration of e coli n0 starting concentration of e coli fedosed cumulative dosage of fe the data series obtained for fast medium and slow dosage had very similar slopes varying from 0 23 to 0 27 mgfe 1 with an average slope of 0 24 l mgfe 1 being therefore selected as the value k the fe dose can in turn be expressed as the product of fe dosing rate d fe dt and electrolysis time eq 5 hence 5 ln n n 0 0 24 d fe dt t based on faraday s equation s i eq 1 the term d fe dt can be obtained as follows 6 m fe i t m n f ɳ vol fe i t 55 85 g mol 1 v 2 96485 3 c mol 1 ɳ dt d fe dt i 2 90 x 10 4 g c 1 v ɳ where mfe mass of released fe g i intensity of the electric current a t time of electrolysis s m molar mass of the sacrificial anode metal fe 55 85

concentrations and time into mgfe and min respectively in eq 6 and substituting in eq 5 a simple expression can be obtained for the ln n no resulting in eq 7 7 ln n n 0 i t v η 4 08 l a min since both the assay volume and faradaic efficiency are assumed to be constant the obtained expression has the same structure as the well known chick watson equation 42 namely 8 ln n n 0 k cw c t in this expression kcw is a specific inactivation constant t is the exposure time to the disinfectant and c is the concentration of such disinfectant in our particular case the current intensity behaves as a pseudo disinfectant not because the electric current is producing inactivation but because the release of the disinfectant s precursor fe2 is directly proportional to the current intensity i applying a logarithmic base change 9 log 10 n n 0 i t v x η x 1 77 l a min this expression shows that for a given time min and sample volume l the logarithmic removal value of e coli wr1 is directly proportional to the current intensity a the adjustment coefficient 1 77 l a 1 min 1 is then a function of the environmental conditions ph do temperature etc to the best of our knowledge this expression is the first to link disinfection with electric current during fe ec 4 3 chemical or electrochemical fe2 when comparing inactivation results of cc with fe ec it may be concluded that the origin of the fe2 source did not play a significant role in disinfection it could be argued however that the final hydrolysis products and the floc formation process are different even though both experiments were conducted under identical test conditions ph temperature mixing intensity do the differences between chemical and electrochemical floc forming processes were extensively studied by harif et al 11 who concluded that the coagulation flocculation mechanisms using either coagulation method are similar yet not identical it was found that electrocoagulation produced more fragile and porous flocs which are easily compacted and restructured the high shear conditions in our experiments prevented the formation of macroscopic floc like structures 7 11 μm range s i table 2 producing what could best be described as fine dust sized particles the flocs however did not play a significant role in the elimination of e coli as the addition of tempol almost completely stopped inactivation for φx174 inactivation was less prominent and also less affected by tempol suggesting that another elimination process e g entrapment in flocs was also important this could differ between cc and fe ec however the potential contribution of differences in fe oh 3 floc structure on microbial entrapment was beyond the scope of this study what is apparent is that experiments using fe3 did not produce observable differences with the no treatment blank for either microbial indicator pointing out that fe3 or its particulates offered no measurable disinfection properties inactivation nor floc entrapment under these high shear conditions 5 conclusions in this study it was demonstrated that e coli wr1 and somatic coliphage φx174 are inactivated during fe2 oxidation irrespective of dosing fe chemically or electro chemically in control experiments with fe3 no inactivation was observed for either microbe ros quenching experiments with tempol confirmed that e coli inactivation 5 log10 is related to the production of fenton like intermediates ros during fe2 oxidation the observed e coli inactivation kinetics could be mathematically related to the fe2 oxidation rate which under aerobic conditions is also directly proportional to the fe ec current s intensity the inactivation process then follows a chick watson like expression in which the amperage behaves as a surrogate for the disinfectant s concentration phage φx174 removal inactivation 2 3 log10 could not be described in the same way as at higher fe dosages 10 mg l removal efficiency dropped rapidly also ros quencher

13004,electrochemical ferrous iron fe2 wastewater treatment is gaining momentum for treating municipal wastewater due to its decreasing costs environmental friendliness and capacity for removal of a wide range of contaminants disinfection by iron electrocoagulation fe ec has been occasionally reported in full scale industrial applications yet controversy remains regarding its underlying elimination mechanisms and kinetics in this study it was demonstrated that substantial inactivation can be achieved for escherichia coli wr1 5 log10 and somatic coliphage φx174 2 3 log10 electrochemically produced fe2 yielded similar inactivation as chemical fe2 reactive oxygen species ros quenching experiments with tempol confirmed that e coli inactivation was related to the production of fenton like intermediates during fe2 oxidation the observed e coli disinfection kinetics could be mathematically related to fe ec current intensity using a chick watson like expression in which the amperage is surrogate for the disinfectant s concentration we hereby show that it is possible to mathematically predict disinfection based on applied fe dosage and dosage speed phage φx174 inactivation could not be described in a similar way because at higher fe dosages 20 mg l little additional inactivation was observed also ros quencher tempol did not completely inhibit phage φx174 removal suggesting that additional pathways are relevant for its elimination graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrocoagulation disinfection reactive oxygen species tempol water reclamation 1 introduction globally agriculture is the largest water consumer worldwide however 3 2 billion people currently inhabit agricultural areas prone to shortages or severe scarcity 38 the use of treated municipal wastewater is a common practice particularly throughout asia where over 200 million farmers make use of raw or treated wastewater for the irrigation of over 2000 km2 of cropland 31 33 in these cases wastewater reuse can reduce the pressure on freshwater resources particularly in water stressed regions in which there can be extreme seasonal fluctuations in agricultural water availability however no matter how attractive municipal wastewater reclamation appears it is still a potential source of a wide range of enteric pathogens these include bacteria viruses protozoa and helminths as well as the emerging concern of antimicrobial resistant bacteria listed as a global health threat by who 9 hence the reuse of municipal effluents demands careful handling of the health risks associated with it these risks will depend on the concentration of pathogens in the treated effluent how the treated effluent will be used and the associated exposure routes and susceptibility of the users after exposure therefore the level of treatment pathogen inactivation for reclamation purposes depends on the particular reuse application and the likelihood and frequency of user exposure in this study we evaluated the disinfection 1 1 disinfection is the process of water treatment to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms elimination mechanisms are inactivation of the microorganism or physical removal of the microorganism from the water matrix capacity of the electrochemical process called iron electrocoagulation fe ec targeting its use as a municipal water reclamation technology and with a special focus on its kinetics fe ec is a process which releases fe2 ions into a water stream in order to induce coagulation as opposed to conventional fe chemical coagulation cc which is usually performed by dosing fecl3 or other fe3 salts fe ec produces the metallic coagulant on site by the electrochemical dissolution of fe or steel plates fe ec has been applied as a treatment for effluents from a wide variety of industries such as paper and pulp petrochemical textile dairy slaughterhouses manure metal plating and others 7 10 28 46 however its use for municipal wastewater applications has been marginal and mainly confined to academic research 1 16 24 25 44 disinfection by fe ec has been occasionally reported in full scale industrial applications yet its underlying inactivation mechanisms are still not clearly understood in general terms three major microbe removal inactivation mechanisms have been proposed for fe ec namely a sorption or entrapment of microbes to the flocculation products with subsequent removal by sedimentation 3 12 b inactivation due to the induced electric field between the plates 8 29 and c chemical inactivation due to reactive oxygen species ros 5 8 12 24 37 or due to the in situ formation of disinfectants and disinfectant by products 24 29 dixon stockwell 5 define ros as a general term that includes several partially reduced molecules containing oxygen such as superoxide o2 peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh they are an integral part in the semi fenton chemistry that takes place when fe ec is conducted under aerobic conditions which comprises the aerobic oxidation pathway of fe2 into fe3 and the cascade of intermediate species formed in the process fig 1 most of these species in particular the radicals have an extremely short half life in the range of 10 6 10 9 s for which their production and degradation can be considered instantaneous 34 in general terms disinfection by ros occurs due to oxidative damage to dna rna enzymes proteins cell membrane constituents and subsequent rupture viral capsids phospholipid envelopes or via the interruption of the respiratory pathway 4 20 41 ros disinfection capacity varies greatly among the different ros species while superoxide and hydrogen peroxide are considered the weakest ros compounds as hydroxyl radicals are considered the most potent hence during fe ec and cc there may be different pathways for inactivation or removal of pathogenic micro organisms at play however to utilize fe coagulation as a disinfection method it is critical to differentiate between these pathways as they require different operational conditions the objective of this study was therefore to isolate the contribution of inactivation by ros formed during fe2 oxidation from other removal pathways such as floc sorption and entrapment as this differentiation is generally lacking in electrocoagulation literature the contribution of ros mediated inactivation was therefore assessed for both a bacterial and a viral enteric indicator organism namely escherichia coli wr1 and somatic coliphage φx174 respectively for this purpose a series of experiments with both chemical and electro chemical dosing of fe2 were conducted either in presence or absence of the fenton inhibitor tempol 14 in this study a differentiation was made between continuous and single spike dosage as it is hypothesized that continuous generation of ros might be beneficial for the disinfection capacity of the fe ec system in addition the dosage rate was assessed to develop a ros inactivation kinetics model for fe ec 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory setup and experimental design experiments were conducted using fe ec and or cc as sources of fe fig 2 all experiments were performed in 2 l cylindrical glass beakers mounted on identical labnico l23 magnetic stirrers and fitted with ptfe coated bars for stirring purposes during all experiments air was supplied continuously using an oase oxymax200 air pump and dissolved oxygen do levels were monitored continuously in order to maintain saturation in the test water depending on the experiment chemical dosing was performed either by spiking the dosage weighing and directly dosing fe salts into the reaction beaker or by continuously adding dosing solutions using a watson marlow 120 u peristaltic pump fecl2 and fecl3 reagent grade salts were supplied by sigma aldrich germany the fe ec setup included a 30 v 3 a tenma 72 10 500 bench dc power supply connected with crocodile clip cables to two s235 steel plates maximum percentages 0 14 carbon 0 10 silicium 0 80 manganese 0 025 phosphorous 0 015 sulphur 0 010 nitrogen 0 20 copper and 0 080 aluminum dimensions of the steel plates were 6 cm 4 cm of which 4 cm 4 cm were submerged 2 cm remained above the test water to connect the clip cables the plates were polished with coarse and fine sand paper before each use and mounted to the end of a plastic tube with carved parallel slots ensuring the plates remained parallel and spaced approximately 1 cm as described elsewhere 1 2 12 26 29 during each individual experiment only two process control parameters were adjusted namely electrical current amperage and electrolysis time these parameter combinations were selected beforehand for each experiment in order to produce a dose of 50 mgfe l under different speeds namely 5 0 2 5 and 1 0 mgfe l min as oxidation kinetics are relevant for this research the maximum fe dosage rate 5 0 mgfe l min was selected based on the capacity of the power supply not to reach exceed its maximum voltage 30 v since experiments were conducted at room temperature the need to minimize spontaneous inactivation of e coli limited the duration of the experiments which in turn defined the lower fe dosage rate 1 0 mgfe l min an intermediate fe dosage speed 2 5 mgfe l min was added as a third dataset four groups of experiments were performed in order to determine the role of oxidizing fe2 in ros mediated disinfection fig 3 and the kinetics involved for all experiments synthetic water containing a buffer solution and indicator microbes was prepared described in section 2 2 the contribution of ros mediated disinfection was assessed in two ways namely 1 comparing inactivation by fe2 or fe3 and 2 ros quenching while dosing fe2 fecl2 see 2 4 to determine whether the source of fe had any impact on ros mediated disinfection a third group of experiments compared microbial inactivation using cc or fe ec as the fe2 source including ros quenching for each case lastly fe ec disinfection kinetics were studied by operating the system at different dosage rates additional information can be found in s i table 1 for all experiments the stirring speed was set to 200 rpm which induced intense mixing and turbulence and prevented the formation of macroscopic flocs samples were collected immediately after the fe dosing was stopped while the stirring was still on in order to avoid any sedimentation collected samples were used immediately for microbiological and physical chemical characterization 2 2 synthetic water matrix for all experiments the synthetic water matrix was either 0 02 m or 0 04 m tris hcl buffer hoch₂ ₃cnh₂ s i table 1 selected by its capacity to buffer at a ph of approximately 7 5 7 7 similar to that of municipal secondary effluents its absence of fe or ros scavengers such as po4 3 co3 2 ca2 and its moderate conductivity avoiding the addition of electrolytes for fe ec 2 3 microbial spike preparation two non pathogenic organisms were used to spike the synthetic effluents namely e coli wr1 nctc 13167 and somatic coliphage φx174 atcc 13706 b1 a bacterial and viral indicator respectively as previously used in 2 e coli wr1 frozen stock was thawed and grown in tygb broth tryptone yeast extract glucose broth for 3 h at 37 c to concentrations of 1 108 cfu ml then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm during 10 min the obtained pellet was re suspended in pbs ph 7 2 to a concentration of 1 109 cfu ml stored at 4 c and used within 24 h phage φx174 was propagated following the iso 10705 2 2000 method water quality detection and enumeration of bacteriophages part 2 enumeration of somatic coliphages to concentrations of approximately 1 109 pfu ml e coli wr1 and phage φx174 were dosed into the test liquid to initial concentrations of 1 105 cfu ml and 1 104 pfu ml respectively 2 4 tempol as quencher for fe2 mediated ros in order to inhibit the disinfection by ros produced following the aerobic oxidation of fe2 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidin 1 oxyl also known as 4 hydroxy tempo or tempol was selected as ros quencher tempol is the most studied of the nitroxides mainly due to its low molecular weight and high cell permeability 43 its most remarkable properties include the superoxide catalysis the catalytic destruction of h2o2 by catalase like reactions and the hindering of toxic hydroxyl radical production the reaction between tempol and fe2 cations was described by 27 1 r r no fe 2 r r noh fe 3 in this reaction the nitroxide indicated by the reducible functional group no reacts on a 1 1 m ratio with fe2 to produce the oxidized oxoammonium noh and fe3 in this way nitroxides accept the electrons from reduced fe complexes therefore outcompeting oxygen and thus preventing the production of oxygenated radicals this equimolar reaction between fe2 and tempol was instrumental during ros quenching experiments later described in this publication during these experiments reagent grade tempol sigma aldrich germany was weighed added directly and diluted into the synthetic water before any addition of fe 2 5 analytical methods e coli screening and quantification was performed by membrane filtration according to apha standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 23rd edition samples were filtered in 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane filters and placed on chromocult coliform agar merck selective media in which e coli wr1 yields distinct purple colonies and incubated at 37 c for 24 h screening of somatic coliphages was performed by pour plate technique following iso 10705 2 2000 total fe was measured with spectroquant iron cell test 1 50 mgfe l using a spectroquant nova60 merck germany photometer while fe2 was measured with hach lck 320 fe test kits 0 2 6 mgfe l hydrogen peroxide measurements were conducted following the ghormley triiodide method 6 with filtered samples 0 45 μm using a genesys 10s uv vis thermo scientific at 350 nm wavelength all samples analyzed for h2o2 were processed within 60 s of extraction for fe ec experiments free chlorine tests were conducted in filtered samples using the dpd method spectroquant supelco in order to rule out the production of cl2 compounds that could account for unwanted disinfection 2 6 data analysis a reduction in the concentration of the microorganisms is expressed as log removal values since this term is widely used but here referred to as either removal or inactivation based on the involved elimination mechanism comparison between data series of somatic coliphage φx174 or e coli concentrations in synthetic effluents under different conditions was performed using spearman s rank order correlation which calculates rank correlation coefficient rs and p value rs determines the strength of the correlation between two datasets rs 0 9 indicates very strong correlation the p value determines the likelihood of two data series to be co relatable by mere chance p value 0 05 shows a strong correlation beyond chance between data sets spearman was preferred over pearson s correlation due to the monotonic behavior of most plots to be correlated section 3 3 results 3 1 inactivation by fe2 or fe3 experiments comparing e coli wr1 and somatic coliphage φx174 inactivation by varying dosages of either fe2 or fe3 are depicted in fig 4 no significant difference in terms of floc characteristics were observed after 1 h of continuous stirring for samples dosed with either fecl2 or fecl3 s i fig 4 for both selected microbial indicators inactivation using fecl3 fe3 was negligible across all assayed dosages yet the response towards fecl2 fe2 was considerably different e coli inactivation increased with increasing fe2 dosage with an approximate 0 05 log10 per mg fe l dosed at the maximum dosage of 100 mg fe l e coli inactivation approached 5 log10 the inactivation of φx174 showed a biphasic pattern up to 10 20 mg fe2 l inactivation was more rapid close to 1 5 log10 which was similar to e coli while at higher fe2 concentrations inactivation levelled off reaching approximately 2 5 log10 at 100 mg fe l all retrieved samples dosed with fecl2 showed full fe2 oxidation after 1 h of stirring fe2 below limit of detection lod though given the relatively high ph and do it is likely that this condition had been achieved within minutes it may be concluded that under intense mixing to prevent sedimentation and aerobic conditions dosage of fe2 demonstrated to have considerable inactivation properties that were not observed for fe3 under identical conditions this indicates that the oxidation of fe2 itself and potentially the production of intermediate ros plays a critical role in fe based disinfection 3 2 ros quenching to investigate the contribution of ros to e coli and φx174 inactivation during fe2 oxidation fe2 was dosed chemically with and without the presence of an equimolar amount of the ros quencher tempol tempol counteracted the bactericidal properties of oxidizing fe2 for e coli with under 1 log10 inactivation at all dosages s i fig 1 according to eq 1 the interaction between tempol and fe2 should lead to oxidation of the latter into fe3 without o2 acting an as electron acceptor avoiding the formation of the superoxide radical and thus halting the ros cascade all samples with and without tempol showed full fe oxidation after 1 h of stirring fe2 below lod inactivation of e coli and phage φx174 under a dose of 50 mgfe l is displayed in fig 5 the complete dosage series is presented in s i fig 1 for both indicators beakers in which only tempol was dosed showed almost identical microbial concentrations as the blank negligible inactivation confirming that the quencher itself did not exhibit inactivation properties e coli inactivation reached approximately 3 log10 when the reaction was not quenched dropping to 0 5 log10 with tempol added these results indicate that the observed inactivation during fe2 oxidation was related to the formation of reactive intermediates and that this inactivation pathway could be almost completely suppressed by the addition of the fenton inhibitor tempol this also indicates that the primary elimination process was inactivation rather than entrapment in flocs phage φx174 demonstrated a similar inactivation as e coli under the presence of fe2 2 8 log10 without tempol while inactivation was still significant after the addition of tempol 1 5 log10 the observation that φx174 disinfection in the presence of tempol is not fully suppressed suggests the contribution of an elimination mechanism other than ros such as entrapment in flocs no production of cl2 based compounds 0 01 mg l total cl2 was detected during these or any of the experiments described in this publication hence this inactivation mechanism was ruled out 3 3 cc versus fe ec to determine the impact of the source of fe2 in inactivation experiments using an identical and constant fe supply rate 1 0 mgfe l min were conducted either by cc or fe ec for e coli wr1 almost identical inactivation was obtained whether the fe source was either chemical fecl2 or electrochemical fig 6a this indicated that the source of fe2 was irrelevant for inactivation as long as the produced fe2 dosage was similar spearman s rank correlation test between averaged data sets determined rs 1 with a p value of 0 001 for both cc and fe ec the fe was dosed in a constant manner instead of in a single spike as instant dosing is not possible with fe ec when comparing fe2 continuous dosing fig 6 a c against instant dosing figs 4 and 5 for inactivation of e coli it is apparent that for constant dosing the same maximum inactivation is achieved after dosing only half the fe dose 50 mgfe l than for the single spike experiments 100 mgfe l for phage φx174 experiments with non quenched fe2 also produced similar inactivation results whether the fe source was chemical fecl2 or electrochemical as depicted in fig 6c this indicated that the source of fe2 is also irrelevant for phage φx174 inactivation as long as the produced fe dosage is similar spearman rs 0 97 p value 0 001 regarding the performance of continuous fe dosing compared to a single spike figs 4 and 5 50 mgfe l continuous dosage yielded similar inactivation of φx174 as a single spike dose 2 log10 inactivation for experiments involving quenched fe2 dosage with added tempol inactivation datasets coming from the e coli experiments with chemical and electrochemical sources still show a statistically strong correlation spearman rs 0 86 p value 0 05 but inactivation is in either case almost completely mitigated under the presence of tempol fig 6b inactivation was 1 log10 at the maximum fe dosage 50 mgfe l data for φx174 experiments involving quenched fe2 dosage fig 6d on chemical versus electrochemical sources again showed a statistically strong correlation spearman rs 0 93 p value 0 02 however as opposed to the strong reduction of the inactivation rate observed for e coli fig 6b versus 6a addition of tempol yielded only a small reduction of the inactivation rate for either of the fe sources fig 6d versus 6c altogether these results conclusively show that irrespective of the type of assay quenched non quenched or the type of microbial indicator there is no statistical difference between inactivation induced by fe2 coming from either cc or fe ec this implies that during fe ec the contribution of electrolysis specific inactivation pathways due to electric fields or to cl2 formation was negligible 3 4 fe ec inactivation kinetics in order to investigate fe ec inactivation kinetics experiments were conducted with three different dosing rates namely 5 0 2 5 and 1 0 mgfe l min fast medium and slow dosage respectively for each of these settings the fe supply was stopped once the cumulative dosage reached 50 mgfe l in order to produce the same end concentration for e coli wr1 the faster the fe dosage the higher the inactivation rate interestingly inactivation stopped abruptly once the electric charge was interrupted which means that the inactivation produced during the fe ec stage offered no residual effect once the current ceased s i fig 2 this implies that disinfectants produced during the supply of fe2 were extremely short lived the plot ln c co versus electrolysis time fig 7a shows a good correlation between the averaged datasets and linear trendlines with the slope being the inactivation rate in which the ratios between the inactivation rates 5 2 3 0 1 0 are similar to the ratios of the current intensity and of fe production speed 5 0 2 5 1 0 when plotted against the fe dosage fig 7b there is an overlap between the ln c co plots indicating that inactivation is directly proportional to the dosed fe for all dosage speeds for phage φx174 results showed different inactivation kinetics than e coli the inactivation rate the slope in fig 7c appeared numerically comparable for all experiments this means that the inactivation rate progressed similarly irrespective of dosing speed as long as the electric current was being applied yet was independent of the magnitude of such current instead of proportional as for e coli since each configuration delivered different amounts of fe per unit time shorter fe dosage times faster dosage speeds yielded less total inactivation than slower dosages as depicted in fig 7d for 50 mgfe l the slow dosage speed 1 0 mgfe l min produced 4 7 ln inactivation 1 8 log10 whereas the fast dosage speed 5 0 mgfe l min reached only 1 2 ln 0 7 log10 the averaged ln c co diagrams for each different charge speed condition show sufficient linearity as to assume a linear regression to provide an adequate fit even though the r2 values were somewhat lower than those obtained for e coli for all cases the decrease in the concentration of phage φx174 ceased abruptly once the electric current supply was interrupted as was the case with e coli once again suggesting that fe ec produced no residual disinfection and that the disinfectants produced were extremely short lived s i fig 3 3 5 fe speciation and h2o2 measurements during the fe ec inactivation kinetics experiments screening of fe2 and fe3 was performed to verify that the conversion of fe2 into fe3 was a steady state process h2o2 screening was performed simultaneously to confirm the onset of the ros cascade fe screening fig 8 showed for all cases a very stable and relatively low fe2 concentration being established and measured during electrolysis simultaneous with a stable fe3 production since fe is electrochemically dosed as fe2 22 and fe3 is produced at a steady rate this means that fe2 is readily converted to fe3 this was expected due to relatively high ph 7 4 7 7 and dissolved oxygen close to saturation 7 5 mgo2 l once the current was interrupted an abrupt drop in the fe2 concentration was observed readily stabilizing at 1 mgfe l for the remainder of the screening it is important to note that in all cases inactivation only occurred during the time in which fe2 was being steadily supplied and steadily oxidized and halted abruptly once fe2 stopped being supplied hence stopped being oxidized for all experiments faradaic efficiency of the fe ec was determined 95 96 based on the measured fe2 plateau ph and dissolved oxygen concentrations during fe ec theoretical fe2 oxidation rates or fe3 production were calculated following the methodology proposed by stumm lee 36 expressed in eq 2 calculations are detailed in s i table 3 2 d fe 2 d t k fe 2 p o 2 oh 2 where k is the kinetic constant 1 5 0 5 1013 l2mol 2atm 1min 1 fe2 is the molar concentration of the fe present in the fe2 form po2 is the partial pressure of oxygen atm oh is the molarity of the oh ion theoretical versus observed oxidation rates are displayed in table 1 these theoretical fe2 oxidation values are numerically very similar to the measured production rate of fe3 in each case 4 69 2 36 and 0 93 mgfe l min respectively confirming that the obtained fe2 concentrations and oxidation rates during the application of electric current corresponded to that of a pseudo steady state samples for h2o2 measurement were collected every 1 2 or 5 min for fast medium and slow dosage respectively and processed according to the ghormley triiodide method after 0 45 μm filtration as turbid samples yield very high false readings the maximum observed value for h2o2 occurred during fast dosage reaching 1 07 mg l 53 7 μm at t 8 min while for the medium and slow dosage experiments the maximum was approximately at 0 25 0 05 mg l 13 9 μm as depicted in fig 9 during slow dosage a sudden drop of h2o2 concentration from 0 27 mg l to below detection was observed once the current was disconnected suggesting that the h2o2 conversion rate into intermediates fig 1 is much faster than the experimental measurement time this could imply that the actual h2o2 value inside of the beaker at the moment of sample extraction could be larger than the value actually measured 60s later this being an important limitation of the h2o2 measurement method it is unlikely however that h2o2 was responsible for disinfection since the required concentrations and exposure time for inactivation are orders of magnitude larger than the ones observed 21 however the production of h2o2 is a necessary intermediate step in the ros cascade mediating in the production of hydroxyl radicals and or ferryl ions the main disinfecting species related to fe ros as depicted in fig 1 4 discussion 4 1 inactivation of e coli and phage φx174 by fe2 oxidation role of ros electrochemically produced fe2 yielded significant inactivation in synthetic secondary effluent at ph 7 5 7 7 at room temperature 20 c under intensive mixing and aeration reaching 5 log10 for e coli at 100 mg l fe2 it was suggested that the oxidation of fe2 promotes the formation of bactericidal ros species 1 while fe3 is unable to do so given its already oxidized state 17 40 this hypothesis was tested by the introduction of the fenton inhibitor tempol in order to verify if the anoxic oxidation of fe2 into fe3 would lose its disinfection capacities as the quencher would theoretically accept the produced electron instead of the o2 preventing the ros formation 23 30 35 indeed the addition of tempol resulted in the almost complete inhibition of the inactivation of e coli underlining the value of dosing fe in its reduced state for phage φx174 electrochemically produced fe2 also resulted in inactivation but the net result was lower than for e coli 2 versus 5 log10 at 100 mg l fe2 a biphasic inactivation pattern was observed for φx174 with faster inactivation up to 10 20 mg l fe2 and slower inactivation between 20 and 100 mg l fe2 for the phage the quencher did reduce inactivation but to a considerably smaller extent than for e coli pointing towards an additional removal pathway other than ros such an alternative pathway was proposed by 18 who determined that un oxidized fe2 achieved measurable ms2 phage inactivation although it proved to be weak under aerobic conditions and relatively low fe2 concentrations as in our experiments 45 found that ms2 bacteriophages adsorb to the fe oxyhydroxide flocs due to their negative surface charge and 19 demonstrated that virus entrapment and inactivation take place during fe ec 12 and 13 proposed that phage inactivation was promoted by longer exposure time of the viruses to the ros which aligns with our findings for different fe ec dosing rates however in our experiments tempol did not fully shield phage φx174 from inactivation fig 6c and d since a decrease in plaque counts was observed even when ros were believed to be suppressed this points to either a separate simultaneous inactivation process or to marginal ros production due to o2 competition for fe2 that could not be sufficiently quenched by tempol 4 2 fe ec inactivation kinetics of phage φx174 and e coli inactivation of phage φx174 increased with apparent linearity with the fe ec dosage time the variation of the value k 0 094 to 0 140 min 1 is relatively small considering the 500 variation of the current intensity meaning that the inactivation rate is largely irresponsive to it with this we conclude that exposure time to oxidizing fe2 is the main driver in phage inactivation 3 ln n n 0 k n t where kn is a first order rate constant ranges from 0 094 to 0 140 min 1 derived from fig 7c t is the electrolysis time min phage φx174 inactivation was found to be dependent of time but not of the dosed fe the ln c co plot for e coli wr1 however clearly showed linearity towards the fe dose therefore the expression linking e coli wr1 inactivation to the dosed fe can be written as follows 4 ln n n 0 k fe dosed where k first order rate constant n concentration of e coli n0 starting concentration of e coli fedosed cumulative dosage of fe the data series obtained for fast medium and slow dosage had very similar slopes varying from 0 23 to 0 27 mgfe 1 with an average slope of 0 24 l mgfe 1 being therefore selected as the value k the fe dose can in turn be expressed as the product of fe dosing rate d fe dt and electrolysis time eq 5 hence 5 ln n n 0 0 24 d fe dt t based on faraday s equation s i eq 1 the term d fe dt can be obtained as follows 6 m fe i t m n f ɳ vol fe i t 55 85 g mol 1 v 2

concentrations and time into mgfe and min respectively in eq 6 and substituting in eq 5 a simple expression can be obtained for the ln n no resulting in eq 7 7 ln n n 0 i t v η 4 08 l a min since both the assay volume and faradaic efficiency are assumed to be constant the obtained expression has the same structure as the well known chick watson equation 42 namely 8 ln n n 0 k cw c t in this expression kcw is a specific inactivation constant t is the exposure time to the disinfectant and c is the concentration of such disinfectant in our particular case the current intensity behaves as a pseudo disinfectant not because the electric current is producing inactivation but because the release of the disinfectant s precursor fe2 is directly proportional to the current intensity i applying a logarithmic base change 9 log 10 n n 0 i t v x η x 1 77 l a min this expression shows that for a given time min and sample volume l the logarithmic removal value of e coli wr1 is directly proportional to the current intensity a the adjustment coefficient 1 77 l a 1 min 1 is then a function of the environmental conditions ph do temperature etc to the best of our knowledge this expression is the first to link disinfection with electric current during fe ec 4 3 chemical or electrochemical fe2 when comparing inactivation results of cc with fe ec it may be concluded that the origin of the fe2 source did not play a significant role in disinfection it could be argued however that the final hydrolysis products and the floc formation process are different even though both experiments were conducted under identical test conditions ph temperature mixing intensity do the differences between chemical and electrochemical floc forming processes were extensively studied by harif et al 11 who concluded that the coagulation flocculation mechanisms using either coagulation method are similar yet not identical it was found that electrocoagulation produced more fragile and porous flocs which are easily compacted and restructured the high shear conditions in our experiments prevented the formation of macroscopic floc like structures 7 11 μm range s i table 2 producing what could best be described as fine dust sized particles the flocs however did not play a significant role in the elimination of e coli as the addition of tempol almost completely stopped inactivation for φx174 inactivation was less prominent and also less affected by tempol suggesting that another elimination process e g entrapment in flocs was also important this could differ between cc and fe ec however the potential contribution of differences in fe oh 3 floc structure on microbial entrapment was beyond the scope of this study what is apparent is that experiments using fe3 did not produce observable differences with the no treatment blank for either microbial indicator pointing out that fe3 or its particulates offered no measurable disinfection properties inactivation nor floc entrapment under these high shear conditions 5 conclusions in this study it was demonstrated that e coli wr1 and somatic coliphage φx174 are inactivated during fe2 oxidation irrespective of dosing fe chemically or electro chemically in control experiments with fe3 no inactivation was observed for either microbe ros quenching experiments with tempol confirmed that e coli inactivation 5 log10 is related to the production of fenton like intermediates ros during fe2 oxidation the observed e coli inactivation kinetics could be mathematically related to the fe2 oxidation rate which under aerobic conditions is also directly proportional to the fe ec current s intensity the inactivation process then follows a chick watson like expression in which the amperage behaves as a surrogate for the disinfectant s concentration phage φx174 removal inactivation 2 3 log10 could not be described in the same way as at higher fe dosages 10 mg l removal efficiency dropped rapidly also ros quencher tempol did not completely inhibit phage φx174 inactivation suggesting that additional pathways are relevant for virus removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
