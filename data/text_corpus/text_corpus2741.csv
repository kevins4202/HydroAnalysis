13705,grit removal is an important step in a municipal wastewater treatment plant to remove fine particles from wastewater one of the prominent technologies for grit removal is an aerated grit tank agt which uses air diffusers to create spiral flow that allows heavier particles to accelerate and settle to the bottom of the tank the performance of an agt largely depends on induced flow patterns and hydrodynamic forces the current study investigated an industrial scale agt using computational fluid dynamics modelling and simulations for the simulated tank industrial trials were conducted to measure grit quantity and particle size distribution in the influent and effluent of the tank the measured data were used to validate the cfd model and then the validated model was used to investigate the effect operating conditions and modifications in tank geometry on flow patterns and grit capture efficiency the objective of this parametric investigation was aimed to improve grit removal efficiency of the simulated agt the predictions suggested only 6 6 change in the grit capture efficiency of the tank when air flowrate was either increased by 50 from the current setpoint 230 nm3 hr simulation of a peak wet weather wastewater flowrate 986 l s resulted in 50 drop in grit capture compared to dry weather wastewater flowrate 460 l s among the simulated tank modifications to improve grit removal during peak wet weather events increase in tank length and width did not provide significant improvement however modification in tank base by relocating the screw conveyor recess from its current position midway along the width of the tank to a location adjacent to the wall resulted in 34 increase in the capture efficiency of smaller particles in a size range of 100 150 μm keywords

plant 1 introduction the removal of grit is a critical step in a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp grit generally refers to inorganic solids such as sand gravel and cinders with little to no putrescible organic matter in typical municipal wastewater grit is also present in the form of non putrescent organic matter such as eggshells bone chips seeds and coffee grounds 1 if not removed grit particles settle in downstream pipes channels and process tanks and also cause the abrasion of mechanical equipment within the plant in a municipal wastewater plant grit is typically removed at the headworks of a municipal wastewater treatment plant following the inlet screens and preceding primary clarification for grit removal different technologies such as vortex type systems hydrocyclones detritus tanks and velocity controlled channels are currently being used one of these technologies is an aerated grit tank agt which has been investigated in the current study a typical agt fig 1 is an oblong tank with a conical bottom wastewater enters at one end of the tank flows along the length and leaves the tank through an overflow weir at the other end the tank is connected to a blower which supplies air to submerged diffusers along one side of the tank these diffusers run longitudinally along the tank length and the flow of air through them generates spiral flow of wastewater this spiral flow allows heavier grit particles to settle to the bottom the tank whilst the lighter organic particles remain in suspension in the wastewater 2 grit particles which settle to the bottom of the tank are collected in a sump and removed by different arrangements at the bottom such as screw conveyors bucket conveyors and grab buckets these systems remove grit slurry from the tank which is washed to remove organic matter and dewatered to remove excess water 3 the operation of an agt is complex due to seasonal fluctuation in wastewater quantity and grit concentration the wastewater flowrate in wet weather is usually an order of magnitude higher than in dry weather real time monitoring of grit capture efficiency is usually not feasible requiring plant operators to undertake onerous sampling investigations to quantify the capture efficiency these field sampling investigations can be undertaken to characterise the grit concentration in the influent and effluent and use this data to determine particle size distribution and grit removal efficiency 4 such sampling investigations are difficult to perform and are challenging to sequence to coincide with peak wet weather flow into the plant the fluctuation in wastewater flowrate creates challenges for plant operators in understanding how grit capture efficiency is affected by both wastewater influent and diffused air flow rates optimum use of blowers is extremely critical to energy efficiency and grit capture efficiency of an agt the sizing of agts has traditionally relied on design guidelines experience of operators and manufacturer s recommendations 5 an example of these typical design guidelines and their comparison against the agt tank considered in the current study is summarized in table 1 it was observed that there are differences and contradictions between the various guidelines though the dimensions of the agt tank considered in the current study is generally within the suggested range for most criteria londong 6 conducted pilot scale experiments in order to provide sizing principles related to geometry of the tank and air flow to the diffusers the principles aimed to achieve specific low velocities at the bottom of the tank that allow grit particles to settle but ensure that the velocity was high enough to avoid settling of organic material in the wastewater londong s study found that a velocity of 0 20 m s in the bottom of the tank achieved high capture of heavier grit particles and low settling of organic material londong s experiments and sizing principles influenced some of the recommendations in the widely used water environment federation manual of practice 2 sawicki 7 developed a simplified two dimensional model of the flow field that ignored the longitudinal dimension as the discharge through the tank was deemed insignificant compared to the transverse circulation this allowed the two dimensional multiphase flow to be approximated using the poisson equation munoz and young 8 noted that sawicki s approach was theoretical in nature and lacked explanation of how to solve the poisson s equation munoz and young 8 proposed a means using mathcad to numerically integrate the poisson s equation to predict the velocity field in the chamber this provided a quick way of modelling the aerated grit tank recognizing that three dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling is more suitable for the complex multiphase flow cfd has been used in several previous studies to investigate the flow patterns and performance of different types of grit removal tank a few prominent cfd studies on grit removal tanks are summarized in table 2 in these studies water air multiphase flow in a grit removal tank was modelled using either the eulerian eulerian ee approach or volume of fluid vof approach the ee approach represents both water and air phases as interpenetrating continua whereas the vof approach tracks the interface between the two phases interface tracking by the vof approach requires very fine grid near the interface particularly at the top liquid surface in the tank and interface of diffusing gas bubbles the requirement fine grid by the vof approach makes this approach computationally very intensive for simulations of industrial scale grit removal tanks on the other hand the ee approach can resolve key flow patterns of water air multiphase flow in a grit removal tank and is also computationally less intensive several previous studies table 2 have ignored the solid phase grit whereas several others have used discrete particle modelling dpm approach to model the flow of the solid phase in the dpm approach the movement of each particle is tracked by solving force balance equation for each particle the dpm approach is computationally feasible for low concentration of solids in the flow previous studies table 2 have used different types of turbulent model to investigate the flow of water literature review suggests that the design and operation of an agt is significantly challenging on account of seasonal variation in wastewater quantity and grit concentration industrial practices for agts mostly rely on empirical data and operator s experience without fundamental insight into multiphase hydrodynamics further there are a limited number of cfd studies on agts in literature and cfd studies on agts or settling tanks have used different modelling approaches and closure models there has been no consensus among previous studies on the selection of turbulent model and boundary conditions in the current study cfd simulations of an industrial agt tank which is a part of a major wwtp in north eastern usa were conducted the cfd model considered 3d flow domain and resolved the flow of air water and suspended grit particles in the flow domain in the current study the ee approach was used for the flow of wastewater and air whereas the dpm was used for the particulate phase the model was validated against plant data on grit capture efficiency and then the validated model was used to investigate the effect of operating parameters such as water flowrate and air flowrate on the flow pattern and particle capture efficiency furthermore simulations were also conducted to investigate the effect design modifications of the agt on grit capture efficiency at wet weather wastewater flowrate before conducting the parametric study the effect of turbulent models on model predictions were also investigated the primary objective was to develop a cfd model for an industrial scale agt and provide predictions over a wide range of operating conditions such predictions will be useful in operation of agts and design of such tanks in future 2 cfd model 2 1 multiphase model the flow in the agt is a multiphase flow of air wastewater and suspended grit particles in the current study the flow of air and wastewater was modelled by using the ee approach and particles were resolved as discrete particles using the lagrangian approach known as dpm in the ee approach both air and wastewater phases were considered as interpenetrating continua the wastewater phase was considered as a primary phase and air phase became a secondary phase for each phase mass and momentum balance equations were solved the momentum equations of both the phases were coupled by an interface drag force for the drag force several different drag models are available in the literature in the current study the drag model of schiller and naumann 21 was selected based on previous cfd studies on aeration tanks 22 the flow in the tank is anticipated as highly turbulent and rotational due to the sparging of air to capture turbulent condition k ω shear stress transport sst turbulent model was selected the selection of the turbulent model was based on the investigation of the effect of three turbulent models such as k ε model k ε renormalized group rng and k ω sst model on flow predictions the governing equations and constitutive equations for the water air ee model are summarised in appendix i the particulate phase was modelled as a lagrangian phase for which force balance over each particle was solved one way coupling between the primary phase and particulate phase was modelled by using the spherical drag model the one way coupling approach ignores the effect of particles on the primary continuous phase and interparticle interactions such assumptions can be justified in the current study as the concentration of the particulate phase in the tank is very low less than 0 01 the equations for the particulate phase are also included in appendix i 2 2 geometry and meshing the simulated geometry of an agt with major dimensions is shown in fig 2 and the geometry with dimensions different parts is shown in appendix ii wastewater enters the upstream end of the tank through a rectangular opening in the wall and leaves the tank over a rectangular weir at the downstream end this weir maintains a minimum water level in the tank diffuser pipes are located on one side of the tank a multi stage blower provides air to the diffusers running the length of the tank is a screw conveyor recess sump where a spiral screw conveyor is located at the lowest point of the floor note that the screw conveyor arrangement was not included in the simulated geometry the flow domain of the tank is discretised by using hexahedral structured mesh as shown in fig 2 b 2 3 numerical parameters a 3d transient simulations were conducted to predict velocity fields of the continuous phases ansys fluent was used to carry out the simulations the phase coupled simple pressure velocity coupling method was used and the green gauss node based gradient evaluation method was implemented for gradients 23 a the presto pressure method was used for the pressure discretisation scheme second order upwind discretization scheme was used for the equations for mass and momentum balance turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent energy dissipation rate based on recommendation by wicklein et al 24 the effect of gravity was also included the transient simulations with a time step size of 0 005 s were run for total physical time of 100 s a maximum of 20 iterations was completed for every time step the convergence criteria of a residual error below 10 3 was adopted for all residuals after 100 s all residuals dropped below 10 4 for all simulations performed 2 4 boundary conditions wastewater inlet was modelled as a velocity inlet for which the velocity was calculated by 1 u q w h w h i where u is the velocity in the channel q is the volumetric flow rate w is the channel width h w is the elevation of water in the tank plant datum and h i is the invert level of the channel turbulence was specified at the velocity inlet by defining hydraulic diameter and turbulence intensity 2 d h 4 a c r o s s s e c t i o n l w e t t e d 3 r e ρ u d h μ 4 i 0 16 r e 1 8 where d h is the hydraulic diameter re is the reynolds number ρ is the density of the fluid and v is the velocity the overflow weir was modelled as a pressure outlet maintained at atmospheric pressure turbulence at the pressure outlet was also specified using the hydraulic diameter and turbulence intensity the backflow volume fraction for the air phase was set to zero air enters the simulated agt through the simplified 100 mm wide diffuser face which was represented as a velocity inlet turbulence was specified at the velocity inlet using the hydraulic diameter and turbulence intensity the volume fraction at this velocity inlet was set to 0 for wastewater and 1 for air the downstream end of the simulated agt has a sharp crested weir which controls the wastewater level in the tank the discharge equation for the sharp crested weir can be given by eq 5 25 5 q 2 3 c 2 g d 1 δ z 3 l where q is the flow over the weir c is the weir discharge coefficient d 1 is the upstream water depth δ z is the crest height above channel bed and l is the length of the weir the weir discharge coefficient is expressed by eq 6 26 6 c 0 602 0 075 d 1 δ z δ z the agt consists of an open topped tank with a free liquid surface a degassing boundary condition was selected to represent the liquid surface of the tank the degassing boundary condition is used to model a free surface through which only dispersed gas bubbles are allowed to escape whilst the continuous liquid phases see the boundary as a free slip wall 23 b the use of the ee multiphase model with a degassing boundary was used by several previous studies for modelling aeration tanks with free liquid surfaces 22 27 31 side walls of the tank were modelled using no slip wall conditions 2 5 simulation plan total 19 simulations were performed in the current study as listed in table 3 initially simulations were conducted to investigate the effect of mesh size simulations no 1 3 and turbulent models simulations no 4 6 these simulations were performed only for the flow of air and water phases in the flow domain and aimed to provide the selection of critical modelling parameters consequently a simulation was conducted with third particulate phase for model validation simulation 7 after model validation three phase simulations were performed to investigate the effect of water flowrate simulations 8 10 and air flowrate simulations no 11 15 on flow patterns and grit capture efficiency finally simulations no 16 19 were conducted to investigate the effect of modifications in the tank geometry operating wastewater flowrates were determined based on the current plant operation wastewater flowrate of 230 l s represents average dry weather flowrate when two such agts are operated that of 460 l s represents average dry weather flowrate when one tank is operational and 986 l s represents peak wet weather flowrate the blowers that supply air to the diffusers can deliver between 289 and 739 nm3 hr the plant currently operates the blowers at minimum speed 289 nm3 hr as anecdotal advice from operators suggests capture reduces if additional air is sent to the tank in the current study air flowrate range from 145 434 nm3 hr was considered for parametric study while plant data for density of grit particles received by the industrial agt considered in this study was not available it was expected that the collected grit overwhelmingly consisted of sand particles furthermore industrial grit removal systems typically adopt a design value for density of grit that is equal to the density of sand 3 consequently grit particles were assumed to have a density of 2650 kg m3 similar to silica sand further average grit particle size of 310 μm with rosin rammler size distribution factor of 2 8 corresponding to the experimental size distribution values as summarized in table 4 was considered for the simulations as mentioned before a commercial cfd code ansys fluent v 19 was used to conduct the simulations each simulation required approximately 2 days to complete on a computer node having 16 cores on 2 x intel r xeon r cpu e5 2680 2 70 ghz with 64 gb ram 3 results and discussion to compare predictions of different simulated scenarios surfaces and lines sensors were defined within the flow domain as shown in fig 3 z1 z6 z10 z14 and z18 are xy planes at z 1 6 10 14 and 18 m respectively x2 5 and x5 1 are yz planes at x 2 5 and 5 1 m the plane at x 2 5 is cut down the length of the tank at the deepest point directly above the sump that houses the screw conveyor and the plane at x 5 1 is cut through the diffusers that run alongside one side of the tank xz1 5 and xz5 1 are vertical lines at x 1 5 and 5 1 m respectively on z10 plane yz7 0 and yz9 2 are horizontal lines at y 7 and 9 2 m respectively on z10 plane yz9 2 is located above the level of the diffuser and yz7 0 is located below the level of the diffuser 3 1 flow patterns initially a base case simulation with wastewater flowrate of 430 l s and air flowrate of 289 nm3 hr was performed for 100 s physical time fig 4 a shows variation of the mass flowrate of air and water phases at the tank outlet with time it was observed that both outlet mass flowrates achieved a value equal to inlet mass flowrate after 60 s fig 4 b shows the velocity magnitude of water along line yz9 2 at 90 s 95 s and 100 s time the profiles were found to be consistent with very minor discrepancy among them this observation confirmed that a steady state condition achieved within 100 s consequently each transient ee air water flow simulation was conducted for 100 s physical time and the simulation data for the last 10 s were used to report time averaged predictions the velocity streamlines of wastewater and air are shown in fig 4 the wastewater streamlines fig 5 a and b showed the presence of spiral flow down the length of the tank interestingly the streamlines also revealed a less pronounced spiral occurring in the metre gap between the diffuser and its nearest wall suggesting that the diffused air induces two different spirals in opposite directions down the tank it is also apparent that the wastewater velocity is highest directly above the diffuser when travelling upward in a positive y direction this observation is consistent with previous cfd investigations of aerated grit tanks in literature 4 17 the velocity then decreased as the spiral completes its rotation toward the bottom of the tank once flow progresses past the inlet zone to the first diffuser the velocity fields started to appear consistent down the length of the tank at z6 z10 z14 and z18 the spiral on the left side of the diffuser in fig 5 b exhibited a clearly defined anti clockwise with a centroid approximately 1 m above and 1 m horizontally offset from the diffuser less clearly defined but still present was the smaller clockwise spiral between the diffuser and its nearest wall shown on the right side of the diffuser in fig 5 b the wastewater velocity magnitude just above the bottom of the tank was approximately 0 06 m s this value is considerably below recommendations from literature 6 that suggest the velocity in this region should be approximately 0 20 m s to prevent organic material in the wastewater from settling and being removed with the grit however there have been no reports from plant operators of the investigated tank that large quantities of organics are present in the removed grit which would be detectable due to the odour it is apparent from fig 5 c and d that the velocity of the air phase gradually decreased as air bubbles rise to the surface it is also apparent that the air bubbles appeared to form a plume diverging away from the diffuser as they rose to the surface the components of the wastewater velocity along the four lines xz1 5 yz9 2 yz7 0 and xz5 1 at the z10 plane midway along the length of the tank are plotted in fig 5 at xz1 5 fig 6 a the x velocity changed from positive to negative approximately halfway along the line due to spiral flow causing wastewater to move away from the diffuser at the top of the tank negative x velocity and being drawn back toward the diffuser near the bottom of the tank positive x velocity the y velocity was negative and tends towards zero at the liquid surface this is because line xz1 5 is near the opposite wall from the diffuser where the flow spiral is moving downward negative y velocity there was a small positive z velocity along the line which indicated net flow in the positive z direction toward the outlet without backflow or recirculation at xz5 1 fig 6a the x and y velocity exhibited rapid changes in velocity around the level of the diffuser y 7 6 m above the level of the diffuser the x velocity was negative before changing to positive approximately halfway between the diffuser and the liquid surface of the tank this can be attributed to the two competing spirals either side of the diffuser above the level of the diffuser the y velocity increased in magnitude peaking at a maximum of 0 53 m s at y 9 2 m the y velocity decreased to zero towards the liquid surface of the tank at yz9 2 fig 6c the x velocity was negative between x 0 m and x 4 m in the region between the diffuser x 5 1 and its nearest wall the x velocity switched from positive to negative this is expected as line yz9 2 is near the liquid surface of the tank meaning that the diffused air should be generating a wastewater spiral away from the diffuser the y velocity was negative moving down to the bottom of the tank on the wall opposite from the diffuser the y velocity then increased sharply in a positive direction above the level of the diffuser the z velocity was very low consistent with that for line xz1 5 at yz7 0 fig 6d the x velocity remained positive along line yz7 0 as the line is near the bottom of the tank where the wastewater would be moving toward the diffuser the velocity generally increased closer to the diffuser the y velocity changed direction approximately halfway along the line due to the spiral motion of the flow at the bottom of the tank 3 2 effect of model parameters the mesh dependency of simulation results was investigated by simulating three mesh sizes with total number of cells of 547123 1494625 and 3776544 460 l s wastewater flow rate and 289 nm3 hr air flow rate were used in these three simulations wastewater y velocity at yz9 2 and yz7 0 on reporting plane z10 were selected to compare the three meshes the y component of velocity was selected for comparison as its magnitude was significantly higher than other velocity components and it had significant impact on settling of grit the y velocity values at two axial positions one above the air diffuser and the other just below the free surface at either side of the eye of the spiral flow were selected for this comparison at these selected reporting locations one would expect significant changes in y velocity of the wastewater phase the quantitative predictions for meshes with 1 5 million and 3 8 million cells were in close agreement with discrepancies within approximately 10 fig 7 a and b consequently the results were deemed sufficiently independent of mesh size and the geometry with 1 5 million cells was used in subsequent simulations the literature review suggested that previous cfd studies used different turbulent models to assess the effect of turbulent model on flow predictions simulations were conducted using three turbulence models under the same flow conditions 460 l s wastewater flow rate and 289 nm3 hr air flow rate the investigated turbulent models are standard k ε reenormalized group rng k ε k ω shear stress transport sst model the comparison fig 7c and d shows subtle differences between the magnitudes of the y velocity between the three turbulence models the general behaviour and velocity trends were consistent with the exception of line yz7 0 between x 4 0 and x 4 6 where the line approaches the diffuser location here the y velocity of the rng k ε model was negative whilst the y velocity of the k ε and k ω sst model remained positive this suggests differences in the way the rng k ε model simulates the highly turbulent zone around the diffuser as experimental data for y velocity in the tank are not available the selection of the turbulence model was made based on literature the k ω sst has been successfully implemented in previous aeration tank studies 27 28 32 33 as well as separator studies that involve whirlpools or swirling flows 34 35 thus the k ω sst model was selected for the subsequent simulations 3 3 dpm simulation and model validation the ee water air flow simulations were run for 100 s physical time to achieve pseudo steady state then grit particles were injected as discrete particulate phase from the wastewater inlet with the same velocity as that of wastewater the outlet weir which was configured as pressure outlet for water and air was configured with the escape boundary condition for the grit particles the reflect boundary condition was applied to all internal walls for grit particles whereas the trap boundary condition was applied to the bottom wall of the tank as illustrated in fig 8 a it should be noted that a screw conveyor located in a recess at the bottom of the tank to mimic collection of particles in the cfd model the trap boundary condition was selected with assumption that when grit particles reach the level represented by the trap they would settle into the screw conveyor recess and then be pulled towards the sump at the end of the tank total 71 200 particles total mass of 0 0292 kg having a rosin rammler distribution between 10 μm and 1000 μm with the size range divided into 200 bins were injected the average grit particle size was 310 μm with rosin rammler size distribution factor of 2 8 corresponding to the experimental data table 4 to track grit particles an approach described by meroney and sheker 20 was used in this approach the length of time that each particle is tracked is dependent on the total number of steps specified at the beginning of the dpm setup a given particle is tracked until it escapes the domain from an outlet or a trapped boundary wall otherwise after the given number of steps the model declares a particle s trajectory as incomplete in the current work the effect of the number of steps on particle track statistics the number of particles leaving and the number of particles remaining inside the flow domain was investigated by considering the number of steps from 10 000 to 300000 capture efficiency was calculated for the u s standard sieve sizes 10 25 37 74 106 150 212 300 355 425 500 600 710 850 and 1000 microns it was observed that there was negligible difference between captured efficiency at 200000 and 300000 time steps for all particle sizes to limit computational time the number of time steps adopted for subsequent dpm simulations was 200000 initially the settling behaviour particles was investigated using the trajectories of different sized particles at wastewater flowrate of 430 l s and air flowrate of 289 nm3 hr fig 8b f particles with diameter dp of 500 μm and larger entered the tank through the inlet channel and quickly reached to the bottom fig 8b such larger particles did not even progress through to the aeration zone this was expected due to their higher settling velocity at the other end of particle size distribution dp 150 μm particles entered the aeration zone and moved through the tank in a spiral flow pattern before either settling to the bottom of the tank or continuing all the way to the end of the tank and escaping through the outlet fig 8d particles with dp 300 μm progressed through the aeration zone and travelled up to a half of the tank length in spiral flow paths before they settled at the bottom fig 8b the captured efficiency e was used to measure the performance of the tank can be represented by 7 e m s i z e i n m s i z e e s c a p e d m s i z e i n m s i z e t r a p p e d m s i z e i n c o m p l e t e m s i z e i n where m represents the mass of particles within a certain size range m s i z e i n m s i z e e s c a p e d m s i z e t r a p p e d and m s i z e i n c o m p l e t e represent the mass of particles injected in the flow domain escaped from the flow domain trapped at the bottom and suspended inside in the flow domain respectively it was also noted that even with 300000 time steps there were a significant number of particles that had incomplete trajectories investigation of particle trajectories showed that many of these incomplete trajectories were caused by particles entering regions of very low fluid velocity such as in corners of the tank or directly under the diffuser where the two opposing spirals meet this was expected as when the tank was drained during the construction project accumulated grit was observed in several locations previous studies 20 36 have also noted that due to time consuming nature of particle settling simulations are often cut short before all particles have either escaped or become trapped within the domain some particle trajectories are retained i e incomplete this has necessitated the introduction of a revised efficiency criteria re to ignore the retained incomplete particles 8 r e m s i z e t r a p p e d m s i z e i n m s i z e i n c o m p l e t e meroney and sheker 20 noted that re would always be less than or at most equal to e which makes re a more conservative criteria for efficiency in the current study the re criteria was used to measure tank s captured efficiency or grit removal efficiency the captured efficiency predicted of different sizes at 460 l s wastewater flowrate and 289 nm3 hr air flowrate was compared with the plant data table 5 for 150 212 and 300 μm sieves a high degree of validation with only 2 01 0 41 and 2 37 difference respectively between the sampling data and the cfd model was observed however there was a larger absolute difference 17 43 between the sampling data and cfd model for the 106 μm sieve it is also notable in the plant that the capture efficiency drops very little as the sieve size reduces this is contrary to the literature data of similar systems which typically feature a significant drop in capture efficiency at smaller sieve sizes consistent with the cfd predictions of the current study 3 4 effect of wastewater flowrate simulations were conducted with wastewater flowrate of 230 460 and 986 l s at constant air flowrate of 289 nm3 hr with grit injection as discussed in the previous section fig 9 a shows the wastewater y velocity at the bottom of the tank immediately above the screw conveyor it is expected that a higher positive y velocity as the spiral moves upward would inhibit a grit particle from settling downward into the screw conveyor recess it was observed that there was minor difference in the y velocity values from 230 and 460 l s flow rate but a noticeable increased in velocity for the 986 l s simulation fig 9 b compares the capture efficiency for the different wastewater flow rates the increase in the wastewater flowrate resulted in decrease in capture efficiency at wet weather flowrate of 986 l s the model predicted significant drop in capture efficiency with the agt achieving less than half of that at average dry weather flowrate of 230 l s such significant drop in capture efficiency is highly undesired particularly when grit loads to the plant are typically highest during peak wet weather events 3 3 5 effect of gas flowrate at constant dry weather wastewater flowrate of 230 l s simulations were conducted using 145 217 289 and 434 nm3 hr air flowrate and grit injection as discussed in the previous section fig 10 a illustrates how the wastewater velocity magnitude at the bottom of the tank reduced with reducing air flow rate the current setpoint 289 nm3 hr resulted in a minimum wastewater velocity of approximately 0 06 m s above the screw conveyor reducing the airflow by 50 reduces this to approximately 0 04 m s these values are significantly below the value of approximately 0 20 m s recommended by literature to keep organic material in suspension this suggests that any reduction in air flowrate to reduce energy consumption would need to be monitored by the plant operators to ensure excessive amounts of organic material are not being removed with the grit fig 10 b shows the revised capture efficiency for different air flowrates the capture efficiency reduced with decreasing air flow however there are a number of sieve sizes 25 106 and 150 μm where the current air flow setpoint resulted in higher capture compared to both higher and lower air flow one might expect grit particles to settle quicker and increase in capture efficiency if the wastewater velocity above the screw conveyor decreases in response to reduced air flowrate however the predictions in fig 10 b do not support this the y direction vertical wastewater velocity immediately above the collection sump along reporting line yz7 0 in fig 10a show that increase in air flowrate increased the intensity of the spiral flow within the tank this can be seen in the increase in the velocity magnitude in both the positive and negative y direction fig 10a during the downward motion of the spiral negative y velocity a higher velocity of the wastewater phase might result in a higher velocity of the grit particles as these grit particles carry higher momentum the separation from the wastewater streamlines as the spiral turns upwards was more pronounced this would aid the grit particle reaching the screw conveyor recess and improving capture these observations suggest that there were competing phenomena affecting the capture of particles it is also possible that the long pipe diffuser resulted in a dense plume of bubbles that was inefficient at transferring momentum to the wastewater it would be interesting for further work to study if alternative diffuser configurations provide the same intensity of spiral motion with less air flow the predictions suggest that sacrificing a small amount of capture would provide significant energy savings by reducing air flowrate to the tank however this would need more field trials to ensure that excessive amounts of organic material are not removed with the grit 3 6 effect of tank geometry simulation predictions demonstrated that peak wet weather events resulted in a significant drop in capture efficiency consequently the following system modifications were investigated to improve capture efficiency of the agt under wet weather flowrate of 936 l s increase in air flowrate previous simulations on the effect of air flowrate indicated a minor increase in capture when air flowrate was increased at an average dry weather flow of 230 l s to review the impact during wet weather flows the air flowrate to the tank was increased to 434 nm3 hr no changes are made to the tank geometry in this simulation increase in tank length asce 2 notes that longer tanks improve the capture of finer grit particles whilst modifying the existing tank would represent a considerable capital expenditure this simulation was run to test this the length of the tank in the diffuser zone of the existing tank is 17 77 m a number of design recommendations outlined in table 1 suggest an upper range for the length to width ratio of 5 1 this would equate to a length of approximately 30 m therefore this simulation had modified the geometry file by increasing the length of the diffuser zone from 17 77 m to 30 m the velocity of the diffuser inlet was held constant with the current setpoint consequently air flowrate was increased proportional to the increase in the diffuser zone length increase in tank width the current tank has a width of 6 12 m and a width depth ratio of 1 38 1 which is at the lower range recommended by tchobanoglous et al 3 who suggests a range of 1 1 to 1 5 to test the impact of increasing the tank width an updated geometry file with a width of 8 0 m width depth ratio of 1 8 1 was created use of a baffle sawicki 7 and albrecht 37 recommended the use of baffles to improve the performance of an agt an alternative geometry with a longitudinal baffle parallel to the diffuser was simulated the baffle was positioned 1000 mm from the wall and the diffuser was moved as close as possible to the tank wall modify tank base the screw conveyor recess of the existing tank is approximately midway along the width of the tank londong 6 suggested that this low point being located closer to one side as shown in fig 11 a this creates a longer sedimentation zone for particles settling toward the sump a simulation with a modified the base of the tank with a 30 degree floor slope and repositioned the diffuser was conducted to replicate the londong 6 configuration fig 11 b compares predicted capture efficiency from the above mentioned modifications and current tank the following observed were made from the comparison increase in the air flow by 50 resulted in a minor increase in capture with a maximum absolute increase of 6 6 for the 150 μm sieve size increase in the tank length to 30 m in the diffuser zone generally increased capture efficiency there was a maximum absolute increase of 11 for the 74 μm sieve size compared to the current tank the results are consistent with observations in asce 2 regarding longer tanks improving fine particle capture increase in the tank width to 8 m resulted in negligible increase in capture except for the 106 150 micron sieve sizes for which capture efficiency increased by 11 and 8 3 respectively for most sieve sizes the addition of the baffle decreased capture compared to the current tank it was concluded that a successful baffle configuration could be found with more trials however this did illustrate the challenge of traditional design approaches for agts the modification of the tank base had significantly improved wet weather capture relative to both the existing tank and the other modifications the largest increase was for the 106 and 150 μm sieve sizes with increase in the efficiency by 34 this suggests that the current tank configuration with the low point approximately halfway across the tank width is inferior to the arrangement proposed by londong 6 where the low point is offset to one side of the tank the design modification as suggested by londong 6 was the most promising further combining this design modification with the above suggested other modifications may further improve grit capture efficiency it is noted that the floor slope of the investigated tank is formed by mass concrete benching and not structural concrete consequently this modification could be achieved without major structural modifications to the tank although with significant cost 4 conclusions the flow behaviour and capture of grit particles in an industrial scale wwtp agt was investigated by conducting cfd simulations in the simulation wastewater and air phases were modelled using the ee approach and the flow of grit particles was resolved by using the dpm approach transient simulations were run for 100 s physical time in order to progress to a steady state wastewater and air flow field and then discrete grit particles were injected in the flow domain initially the cfd model was validated using plant data on grit removal consequently the model was used to investigate the effect of different operating conditions and modified tank geometries on tank s grit capture efficiency the predictions showed that there were only small changes in the capture efficiency of the tank when air flowrate was either increased 50 or decreased 50 from the current set point 230 nm3 hr the results suggest that there could be significant energy savings if a small amount of capture was sacrificed as blowers used to sparge the air significantly contributes to energy requirement of an agt simulation of a peak wet weather event wastewater flowrate 986 l s resulted in a 50 drop in grit capture several tank modifications were trialled to determine if grit capture could be improved during peak wet weather events small improvements in grit capture were found if the tank length or the tank width was extended or the air flow rate was increased 34 increase in the capture efficiency of smaller particles in a size range of 100 150 μm under wet weather flow conditions was found if the tank base was modified so that the screw conveyor recess was relocated from its current position midway along the width of the tank to a location adjacent to the wall interestingly the addition of a baffle with dimensions based on design guidelines from literature reduced capture during wet weather compared to the current tank with more iterative optimization study it is expected that a baffle configuration could be found that improves capture however this highlights a major challenge in using traditional rule of thumb design approaches for agts further work could consider the organic particles within wastewater this could allow the simulation to consider if these particles settle and are removed from the tank along with the grit particles this would be important for testing alternative design configurations to maximise the amount of inorganic grit removed whilst minimising the amount of organic material removed it is noted however that the organic particles would exhibit complex phenomena including flocculation discrete hindered and compression settling of the near neutral buoyancy particles and would add significant complexity to the modelling it would likely also require additional sampling data to validate declaration of competing

13705,grit removal is an important step in a municipal wastewater treatment plant to remove fine particles from wastewater one of the prominent technologies for grit removal is an aerated grit tank agt which uses air diffusers to create spiral flow that allows heavier particles to accelerate and settle to the bottom of the tank the performance of an agt largely depends on induced flow patterns and hydrodynamic forces the current study investigated an industrial scale agt using computational fluid dynamics modelling and simulations for the simulated tank industrial trials were conducted to measure grit quantity and particle size distribution in the influent and effluent of the tank the measured data were used to validate the cfd model and then the validated model was used to investigate the effect operating conditions and modifications in tank geometry on flow patterns and grit capture efficiency the objective of this parametric investigation was aimed to improve grit removal efficiency of the simulated agt the predictions suggested only 6 6 change in the grit capture efficiency of the tank when air flowrate was either increased by 50 from the current setpoint 230 nm3 hr simulation of a peak wet weather wastewater flowrate 986 l s resulted in 50 drop in grit capture compared to dry weather wastewater flowrate 460 l s among the simulated tank modifications to improve grit removal during peak wet weather events increase in tank length and width did not provide significant improvement however modification in tank base by relocating the screw conveyor recess from its current position midway along the width of the tank to a location adjacent to the wall resulted in 34 increase in the capture efficiency of smaller particles in a size range of 100 150 μm keywords

plant 1 introduction the removal of grit is a critical step in a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp grit generally refers to inorganic solids such as sand gravel and cinders with little to no putrescible organic matter in typical municipal wastewater grit is also present in the form of non putrescent organic matter such as eggshells bone chips seeds and coffee grounds 1 if not removed grit particles settle in downstream pipes channels and process tanks and also cause the abrasion of mechanical equipment within the plant in a municipal wastewater plant grit is typically removed at the headworks of a municipal wastewater treatment plant following the inlet screens and preceding primary clarification for grit removal different technologies such as vortex type systems hydrocyclones detritus tanks and velocity controlled channels are currently being used one of these technologies is an aerated grit tank agt which has been investigated in the current study a typical agt fig 1 is an oblong tank with a conical bottom wastewater enters at one end of the tank flows along the length and leaves the tank through an overflow weir at the other end the tank is connected to a blower which supplies air to submerged diffusers along one side of the tank these diffusers run longitudinally along the tank length and the flow of air through them generates spiral flow of wastewater this spiral flow allows heavier grit particles to settle to the bottom the tank whilst the lighter organic particles remain in suspension in the wastewater 2 grit particles which settle to the bottom of the tank are collected in a sump and removed by different arrangements at the bottom such as screw conveyors bucket conveyors and grab buckets these systems remove grit slurry from the tank which is washed to remove organic matter and dewatered to remove excess water 3 the operation of an agt is complex due to seasonal fluctuation in wastewater quantity and grit concentration the wastewater flowrate in wet weather is usually an order of magnitude higher than in dry weather real time monitoring of grit capture efficiency is usually not feasible requiring plant operators to undertake onerous sampling investigations to quantify the capture efficiency these field sampling investigations can be undertaken to characterise the grit concentration in the influent and effluent and use this data to determine particle size distribution and grit removal efficiency 4 such sampling investigations are difficult to perform and are challenging to sequence to coincide with peak wet weather flow into the plant the fluctuation in wastewater flowrate creates challenges for plant operators in understanding how grit capture efficiency is affected by both wastewater influent and diffused air flow rates optimum use of blowers is extremely critical to energy efficiency and grit capture efficiency of an agt the sizing of agts has traditionally relied on design guidelines experience of operators and manufacturer s recommendations 5 an example of these typical design guidelines and their comparison against the agt tank considered in the current study is summarized in table 1 it was observed that there are differences and contradictions between the various guidelines though the dimensions of the agt tank considered in the current study is generally within the suggested range for most criteria londong 6 conducted pilot scale experiments in order to provide sizing principles related to geometry of the tank and air flow to the diffusers the principles aimed to achieve specific low velocities at the bottom of the tank that allow grit particles to settle but ensure that the velocity was high enough to avoid settling of organic material in the wastewater londong s study found that a velocity of 0 20 m s in the bottom of the tank achieved high capture of heavier grit particles and low settling of organic material londong s experiments and sizing principles influenced some of the recommendations in the widely used water environment federation manual of practice 2 sawicki 7 developed a simplified two dimensional model of the flow field that ignored the longitudinal dimension as the discharge through the tank was deemed insignificant compared to the transverse circulation this allowed the two dimensional multiphase flow to be approximated using the poisson equation munoz and young 8 noted that sawicki s approach was theoretical in nature and lacked explanation of how to solve the poisson s equation munoz and young 8 proposed a means using mathcad to numerically integrate the poisson s equation to predict the velocity field in the chamber this provided a quick way of modelling the aerated grit tank recognizing that three dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling is more suitable for the complex multiphase flow cfd has been used in several previous studies to investigate the flow patterns and performance of different types of grit removal tank a few prominent cfd studies on grit removal tanks are summarized in table 2 in these studies water air multiphase flow in a grit removal tank was modelled using either the eulerian eulerian ee approach or volume of fluid vof approach the ee approach represents both water and air phases as interpenetrating continua whereas the vof approach tracks the interface between the two phases interface tracking by the vof approach requires very fine grid near the interface particularly at the top liquid surface in the tank and interface of diffusing gas bubbles the requirement fine grid by the vof approach makes this approach computationally very intensive for simulations of industrial scale grit removal tanks on the other hand the ee approach can resolve key flow patterns of water air multiphase flow in a grit removal tank and is also computationally less intensive several previous studies table 2 have ignored the solid phase grit whereas several others have used discrete particle modelling dpm approach to model the flow of the solid phase in the dpm approach the movement of each particle is tracked by solving force balance equation for each particle the dpm approach is computationally feasible for low concentration of solids in the flow previous studies table 2 have used different types of turbulent model to investigate the flow of water literature review suggests that the design and operation of an agt is significantly challenging on account of seasonal variation in wastewater quantity and grit concentration industrial practices for agts mostly rely on empirical data and operator s experience without fundamental insight into multiphase hydrodynamics further there are a limited number of cfd studies on agts in literature and cfd studies on agts or settling tanks have used different modelling approaches and closure models there has been no consensus among previous studies on the selection of turbulent model and boundary conditions in the current study cfd simulations of an industrial agt tank which is a part of a major wwtp in north eastern usa were conducted the cfd model considered 3d flow domain and resolved the flow of air water and suspended grit particles in the flow domain in the current study the ee approach was used for the flow of wastewater and air whereas the dpm was used for the particulate phase the model was validated against plant data on grit capture efficiency and then the validated model was used to investigate the effect of operating parameters such as water flowrate and air flowrate on the flow pattern and particle capture efficiency furthermore simulations were also conducted to investigate the effect design modifications of the agt on grit capture efficiency at wet weather wastewater flowrate before conducting the parametric study the effect of turbulent models on model predictions were also investigated the primary objective was to develop a cfd model for an industrial scale agt and provide predictions over a wide range of operating conditions such predictions will be useful in operation of agts and design of such tanks in future 2 cfd model 2 1 multiphase model the flow in the agt is a multiphase flow of air wastewater and suspended grit particles in the current study the flow of air and wastewater was modelled by using the ee approach and particles were resolved as discrete particles using the lagrangian approach known as dpm in the ee approach both air and wastewater phases were considered as interpenetrating continua the wastewater phase was considered as a primary phase and air phase became a secondary phase for each phase mass and momentum balance equations were solved the momentum equations of both the phases were coupled by an interface drag force for the drag force several different drag models are available in the literature in the current study the drag model of schiller and naumann 21 was selected based on previous cfd studies on aeration tanks 22 the flow in the tank is anticipated as highly turbulent and rotational due to the sparging of air to capture turbulent condition k ω shear stress transport sst turbulent model was selected the selection of the turbulent model was based on the investigation of the effect of three turbulent models such as k ε model k ε renormalized group rng and k ω sst model on flow predictions the governing equations and constitutive equations for the water air ee model are summarised in appendix i the particulate phase was modelled as a lagrangian phase for which force balance over each particle was solved one way coupling between the primary phase and particulate phase was modelled by using the spherical drag model the one way coupling approach ignores the effect of particles on the primary continuous phase and interparticle interactions such assumptions can be justified in the current study as the concentration of the particulate phase in the tank is very low less than 0 01 the equations for the particulate phase are also included in appendix i 2 2 geometry and meshing the simulated geometry of an agt with major dimensions is shown in fig 2 and the geometry with dimensions different parts is shown in appendix ii wastewater enters the upstream end of the tank through a rectangular opening in the wall and leaves the tank over a rectangular weir at the downstream end this weir maintains a minimum water level in the tank diffuser pipes are located on one side of the tank a multi stage blower provides air to the diffusers running the length of the tank is a screw conveyor recess sump where a spiral screw conveyor is located at the lowest point of the floor note that the screw conveyor arrangement was not included in the simulated geometry the flow domain of the tank is discretised by using hexahedral structured mesh as shown in fig 2 b 2 3 numerical parameters a 3d transient simulations were conducted to predict velocity fields of the continuous phases ansys fluent was used to carry out the simulations the phase coupled simple pressure velocity coupling method was used and the green gauss node based gradient evaluation method was implemented for gradients 23 a the presto pressure method was used for the pressure discretisation scheme second order upwind discretization scheme was used for the equations for mass and momentum balance turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent energy dissipation rate based on recommendation by wicklein et al 24 the effect of gravity was also included the transient simulations with a time step size of 0 005 s were run for total physical time of 100 s a maximum of 20 iterations was completed for every time step the convergence criteria of a residual error below 10 3 was adopted for all residuals after 100 s all residuals dropped below 10 4 for all simulations performed 2 4 boundary conditions wastewater inlet was modelled as a velocity inlet for which the velocity was calculated by 1 u q w h w h i where u is the velocity in the channel q is the volumetric flow rate w is the channel width h w is the elevation of water in the tank plant datum and h i is the invert level of the channel turbulence was specified at the velocity inlet by defining hydraulic diameter and turbulence intensity 2 d h 4 a c r o s s s e c t i o n l w e t t e d 3 r e ρ u d h μ 4 i 0 16 r e 1 8 where d h is the hydraulic diameter re is the reynolds number ρ is the density of the fluid and v is the velocity the overflow weir was modelled as a pressure outlet maintained at atmospheric pressure turbulence at the pressure outlet was also specified using the hydraulic diameter and turbulence intensity the backflow volume fraction for the air phase was set to zero air enters the simulated agt through the simplified 100 mm wide diffuser face which was represented as a velocity inlet turbulence was specified at the velocity inlet using the hydraulic diameter and turbulence intensity the volume fraction at this velocity inlet was set to 0 for wastewater and 1 for air the downstream end of the simulated agt has a sharp crested weir which controls the wastewater level in the tank the discharge equation for the sharp crested weir can be given by eq 5 25 5 q 2 3 c 2 g d 1 δ z 3 l where q is the flow over the weir c is the weir discharge coefficient d 1 is the upstream water depth δ z is the crest height above channel bed and l is the length of the weir the weir discharge coefficient is expressed by eq 6 26 6 c 0 602 0 075 d 1 δ z δ z the agt consists of an open topped tank with a free liquid surface a degassing boundary condition was selected to represent the liquid surface of the tank the degassing boundary condition is used to model a free surface through which only dispersed gas bubbles are allowed to escape whilst the continuous liquid phases see the boundary as a free slip wall 23 b the use of the ee multiphase model with a degassing boundary was used by several previous studies for modelling aeration tanks with free liquid surfaces 22 27 31 side walls of the tank were modelled using no slip wall conditions 2 5 simulation plan total 19 simulations were performed in the current study as listed in table 3 initially simulations were conducted to investigate the effect of mesh size simulations no 1 3 and turbulent models simulations no 4 6 these simulations were performed only for the flow of air and water phases in the flow domain and aimed to provide the selection of critical modelling parameters consequently a simulation was conducted with third particulate phase for model validation simulation 7 after model validation three phase simulations were performed to investigate the effect of water flowrate simulations 8 10 and air flowrate simulations no 11 15 on flow patterns and grit capture efficiency finally simulations no 16 19 were conducted to investigate the effect of modifications in the tank geometry operating wastewater flowrates were determined based on the current plant operation wastewater flowrate of 230 l s represents average dry weather flowrate when two such agts are operated that of 460 l s represents average dry weather flowrate when one tank is operational and 986 l s represents peak wet weather flowrate the blowers that supply air to the diffusers can deliver between 289 and 739 nm3 hr the plant currently operates the blowers at minimum speed 289 nm3 hr as anecdotal advice from operators suggests capture reduces if additional air is sent to the tank in the current study air flowrate range from 145 434 nm3 hr was considered for parametric study while plant data for density of grit particles received by the industrial agt considered in this study was not available it was expected that the collected grit overwhelmingly consisted of sand particles furthermore industrial grit removal systems typically adopt a design value for density of grit that is equal to the density of sand 3 consequently grit particles were assumed to have a density of 2650 kg m3 similar to silica sand further average grit particle size of 310 μm with rosin rammler size distribution factor of 2 8 corresponding to the experimental size distribution values as summarized in table 4 was considered for the simulations as mentioned before a commercial cfd code ansys fluent v 19 was used to conduct the simulations each simulation required approximately 2 days to complete on a computer node having 16 cores on 2 x intel r xeon r cpu e5 2680 2 70 ghz with 64 gb ram 3 results and discussion to compare predictions of different simulated scenarios surfaces and lines sensors were defined within the flow domain as shown in fig 3 z1 z6 z10 z14 and z18 are xy planes at z 1 6 10 14 and 18 m respectively x2 5 and x5 1 are yz planes at x 2 5 and 5 1 m the plane at x 2 5 is cut down the length of the tank at the deepest point directly above the sump that houses the screw conveyor and the plane at x 5 1 is cut through the diffusers that run alongside one side of the tank xz1 5 and xz5 1 are vertical lines at x 1 5 and 5 1 m respectively on z10 plane yz7 0 and yz9 2 are horizontal lines at y 7 and 9 2 m respectively on z10 plane yz9 2 is located above the level of the diffuser and yz7 0 is located below the level of the diffuser 3 1 flow patterns initially a base case simulation with wastewater flowrate of 430 l s and air flowrate of 289 nm3 hr was performed for 100 s physical time fig 4 a shows variation of the mass flowrate of air and water phases at the tank outlet with time it was observed that both outlet mass flowrates achieved a value equal to inlet mass flowrate after 60 s fig 4 b shows the velocity magnitude of water along line yz9 2 at 90 s 95 s and 100 s time the profiles were found to be consistent with very minor discrepancy among them this observation confirmed that a steady state condition achieved within 100 s consequently each transient ee air water flow simulation was conducted for 100 s physical time and the simulation data for the last 10 s were used to report time averaged predictions the velocity streamlines of wastewater and air are shown in fig 4 the wastewater streamlines fig 5 a and b showed the presence of spiral flow down the length of the tank interestingly the streamlines also revealed a less pronounced spiral occurring in the metre gap between the diffuser and its nearest wall suggesting that the diffused air induces two different spirals in opposite directions down the tank it is also apparent that the wastewater velocity is highest directly above the diffuser when travelling upward in a positive y direction this observation is consistent with previous cfd investigations of aerated grit tanks in literature 4 17 the velocity then decreased as the spiral completes its rotation toward the bottom of the tank once flow progresses past the inlet zone to the first diffuser the velocity fields started to appear consistent down the length of the tank at z6 z10 z14 and z18 the spiral on the left side of the diffuser in fig 5 b exhibited a clearly defined anti clockwise with a centroid approximately 1 m above and 1 m horizontally offset from the diffuser less clearly defined but still present was the smaller clockwise spiral between the diffuser and its nearest wall shown on the right side of the diffuser in fig 5 b the wastewater velocity magnitude just above the bottom of the tank was approximately 0 06 m s this value is considerably below recommendations from literature 6 that suggest the velocity in this region should be approximately 0 20 m s to prevent organic material in the wastewater from settling and being removed with the grit however there have been no reports from plant operators of the investigated tank that large quantities of organics are present in the removed grit which would be detectable due to the odour it is apparent from fig 5 c and d that the velocity of the air phase gradually decreased as air bubbles rise to the surface it is also apparent that the air bubbles appeared to form a plume diverging away from the diffuser as they rose to the surface the components of the wastewater velocity along the four lines xz1 5 yz9 2 yz7 0 and xz5 1 at the z10 plane midway along the length of the tank are plotted in fig 5 at xz1 5 fig 6 a the x velocity changed from positive to negative approximately halfway along the line due to spiral flow causing wastewater to move away from the diffuser at the top of the tank negative x velocity and being drawn back toward the diffuser near the bottom of the tank positive x velocity the y velocity was negative and tends towards zero at the liquid surface this is because line xz1 5 is near the opposite wall from the diffuser where the flow spiral is moving downward negative y velocity there was a small positive z velocity along the line which indicated net flow in the positive z direction toward the outlet without backflow or recirculation at xz5 1 fig 6a the x and y velocity exhibited rapid changes in velocity around the level of the diffuser y 7 6 m above the level of the diffuser the x velocity was negative before changing to positive approximately halfway between the diffuser and the liquid surface of the tank this can be attributed to the two competing spirals either side of the diffuser above the level of the diffuser the y velocity increased in magnitude peaking at a maximum of 0 53 m s at y 9 2 m the y velocity decreased to zero towards the liquid surface of the tank at yz9 2 fig 6c the x velocity was negative between x 0 m and x 4 m in the region between the diffuser x 5 1 and its nearest wall the x velocity switched from positive to negative this is expected as line yz9 2 is near the liquid surface of the tank meaning that the diffused air should be generating a wastewater spiral away from the diffuser the y velocity was negative moving down to the bottom of the tank on the wall opposite from the diffuser the y velocity then increased sharply in a positive direction above the level of the diffuser the z velocity was very low consistent with that for line xz1 5 at yz7 0 fig 6d the x velocity remained positive along line yz7 0 as the line is near the bottom of the tank where the wastewater would be moving toward the diffuser the velocity generally increased closer to the diffuser the y velocity changed direction approximately halfway along the line due to the spiral motion of the flow at the bottom of the tank 3 2 effect of model parameters the mesh dependency of simulation results was investigated by simulating three mesh sizes with total number of cells of 547123 1494625 and 3776544 460 l s wastewater flow rate and 289 nm3 hr air flow rate were used in these three simulations wastewater y velocity at yz9 2 and yz7 0 on reporting plane z10 were selected to compare the three meshes the y component of velocity was selected for comparison as its magnitude was significantly higher than other velocity components and it had significant impact on settling of grit the y velocity values at two axial positions one above the air diffuser and the other just below the free surface at either side of the eye of the spiral flow were selected for this comparison at these selected reporting locations one would expect significant changes in y velocity of the wastewater phase the quantitative predictions for meshes with 1 5 million and 3 8 million cells were in close agreement with discrepancies within approximately 10 fig 7 a and b consequently the results were deemed sufficiently independent of mesh size and the geometry with 1 5 million cells was used in subsequent simulations the literature review suggested that previous cfd studies used different turbulent models to assess the effect of turbulent model on flow predictions simulations were conducted using three turbulence models under the same flow conditions 460 l s wastewater flow rate and 289 nm3 hr air flow rate the investigated turbulent models are standard k ε reenormalized group rng k ε k ω shear stress transport sst model the comparison fig 7c and d shows subtle differences between the magnitudes of the y velocity between the three turbulence models the general behaviour and velocity trends were consistent with the exception of line yz7 0 between x 4 0 and x 4 6 where the line approaches the diffuser location here the y velocity of the rng k ε model was negative whilst the y velocity of the k ε and k ω sst model remained positive this suggests differences in the way the rng k ε model simulates the highly turbulent zone around the diffuser as experimental data for y velocity in the tank are not available the selection of the turbulence model was made based on literature the k ω sst has been successfully implemented in previous aeration tank studies 27 28 32 33 as well as separator studies that involve whirlpools or swirling flows 34 35 thus the k ω sst model was selected for the subsequent simulations 3 3 dpm simulation and model validation the ee water air flow simulations were run for 100 s physical time to achieve pseudo steady state then grit particles were injected as discrete particulate phase from the wastewater inlet with the same velocity as that of wastewater the outlet weir which was configured as pressure outlet for water and air was configured with the escape boundary condition for the grit particles the reflect boundary condition was applied to all internal walls for grit particles whereas the trap boundary condition was applied to the bottom wall of the tank as illustrated in fig 8 a it should be noted that a screw conveyor located in a recess at the bottom of the tank to mimic collection of particles in the cfd model the trap boundary condition was selected with assumption that when grit particles reach the level represented by the trap they would settle into the screw conveyor recess and then be pulled towards the sump at the end of the tank total 71 200 particles total mass of 0 0292 kg having a rosin rammler distribution between 10 μm and 1000 μm with the size range divided into 200 bins were injected the average grit particle size was 310 μm with rosin rammler size distribution factor of 2 8 corresponding to the experimental data table 4 to track grit particles an approach described by meroney and sheker 20 was used in this approach the length of time that each particle is tracked is dependent on the total number of steps specified at the beginning of the dpm setup a given particle is tracked until it escapes the domain from an outlet or a trapped boundary wall otherwise after the given number of steps the model declares a particle s trajectory as incomplete in the current work the effect of the number of steps on particle track statistics the number of particles leaving and the number of particles remaining inside the flow domain was investigated by considering the number of steps from 10 000 to 300000 capture efficiency was calculated for the u s standard sieve sizes 10 25 37 74 106 150 212 300 355 425 500 600 710 850 and 1000 microns it was observed that there was negligible difference between captured efficiency at 200000 and 300000 time steps for all particle sizes to limit computational time the number of time steps adopted for subsequent dpm simulations was 200000 initially the settling behaviour particles was investigated using the trajectories of different sized particles at wastewater flowrate of 430 l s and air flowrate of 289 nm3 hr fig 8b f particles with diameter dp of 500 μm and larger entered the tank through the inlet channel and quickly reached to the bottom fig 8b such larger particles did not even progress through to the aeration zone this was expected due to their higher settling velocity at the other end of particle size distribution dp 150 μm particles entered the aeration zone and moved through the tank in a spiral flow pattern before either settling to the bottom of the tank or continuing all the way to the end of the tank and escaping through the outlet fig 8d particles with dp 300 μm progressed through the aeration zone and travelled up to a half of the tank length in spiral flow paths before they settled at the bottom fig 8b the captured efficiency e was used to measure the performance of the tank can be represented by 7 e m s i z e i n m s i z e e s c a p e d m s i z e i n m s i z e t r a p p e d m s i z e i n c o m p l e t e m s i z e i n where m represents the mass of particles within a certain size range m s i z e i n m s i z e e s c a p e d m s i z e t r a p p e d and m s i z e i n c o m p l e t e represent the mass of particles injected in the flow domain escaped from the flow domain trapped at the bottom and suspended inside in the flow domain respectively it was also noted that even with 300000 time steps there were a significant number of particles that had incomplete trajectories investigation of particle trajectories showed that many of these incomplete trajectories were caused by particles entering regions of very low fluid velocity such as in corners of the tank or directly under the diffuser where the two opposing spirals meet this was expected as when the tank was drained during the construction project accumulated grit was observed in several locations previous studies 20 36 have also noted that due to time consuming nature of particle settling simulations are often cut short before all particles have either escaped or become trapped within the domain some particle trajectories are retained i e incomplete this has necessitated the introduction of a revised efficiency criteria re to ignore the retained incomplete particles 8 r e m s i z e t r a p p e d m s i z e i n m s i z e i n c o m p l e t e meroney and sheker 20 noted that re would always be less than or at most equal to e which makes re a more conservative criteria for efficiency in the current study the re criteria was used to measure tank s captured efficiency or grit removal efficiency the captured efficiency predicted of different sizes at 460 l s wastewater flowrate and 289 nm3 hr air flowrate was compared with the plant data table 5 for 150 212 and 300 μm sieves a high degree of validation with only 2 01 0 41 and 2 37 difference respectively between the sampling data and the cfd model was observed however there was a larger absolute difference 17 43 between the sampling data and cfd model for the 106 μm sieve it is also notable in the plant that the capture efficiency drops very little as the sieve size reduces this is contrary to the literature data of similar systems which typically feature a significant drop in capture efficiency at smaller sieve sizes consistent with the cfd predictions of the current study 3 4 effect of wastewater flowrate simulations were conducted with wastewater flowrate of 230 460 and 986 l s at constant air flowrate of 289 nm3 hr with grit injection as discussed in the previous section fig 9 a shows the wastewater y velocity at the bottom of the tank immediately above the screw conveyor it is expected that a higher positive y velocity as the spiral moves upward would inhibit a grit particle from settling downward into the screw conveyor recess it was observed that there was minor difference in the y velocity values from 230 and 460 l s flow rate but a noticeable increased in velocity for the 986 l s simulation fig 9 b compares the capture efficiency for the different wastewater flow rates the increase in the wastewater flowrate resulted in decrease in capture efficiency at wet weather flowrate of 986 l s the model predicted significant drop in capture efficiency with the agt achieving less than half of that at average dry weather flowrate of 230 l s such significant drop in capture efficiency is highly undesired particularly when grit loads to the plant are typically highest during peak wet weather events 3 3 5 effect of gas flowrate at constant dry weather wastewater flowrate of 230 l s simulations were conducted using 145 217 289 and 434 nm3 hr air flowrate and grit injection as discussed in the previous section fig 10 a illustrates how the wastewater velocity magnitude at the bottom of the tank reduced with reducing air flow rate the current setpoint 289 nm3 hr resulted in a minimum wastewater velocity of approximately 0 06 m s above the screw conveyor reducing the airflow by 50 reduces this to approximately 0 04 m s these values are significantly below the value of approximately 0 20 m s recommended by literature to keep organic material in suspension this suggests that any reduction in air flowrate to reduce energy consumption would need to be monitored by the plant operators to ensure excessive amounts of organic material are not being removed with the grit fig 10 b shows the revised capture efficiency for different air flowrates the capture efficiency reduced with decreasing air flow however there are a number of sieve sizes 25 106 and 150 μm where the current air flow setpoint resulted in higher capture compared to both higher and lower air flow one might expect grit particles to settle quicker and increase in capture efficiency if the wastewater velocity above the screw conveyor decreases in response to reduced air flowrate however the predictions in fig 10 b do not support this the y direction vertical wastewater velocity immediately above the collection sump along reporting line yz7 0 in fig 10a show that increase in air flowrate increased the intensity of the spiral flow within the tank this can be seen in the increase in the velocity magnitude in both the positive and negative y direction fig 10a during the downward motion of the spiral negative y velocity a higher velocity of the wastewater phase might result in a higher velocity of the grit particles as these grit particles carry higher momentum the separation from the wastewater streamlines as the spiral turns upwards was more pronounced this would aid the grit particle reaching the screw conveyor recess and improving capture these observations suggest that there were competing phenomena affecting the capture of particles it is also possible that the long pipe diffuser resulted in a dense plume of bubbles that was inefficient at transferring momentum to the wastewater it would be interesting for further work to study if alternative diffuser configurations provide the same intensity of spiral motion with less air flow the predictions suggest that sacrificing a small amount of capture would provide significant energy savings by reducing air flowrate to the tank however this would need more field trials to ensure that excessive amounts of organic material are not removed with the grit 3 6 effect of tank geometry simulation predictions demonstrated that peak wet weather events resulted in a significant drop in capture efficiency consequently the following system modifications were investigated to improve capture efficiency of the agt under wet weather flowrate of 936 l s increase in air flowrate previous simulations on the effect of air flowrate indicated a minor increase in capture when air flowrate was increased at an average dry weather flow of 230 l s to review the impact during wet weather flows the air flowrate to the tank was increased to 434 nm3 hr no changes are made to the tank geometry in this simulation increase in tank length asce 2 notes that longer tanks improve the capture of finer grit particles whilst modifying the existing tank would represent a considerable capital expenditure this simulation was run to test this the length of the tank in the diffuser zone of the existing tank is 17 77 m a number of design recommendations outlined in table 1 suggest an upper range for the length to width ratio of 5 1 this would equate to a length of approximately 30 m therefore this simulation had modified the geometry file by increasing the length of the diffuser zone from 17 77 m to 30 m the velocity of the diffuser inlet was held constant with the current setpoint consequently air flowrate was increased proportional to the increase in the diffuser zone length increase in tank width the current tank has a width of 6 12 m and a width depth ratio of 1 38 1 which is at the lower range recommended by tchobanoglous et al 3 who suggests a range of 1 1 to 1 5 to test the impact of increasing the tank width an updated geometry file with a width of 8 0 m width depth ratio of 1 8 1 was created use of a baffle sawicki 7 and albrecht 37 recommended the use of baffles to improve the performance of an agt an alternative geometry with a longitudinal baffle parallel to the diffuser was simulated the baffle was positioned 1000 mm from the wall and the diffuser was moved as close as possible to the tank wall modify tank base the screw conveyor recess of the existing tank is approximately midway along the width of the tank londong 6 suggested that this low point being located closer to one side as shown in fig 11 a this creates a longer sedimentation zone for particles settling toward the sump a simulation with a modified the base of the tank with a 30 degree floor slope and repositioned the diffuser was conducted to replicate the londong 6 configuration fig 11 b compares predicted capture efficiency from the above mentioned modifications and current tank the following observed were made from the comparison increase in the air flow by 50 resulted in a minor increase in capture with a maximum absolute increase of 6 6 for the 150 μm sieve size increase in the tank length to 30 m in the diffuser zone generally increased capture efficiency there was a maximum absolute increase of 11 for the 74 μm sieve size compared to the current tank the results are consistent with observations in asce 2 regarding longer tanks improving fine particle capture increase in the tank width to 8 m resulted in negligible increase in capture except for the 106 150 micron sieve sizes for which capture efficiency increased by 11 and 8 3 respectively for most sieve sizes the addition of the baffle decreased capture compared to the current tank it was concluded that a successful baffle configuration could be found with more trials however this did illustrate the challenge of traditional design approaches for agts the modification of the tank base had significantly improved wet weather capture relative to both the existing tank and the other modifications the largest increase was for the 106 and 150 μm sieve sizes with increase in the efficiency by 34 this suggests that the current tank configuration with the low point approximately halfway across the tank width is inferior to the arrangement proposed by londong 6 where the low point is offset to one side of the tank the design modification as suggested by londong 6 was the most promising further combining this design modification with the above suggested other modifications may further improve grit capture efficiency it is noted that the floor slope of the investigated tank is formed by mass concrete benching and not structural concrete consequently this modification could be achieved without major structural modifications to the tank although with significant cost 4 conclusions the flow behaviour and capture of grit particles in an industrial scale wwtp agt was investigated by conducting cfd simulations in the simulation wastewater and air phases were modelled using the ee approach and the flow of grit particles was resolved by using the dpm approach transient simulations were run for 100 s physical time in order to progress to a steady state wastewater and air flow field and then discrete grit particles were injected in the flow domain initially the cfd model was validated using plant data on grit removal consequently the model was used to investigate the effect of different operating conditions and modified tank geometries on tank s grit capture efficiency the predictions showed that there were only small changes in the capture efficiency of the tank when air flowrate was either increased 50 or decreased 50 from the current set point 230 nm3 hr the results suggest that there could be significant energy savings if a small amount of capture was sacrificed as blowers used to sparge the air significantly contributes to energy requirement of an agt simulation of a peak wet weather event wastewater flowrate 986 l s resulted in a 50 drop in grit capture several tank modifications were trialled to determine if grit capture could be improved during peak wet weather events small improvements in grit capture were found if the tank length or the tank width was extended or the air flow rate was increased 34 increase in the capture efficiency of smaller particles in a size range of 100 150 μm under wet weather flow conditions was found if the tank base was modified so that the screw conveyor recess was relocated from its current position midway along the width of the tank to a location adjacent to the wall interestingly the addition of a baffle with dimensions based on design guidelines from literature reduced capture during wet weather compared to the current tank with more iterative optimization study it is expected that a baffle configuration could be found that improves capture however this highlights a major challenge in using traditional rule of thumb design approaches for agts further work could consider the organic particles within wastewater this could allow the simulation to consider if these particles settle and are removed from the tank along with the grit particles this would be important for testing alternative design configurations to maximise the amount of inorganic grit removed whilst minimising the amount of organic material removed it is noted however that the organic particles would exhibit complex phenomena including flocculation discrete hindered and compression settling of the near neutral buoyancy particles and would add significant complexity to the modelling it would likely also require additional sampling data to validate declaration of competing

13706,this study optimizes the performances of photosynthetic microbial fuel cells pmfcs under mixotrophic conditions in a cathode chamber inoculated with chlorella vulgaris compared to autotrophic conditions in mixotrophic cultivation microalgae in the cathode chamber were provided with organic and inorganic carbon different chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations of 100 300 and 500 mg l 1 were added in the cathode chamber of pmfcs the cod concentration in the anode chambers was maintained at 1000 mg l 1 and 1500 mg l 1 in the batch 1 and 2 respectively the mixotrophic pmfc with 100 mg l 1 of cod in the cathode chamber showed a longer power generation period with power densities of 3 93 0 74 and 9 07 1 40 mw m 2 in batch 1 and 2 respectively in comparison the pmfc in autotrophic conditions showed lower power generation and higher internal resistance however increasing the cod concentration more than 100 mg l 1 decreased the power generation period due to the favorable conditions for heterotrophic metabolism of microalgae the algal biomass generation in the cathode chamber was highest at 300 mg l 1 of cod the highest ammonium nitrogen removal efficiencies 92 and 82 in batches 1 and 2 respectively were obtained when the cathode chamber was enriched with 300 mg l 1 of cod this study successfully demonstrated that pmfc performances can be increased in terms of power generation and biomass production under the mixotrophic cultivation of chlorella vulgaris keywords photosynthetic microbial fuel cell bioelectricity wastewater treatment chlorella vulgaris biomass organic carbon loading 1 introduction microbial fuel cells mfcs are bio electrochemical devices that can convert the chemical energy stored in organic substrates into electricity using microorganisms 1 2 a typical two chambered mfc has an anode chamber and a cathode chamber separated by a membrane microorganisms attached to the anode oxidize the organic substrates to generate electrons and protons the electrons travel through an external circuit to the cathode chamber producing electricity and protons migrate through a membrane to the cathode chamber generally the cathode chamber is filled with water or a buffer solution and aerated using air pumps on the surface of the cathode electrode electrons protons and oxygen react to form water 3 5 in photosynthetic microbial fuel cells pmfcs the oxygen for the cathodic reaction is supplied by the photosynthetic activities of microalgae in the cathode chamber 6 9 mechanical aeration accounts for approximately half of the total operating cost thus the photosynthetic aeration can significantly reduce the operational costs 8 during autotrophic cultivation microalgae produce oxygen utilizing light and inorganic carbon as their energy and carbon sources respectively 10 in this process nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are also assimilated by microalgae thus pmfcs can treat nutrient rich wastewater in the cathode chamber in addition to the wastewater treatment in the anode chamber ammonium nitrogen is one of the most common forms of nitrogen present in wastewater 11 13 microalgae species such as chlorella sp 14 desmodesmus sp 15 scenedesmus sp 16 and chlamydomonas sp 17 have the ability to efficiently remove ammonium nitrogen from wastewater these microalgae species can directly assimilate ammonium nitrogen into amino acids via the enzymes glutamine synthetase gs and glutamate synthase gogat 18 19 chlorella vulgaris is a commonly used microalgae strain in pmfcs due to its high photosynthetic efficiency to produce oxygen 20 a higher dissolved oxygen do concentration ranging between 12 and 25 mg o2 l 1 was observed in the catholyte with chlorella vulgaris compared to the mfc without the microalgae 2 6 mg o2 l 1 21 the light intensity 6 22 24 and illumination period 8 25 27 are the crucial factors affecting the performance of microalgae in pmfcs a maximum chlorella vulgaris biomass concentration of 4 g l 1 or biomass yield of 0 44 g l 1 day 1 was obtained in continuous light intensity of 10 000 lx however the highest maximum power density of 126 mw m 3 was obtained under the light intensity of 5000 lx the maximum power density dropped when increasing the light intensity to 10 000 lx and decreasing to 3500 lx 9 lower or higher illumination intensities are not suitable for the microalgae photosynthesis due to photo limitation and photo inhibition which affects the growth of the cells 28 in contrast to autotrophic metabolism heterotrophic metabolism uses carbon from organic compounds to acquire energy compared to the autotrophic mode the heterotrophic mode showed enhanced concentrations of chlorella protothecoides 29 chlorella vulgaris 30 31 and chlorella sorokiniana 32 however heterotrophic cultivation is not suitable for pmfc applications due to the cessation of photosynthesis which is important for the cathodic reaction therefore for increased biomass concentration mixotrophic cultivation could be more effective in the cathode chamber of pmfcs mixotrophy is a combination of autotrophy and heterotrophy thus microalgae simultaneously use organic and inorganic carbon sources in the presence of light 33 the autotrophy process utilizes inorganic carbon sources such as carbon dioxide through photosynthesis while the heterotrophy process assimilates organic carbon compounds through aerobic respiration 34 in the tertiary treatment of wastewater microalgae are utilized to process nutrients and some organic compounds thus mixotrophic cultivation can be suitable in an actual wastewater treatment plant mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae provides a promising method to obtain large biomass due to its faster growth rate than the autotrophic mode 35 furthermore mixotrophic metabolism requires lower light intensities thus reducing the operating costs 36 however the application of mixotrophic cultivation in pmfcs can result in the decreased power generation due to the consumption of oxygen for aerobic respiration during the heterotrophic metabolism in mixotrophic cultivation anode effluent which contain low amounts of organic carbon can be circulated to cathode chamber for further treatment in a continuous flow mode pmfc system circulating anode chamber effluent to the cathode chamber achieved up to 93 2 of soluble chemical oxygen demand cod 95 9 of ammonium nitrogen 95 1 of total nitrogen and 82 7 of phosphate phosphorus removal efficiency when treating domestic wastewater this system generated 466 9 mw m 3 of maximum power density and chlorella vulgaris biomass at high growth rates up to 375 7 mg l 1 d 1 37 in circulation systems the organics were mainly treated in the anode chamber and the reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus was mainly carried out in the cathode chamber 37 the maximum power density was doubled by the presence of chlorella vulgaris 34 2 10 0 mw m 2 in the cathode chamber compared to the mfc conducted without the algae with 0 19 g l 1 d 1 of cod and 5 mg l 1 d 1 of ammonium removal rates when treating anode chamber effluent in the cathode chamber in a batch mode 7 however the mixotropic cultivation in the cathode chamber of pmfc was not investigated in details in previous studies to characterize the performances therefore it is important to optimize pmfcs for simultaneous power generation algal biomass production and wastewater treatment using different conditions in the mixotrophic mode to compare with the autotrophic mode in this study the optimization of pmfc was achieved using varied organic carbon loading in the cathode chamber instead of circulating the anode effluent to the cathode chamber the cathode chamber was supplied with defined wastewater containing different concentrations of organic carbon the inorganic carbon was provided with bicarbonate and the cathode chambers were also open to the atmosphere to allow microalgae to gain carbon dioxide from the atmosphere an autotrophic pmfc was also performed without adding organic carbon not all microalgal species can utilize organic carbon to grow 38 chlorella vulgaris is one of the most common species that can be cultured mixotrophically using both organic and inorganic carbon 30 thus chlorella vulgaris was inoculated in the cathode chambers of pmfcs the performances of pmfcs were assessed based on power generation microalgal biomass production cod removal efficiency and ammonium nitrogen removal efficiency to observe the effects of organic carbon loading in the anode chamber on the performance of pmfc two batch experiments were conducted using 1000 and 1500 mg l 1 of cods in the anode chamber 2 methodology 2 1 microbial fuel cell system the

for a total of 5 batches 2 4 pmfc operation the anode chambers of two reactors were filled with synthetic wastewater containing acetate as the sole organic carbon source for bacteria the acetate was provided in a buffer solution to maintain the ph at 7 0 the composition of the synthetic wastewater in the anode chamber was g l 1 3 30 nah2po4 2h2o 4 09 na2hpo4 1 42 nacl and 10 ml of trace element

ammonium nitrogen concentration was maintained at 300 mg l 1 with the addition of ammonium chloride into the synthetic wastewater the cathode chambers of both reactors were filled with this wastewater and inoculated with chlorella vulgaris samples to obtain 0 25 g l 1 of initial biomass the cathode chambers were open to the atmosphere to allow microalgae to gain carbon dioxide from the atmosphere artificial lighting was provided continuously for microalgae using light emitting diode led tube lamps the light intensity was measured by a lux meter the light intensity on the surface of the cathode chamber was 7000 lx voltage readings were recorded at an interval of 5 min using a voltage data logger grant instruments cambridge co ltd across 1000 ω of external resistance first reactor was operated for 16 days and the second reactor for 19 days due to the higher cod content in the anode chamber the cathode and anode chambers were refreshed with the synthetic wastewater each time additionally cathode chambers of both reactors were provided with sodium acetate to maintain the cod concentration at 100 mg l 1 reactors were repeated again with 300 and 500 mg l 1 of cod in the cathode chambers the cathode chambers conducted without adding any organic carbon is denoted by pmfc 1 cathode chambers conducted with 100 300 and 500 mg l 1 of cod are denoted by pmfc 2 3 and 4 respectively each pmfc conducted with 1000 and 1500 mg l 1 of cod in the anode chamber are denoted by batch 1 batch 2 respectively anodic ph was maintained at 7 0 in all pmfcs using the buffer solution however the ph in the cathode chambers varied due to the different organic carbon concentrations the measured ph of pmfc 1 2 3 and 4 were 8 24 8 58 9 37 and 9 37 in the cathode chambers at the beginning of the experiment the organic carbon also affected the conductivity in the catholyte the conductivities in the cathode chamber were 1008 1115 1334 and 1545 μs cm 1 in pmfc 1 2 3 and 4 at the beginning respectively 2 5 polarization test a polarization experiment was performed for pmfcs when the voltage generation stabilized first the pmfc was allowed to reach a steady state in open circuit for 10 15 min and the open circuit voltage ocv was recorded after that different external resistances of 3300 2000 1000 680 500 390 150 100 20 ω were applied in the external circuit the voltage readings were taken at each external resistance after the cell reached a steady state approximately 10 15 min were provided for cells to reach a stabilized voltage polarization test was performed for batch 1 and 2 after 10 days 240 h and 14 days 336 h from the beginning respectively 2 6 analytical methods and calculations the current density id and power density pd normalized to the surface area of the cathode a were calculated according to id v a r and pd v2 a r respectively where r is the external resistance and v is the voltage measured across the external resistance power densities obtained from pmfcs throughout the experiment across 1000 ω external resistance were plotted with respect to time the power curve was plotted as the function of current density and power density the maximum power density value was obtained from the power curve the polarization curve was plotted as a function of current density and voltage the polarization slope method was used to obtain the internal resistance of mfcs samples were taken from the anode and cathode chambers at an interval of 4 days to measure wastewater parameters the cod of the synthetic wastewater in the anode and chambers was measured using the standard closed reflux titrimetric method the ammonium nitrogen concentration in the cathode chambers was measured using the standard titrimetric method removal efficiencies were calculated as the ratio of the removed substrate to the initial substrate biomass generation was measured by a spectrophotometer thermo scientific genesys 10s uv vis thermo fisher scientific usa the use of optical density is an indirect method widely used for non invasive measurement of microalgae biomass the optical density measurements are directly correlated with the number of cells in the medium the maximum absorbance was inspected by scanning sample cultures between 550 and 800 nm using the spectrophotometer the maximum absorbance was observed at 683 nm for the analyzed chlorella vulgaris samples the absorbance value at the maximum absorbance was converted to dry microalgae biomass concentration in g l 1 using a standard curve do was monitored by a do meter ysi 550a xylem inc usa ph was measured using a ph meter starter 3100 ohaus usa and conductivity meter sevengo mettler toledo s a e spain was used to measure the conductivity of the wastewater 3 results and discussion 3 1 power generation of pmfcs power densities obtained from pmfcs across 1000 ohms of external resistance are shown in fig 2 and 3 for batch 1 and 2 respectively in all pmfcs power generation was higher in batch 2 compared to batch 1 the only variation for each pmfc was the cod concentration in the anode chamber during batch 1 the cod concentration in the anode chamber was 1000 mg l 1 it was increased to 1500 mg l 1 in batch 2 therefore the increased power generation was solely due to the increased cod concentration in the anode chamber anodic bacteria biofilm rapidly converted the organics in the wastewater to electricity when supplied in sufficient quantity to promote electricity generation 40 however a high organic matter particle content can restrict the movement of protons in the anode chamber substrate therefore when the organic loading exceeds a specific concentration the power density decreased due to the increased internal resistance of the cell 41 reddy et al 2010 obtained increased power generation when increasing the organic loading rate olr from 0 195 to 0 911 kg m 3 d 1 in the cathode chamber however the power generation dropped with 1 589 kg m 3 d 1 of olr 42 increasing the concentration of cod from 1000 mg l 1 to 1500 mg l 1 acetate increased the power generation in the cell due to the favorable conditions for bacteria biofilm with higher organic matter in wastewater pmfc 4 achieved high power density generation during the both batches it was 8 20 0 42 and 10 68 0 88 mw m 2 during batch 1 and batch 2 respectively batch 1 and batch 2 achieved this high power generation state after 46 and 65 h from the start of the experiment respectively the do in the cathode compartment was 16 58 0 62 mg l 1 during this period however pmfc 4 maintained this power generation for a short period approximately 57 and 105 h in batch 1 and 2 respectively after that the power generation dropped to 0 mw m 2 in batch 1 during batch 2 it maintained at 0 28 0 03 mw m 2 until the end of the experiment the power density drop can be explained by the do concentration during this period the do concentration was 5 58 1 00 mg l 1 during the low power generation period this could be due to the favorable conditions for heterotrophic metabolism because of the high organic carbon concentration in the cathode chamber of pmfc 4 autotrophic metabolism of chlorella vulgaris generating oxygen via photosynthesis diminished resulting in a decreased cathodic reaction a high power generation with high do concentration at the initial stage for a short period suggested that chlorella vulgaris promoted autotrophic metabolism later heterotrophic metabolism predominated in chlorella vulgaris compared to pmfc 4 a longer period of power generation was observed in pmfc 3 the power generation reached to a maximum of 8 75 mw m 2 after 55 h in batch 1 after 55 h the power density gradually dropped to 2 63 mw m 2 during next 115 h the power generation continued at 2 90 0 25 for another 27 h before it dropped to 0 mw m 2 in batch 2 power generation reached to a maximum of 8 95 mw m 2 at 58th hour after that the power density was gradually dropped to 4 69 mw m 2 at 128th hour and again gradually increased to 6 07 mw m 2 at 162nd hour the power generation maintained at 6 54 0 20 mw m 2 during the next 139 h of period before it dropped to a low power density generation range during the peak voltage period of pmfc 3 the do was approximately 14 72 2 11 mg l 1 the do concentration dropped to 9 47 1 68 mg l 1 in the later period this suggested that the autotrophic mode was maintained in the pmfc 3 for a longer period than that of pmfc 4 the best performance in the cell under mixotrophic algal cultivation in the cathode chamber was achieved by pmfc 2 during batch 1 and batch 2 the power generation was maintained at 3 93 0 74 mw m 2 for 260 h and 9 07 1 40 mw m 2 for 320 h respectively this could be due to the higher do concentration in the cathode compartment the do in the cathode chamber was 12 29 1 47 mg l 1 in pmfc 2 these results showed that increasing the organic carbon concentration in the cathode chamber decreased the period of the autotrophic mode achieved by chlorella vulgaris chlorella vulgaris switched to heterotrophic metabolism within a shorter period with an increase in the organic carbon concentration the results suggested that better power generation in the cell can be achieved at low concentrations of organic carbon acetate in the cathode chamber the optimum organic carbon acetate concentration in the cathode chamber for a pmfc in terms of power generation was 100 mg l 1 this could be due to a decrease in photosynthesis with decreased oxygen production when high concentrations of organic carbon are available in the growth medium high organic carbon concentrations provide favorable conditions for heterotrophic metabolism 43 heterotrophic metabolism also uses oxygen for aerobic respiration 34 which can further decrease the available do for the cathodic reaction pmfc 1 showed stable power generation of 3 20 0 27 mw m 2 for 260 h and 5 91 0 50 mw m 2 for 390 h in batch 1 and 2 respectively during this period the do concentration was 10 70 2 15 mg l 1 in the cathode chamber pmfc 2 conducted in mixotrophic conditions showed higher power generation compared to the autotrophic pmfc 1 kang et al 2004 studied organic and inorganic carbon metabolism during the mixotrophic cultivation of synechococcus sp using 3 g of glucose per l 44 according to the results the net photosynthesis rate was 263 μmol o2 mg chl a h 1 for the mixotrophic culture and 146 μmol o2 mg chl a h 1 for the autotrophic culture a higher photosynthesis rate was observed in mixotrophic conditions than in autotrophic conditions power and polarization curves obtained for pmfc 1 autotrophic cultivation and pmfc 2 mixotrophic cultivation are shown in fig 4 a and 4b respectively pmfc 2 showed the highest maximum power density of 10 25 mw m 2 compared to the pmfc 1 6 25 mw m 2 in batch 1 in batch 2 a maximum power density of 7 13 mw m 2 and 11 63 mw m 2 was obtained in pmfc 1 and pmfc 2 respectively the internal resistances calculated from the polarization curve for pmfc 1 and 2 were 549 4 and 435 8 ω in batch 1 respectively higher internal resistances of 731 3 and 588 2 ω were obtained in batch 2 for pmfc 1 and 2 respectively higher maximum power densities and lower internal resistances were obtained in the pmfc 2 which conducted under mixotrophic conditions compared to the autotrophic pmfc table 1 provides a comparison of maximum power density obtained in this study with some previous studies del campo et al 2014 achieved a high power density of 14 4 mw m 2 using fruit processing wastewater inoculated with activated sludge in the anode chamber and bold s basal media inoculated with chlorella vulgaris in the cathode chamber 45 power overshoot was often encountered when evaluating polarization curves in numerous mfc studies 46 51 power overshoot refers to the phenomenon of doubling back of the power density curve towards lower current densities rather than the expected higher current density value 52 54 the power overshoot behavior of pmfcs can be observed in some power curves fig 4a at high current densities power overshoot occurred due to the insufficient acclimation of the biofilm to either high current densities or more positive anode potentials prior to the polarization test 54 it was shown that the power overshoot could be eliminated through acclimation of the mfc to low external resistances 53 54 or through proper acclimation of the biofilm to higher potentials 55 3 2 biomass generation in pmfcs fig 5 a shows the final biomass concentration obtained in the cathode chamber of pmfcs during 16 batch 1 and 19 batch 2 days of operation biomass productivities obtained in pmfcs are shown in fig 5b the algal biomass concentrations in the cathode chamber increased with increasing cod concentration from 0 to 300 mg l 1 the highest biomass generation was obtained in pmfc 3 that contained 300 mg l 1 of cod the biomass concentration of pmfc 3 increased from 0 25 to 3 07 g l 1 in 16 days during batch 1 and it was increased by a total biomass concentration of 3 11 g l 1 during 19 days in batch 2 the corresponding biomass productivities were 0 176 and 0 164 g l 1 day 1 in batch 1 and 2 respectively the biomass productivities obtained in the pmfc 1 under autotrophic conditions were 0 104 and 0 091 g l 1 day 1 in batch 1 and 2 respectively results suggested that the mixotrophic cultivation of chlorella vulgaris can enhance the biomass generation a higher growth rate of 0 44 d 1 was obtained by kim et al 2013 under mixotrophic conditions than autotrophic conditions 0 24 d 1 using chlorella sorokiniana 35 higher cell density was also reported with mixotrophic cultures due to the growth stimulating effects of light and carbon dioxide utilization 56 increasing the cod concentration to 500 mg l 1 in pmfc 4 decreased the biomass generation compared to 300 mg l 1 of cod the biomass productivities of pmfc 4 were 0 146 and 0 126 g l 1 day 1 in batch 1 and batch 2 respectively according to a study by chandra et al 2014 mixed microalgae culture cultivated under different glucose concentrations of 0 500 1000 2000 and 3000 mg l 1 for 8 days resulted in higher biomass productivity at lower carbon loading 500 mg cod l 1 57 results suggested that the optimum concentration of cod in the cathode chamber for chlorella vulgaris biomass generation using acetate as the organic carbon substrate was 300 mg l 1 the concentrations of carbon provided in terms of organic carbon was 0 0376 0 1127 and 0 1878 g l 1 in pmfc 2 3 and 4 in the cathode chamber respectively the concentrations of carbon provided in terms of inorganic carbon was 0 0146 g l 1 for all pmfcs therefore the total carbon concentration in pmfc 1 2 3 and 4 were 0 0146 0 0522 0 1273 and 0 2024 g l 1 respectively the nitrogen concentration in the cathode chambers was 0 2333 g l 1 therefore c n ratios were 0 063 0 224 0 546 and 0 868 in pmfc 1 2 3 and 4 respectively in terms of biomass generation better performance was achieved with the c n ratio of 0 546 in this study the nitrogen concentration was fixed at a constant and the c n ratio varied using the organic carbon the effects of different nitrogen concentration on the pmfc performance was not investigated in this study studies have reported that high amount of nitrogen can reduce biomass growth a study conducted by huang et al 2017 under phosphate concentration of 1460 mg l 1 using chlorella vulgaris a biomass of 3 50 and 4 70 g l 1 was generated in 13 days under nitrate concentrations of 182 4 and 364 8 g l 1 respectively when cultivated without adding nitrogen the biomass was only 0 59 g l 1 however increase in nitrogen concentration to 547 2 mg l 1 resulted in decrease in biomass to 4 59 g l 1 the biomass generation was further decreased to 3 13 g l 1 with 729 6 mg l 1 of nitrate concentration 58 3 3 wastewater treatment of pmfcs fig 6 a shows the cod removal efficiency in both batches since different initial cod concentrations and retention times were used in batch 1 and batch 2 the cod removal data were normalized and reported as the cod removal rate mg l 1 day 1 fig 6b the results suggested that all pmfcs achieved similar cod removal rates in the anode chamber the effects of the anode biofilm on the performance of pmfc were eliminated by acclimatizing the anode electrode with bacteria biofilm before the experiment therefore all the pmfcs acquired mature biofilm status before the experiment the variation in the pmfc performances solely depended on the cod changes in the cathode chamber since the anode chamber conditions were similar for each batch the variation of cod removal efficiency with time and the total cod removal efficiencies in the cathode chambers are shown in fig 7 a and 7b respectively the corresponding cod removal rates are shown in fig 7c the highest cod removal efficiency was obtained with an initial cod concentration of 100 mg l 1 cod removal efficiency decreased when the initial cod concentration increased higher cod concentrations required a longer retention period to achieve high cod removal efficiencies high cod removal rates were achieved when increasing the cod concentration in the cathode chamber the highest cod removal rate was obtained with 500 mg l 1 of cod these results indicate that chlorella vulgaris utilized acetate as the organic carbon source during mixotrophic cultivation heterotrophic metabolism assimilates organic substrates to acquire energy 34 some species such as phaeodactylum tricornutum showed negative effects from sodium acetate by slowing growth with a consequent decrease in biomass concentration and biomass productivity 36 ammonium nitrogen removal efficiencies in the cathode chambers are shown in fig 8 the highest ammonium nitrogen removal efficiencies were obtained in pmfc 3 operated under mixotrophic conditions with an initial cod concentration of 300 mg l 1 in the cathode chamber the ammonium nitrogen removal efficiency was 92 and 82 for batch 1 and 2 respectively the corresponding ammonia nitrogen removal rates were approximately 17 and 13 mg l 1 day 1 for batch 1 and 2 respectively the ammonia nitrogen removal rates obtained under autotrophic conditions in pmfc 1 were approximately 12 and 11 mg l 1 day 1 for batch 1 and 2 respectively these results indicate that the wastewater can be treated efficiently for ammonium nitrogen in a pmfc by chlorella vulgaris under mixotrophic conditions if supplemented with the appropriate organic carbon concentration in the cathode chamber according to a study conducted by evans et al 2017 higher levels of ammonia nitrogen treatment were achieved by enrichment of wastewater with glucose for chlorella vulgaris 59 commault et al 2017 reported 5 mg l 1 day 1 of ammonium consumption by chlorella vulgaris with an 8 day retention period in the cathode chamber of a pmfc 7 3 4 practical applications of pmfc pmfc is an efficient alternative approach for algal biomass generation and wastewater treatment this study demonstrated the potential of chlorella vulgaris in reducing the nitrogen and organic carbon contents from the wastewater in pmfcs while generating the biomass chlorella vulgaris can provide feedstock to produce a variety of biofuels due to their high lipid content ranging from 14 to 63 of dry weight 60 62 microalgae biomass is considered as one of the promising alternatives to current biofuel crops such as soybean corn etc since no competition with agricultural food and feed production 63 under mixotrophic conditions chlorella vulgaris can accumulate high amounts of lipids compared to the autotrophic conditions therefore mixotrophic cultivation of chlorella vulgaris in pmfcs is more appropriate for biomass generation to further process biofuels another promising application of microalgae is for animal feed due to the increasing demand for food with natural composition instead of synthesized ingredients chlorella vulgaris can accumulate carotenoids in certain conditions which enhanced the health and life expectancy of animals 64 power generation is one of the main aspects of mfc technology however the power output generated from an individual pmfc unit is insufficient for most practical applications a series configuration of individual mfc units can enhance the power generation a study by wu et al employed a 72 l stack made of 5 membrane based mfc units and achieved power density of 50 9 w m 3 65 another pilot study utilized five 18 l modules total volume of 90 l with brewery wastewater and generated electricity to drive the catholyte recirculation pump 66 up to 90 of cod removal efficiency and up to 60 w m 3 of power generation were achieved with a 50 modules stack containing total of 1000 l of real municipal wastewater tested for 1 year 67 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that the pmfc can be operated under mixotrophic conditions with power generation wastewater treatment and algal biomass production simultaneously power generation in a pmfc increased when chlorella vulgaris was cultivated under mixotrophic conditions with 100 mg l 1 of cod compared to autotrophic conditions however increasing the organic carbon further in the cathode chamber decreased the power generation biomass production in the cathode chamber increased under mixotrophic cultivation of chlorella vulgaris maximum power generation and biomass was observed at the c n ratio of 0 224 and 0 546 respectively chlorella vulgaris achieved approximately 100 of cod removal efficiency during 16 days when the initial cod is 100 mg l 1 in the cathode chamber moreover ammonia can also be assimilated by chlorella vulgaris under mixotrophic condition however due to complexity of industrial wastewater utilizing wastewater from industries under mixotrophic conditions in a pmfc should be further investigated declaration of

13706,this study optimizes the performances of photosynthetic microbial fuel cells pmfcs under mixotrophic conditions in a cathode chamber inoculated with chlorella vulgaris compared to autotrophic conditions in mixotrophic cultivation microalgae in the cathode chamber were provided with organic and inorganic carbon different chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations of 100 300 and 500 mg l 1 were added in the cathode chamber of pmfcs the cod concentration in the anode chambers was maintained at 1000 mg l 1 and 1500 mg l 1 in the batch 1 and 2 respectively the mixotrophic pmfc with 100 mg l 1 of cod in the cathode chamber showed a longer power generation period with power densities of 3 93 0 74 and 9 07 1 40 mw m 2 in batch 1 and 2 respectively in comparison the pmfc in autotrophic conditions showed lower power generation and higher internal resistance however increasing the cod concentration more than 100 mg l 1 decreased the power generation period due to the favorable conditions for heterotrophic metabolism of microalgae the algal biomass generation in the cathode chamber was highest at 300 mg l 1 of cod the highest ammonium nitrogen removal efficiencies 92 and 82 in batches 1 and 2 respectively were obtained when the cathode chamber was enriched with 300 mg l 1 of cod this study successfully demonstrated that pmfc performances can be increased in terms of power generation and biomass production under the mixotrophic cultivation of chlorella vulgaris keywords photosynthetic microbial fuel cell bioelectricity wastewater treatment chlorella vulgaris biomass organic carbon loading 1 introduction microbial fuel cells mfcs are bio electrochemical devices that can convert the chemical energy stored in organic substrates into electricity using microorganisms 1 2 a typical two chambered mfc has an anode chamber and a cathode chamber separated by a membrane microorganisms attached to the anode oxidize the organic substrates to generate electrons and protons the electrons travel through an external circuit to the cathode chamber producing electricity and protons migrate through a membrane to the cathode chamber generally the cathode chamber is filled with water or a buffer solution and aerated using air pumps on the surface of the cathode electrode electrons protons and oxygen react to form water 3 5 in photosynthetic microbial fuel cells pmfcs the oxygen for the cathodic reaction is supplied by the photosynthetic activities of microalgae in the cathode chamber 6 9 mechanical aeration accounts for approximately half of the total operating cost thus the photosynthetic aeration can significantly reduce the operational costs 8 during autotrophic cultivation microalgae produce oxygen utilizing light and inorganic carbon as their energy and carbon sources respectively 10 in this process nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are also assimilated by microalgae thus pmfcs can treat nutrient rich wastewater in the cathode chamber in addition to the wastewater treatment in the anode chamber ammonium nitrogen is one of the most common forms of nitrogen present in wastewater 11 13 microalgae species such as chlorella sp 14 desmodesmus sp 15 scenedesmus sp 16 and chlamydomonas sp 17 have the ability to efficiently remove ammonium nitrogen from wastewater these microalgae species can directly assimilate ammonium nitrogen into amino acids via the enzymes glutamine synthetase gs and glutamate synthase gogat 18 19 chlorella vulgaris is a commonly used microalgae strain in pmfcs due to its high photosynthetic efficiency to produce oxygen 20 a higher dissolved oxygen do concentration ranging between 12 and 25 mg o2 l 1 was observed in the catholyte with chlorella vulgaris compared to the mfc without the microalgae 2 6 mg o2 l 1 21 the light intensity 6 22 24 and illumination period 8 25 27 are the crucial factors affecting the performance of microalgae in pmfcs a maximum chlorella vulgaris biomass concentration of 4 g l 1 or biomass yield of 0 44 g l 1 day 1 was obtained in continuous light intensity of 10 000 lx however the highest maximum power density of 126 mw m 3 was obtained under the light intensity of 5000 lx the maximum power density dropped when increasing the light intensity to 10 000 lx and decreasing to 3500 lx 9 lower or higher illumination intensities are not suitable for the microalgae photosynthesis due to photo limitation and photo inhibition which affects the growth of the cells 28 in contrast to autotrophic metabolism heterotrophic metabolism uses carbon from organic compounds to acquire energy compared to the autotrophic mode the heterotrophic mode showed enhanced concentrations of chlorella protothecoides 29 chlorella vulgaris 30 31 and chlorella sorokiniana 32 however heterotrophic cultivation is not suitable for pmfc applications due to the cessation of photosynthesis which is important for the cathodic reaction therefore for increased biomass concentration mixotrophic cultivation could be more effective in the cathode chamber of pmfcs mixotrophy is a combination of autotrophy and heterotrophy thus microalgae simultaneously use organic and inorganic carbon sources in the presence of light 33 the autotrophy process utilizes inorganic carbon sources such as carbon dioxide through photosynthesis while the heterotrophy process assimilates organic carbon compounds through aerobic respiration 34 in the tertiary treatment of wastewater microalgae are utilized to process nutrients and some organic compounds thus mixotrophic cultivation can be suitable in an actual wastewater treatment plant mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae provides a promising method to obtain large biomass due to its faster growth rate than the autotrophic mode 35 furthermore mixotrophic metabolism requires lower light intensities thus reducing the operating costs 36 however the application of mixotrophic cultivation in pmfcs can result in the decreased power generation due to the consumption of oxygen for aerobic respiration during the heterotrophic metabolism in mixotrophic cultivation anode effluent which contain low amounts of organic carbon can be circulated to cathode chamber for further treatment in a continuous flow mode pmfc system circulating anode chamber effluent to the cathode chamber achieved up to 93 2 of soluble chemical oxygen demand cod 95 9 of ammonium nitrogen 95 1 of total nitrogen and 82 7 of phosphate phosphorus removal efficiency when treating domestic wastewater this system generated 466 9 mw m 3 of maximum power density and chlorella vulgaris biomass at high growth rates up to 375 7 mg l 1 d 1 37 in circulation systems the organics were mainly treated in the anode chamber and the reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus was mainly carried out in the cathode chamber 37 the maximum power density was doubled by the presence of chlorella vulgaris 34 2 10 0 mw m 2 in the cathode chamber compared to the mfc conducted without the algae with 0 19 g l 1 d 1 of cod and 5 mg l 1 d 1 of ammonium removal rates when treating anode chamber effluent in the cathode chamber in a batch mode 7 however the mixotropic cultivation in the cathode chamber of pmfc was not investigated in details in previous studies to characterize the performances therefore it is important to optimize pmfcs for simultaneous power generation algal biomass production and wastewater treatment using different conditions in the mixotrophic mode to compare with the autotrophic mode in this study the optimization of pmfc was achieved using varied organic carbon loading in the cathode chamber instead of circulating the anode effluent to the cathode chamber the cathode chamber was supplied with defined wastewater containing different concentrations of organic carbon the inorganic carbon was provided with bicarbonate and the cathode chambers were also open to the atmosphere to allow microalgae to gain carbon dioxide from the atmosphere an autotrophic pmfc was also performed without adding organic carbon not all microalgal species can utilize organic carbon to grow 38 chlorella vulgaris is one of the most common species that can be cultured mixotrophically using both organic and inorganic carbon 30 thus chlorella vulgaris was inoculated in the cathode chambers of pmfcs the performances of pmfcs were assessed based on power generation microalgal biomass production cod removal efficiency and ammonium nitrogen removal efficiency to observe the effects of organic carbon loading in the anode chamber on the performance of pmfc two batch experiments were conducted using 1000 and 1500 mg l 1 of cods in the anode chamber 2 methodology 2 1 microbial fuel cell system the

for a total of 5 batches 2 4 pmfc operation the anode chambers of two reactors were filled with synthetic wastewater containing acetate as the sole organic carbon source for bacteria the acetate was provided in a buffer solution to maintain the ph at 7 0 the composition of the synthetic wastewater in the anode chamber was g l 1 3 30 nah2po4 2h2o 4 09 na2hpo4 1 42 nacl and 10 ml of trace element

ammonium nitrogen concentration was maintained at 300 mg l 1 with the addition of ammonium chloride into the synthetic wastewater the cathode chambers of both reactors were filled with this wastewater and inoculated with chlorella vulgaris samples to obtain 0 25 g l 1 of initial biomass the cathode chambers were open to the atmosphere to allow microalgae to gain carbon dioxide from the atmosphere artificial lighting was provided continuously for microalgae using light emitting diode led tube lamps the light intensity was measured by a lux meter the light intensity on the surface of the cathode chamber was 7000 lx voltage readings were recorded at an interval of 5 min using a voltage data logger grant instruments cambridge co ltd across 1000 ω of external resistance first reactor was operated for 16 days and the second reactor for 19 days due to the higher cod content in the anode chamber the cathode and anode chambers were refreshed with the synthetic wastewater each time additionally cathode chambers of both reactors were provided with sodium acetate to maintain the cod concentration at 100 mg l 1 reactors were repeated again with 300 and 500 mg l 1 of cod in the cathode chambers the cathode chambers conducted without adding any organic carbon is denoted by pmfc 1 cathode chambers conducted with 100 300 and 500 mg l 1 of cod are denoted by pmfc 2 3 and 4 respectively each pmfc conducted with 1000 and 1500 mg l 1 of cod in the anode chamber are denoted by batch 1 batch 2 respectively anodic ph was maintained at 7 0 in all pmfcs using the buffer solution however the ph in the cathode chambers varied due to the different organic carbon concentrations the measured ph of pmfc 1 2 3 and 4 were 8 24 8 58 9 37 and 9 37 in the cathode chambers at the beginning of the experiment the organic carbon also affected the conductivity in the catholyte the conductivities in the cathode chamber were 1008 1115 1334 and 1545 μs cm 1 in pmfc 1 2 3 and 4 at the beginning respectively 2 5 polarization test a polarization experiment was performed for pmfcs when the voltage generation stabilized first the pmfc was allowed to reach a steady state in open circuit for 10 15 min and the open circuit voltage ocv was recorded after that different external resistances of 3300 2000 1000 680 500 390 150 100 20 ω were applied in the external circuit the voltage readings were taken at each external resistance after the cell reached a steady state approximately 10 15 min were provided for cells to reach a stabilized voltage polarization test was performed for batch 1 and 2 after 10 days 240 h and 14 days 336 h from the beginning respectively 2 6 analytical methods and calculations the current density id and power density pd normalized to the surface area of the cathode a were calculated according to id v a r and pd v2 a r respectively where r is the external resistance and v is the voltage measured across the external resistance power densities obtained from pmfcs throughout the experiment across 1000 ω external resistance were plotted with respect to time the power curve was plotted as the function of current density and power density the maximum power density value was obtained from the power curve the polarization curve was plotted as a function of current density and voltage the polarization slope method was used to obtain the internal resistance of mfcs samples were taken from the anode and cathode chambers at an interval of 4 days to measure wastewater parameters the cod of the synthetic wastewater in the anode and chambers was measured using the standard closed reflux titrimetric method the ammonium nitrogen concentration in the cathode chambers was measured using the standard titrimetric method removal efficiencies were calculated as the ratio of the removed substrate to the initial substrate biomass generation was measured by a spectrophotometer thermo scientific genesys 10s uv vis thermo fisher scientific usa the use of optical density is an indirect method widely used for non invasive measurement of microalgae biomass the optical density measurements are directly correlated with the number of cells in the medium the maximum absorbance was inspected by scanning sample cultures between 550 and 800 nm using the spectrophotometer the maximum absorbance was observed at 683 nm for the analyzed chlorella vulgaris samples the absorbance value at the maximum absorbance was converted to dry microalgae biomass concentration in g l 1 using a standard curve do was monitored by a do meter ysi 550a xylem inc usa ph was measured using a ph meter starter 3100 ohaus usa and conductivity meter sevengo mettler toledo s a e spain was used to measure the conductivity of the wastewater 3 results and discussion 3 1 power generation of pmfcs power densities obtained from pmfcs across 1000 ohms of external resistance are shown in fig 2 and 3 for batch 1 and 2 respectively in all pmfcs power generation was higher in batch 2 compared to batch 1 the only variation for each pmfc was the cod concentration in the anode chamber during batch 1 the cod concentration in the anode chamber was 1000 mg l 1 it was increased to 1500 mg l 1 in batch 2 therefore the increased power generation was solely due to the increased cod concentration in the anode chamber anodic bacteria biofilm rapidly converted the organics in the wastewater to electricity when supplied in sufficient quantity to promote electricity generation 40 however a high organic matter particle content can restrict the movement of protons in the anode chamber substrate therefore when the organic loading exceeds a specific concentration the power density decreased due to the increased internal resistance of the cell 41 reddy et al 2010 obtained increased power generation when increasing the organic loading rate olr from 0 195 to 0 911 kg m 3 d 1 in the cathode chamber however the power generation dropped with 1 589 kg m 3 d 1 of olr 42 increasing the concentration of cod from 1000 mg l 1 to 1500 mg l 1 acetate increased the power generation in the cell due to the favorable conditions for bacteria biofilm with higher organic matter in wastewater pmfc 4 achieved high power density generation during the both batches it was 8 20 0 42 and 10 68 0 88 mw m 2 during batch 1 and batch 2 respectively batch 1 and batch 2 achieved this high power generation state after 46 and 65 h from the start of the experiment respectively the do in the cathode compartment was 16 58 0 62 mg l 1 during this period however pmfc 4 maintained this power generation for a short period approximately 57 and 105 h in batch 1 and 2 respectively after that the power generation dropped to 0 mw m 2 in batch 1 during batch 2 it maintained at 0 28 0 03 mw m 2 until the end of the experiment the power density drop can be explained by the do concentration during this period the do concentration was 5 58 1 00 mg l 1 during the low power generation period this could be due to the favorable conditions for heterotrophic metabolism because of the high organic carbon concentration in the cathode chamber of pmfc 4 autotrophic metabolism of chlorella vulgaris generating oxygen via photosynthesis diminished resulting in a decreased cathodic reaction a high power generation with high do concentration at the initial stage for a short period suggested that chlorella vulgaris promoted autotrophic metabolism later heterotrophic metabolism predominated in chlorella vulgaris compared to pmfc 4 a longer period of power generation was observed in pmfc 3 the power generation reached to a maximum of 8 75 mw m 2 after 55 h in batch 1 after 55 h the power density gradually dropped to 2 63 mw m 2 during next 115 h the power generation continued at 2 90 0 25 for another 27 h before it dropped to 0 mw m 2 in batch 2 power generation reached to a maximum of 8 95 mw m 2 at 58th hour after that the power density was gradually dropped to 4 69 mw m 2 at 128th hour and again gradually increased to 6 07 mw m 2 at 162nd hour the power generation maintained at 6 54 0 20 mw m 2 during the next 139 h of period before it dropped to a low power density generation range during the peak voltage period of pmfc 3 the do was approximately 14 72 2 11 mg l 1 the do concentration dropped to 9 47 1 68 mg l 1 in the later period this suggested that the autotrophic mode was maintained in the pmfc 3 for a longer period than that of pmfc 4 the best performance in the cell under mixotrophic algal cultivation in the cathode chamber was achieved by pmfc 2 during batch 1 and batch 2 the power generation was maintained at 3 93 0 74 mw m 2 for 260 h and 9 07 1 40 mw m 2 for 320 h respectively this could be due to the higher do concentration in the cathode compartment the do in the cathode chamber was 12 29 1 47 mg l 1 in pmfc 2 these results showed that increasing the organic carbon concentration in the cathode chamber decreased the period of the autotrophic mode achieved by chlorella vulgaris chlorella vulgaris switched to heterotrophic metabolism within a shorter period with an increase in the organic carbon concentration the results suggested that better power generation in the cell can be achieved at low concentrations of organic carbon acetate in the cathode chamber the optimum organic carbon acetate concentration in the cathode chamber for a pmfc in terms of power generation was 100 mg l 1 this could be due to a decrease in photosynthesis with decreased oxygen production when high concentrations of organic carbon are available in the growth medium high organic carbon concentrations provide favorable conditions for heterotrophic metabolism 43 heterotrophic metabolism also uses oxygen for aerobic respiration 34 which can further decrease the available do for the cathodic reaction pmfc 1 showed stable power generation of 3 20 0 27 mw m 2 for 260 h and 5 91 0 50 mw m 2 for 390 h in batch 1 and 2 respectively during this period the do concentration was 10 70 2 15 mg l 1 in the cathode chamber pmfc 2 conducted in mixotrophic conditions showed higher power generation compared to the autotrophic pmfc 1 kang et al 2004 studied organic and inorganic carbon metabolism during the mixotrophic cultivation of synechococcus sp using 3 g of glucose per l 44 according to the results the net photosynthesis rate was 263 μmol o2 mg chl a h 1 for the mixotrophic culture and 146 μmol o2 mg chl a h 1 for the autotrophic culture a higher photosynthesis rate was observed in mixotrophic conditions than in autotrophic conditions power and polarization curves obtained for pmfc 1 autotrophic cultivation and pmfc 2 mixotrophic cultivation are shown in fig 4 a and 4b respectively pmfc 2 showed the highest maximum power density of 10 25 mw m 2 compared to the pmfc 1 6 25 mw m 2 in batch 1 in batch 2 a maximum power density of 7 13 mw m 2 and 11 63 mw m 2 was obtained in pmfc 1 and pmfc 2 respectively the internal resistances calculated from the polarization curve for pmfc 1 and 2 were 549 4 and 435 8 ω in batch 1 respectively higher internal resistances of 731 3 and 588 2 ω were obtained in batch 2 for pmfc 1 and 2 respectively higher maximum power densities and lower internal resistances were obtained in the pmfc 2 which conducted under mixotrophic conditions compared to the autotrophic pmfc table 1 provides a comparison of maximum power density obtained in this study with some previous studies del campo et al 2014 achieved a high power density of 14 4 mw m 2 using fruit processing wastewater inoculated with activated sludge in the anode chamber and bold s basal media inoculated with chlorella vulgaris in the cathode chamber 45 power overshoot was often encountered when evaluating polarization curves in numerous mfc studies 46 51 power overshoot refers to the phenomenon of doubling back of the power density curve towards lower current densities rather than the expected higher current density value 52 54 the power overshoot behavior of pmfcs can be observed in some power curves fig 4a at high current densities power overshoot occurred due to the insufficient acclimation of the biofilm to either high current densities or more positive anode potentials prior to the polarization test 54 it was shown that the power overshoot could be eliminated through acclimation of the mfc to low external resistances 53 54 or through proper acclimation of the biofilm to higher potentials 55 3 2 biomass generation in pmfcs fig 5 a shows the final biomass concentration obtained in the cathode chamber of pmfcs during 16 batch 1 and 19 batch 2 days of operation biomass productivities obtained in pmfcs are shown in fig 5b the algal biomass concentrations in the cathode chamber increased with increasing cod concentration from 0 to 300 mg l 1 the highest biomass generation was obtained in pmfc 3 that contained 300 mg l 1 of cod the biomass concentration of pmfc 3 increased from 0 25 to 3 07 g l 1 in 16 days during batch 1 and it was increased by a total biomass concentration of 3 11 g l 1 during 19 days in batch 2 the corresponding biomass productivities were 0 176 and 0 164 g l 1 day 1 in batch 1 and 2 respectively the biomass productivities obtained in the pmfc 1 under autotrophic conditions were 0 104 and 0 091 g l 1 day 1 in batch 1 and 2 respectively results suggested that the mixotrophic cultivation of chlorella vulgaris can enhance the biomass generation a higher growth rate of 0 44 d 1 was obtained by kim et al 2013 under mixotrophic conditions than autotrophic conditions 0 24 d 1 using chlorella sorokiniana 35 higher cell density was also reported with mixotrophic cultures due to the growth stimulating effects of light and carbon dioxide utilization 56 increasing the cod concentration to 500 mg l 1 in pmfc 4 decreased the biomass generation compared to 300 mg l 1 of cod the biomass productivities of pmfc 4 were 0 146 and 0 126 g l 1 day 1 in batch 1 and batch 2 respectively according to a study by chandra et al 2014 mixed microalgae culture cultivated under different glucose concentrations of 0 500 1000 2000 and 3000 mg l 1 for 8 days resulted in higher biomass productivity at lower carbon loading 500 mg cod l 1 57 results suggested that the optimum concentration of cod in the cathode chamber for chlorella vulgaris biomass generation using acetate as the organic carbon substrate was 300 mg l 1 the concentrations of carbon provided in terms of organic carbon was 0 0376 0 1127 and 0 1878 g l 1 in pmfc 2 3 and 4 in the cathode chamber respectively the concentrations of carbon provided in terms of inorganic carbon was 0 0146 g l 1 for all pmfcs therefore the total carbon concentration in pmfc 1 2 3 and 4 were 0 0146 0 0522 0 1273 and 0 2024 g l 1 respectively the nitrogen concentration in the cathode chambers was 0 2333 g l 1 therefore c n ratios were 0 063 0 224 0 546 and 0 868 in pmfc 1 2 3 and 4 respectively in terms of biomass generation better performance was achieved with the c n ratio of 0 546 in this study the nitrogen concentration was fixed at a constant and the c n ratio varied using the organic carbon the effects of different nitrogen concentration on the pmfc performance was not investigated in this study studies have reported that high amount of nitrogen can reduce biomass growth a study conducted by huang et al 2017 under phosphate concentration of 1460 mg l 1 using chlorella vulgaris a biomass of 3 50 and 4 70 g l 1 was generated in 13 days under nitrate concentrations of 182 4 and 364 8 g l 1 respectively when cultivated without adding nitrogen the biomass was only 0 59 g l 1 however increase in nitrogen concentration to 547 2 mg l 1 resulted in decrease in biomass to 4 59 g l 1 the biomass generation was further decreased to 3 13 g l 1 with 729 6 mg l 1 of nitrate concentration 58 3 3 wastewater treatment of pmfcs fig 6 a shows the cod removal efficiency in both batches since different initial cod concentrations and retention times were used in batch 1 and batch 2 the cod removal data were normalized and reported as the cod removal rate mg l 1 day 1 fig 6b the results suggested that all pmfcs achieved similar cod removal rates in the anode chamber the effects of the anode biofilm on the performance of pmfc were eliminated by acclimatizing the anode electrode with bacteria biofilm before the experiment therefore all the pmfcs acquired mature biofilm status before the experiment the variation in the pmfc performances solely depended on the cod changes in the cathode chamber since the anode chamber conditions were similar for each batch the variation of cod removal efficiency with time and the total cod removal efficiencies in the cathode chambers are shown in fig 7 a and 7b respectively the corresponding cod removal rates are shown in fig 7c the highest cod removal efficiency was obtained with an initial cod concentration of 100 mg l 1 cod removal efficiency decreased when the initial cod concentration increased higher cod concentrations required a longer retention period to achieve high cod removal efficiencies high cod removal rates were achieved when increasing the cod concentration in the cathode chamber the highest cod removal rate was obtained with 500 mg l 1 of cod these results indicate that chlorella vulgaris utilized acetate as the organic carbon source during mixotrophic cultivation heterotrophic metabolism assimilates organic substrates to acquire energy 34 some species such as phaeodactylum tricornutum showed negative effects from sodium acetate by slowing growth with a consequent decrease in biomass concentration and biomass productivity 36 ammonium nitrogen removal efficiencies in the cathode chambers are shown in fig 8 the highest ammonium nitrogen removal efficiencies were obtained in pmfc 3 operated under mixotrophic conditions with an initial cod concentration of 300 mg l 1 in the cathode chamber the ammonium nitrogen removal efficiency was 92 and 82 for batch 1 and 2 respectively the corresponding ammonia nitrogen removal rates were approximately 17 and 13 mg l 1 day 1 for batch 1 and 2 respectively the ammonia nitrogen removal rates obtained under autotrophic conditions in pmfc 1 were approximately 12 and 11 mg l 1 day 1 for batch 1 and 2 respectively these results indicate that the wastewater can be treated efficiently for ammonium nitrogen in a pmfc by chlorella vulgaris under mixotrophic conditions if supplemented with the appropriate organic carbon concentration in the cathode chamber according to a study conducted by evans et al 2017 higher levels of ammonia nitrogen treatment were achieved by enrichment of wastewater with glucose for chlorella vulgaris 59 commault et al 2017 reported 5 mg l 1 day 1 of ammonium consumption by chlorella vulgaris with an 8 day retention period in the cathode chamber of a pmfc 7 3 4 practical applications of pmfc pmfc is an efficient alternative approach for algal biomass generation and wastewater treatment this study demonstrated the potential of chlorella vulgaris in reducing the nitrogen and organic carbon contents from the wastewater in pmfcs while generating the biomass chlorella vulgaris can provide feedstock to produce a variety of biofuels due to their high lipid content ranging from 14 to 63 of dry weight 60 62 microalgae biomass is considered as one of the promising alternatives to current biofuel crops such as soybean corn etc since no competition with agricultural food and feed production 63 under mixotrophic conditions chlorella vulgaris can accumulate high amounts of lipids compared to the autotrophic conditions therefore mixotrophic cultivation of chlorella vulgaris in pmfcs is more appropriate for biomass generation to further process biofuels another promising application of microalgae is for animal feed due to the increasing demand for food with natural composition instead of synthesized ingredients chlorella vulgaris can accumulate carotenoids in certain conditions which enhanced the health and life expectancy of animals 64 power generation is one of the main aspects of mfc technology however the power output generated from an individual pmfc unit is insufficient for most practical applications a series configuration of individual mfc units can enhance the power generation a study by wu et al employed a 72 l stack made of 5 membrane based mfc units and achieved power density of 50 9 w m 3 65 another pilot study utilized five 18 l modules total volume of 90 l with brewery wastewater and generated electricity to drive the catholyte recirculation pump 66 up to 90 of cod removal efficiency and up to 60 w m 3 of power generation were achieved with a 50 modules stack containing total of 1000 l of real municipal wastewater tested for 1 year 67 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that the pmfc can be operated under mixotrophic conditions with power generation wastewater treatment and algal biomass production simultaneously power generation in a pmfc increased when chlorella vulgaris was cultivated under mixotrophic conditions with 100 mg l 1 of cod compared to autotrophic conditions however increasing the organic carbon further in the cathode chamber decreased the power generation biomass production in the cathode chamber increased under mixotrophic cultivation of chlorella vulgaris maximum power generation and biomass was observed at the c n ratio of 0 224 and 0 546 respectively chlorella vulgaris achieved approximately 100 of cod removal efficiency during 16 days when the initial cod is 100 mg l 1 in the cathode chamber moreover ammonia can also be assimilated by chlorella vulgaris under mixotrophic condition however due to complexity of industrial wastewater utilizing wastewater from industries under mixotrophic conditions in a pmfc should be further investigated declaration of

13707,in the present study a cheese whey agro industrial byproduct was utilized as a natural feedstock for bioplastic production the bioprocess consisted of a fermentative lactic acid production step 1 and a following photofermentative poly 3 hydroxybutyrate production step 2 during step 1 the bacterium lactobacillus sp converted lactose contained in cheese whey into lactic acid during step 2 the marine bacterium rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 converted lactic acid contained in the cheese whey fermented effluent cwfe in bioplastic in this investigation the cwfe produced during step 1 showed a lactic acid content of 29 5 1 3 g l when for feeding rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 was utilized cwfe diluted with water 50 v v the highest poly 3 hydroxybutyrate content 67 3 1 of bacterial dry biomass was observed both bioprocess steps can significantly contribute to realize a circular bioeconomy able to cut down the costs of bioplastic production and reduce the environmental impact caused by the intensive human feed and food productions keywords rhodovulum sulfidophilum lactobacillus sp polyhydroxyalkanoates cheese whey photobioreactor 1 introduction petroleum derived plastic production and accumulation have devastating environmental effects consequently polyhydroxyalkanoates phas appear to be true alternatives to common plastics because they are biodegradable and biocompatible and can be biologically produced 1 phas can be produced by means of a number of organisms such as plants heterotrophic bacteria phototropic microorganisms cyanobacteria and microalgae and purple non sulfur bacteria pnsb one of the major costs associated with the bacterial production of phas derives from the carbon source used for their production despite having comparable characteristics to petrol plastics extensive bioplastic use is still deferred because of its high production cost 1 2 the cheese whey by product is an interesting feedstock for the fermentative process whey is composed mainly of lactose easily fermentable sugar and other compounds in minor amounts such as proteins mineral salts and lipids that can be used as nutrients by microbial cultures 3 because of the high nutrient content of whey this industrial by product is considered a cheap carbon source capable of reducing the costs associated with lactic acid bacteria lab culture medium 4 approximately 120 160 million tons of whey are produced annually throughout the world 5 6 the value of using whey lactose for pha production is clear as it would dramatically decrease the costs of pha production 1 the high pha production cost e g 24 kg 1 for photosynthetic phb production is the combined result of a high energy demand for media sterilization the cost of the carbon source and

fermentation in two ways ì during the hetero fermentative process glucose is converted into la carbon dioxide ethanol and acetic acid ii during the homo fermentative process a carbon source is utilized to produce la 29 lactobacillus sp culture grown in the fermenter 2 5 l working volume was subjected to a dynamic ph change this cyclic daily ph change was repeated for the whole duration of the experimental fermentation data not shown at the end of the fermentative process step 1 the sugar content lactose of lactobacillus culture was totally converted into la which was accumulated into the fermentation broth reaching the concentration of 29 5 1 3 g l the maximum la concentration reached in the present study during step 1 was 1 3 times higher than the value obtained in a previous study carried out by our team using lactobacillus sp 2 and 1 4 times higher than the value reported by luongo et al 12 it could be attributed to the high lactose content of cheese way and the inoculum monoculture lactobacillus sp utilized in the present investigation the aforementioned fermentation broth was centrifuged and then the pellet was separated from the supernatant this last was then diluted with different percentages of deionized water as reported in the material and method section 20 30 and 50 v v and sterilised before being used for feeding the photofermentation process step 2 in the present study the nontoxic by product cheese whey utilized for feeding the fermentative bioprocess step 1 permitted an optimal conversion of the lactose rich effluent cheese whey into a cwfe rich in la the fermentation of cheese whey by lactobacillus sp was performed in accordance with the method reported elsewhere 2 recently es et al 17 have reviewed the viability and industrial potentiality of the most recent advances in the biotechnological production of la which proved to be an optimum carbon source for the cultivation of the fresh water bacterium rhodopseudomonas sp s16 vogs3 2 using photosynthetic bacteria is a promising technology to treat diﬀ erent types of wastewater eﬀ ectively and economically 30 the results shown in fig 2 a b concern the marine rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 grown into either a synthetic medium or three culture broths containing water diluted cwfe 20 30 and 50 v v it is evident that bchl increased quickly in all bacterial cultures grown into culture broths containing diluted cwfe fig 2a the maximum bchl concentration of 16 5 mg l was reached in 50 cwfe when decreasing the percentage of dilution lower bchl concentrations were observed 10 7 mg l and 6 8 mg l respectively at 30 and 20 of cwfe these maximum bchl concentration values were observed after 24 h of bacterial growth they decreased slightly in the following period in contrast to this behaviour rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 grown into a synthetic medium reached the maximum bchl concentration 15 8 mg l in a longer time 144 h nevertheless the maximum bchl concentration was very similar to the value observed in 50 cwfe diluted with water fig 2b shows the la consumption versus time it was observed that the la consumption was total in the culture grown in the synthetic medium only in contrast three increasing plateau values 0 878 2 264 and 4 140 h were reached in the bacterial cultures grown in diluted cwfe 20 30 and 50 v v in fact the la consumption was of one phase decay type in the synthetic medium and of two phase decay type in the diluted cwfe the growth parameters are shown in table 1 the p3hb accumulation was observed over time fig 3 during the cultivation of rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 into a synthetic medium the p3hb accumulation reached the maximum value 1042 mg l at t79 to decrease significantly in the following period fig 3a this reduction was attributed to the depletion of the carbon source in the synthetic medium such as shown in the fig 2b in contrast a very different behaviour was observed when rhodovulum was cultured into diluted cwfe fig 3b d the higher the concentration of cwfe in the cultural broths the higher the amount of the polyester the highest cumulative p3hb 1685 mg l was achieved when rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 was cultured in 50 of cwfe in this cultural broth the p3hb accumulation was very fast especially during the first 79 h of the bacterial growth moreover over 79 h of bacterial growth the highest p3hb productivity 19 5 mg l h was achieved fig 3d higher p3hb productivities were attained culturing heterotrophic bacteria i 60 mg p3hb l h were obtained feeding bacillus megaterium with whey supernatant 21 and ii 204 mg p3hb l h were obtained growing mixed cultures of undefined microorganisms with fermented whey 31 fig 4 shows the content of p3hb in the dry biomass of rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 at the end of the experiments the lowest percentage of p3hb 26 3 2 2 of dry biomass was found when the bacterium was cultured in the synthetic medium the percentage increased significantly when rhodovulum was cultured into the cwfe the highest content 67 0 3 1 of dry biomass was achieved when the bacterium was grown into 50 cwfe although the content of the p3hb in the dry biomass was quite high the strategy used for reaching those results were of batch type hence discontinuous several disadvantages of discontinuous bioprocesses are well known 32 recently our group obtained a bacterial dry biomass with a content of 10 3 of p3hb culturing the fresh water bacterium rhodopseudomonas sp s16 vogs3 in diluted cwfe 50 v v with a lower dilution of cwfe 25 v v the polyester content was enhanced to 18 4 of dry biomass 2 the comparison between the fresh water bacterium rhodopseudomonas sp s16 vogs3 with the marine rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 has shown that the p3hb content in rhodovulum dry biomass was 3 6 times higher than rhodopseudomonas dry biomass nevertheless this high difference decreases to 1 6 times if the comparison is carried out with rhodopseudomonas sp s16 vogs3 grown in the culture broth containing a dark fermented eﬄuent of molasses that produced a p3hb rich biomass 41 7 of cdw results concerning the semi continuous regimen are shown in fig 5 the accumulation of the p3hb in the rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 culture increased over time to stabilize at the concentration of 1200 mg l fig 5a the amount of 1200 mg pha l was recently reported culturing rhodovulum sulfidophilum in a medium containing a mix of oas 3 g l of sodium malate and 3 g l of sodium pyruvate and lighting the culture with leds 800 nm at the intensity of 8 w m2 33 during the batch growth and the semi continuous regimen three groups of biomasses b1 b2 and b3 were harvested fig 5a their p3hb content ranged from 40 to 52 of cdw the p3hb output rates were of 48 5 mg l day 35 6 mg l day and 59 7 mg l day respectively we never observed the h2 photo evolution it is sharply at odds with our previous investigation concerning the utilization of the cwfe by means of rhodopseudomonas sp s16 vogs3 where cumulative h2 of 196 ml l and 418 ml l were achieved when rhodopseudomonas was fed with 25 and 50 of cwfe respectively 2 the higher bioplastic content in rhodovulum cdw than rhodopseudomonas cdw could be attributed at least in part to the lack of h2 production unpublished results carried out with rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 fed with lactate demonstrated that lactate did not determine a combined production of h2 and p3hb in contrast only p3hb was produced during rhodovulum cultivation on the other hand purple photosynthetic bacteria are known as producers of intracellular pha extracellular nucleic acids and h2 33 in fact a parallel production of h2 and p3hb has been recently reported 2 nevertheless under anaerobic conditions there might be competition between p3hb accumulation and hydrogen evolution for reducing equivalents 34 so when the production is only confined to the p3hb without h2 the polyester production is more expressed a further parameter investigated in the present study concerned the change of the e0 monitored in situ during the bacterial growth over time the results are exhibited in fig 6 the dark period before lighting the rhodovulum cultures was a favourable condition to reach negative values of e0 rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 grown into the synthetic medium fig 6a showed lower e0 than those grown into the culture broths containing cwfe fig 6b d in these last culture broths e0 values around 200 mv were observed lower e0 values 352 mv at t24 and 312 mv at t648 were observed only in the culture containing 50 of cwfe fig 6d nutrient losses in human food chain severely surpass our planetary boundaries 35 the recovery of agro industrial by products can contribute to a mitigation for instance by converting wastewater resources to microbial protein for animal feed bioactive substances such as cis vaccenic acid an antivirus substance and a parallel production of green energy bioh2 and bioplastics 35 38 in view of the above premise the utilization of wastewater as it is is not very often appropriate for feeding microbial processes because wastewater as olive mill wastewater omw contains toxic products e g polyphenols 39 in this case a proper low diluted omw with water 4 6 v v was used for h2 production 40 in contrast to the previous h2 production strategy pre treated omws with either clay or some adsorbent matrices were utilized for feeding purple non sulfur bacteria as rhodobacter sphaeroides or rhodopseudomons palustris 38 41 the present study focused on the marine rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 because the high salinity of both cheese whey and cwfe can promote the bacterial growth and the p3hb synthesis a few pnsb have been proved to have a certain salinity tolerance 1 0 4 5 e g rhodopseudomonas palustris is a salt tolerant species and it could maintain high removal rate up to 76 8 under the salinity of 3 23 42 marine purple bacteria or other more tolerant species will likely replace them in the long term 43 moreover the high salinity of culture broth can reduce the risk of biological contamination 44 the results obtained with rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 should be useful as host microorganism for large scale industrial bioplastic production using the abundant la resource moreover the costs of pnsb biomass production or biobased products cis vaccenic acids h2 and phas could be further optimized by using sunlight 36 a relationship between the solar radiation and the microbial biomass output rate was reported elsewhere 25 the developed feeding strategy investigated in the present study was validated using cheese way as the sole carbon source for producing a lactate rich broth which was successively used for the p3hb production the two stage control strategy resulted in the p3hb concentration of 1200 mg l and p3hb content of 67 of cdw 4 conclusions the present study demonstrated that cheese whey could be a high economical feedstock for the circular bioeconomy the high salinity of cheese whey did not result harmful for either lactobacillus or rhodovulum cultivation the fermentation of cheese whey by means of lactobacillus sp produced a high amount of la that was successively utilized for producing rich p3hb biomass of the marine rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 the highest cumulative p3hb 1685 mg l was achieved during batch growth the p3hb content into the bacterium dry biomass was so high 67 of cdw that could significantly make it cost effective for the bioplastic industrial production the abovementioned best result regarding the content of the p3hb into rhodovulum dry biomass was obtained feeding the bacterium with 50 of cwfe acknowledgements the research was supported by the tuscan

13707,in the present study a cheese whey agro industrial byproduct was utilized as a natural feedstock for bioplastic production the bioprocess consisted of a fermentative lactic acid production step 1 and a following photofermentative poly 3 hydroxybutyrate production step 2 during step 1 the bacterium lactobacillus sp converted lactose contained in cheese whey into lactic acid during step 2 the marine bacterium rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 converted lactic acid contained in the cheese whey fermented effluent cwfe in bioplastic in this investigation the cwfe produced during step 1 showed a lactic acid content of 29 5 1 3 g l when for feeding rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 was utilized cwfe diluted with water 50 v v the highest poly 3 hydroxybutyrate content 67 3 1 of bacterial dry biomass was observed both bioprocess steps can significantly contribute to realize a circular bioeconomy able to cut down the costs of bioplastic production and reduce the environmental impact caused by the intensive human feed and food productions keywords rhodovulum sulfidophilum lactobacillus sp polyhydroxyalkanoates cheese whey photobioreactor 1 introduction petroleum derived plastic production and accumulation have devastating environmental effects consequently polyhydroxyalkanoates phas appear to be true alternatives to common plastics because they are biodegradable and biocompatible and can be biologically produced 1 phas can be produced by means of a number of organisms such as plants heterotrophic bacteria phototropic microorganisms cyanobacteria and microalgae and purple non sulfur bacteria pnsb one of the major costs associated with the bacterial production of phas derives from the carbon source used for their production despite having comparable characteristics to petrol plastics extensive bioplastic use is still deferred because of its high production cost 1 2 the cheese whey by product is an interesting feedstock for the fermentative process whey is composed mainly of lactose easily fermentable sugar and other compounds in minor amounts such as proteins mineral salts and lipids that can be used as nutrients by microbial cultures 3 because of the high nutrient content of whey this industrial by product is considered a cheap carbon source capable of reducing the costs associated with lactic acid bacteria lab culture medium 4 approximately 120 160 million tons of whey are produced annually throughout the world 5 6 the value of using whey lactose for pha production is clear as it would dramatically decrease the costs of pha production 1 the high pha production cost e g 24 kg 1 for photosynthetic phb production is the combined result of a high energy demand for media sterilization the cost of the carbon source and

1 1 p3hb pavg mg l h p3hb2 p3hb1 mg l t2 t1 h where p3hb1 and p3hb2 are the p3hb concentrations mg l at t1 and t2 h respectively 3 results and discussion the lab are able to utilize carbon sources by fermentation in two ways ì during the hetero fermentative process glucose is converted into la carbon dioxide ethanol and acetic acid ii during the homo fermentative process a carbon source is utilized to produce la 29 lactobacillus sp culture grown in the fermenter 2 5 l working volume was subjected to a dynamic ph change this cyclic daily ph change was repeated for the whole duration of the experimental fermentation data not shown at the end of the fermentative process step 1 the sugar content lactose of lactobacillus culture was totally converted into la which was accumulated into the fermentation broth reaching the concentration of 29 5 1 3 g l the maximum la concentration reached in the present study during step 1 was 1 3 times higher than the value obtained in a previous study carried out by our team using lactobacillus sp 2 and 1 4 times higher than the value reported by luongo et al 12 it could be attributed to the high lactose content of cheese way and the inoculum monoculture lactobacillus sp utilized in the present investigation the aforementioned fermentation broth was centrifuged and then the pellet was separated from the supernatant this last was then diluted with different percentages of deionized water as reported in the material and method section 20 30 and 50 v v and sterilised before being used for feeding the photofermentation process step 2 in the present study the nontoxic by product cheese whey utilized for feeding the fermentative bioprocess step 1 permitted an optimal conversion of the lactose rich effluent cheese whey into a cwfe rich in la the fermentation of cheese whey by lactobacillus sp was performed in accordance with the method reported elsewhere 2 recently es et al 17 have reviewed the viability and industrial potentiality of the most recent advances in the biotechnological production of la which proved to be an optimum carbon source for the cultivation of the fresh water bacterium rhodopseudomonas sp s16 vogs3 2 using photosynthetic bacteria is a promising technology to treat diﬀ erent types of wastewater eﬀ ectively and economically 30 the results shown in fig 2 a b concern the marine rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 grown into either a synthetic medium or three culture broths containing water diluted cwfe 20 30 and 50 v v it is evident that bchl increased quickly in all bacterial cultures grown into culture broths containing diluted cwfe fig 2a the maximum bchl concentration of 16 5 mg l was reached in 50 cwfe when decreasing the percentage of dilution lower bchl concentrations were observed 10 7 mg l and 6 8 mg l respectively at 30 and 20 of cwfe these maximum bchl concentration values were observed after 24 h of bacterial growth they decreased slightly in the following period in contrast to this behaviour rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 grown into a synthetic medium reached the maximum bchl concentration 15 8 mg l in a longer time 144 h nevertheless the maximum bchl concentration was very similar to the value observed in 50 cwfe diluted with water fig 2b shows the la consumption versus time it was observed that the la consumption was total in the culture grown in the synthetic medium only in contrast three increasing plateau values 0 878 2 264 and 4 140 h were reached in the bacterial cultures grown in diluted cwfe 20 30 and 50 v v in fact the la consumption was of one phase decay type in the synthetic medium and of two phase decay type in the diluted cwfe the growth parameters are shown in table 1 the p3hb accumulation was observed over time fig 3 during the cultivation of rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 into a synthetic medium the p3hb accumulation reached the maximum value 1042 mg l at t79 to decrease significantly in the following period fig 3a this reduction was attributed to the depletion of the carbon source in the synthetic medium such as shown in the fig 2b in contrast a very different behaviour was observed when rhodovulum was cultured into diluted cwfe fig 3b d the higher the concentration of cwfe in the cultural broths the higher the amount of the polyester the highest cumulative p3hb 1685 mg l was achieved when rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 was cultured in 50 of cwfe in this cultural broth the p3hb accumulation was very fast especially during the first 79 h of the bacterial growth moreover over 79 h of bacterial growth the highest p3hb productivity 19 5 mg l h was achieved fig 3d higher p3hb productivities were attained culturing heterotrophic bacteria i 60 mg p3hb l h were obtained feeding bacillus megaterium with whey supernatant 21 and ii 204 mg p3hb l h were obtained growing mixed cultures of undefined microorganisms with fermented whey 31 fig 4 shows the content of p3hb in the dry biomass of rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 at the end of the experiments the lowest percentage of p3hb 26 3 2 2 of dry biomass was found when the bacterium was cultured in the synthetic medium the percentage increased significantly when rhodovulum was cultured into the cwfe the highest content 67 0 3 1 of dry biomass was achieved when the bacterium was grown into 50 cwfe although the content of the p3hb in the dry biomass was quite high the strategy used for reaching those results were of batch type hence discontinuous several disadvantages of discontinuous bioprocesses are well known 32 recently our group obtained a bacterial dry biomass with a content of 10 3 of p3hb culturing the fresh water bacterium rhodopseudomonas sp s16 vogs3 in diluted cwfe 50 v v with a lower dilution of cwfe 25 v v the polyester content was enhanced to 18 4 of dry biomass 2 the comparison between the fresh water bacterium rhodopseudomonas sp s16 vogs3 with the marine rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 has shown that the p3hb content in rhodovulum dry biomass was 3 6 times higher than rhodopseudomonas dry biomass nevertheless this high difference decreases to 1 6 times if the comparison is carried out with rhodopseudomonas sp s16 vogs3 grown in the culture broth containing a dark fermented eﬄuent of molasses that produced a p3hb rich biomass 41 7 of cdw results concerning the semi continuous regimen are shown in fig 5 the accumulation of the p3hb in the rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 culture increased over time to stabilize at the concentration of 1200 mg l fig 5a the amount of 1200 mg pha l was recently reported culturing rhodovulum sulfidophilum in a medium containing a mix of oas 3 g l of sodium malate and 3 g l of sodium pyruvate and lighting the culture with leds 800 nm at the intensity of 8 w m2 33 during the batch growth and the semi continuous regimen three groups of biomasses b1 b2 and b3 were harvested fig 5a their p3hb content ranged from 40 to 52 of cdw the p3hb output rates were of 48 5 mg l day 35 6 mg l day and 59 7 mg l day respectively we never observed the h2 photo evolution it is sharply at odds with our previous investigation concerning the utilization of the cwfe by means of rhodopseudomonas sp s16 vogs3 where cumulative h2 of 196 ml l and 418 ml l were achieved when rhodopseudomonas was fed with 25 and 50 of cwfe respectively 2 the higher bioplastic content in rhodovulum cdw than rhodopseudomonas cdw could be attributed at least in part to the lack of h2 production unpublished results carried out with rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 fed with lactate demonstrated that lactate did not determine a combined production of h2 and p3hb in contrast only p3hb was produced during rhodovulum cultivation on the other hand purple photosynthetic bacteria are known as producers of intracellular pha extracellular nucleic acids and h2 33 in fact a parallel production of h2 and p3hb has been recently reported 2 nevertheless under anaerobic conditions there might be competition between p3hb accumulation and hydrogen evolution for reducing equivalents 34 so when the production is only confined to the p3hb without h2 the polyester production is more expressed a further parameter investigated in the present study concerned the change of the e0 monitored in situ during the bacterial growth over time the results are exhibited in fig 6 the dark period before lighting the rhodovulum cultures was a favourable condition to reach negative values of e0 rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 grown into the synthetic medium fig 6a showed lower e0 than those grown into the culture broths containing cwfe fig 6b d in these last culture broths e0 values around 200 mv were observed lower e0 values 352 mv at t24 and 312 mv at t648 were observed only in the culture containing 50 of cwfe fig 6d nutrient losses in human food chain severely surpass our planetary boundaries 35 the recovery of agro industrial by products can contribute to a mitigation for instance by converting wastewater resources to microbial protein for animal feed bioactive substances such as cis vaccenic acid an antivirus substance and a parallel production of green energy bioh2 and bioplastics 35 38 in view of the above premise the utilization of wastewater as it is is not very often appropriate for feeding microbial processes because wastewater as olive mill wastewater omw contains toxic products e g polyphenols 39 in this case a proper low diluted omw with water 4 6 v v was used for h2 production 40 in contrast to the previous h2 production strategy pre treated omws with either clay or some adsorbent matrices were utilized for feeding purple non sulfur bacteria as rhodobacter sphaeroides or rhodopseudomons palustris 38 41 the present study focused on the marine rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 because the high salinity of both cheese whey and cwfe can promote the bacterial growth and the p3hb synthesis a few pnsb have been proved to have a certain salinity tolerance 1 0 4 5 e g rhodopseudomonas palustris is a salt tolerant species and it could maintain high removal rate up to 76 8 under the salinity of 3 23 42 marine purple bacteria or other more tolerant species will likely replace them in the long term 43 moreover the high salinity of culture broth can reduce the risk of biological contamination 44 the results obtained with rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 should be useful as host microorganism for large scale industrial bioplastic production using the abundant la resource moreover the costs of pnsb biomass production or biobased products cis vaccenic acids h2 and phas could be further optimized by using sunlight 36 a relationship between the solar radiation and the microbial biomass output rate was reported elsewhere 25 the developed feeding strategy investigated in the present study was validated using cheese way as the sole carbon source for producing a lactate rich broth which was successively used for the p3hb production the two stage control strategy resulted in the p3hb concentration of 1200 mg l and p3hb content of 67 of cdw 4 conclusions the present study demonstrated that cheese whey could be a high economical feedstock for the circular bioeconomy the high salinity of cheese whey did not result harmful for either lactobacillus or rhodovulum cultivation the fermentation of cheese whey by means of lactobacillus sp produced a high amount of la that was successively utilized for producing rich p3hb biomass of the marine rhodovulum sulfidophilum dsm 1374 the highest cumulative p3hb 1685 mg l was achieved during batch growth the p3hb content into the bacterium dry biomass was so high 67 of cdw that could significantly make it cost effective for the bioplastic industrial production the abovementioned best result regarding the content of the p3hb into rhodovulum dry biomass was obtained feeding the bacterium with 50 of cwfe acknowledgements the research was supported by the tuscan

13708,microalgae has been utilised in various applications ranging from pharmaceuticals cosmetics supplements liquid fuels as well as food source for human and animals the upscaling of microalgae production to meet the demand for global consumption has yet to be realized as there are many factors to be considered in the upstream and downstream processing of microalgae biomass for upstream processing the high cultivation cost which poses a major setback can be reduced by cultivating the microalgae in wastewater sources which are widely available and at the same time can lead to bioremediation of these waste sources the contents of microalgae biomass from wastewater can also be used to produce the desired bioproducts for downstream processing the efficiency of traditional processes has long hindered the progression of microalgae to products hence the discovery of advanced technologies which can yield higher productivity and good quality products have been studied and upscale to a pilot scale to verify its feasibility separation techniques like liquid biphasic system and membrane separation are potential in achieving high yield and separation efficiency to recover valuable products from microalgae and these processes are environmentally friendly and cost effective the insights from cultivating microalgae in wastewater sources and the promising technologies to convert them into useful bioproducts will be beneficial to the developments of future upstream and downstream processes keywords biomolecules extraction liquid biphasic flotation system membrane based technology microalgae wastewater 1 introduction microalgae have emerged as a potential alternative source of feedstock for renewable energy food medical supplements and cosmetics 1 it has attracted the attention of many researchers to meet the demand of the increasing world population the benefits of microalgae have been reported in several studies this includes microalgae as a carbon sink which is able to produce various types of biomolecules such as carotenoids lipids polysaccharides proteins amino acid and carbohydrates 2 8 the biomass composition of microalgae is mainly carbohydrates proteins lipids and this composition varies between each microalgae species and strain depending on the growth factors such as nutrient concentrations light and temperature intensity 9 13 microalgae have been suggested to be one of the most reliable sources of protein due to its higher protein content compared to vegetable eggs soybeans and chicken meat 14 15 apart from that production of wastewater derived from many anthropogenic activities such as the industrial agricultural and domestic has been one of the major environmental issues and a threat to water security about half of the global waterbodies such as the lakes rivers and seas have been contaminated by the domestic and industrial wastewaters 16 the release of untreated wastewater could lead to the acidification of water bodies eutrophication global warming and human toxicity 17 other than that with the exponential increased of the world population and demand for clean water it is essential to treat and remediate wastewater so that it could be recycled and reused the main process of wastewater treatments can be classified into three categories which are physical i e filtration and uv chemical i e disinfection electrochemical ion exchange oxidation coagulation catalytic reduction antifoaming and neutralisation and biological i e microbial biodegradation phytoremediation and digester the conventional method of wastewater treatments involves the combinations of three processes as shown in fig 1 and the processes in each stage are described in table 1 the main disadvantage of the conventional method of wastewater treatment includes large consumption of energy that contributes to the release of greenhouse gases and leads to global warming 18 arthrospira aphanizomenon and chlorella sp are the most common microalgae species used for human consumption arthrospira and chlorella are used in food ingredient 15 19 in 1950s chlorella sp was introduced to combat the issue in regards to food shortage of the growing world population 20 besides that the natural sprout of spirulina in a volcanic basin are collected and processed for food production in myanmar 19 more than 70 companies run the production of chlorella microalgae and it is one of the most top selling supplements in japan 21 apart from that the extracted lipid from microalgae can produce up to 5000 gallons of biofuels per acre per year 22 the biomolecules from microalgae can potentially meet the global food and energy demand for example microalgae are able to generate a huge amount of carotenoids that can be used as food supplements and colouring reagents 7 carotenoids from microalgae are safe for consumption because they are natural based and could overcome the health issues caused by synthetic colourant and food supplements such as the hyperactivity in human and allergic reactions 7 however the market price of these biomolecules is expensive due to the high processing costs such as cultivation harvesting extraction and purification of the microalgae the market price of 1 kg of microalgae astaxanthin beta carotene lutein lipid and protein are within the range of 200 7000 300 500 910 15000 80 160 142 303 respectively 7 23 24 the downstream processing of microalgae remains as the core driver of this high price which needs to be tackled to ensure the economic feasibility to utilize microalgae as an alternative resource the downstream processes consist of pre treatment harvesting extraction and purification of microalgae 7 membrane based technology is one of the advanced technology for removing or rejecting unwanted substances thus allowing the valuable substances to pass through the membranes driven by the membrane pore size and pressure osmosis thermal or electrical force 25 it is also one of the most cost effective methods for removing small droplets such as lipid 26 27 the technology can be categorised into four types the microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis with the removal of particle size ranges between 10 0 1 μm 0 05 0 01 μm 0 005 0 001 μm and 0 0005 0 0001 μm respectively shown in fig 2 there is a great need to understand the efficiency of microalgae as a wastewater bio remediator and the subsequent efficiency of different extraction methods to produce biomolecules from microalgae thus the objectives of this review paper are to highlight the efficiency of microalgae for wastewater treatment the production of biomolecules from microalgae using the composition of wastewater and to understand the efficiency of different types of biomolecules extraction methods this review will contribute to the understanding of bioprocessing of microalgae cultivated from wastewater 2 benefits of microalgae the cultivation of microalgae required water supply sunlight carbon dioxide and nutrients similar to the conventional food crop cultivations but microalgae have a higher growth rate compared to other plants and the cultivation of microalgae can provide ecological services and can bring no negative impacts to the environment 28 29 the biomass of microalgae was observed twice of its original biomass in just 13 hours of cultivation 30 each pound of microalgae biomass can absorb 1 8 pounds of carbon dioxide co2 from the atmosphere 22 microalgae in general only makeup 0 5 of the total plant biomass but can produce more than 75 of oxygen o2 required for living things 31 the main advantages of microalgae are that it can grow in harsh environments such as wastewater and do not require a big land area for cultivation leading to less land competition with the agriculture industry animal farms and human residential area 5 7 microalgae require about 49 to 132 times lower cultivation space compared to other crop cultivation 2 the biomass composition of different species of microalgae is summarised in table 2 the generation of protein lipid and carbohydrates in microalgae involves the uptake of carbon phosphorus and nitrogen from the cultivation medium such as hco3 nh4 no3 no2 or organic nitrogen 34 35 the uptake of phosphorus will specifically be used to synthesize lipid 34 the process of biomolecules formation in microalgae is summarised in fig 3 2 1 factors affecting the productivity of microalgae the growth of microalgae and the production of biomolecules are influenced by the cultivation conditions such as the concentration of co2 temperature ph light intensity salinity and the composition of nutrients in the cultivation medium 36 these conditions vary for each microalgae species where high light intensity may lead to better productivity of lipid but lower productivity of carbohydrates and protein ankistrodesmus falcatus and nannochloropsis sp were able to produce 67 2 and 57 of lipid biomass respectively under low light intensity while botryococcus braunii could produce 55 of lipid under high light intensity the light intensity shows no effect on the protein productivity for ankistrodesmus falcatus 37 38 the productivity of lipid from isochrysis galbana and scenedesmus obliquus is higher at high temperature and vice versa for chlorella vulgaris 39 the production of lipid was the highest in zarrouk s medium followed by bg 11 and chu 10 of 67 2 65 74 and 61 13 respectively 38 botryococcus braunii has high tolerance towards different ranges of temperature between 40 c to 20 c with this substantial tolerance massive outdoor cultivation of botryococcus braunii can be done as extreme or low outdoor heating can have minimal impact on the growth rate 40 however the growth of botryococcus braunii and chlorella vulgaris was recorded to be optimum at 25 c and 30 c respectively 34 40 botryococcus braunii can tolerate a ph ranging between 6 0 8 5 but growth rates are low at low ph value 40 meanwhile the growth rate of chlorella vulgaris was seen to be maximum at a ph between 9 10 with biomass and lipid yield of 3 43 g l and 66 25 mg l respectively 34 botryococcus braunii recorded the highest biomass productivity when 2 5 g l of carbon source was used 41 co2 has minimum impact on the growth of dunaliella salina as there was no significant difference in the biomass yield when different concentration of co2 was used in the cultivation 34 the productivity of botryococcus braunii has shown to be maximum in modified chu13 medium 42 the biomass and lipid yield of botryococcus braunii recorded the highest reading when nacl concentration was between 0 017 0 085 m the growth and lipid productivity stunted when higher concentration was used 40 the concentration of nitrate in the medium also plays a role in the growth of botryococcus braunii and productivity of lipid it was seen that the growth rate of botryococcus braunii decreased in low nitrate concentration of less than 0 04 nm but increased in lipid productivity growth rates of biomass and lipid productivity were recorded to be 0 159 g l d and 0 019 g l d respectively under moderate concentration of nitrate of 0 37 nm 43 the biomass yield of chlorella vulgaris was recorded 2 24 g l and 6 8 g l in modified soil extract medium and modified bold basal medium respectively and lipid productivity was recorded the highest in the modified soil extract medium 34 same growth rate of chlorella vulgaris was seen using bg 11 and kolkwitz but bg 11 produced a higher yield of biomass 44 maximum lipid content of dunaliella salina was achieved with nitrogen concentration of 2 nm however constant concentration of nitrogen with an increased light intensity could increase the biomass yield and lipid content of dunaliella salina 34 2 2 environmental remediation of wastewater using microalgae wastewater consists of a range of microorganisms i e bacteria and viruses that are mostly non toxic and these microorganisms can produce co2 to support the growth of microalgae 28 45 46 however some wastewater may also contain pathogenic microorganisms that may be harmful to microalgae and lead to the contamination of microalgae 22 47 seen in fig 4 therefore the cultivation of microalgae in wastewater requires extra monitoring the ratio of microalgae to bacteria also plays an important role for wastewater remediation and biomolecules productivity 48 microalgae in wastewater could provide a wide range benefits such as the removal of coliform bacteria nitrogen phosphorus and heavy metals and also reduction of the biochemical and chemical oxygen demand from the wastewater 47 49 50 cultivation of microalgae from wastewater utilises the nutrients from the wastewater to support its growth and allows the reduction of the production cost and greenhouse gas emissions 51 54 greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced as microalgae will act as the wastewater remediator carbon sink and less generation of electricity will be needed compared to the conventional method of wastewater treatment 18 a single gram of microalgae biomass could consume up of 0 063 g of nitrogen and 0 009 g phosphorous from the wastewater composition 55 56 table 3 summarizes the common species of microalgae used for the remediation of wastewater by microalgae microalgae can tolerate a wide range of water salinity ph and temperature it can also grow in high concentration of sulphur oxide co2 and nitrogen oxide which makes it suitable to be cultivated in wastewater 6 7 the cultivation of microalgae does not require a supply of freshwater as it can easily grow in wastewater that indirectly provides a wastewater treatment 28 67 wastewater is rich in nutrients and it serves as the potential cultivation medium for the microalgae to grow indirectly reducing the cost for cultivation 28 68 69 wastewater can be channelled from many sources such as the water discharge from sewage system industrial and manufacturing plants and agriculture typical wastewater contains organic and inorganic materials the organic compounds include carbohydrates proteins fats and amino acids 28 47 while inorganic compounds are sodium potassium calcium potassium chlorine phosphate ammonium salts and sulphur which favors the cultivation of microalgae 28 47 the united states department of energy states that the microalgae cultivation in wastewater for biofuel production is more cost effective compared to petroleum based diesel and the report emphasises that the biofuel production from microalgae is economically achievable when the wastewater treatment is coupled with microalgae cultivation 54 69 70 the utilisation of wastewater organic compounds increases the growth rate of microalgae that leads to higher production of biomass and lipid 71 73 production of lipid was the highest when the ratio of carbon to nitrogen was 15 with good removal rates of up to 90 5 87 2 and 88 6 for nitrogen cod and phosphorous respectively 51 table 4 summarizes the yield of microalgae biomass and lipid from wastewater cultivation 3 conventional technologies for the extraction of proteins and lipids from microalgae 3 1 conventional technologies for extraction of proteins from microalgae proteins are delicate and fragile they are easily denatured by harsh environments and chemicals the conventional methods of protein extractions are laborious time consuming and limited for commercial use the mechanical and enzymatic methods for protein extraction may disturb the integrity of the protein 77 78 cell disruption is required to improve the extraction process the cell disruption process helps to breakdown the rigid microalgae cell wall to increase the availability of protein to be extracted 78 the commonly used methods of cell disruptions are the bead milling high pressure homogenization high speed homogenizer ultrasound microwave enzymatic lysis chemical treatment and pulsed electric field 79 the conventional and emerging methods of cell disruption have been summarised 79 80 the conventional methods of protein extraction are chemical based techniques such as solvent extraction and enzymatic hydrolysis assisted with cell disruption or pre treatment processes such as pulsed electric field sonication bead milling high pressure homogenization and enzymatic treatment 3 2 conventional technologies for extraction of lipids from microalgae 3 2 1 supercritical carbon dioxide traditional ways of lipid extractions are soxhlet folch and bligh and dyer methods that require the use of solvents such as hexane methanol and chloroform these methods are efficient for the extraction of lipid however the use of these solvents arouses the concern of environmental hazards and human health through neurotoxic effects 81 these challenges such as technological and economical limitations and environmental hazards need to be overcome before commercialising microalgae biofuel 10 supercritical carbon dioxide scco2 method has gained attention for lipid extraction and it has been successfully introduced in industrial processes such as fatty acid refining coffee decaffeination and herbal productions 82 scco2 is effective in extracting lipid compared to conventional method of bligh dyer 83 ethanol is usually used as the conventional organic solvent coupled with a supercritical carbon dioxide this is because ethanol is known to be non toxic and has a strong ability to penetration through the cell wall of microalgae 84 utilization of ethanol allows 20 90 of microalgae lipids to be extracted 84 the drawback of scco2 is it requires an instalment of pressure pump and heater in order for the system to function which means extra cost is needed 83 the pressure pump and the heater are essential for producing the supercritical state of the solvent the supercritical solvent is introduced to the microalgae and dissolved the lipid lipids are extracted from the solvent by adjusting the pressure 84 other than that the operation of scco2 is not a continuous system meaning that the biomass needs to be removed and reloaded into the extractors by batch leading to higher operating expenses as more manpower is needed to load and unload the biomass 84 it has been reported that scco2 is one of the most efficient methods for extracting lipids from microalgae 84 table 5 summarises the recovery of lipid from microalgae using scco2 system the operation of scco2 method is suitable on a wet microalgae biomass without having to dewater it this is a good initiative to save energy because the drying process is no longer required 84 other than that scco2 is also able to extract other biomolecules from the microalgae making it one of the effective methods to make the best use of the microalgae the main advantage of this system is the utilisation of co2 compounds as the solvent whereby co2 is non hazardous the low critical temperature of co2 allows the extraction of biomolecules and it has been shown that scco2 to be a promising method for lipid extraction 85 scco2 penetrates into the microalgae cells leading to a decrease in ph and disrupts the cell membrane 86 the range of organic solvents can also be altered by controlling the density of the supercritical fluid carbon dioxide whereby it allows the extraction purification and fractionation of the selective biomolecules the scco2 system has seen to be able to preserve the natural properties of biomolecules 86 93 nevertheless the high pressure and temperature need to be monitored to ensure the quality of the biomolecules thus integration of scco2 system with non thermal technology was suggested 86 the quality of biomolecules remains good using the coupled system of scco2 with pulsed electric field 94 3 2 2 folch bligh dyer and soxhlet extraction methods the typical solvents used for the extraction of lipid from microalgae are n hexane ethanol 1 butanol dimethyl ether and mixtures of chloroform methanol n hexane isopropanol methylene chloride methanol chloroform methanol 95 the solvent mixtures of chloroform methanol with volume ratio of 2 1 is commonly used in folch method for the extraction of lipids from animal tissues 95 the types and ratio of solvents used in bligh and dyer method are similar to folch method with an addition of water and co solvent 95 the ratio and types of solvents used significantly affect the recovery of lipid from microalgae the lipid extraction was seen higher in chloroform methanol with volume ratio of 2 1 compared to hexane isopropanol with volume ratio of 3 2 dichloromethane ethanol with volume ratio of 1 1 acetone dichloromethane with volume ratio of 1 1 and dichloromethane methanol with volume ration of 1 1 96 mixture of solvent was investigated to see the amount of lipid recovery ethyl acetate methanol solvent system had shown to recover 98 more lipids compared to toluene methanol ethyl acetate methanol and hexane methanol systems 97 soxhlet extraction is one of the oldest lipid extraction methods hexane is used as the solvent for this method whereby it helps to dissolve tag produced by the microalgae 84 the extraction of lipid using soxhlet extraction involves the process of evaporation and condensation the main components of the soxhlet apparatus can be categorised into three which are the condenser for continuous cooling round bottom flask for continuous heating and soxhlet extractor to keep the microalgae biomass hexane is placed in a round bottomed flask for heating and the evaporated hexane will travel through the microalgae and condensed in the condenser 84 98 the condensed solvent containing lipid will be collected from the round bottom flask the solution will go through distillation for lipid recovery 84 98 the main problems of the conventional methods of biomolecule extraction include the time consuming of the processes and the use of toxic solvents such as hexane and chloroform that can have negative impacts on human health and environment 95 99 thus alternative methods of biomolecules extractions are the interest of the researchers 4 recent advances technologies for the extraction of proteins and lipids from microalgae 4 1 liquid biphasic flotation system membrane based technology and liquid biphasic flotation system are the emerging advanced techniques of biomolecules extractions because the processing method is cheap environmentally friendly and does not require high energy input 100 due to the demand for protein extraction technology the cost of protein recovery varies from 30 80 1 101 liquid biphasic flotation lbf is an emerging method of biomolecules extraction because it could overcome the limitations of conventional methods lbf also known as the aqueous two phase flotation atpf is an integrated separation method of the aqueous two phase system atps and solvent sublation ss involving the formation of two immiscible liquid phases that are equilibrium 102 103 lbf is efficient in extracting biomolecules because the process is simple environmentally friendly short processing time compared to the conventional extraction method has a high concentration coefficient scalability and versatility 104 the limitations of an lbf are it is not a continuous system thus microalgae are needed to be removed and added to the system by batch and it uses requires a large amount of chemicals nevertheless the chemicals are recyclable and can be used again for the subsequent batches of biomolecule extraction 105 106 the enhancement of biomolecules extraction using lbf is an ongoing research whereby the traditional mass transfer mode is altered using or substituting different types of chemicals in the system 107 the operation of lbf is carried out by having two immiscible liquid phases consisting of salt solution and an alcohol or a polymer solution 108 110 microalgae is mixed with the salt solution and placed at the bottom phase while alcohol or a polymer is placed at the top phase and air bubbles are injected at the bottom of the system known as sublation column 104 the core process of an lbf is the air bubbles whereby the natural active surface of the biomolecules will attach to the surface of the air bubbles in the salt solution and dissolve in the hydrophilic alcohol polymer once it reaches the top phase forming two phases the polymer or alcohol functions as biomolecule accumulator allowing the biomolecules to accumulate in the top phase 102 104 111 lbf was first used for the extraction of penicillin g from a fermented broth using polyethylene glycol as the top phase and ammonium sulphate in the bottom phase 107 since then many applications of lbf were reported such as the extraction of lipase 105 protein 102 penicillin 112 bacteriocin 113 and others 104 table 6 summarises the recovery of protein molecule from microalgae using the lbf system the type of solvents used in the top and bottom phase plays an important role in attaining the biomolecules and the separation efficiency while the separation efficiency depends on the biomolecules of interest a study demonstrated the used of polyethylene glycol and ammonium sulphate for the extraction of penicillin g and achieved the separation efficiency of 95 the same type of solutions and conditions were used to extract puerariae in a different study the separation efficiency was 87 and the total puerariae recovered was 70 107 114 the use of ethylene oxide propylene oxide and ammonium sulphate solutions for the extraction of lipase achieved the separation efficiency of 76 with lipase yield of 75 higher lipase yield recovery and separation efficiency were recorded using 2 propanol and potassium phosphate as solvents 105 115 low separation efficiency of 11 71 was recorded with 29 18 recovery of biomolecules using 1 propanol and sodium dihydrogen phosphate for the extraction of antioxidant peptides 116 the highest separation efficiency and biomolecule recovery of 98 38 and 99 01 were recorded respectively using ethanol and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 117 current studies are focusing on using ionic liquid in the system as it is environmentally friendly for many enzymatic reactions 103 the benefits of ionic liquid include high electricity and ionic conductors low vapour pressure and volatility non flammable stable heat conductor and have a high range of liquid temperature stability 103 125 ionic liquid and inorganic salt solutions have been tested in a study 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate were used in an lbf system to extract protein 96 22 of protein was recovered with purification factor of 6 56 123 in the earlier study extraction of chloramphenicol under the same conditions showed 97 1 101 9 recovery of chloramphenicol 126 apart from that a study on protein extraction using microwave assisted three phase partitioning have helped in the disruption of the microalgae cell wall to ease the process of protein recovery 63 2 of protein was recovered with a separation efficiency of 67 2 127 recovery of astaxanthin recorded to be 95 08 with separation efficiency of 99 74 using the ultrasound assisted lbf 128 recovery of betacyanins increased using an electric assisted lbf 99 of betacyanins was recovered with separation efficiency of 98 38 117 nonetheless lbf has shown promising performance in the extraction of biomolecules from microalgae 5 fundamental principles using membrane based technology for the extraction of biomolecules from microalgae membrane based is an emerging technology because the process is cheap and environmentally friendly compared to conventional methods 100 it is considered cheap because it does not require a lot of solvents and chemicals the chemicals and solvents can instead be recycled throughout the extraction process 129 membrane microfiltration and ultrafiltration have been used for the extraction of emulsified biomolecules in the food petroleum and metallurgy industries 130 this method is considered as one of suitable options for biomolecules extraction for large biomass of microalgae 131 the effectiveness of the membrane filtration method is influenced by the transmembrane pressure tmp shear rate membrane hydrophilicity permeate fluxes initial oil concentration salinity and ph 132 the advantages of the membrane technology include it having a simple and straightforward process requires low capital cost and footprint low energy requirements which makes it economically feasible effective in nutrients recovery low energy requirement able to treat variety types of wastewater and achieve the standard wastewater discharge it is also suitable to integrate the membrane technology with different technologies or processes to maximise the modularity of the system 25 133 the main challenges of membrane filtration method are correlated with membrane fouling which is the bottleneck of the system and needs to be tackled 134 membrane fouling happens when the surface or inside of the membrane pores are blocked with the deposition of organic material 132 hydrophilic membranes are used for the extraction of lipid to minimise the fouling of the membrane by organic matter 100 hydrophilic membranes can be made from cellulose polyethersulfone pes polyacrylonitrile pan hydrophilated polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf 135 apart from that membrane fouling can be reduced by creating turbulence and increasing the shear rate of the system allowing the organic matter to move away from the membrane 132 136 a research found that membrane fouling is less in a rotating disk filtration compared to a cross flow filtration due to the creation of turbulence bubbles 132 table 7 summarises the type of membrane correlated to its size range pore size and functions currently researchers are intensively trying to develop a new membrane to overcome these challenges 132 137 138 phospholipid 1 2 dipalmitoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine dppc membrane with porous diameter of 0 1 μm was developed high lipid content was extracted and recorded 139 improvement of pan membranes was done by immersing it into different concentrations of hydroxylamine hydrochloride the membrane could extract and remove oil from wastewater 138 the hydrophilicity and membrane fouling of polyvinyl chloride pvc membrane could be improved by immersing it into lignin 140 the membrane fouling hydrophilicity of polyethersulfone could also be improved by modifying it with calcium chloride manganese carbonate 141 polyethersulfone modified with calcium chloride showed tremendous increased in wastewater permeability 142 pure water flux increased by four times when modified polyethersulfone membrane was used in ultrafiltration 143 different types of membrane have different functions in extracting biomolecules from microalgae as shown in table 8 5 1 membrane based technology for protein extraction from microalgae microalgae biomass can also produce a high content of protein such as glycoprotein phycoerythrin and phycobiliproteins 7 the common types of microalgae used for the production of proteins are c vulgaris c phycocyanin c sorokiniana 7 146 membrane technology is extensively used in the dairy industry for proteins recovery from milk 147 membrane technology is the alternative methods of microalgae protein extraction as it is environmentally friendly and does not require high energy input 147 membrane technology is suitable to be coupled with seaweed as part of the cascading biorefinery process to increase the valorisation of microalgae components and avoid the presence of heavy metals in the final product 148 microfiltration can be used to remove materials of molecular weight greater than 200 kda such as the components of the algae cell wall and bacteria ultrafiltration can be used to separate proteins with other biomolecules of molecular weight between 1 200 kda the efficiency of different types of membrane using ultrafiltration and microfiltration are summarised in table 9 5 2 membrane based technology for lipid extraction from microalgae microalgae can produce high amount of lipids such as triacylglycerols monounsaturated fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids glycolipids phytosterols and waxes 7 73 microalgae is a promising source for biofuels because it can produce many types of bio products and oil compared to other crops and it was reported that microalgae can produce 5000 gallons of biofuels per acre per year and the production can be 10 to 20 times higher biofuels than from other crops 22 155 156 an ideal process of lipid extraction should be environmentally friendly economically feasible and efficient 11 162 the membrane based systems into the downstream processing of microalgae includethe harvesting of microalgae however this technology could also be adapted for clean separation and biomolecules extraction 100 the efficiency of lipid extraction of different types of membrane is summarised in table 10 the membrane based technologies have been proposed for the recovery of emulsified lipids in wastewater of different industries such as food and petroleum using micro or ultrafiltration process however the efficiency of lipid extraction is strongly correlated with the intensity of lipids and surfactants mixture 163 a study on oil water separation using a photocatalytic reactor combined with ultrafiltration membrane recorded a promising separation of oil from the water 164 combination methods of adsorption membrane filtration and reverse osmosis to treat an oilfield brine wastewater were done 165 from this study they found that lipid recovery was more than 60 higher than using the conventional method some studies have proposed to combine biological treatment with membrane filtration 166 recovery oil from wastewater managed to achieve pure drinking water using membrane filtration technology 167 these methods of oil filtrations have been applied in the process of biomolecules extraction of microalgae membrane based technology may be suitable for large scale microalgae extraction and it has been achieved using the ultrafiltration method 150 6 future perspective microalgae have emerged as an important source of biofuel for the future production of energy however they are still not economically feasible due to its expensive cultivation requirements such as large volume of water and nutrients on a side note wastewater has shown to be a good replacement for these requirements because wastewaters are rich in organic and inorganic molecules that favor the growth of microalgae nonetheless the content of molecules in wastewaters are inconsistent and may contain harmful substances that may lead to the contamination of microalgae and extra monitoring requirement to avoid contamination of the microalgae analysis on the present substances in the wastewater should be carried out present of toxic or harmful substances should be removed before used or extra monitoring will be required the cost of decontaminating microalgae and monitoring should be analysed in future studies to fully understand the cost effectiveness and the feasibility of growing microalgae in wastewater apart from that a study of wastewater remediation using other microorganisms such as bacterial and the relationship between the microalgae and pathogens e g concentration biomass productivity in wastewater should be further looked into also membrane based technology of lipid and protein extraction is environmentally friendly as it requires fewer chemicals and electricity usage compared to the conventional methods however this technology is strongly correlated to membrane fouling therefore development of new membranes should be further explored to overcome membrane fouling the other main disadvantage of membrane based technology is that the extraction of lipid is not a continuous process whereby feedstocks are added by batch and the membranes are required to be replaced for a certain period leading to high processing cost for the loading and unloading of feedstocks and membranes alternative continuous processes should be explored and the full cost of lipid extraction process using membrane based technology should be analysed in the future study furthermore the optimization of lbf system for biomolecules extractions can also be evaluated with prospects in integrating the membrane based system with the lbf system to observe the feasibility of recycling the phase solutions 7 practical applications from the study we found that wastewater is suitable to be used as the medium for microalgae cultivation because it is rich in nutrients and can support the nutrients needed for microalgae to grow factors influencing the growth of microalgae are temperature light intensity water source nutrients availability and also the concentration of co2 however different species may react differently to light intensity therefore a suitable species should be analysed and studied to ensure it is feasible and can grow in the natural environment apart from that actions to scale up the utilisation of microalgae is to genetically modified microalgae to allow higher production of biomolecules it was seen that the genetically modified microalgae could produce up to 35 more lipid 168 8 conclusion this study highlights that the cultivation of microalgae in wastewater supports the process of wastewater treatment wastewater is also a reliable source of nutrients for the production of biomolecules and microalgae biomass however different microalgae species may react differently to the content of the nutrients on the other hand advanced technologies of biomolecules extraction such as the lbf have shown to be able to extract more biomolecules compared to the conventional methods in addition the pre treatment process of the microalgae increased the recovery of biomolecules using the lbf system as the disrupted cell wall of the microalgae enhances the viability of biomolecule nonetheless membrane based technologies revealed its feasibility in the extraction of protein using polysulfone membrane with molecular cut offs of 0 1 μm 30 kda and 40 kda while the polysulfone membrane recovered the highest lipid with the molecular cut offs of 30 kda declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

13708,microalgae has been utilised in various applications ranging from pharmaceuticals cosmetics supplements liquid fuels as well as food source for human and animals the upscaling of microalgae production to meet the demand for global consumption has yet to be realized as there are many factors to be considered in the upstream and downstream processing of microalgae biomass for upstream processing the high cultivation cost which poses a major setback can be reduced by cultivating the microalgae in wastewater sources which are widely available and at the same time can lead to bioremediation of these waste sources the contents of microalgae biomass from wastewater can also be used to produce the desired bioproducts for downstream processing the efficiency of traditional processes has long hindered the progression of microalgae to products hence the discovery of advanced technologies which can yield higher productivity and good quality products have been studied and upscale to a pilot scale to verify its feasibility separation techniques like liquid biphasic system and membrane separation are potential in achieving high yield and separation efficiency to recover valuable products from microalgae and these processes are environmentally friendly and cost effective the insights from cultivating microalgae in wastewater sources and the promising technologies to convert them into useful bioproducts will be beneficial to the developments of future upstream and downstream processes keywords biomolecules extraction liquid biphasic flotation system membrane based technology microalgae wastewater 1 introduction microalgae have emerged as a potential alternative source of feedstock for renewable energy food medical supplements and cosmetics 1 it has attracted the attention of many researchers to meet the demand of the increasing world population the benefits of microalgae have been reported in several studies this includes microalgae as a carbon sink which is able to produce various types of biomolecules such as carotenoids lipids polysaccharides proteins amino acid and carbohydrates 2 8 the biomass composition of microalgae is mainly carbohydrates proteins lipids and this composition varies between each microalgae species and strain depending on the growth factors such as nutrient concentrations light and temperature intensity 9 13 microalgae have been suggested to be one of the most reliable sources of protein due to its higher protein content compared to vegetable eggs soybeans and chicken meat 14 15 apart from that production of wastewater derived from many anthropogenic activities such as the industrial agricultural and domestic has been one of the major environmental issues and a threat to water security about half of the global waterbodies such as the lakes rivers and seas have been contaminated by the domestic and industrial wastewaters 16 the release of untreated wastewater could lead to the acidification of water bodies eutrophication global warming and human toxicity 17 other than that with the exponential increased of the world population and demand for clean water it is essential to treat and remediate wastewater so that it could be recycled and reused the main process of wastewater treatments can be classified into three categories which are physical i e filtration and uv chemical i e disinfection electrochemical ion exchange oxidation coagulation catalytic reduction antifoaming and neutralisation and biological i e microbial biodegradation phytoremediation and digester the conventional method of wastewater treatments involves the combinations of three processes as shown in fig 1 and the processes in each stage are described in table 1 the main disadvantage of the conventional method of wastewater treatment includes large consumption of energy that contributes to the release of greenhouse gases and leads to global warming 18 arthrospira aphanizomenon and chlorella sp are the most common microalgae species used for human consumption arthrospira and chlorella are used in food ingredient 15 19 in 1950s chlorella sp was introduced to combat the issue in regards to food shortage of the growing world population 20 besides that the natural sprout of spirulina in a volcanic basin are collected and processed for food production in myanmar 19 more than 70 companies run the production of chlorella microalgae and it is one of the most top selling supplements in japan 21 apart from that the extracted lipid from microalgae can produce up to 5000 gallons of biofuels per acre per year 22 the biomolecules from microalgae can potentially meet the global food and energy demand for example microalgae are able to generate a huge amount of carotenoids that can be used as food supplements and colouring reagents 7 carotenoids from microalgae are safe for consumption because they are natural based and could overcome the health issues caused by synthetic colourant and food supplements such as the hyperactivity in human and allergic reactions 7 however the market price of these biomolecules is expensive due to the high processing costs such as cultivation harvesting extraction and purification of the microalgae the market price of 1 kg of microalgae astaxanthin beta carotene lutein lipid and protein are within the range of 200 7000 300 500 910 15000 80 160 142 303 respectively 7 23 24 the downstream processing of microalgae remains as the core driver of this high price which needs to be tackled to ensure the economic feasibility to utilize microalgae as an alternative resource the downstream processes consist of pre treatment harvesting extraction and purification of microalgae 7 membrane based technology is one of the advanced technology for removing or rejecting unwanted substances thus allowing the valuable substances to pass through the membranes driven by the membrane pore size and pressure osmosis thermal or electrical force 25 it is also one of the most cost effective methods for removing small droplets such as lipid 26 27 the technology can be categorised into four types the microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis with the removal of particle size ranges between 10 0 1 μm 0 05 0 01 μm 0 005 0 001 μm and 0 0005 0 0001 μm respectively shown in fig 2 there is a great need to understand the efficiency of microalgae as a wastewater bio remediator and the subsequent efficiency of different extraction methods to produce biomolecules from microalgae thus the objectives of this review paper are to highlight the efficiency of microalgae for wastewater treatment the production of biomolecules from microalgae using the composition of wastewater and to understand the efficiency of different types of biomolecules extraction methods this review will contribute to the understanding of bioprocessing of microalgae cultivated from wastewater 2 benefits of microalgae the cultivation of microalgae required water supply sunlight carbon dioxide and nutrients similar to the conventional food crop cultivations but microalgae have a higher growth rate compared to other plants and the cultivation of microalgae can provide ecological services and can bring no negative impacts to the environment 28 29 the biomass of microalgae was observed twice of its original biomass in just 13 hours of cultivation 30 each pound of microalgae biomass can absorb 1 8 pounds of carbon dioxide co2 from the atmosphere 22 microalgae in general only makeup 0 5 of the total plant biomass but can produce more than 75 of oxygen o2 required for living things 31 the main advantages of microalgae are that it can grow in harsh environments such as wastewater and do not require a big land area for cultivation leading to less land competition with the agriculture industry animal farms and human residential area 5 7 microalgae require about 49 to 132 times lower cultivation space compared to other crop cultivation 2 the biomass composition of different species of microalgae is summarised in table 2 the generation of protein lipid and carbohydrates in microalgae involves the uptake of carbon phosphorus and nitrogen from the cultivation medium such as hco3 nh4 no3 no2 or organic nitrogen 34 35 the uptake of phosphorus will specifically be used to synthesize lipid 34 the process of biomolecules formation in microalgae is summarised in fig 3 2 1 factors affecting the productivity of microalgae the growth of microalgae and the production of biomolecules are influenced by the cultivation conditions such as the concentration of co2 temperature ph light intensity salinity and the composition of nutrients in the cultivation medium 36 these conditions vary for each microalgae species where high light intensity may lead to better productivity of lipid but lower productivity of carbohydrates and protein ankistrodesmus falcatus and nannochloropsis sp were able to produce 67 2 and 57 of lipid biomass respectively under low light intensity while botryococcus braunii could produce 55 of lipid under high light intensity the light intensity shows no effect on the protein productivity for ankistrodesmus falcatus 37 38 the productivity of lipid from isochrysis galbana and scenedesmus obliquus is higher at high temperature and vice versa for chlorella vulgaris 39 the production of lipid was the highest in zarrouk s medium followed by bg 11 and chu 10 of 67 2 65 74 and 61 13 respectively 38 botryococcus braunii has high tolerance towards different ranges of temperature between 40 c to 20 c with this substantial tolerance massive outdoor cultivation of botryococcus braunii can be done as extreme or low outdoor heating can have minimal impact on the growth rate 40 however the growth of botryococcus braunii and chlorella vulgaris was recorded to be optimum at 25 c and 30 c respectively 34 40 botryococcus braunii can tolerate a ph ranging between 6 0 8 5 but growth rates are low at low ph value 40 meanwhile the growth rate of chlorella vulgaris was seen to be maximum at a ph between 9 10 with biomass and lipid yield of 3 43 g l and 66 25 mg l respectively 34 botryococcus braunii recorded the highest biomass productivity when 2 5 g l of carbon source was used 41 co2 has minimum impact on the growth of dunaliella salina as there was no significant difference in the biomass yield when different concentration of co2 was used in the cultivation 34 the productivity of botryococcus braunii has shown to be maximum in modified chu13 medium 42 the biomass and lipid yield of botryococcus braunii recorded the highest reading when nacl concentration was between 0 017 0 085 m the growth and lipid productivity stunted when higher concentration was used 40 the concentration of nitrate in the medium also plays a role in the growth of botryococcus braunii and productivity of lipid it was seen that the growth rate of botryococcus braunii decreased in low nitrate concentration of less than 0 04 nm but increased in lipid productivity growth rates of biomass and lipid productivity were recorded to be 0 159 g l d and 0 019 g l d respectively under moderate concentration of nitrate of 0 37 nm 43 the biomass yield of chlorella vulgaris was recorded 2 24 g l and 6 8 g l in modified soil extract medium and modified bold basal medium respectively and lipid productivity was recorded the highest in the modified soil extract medium 34 same growth rate of chlorella vulgaris was seen using bg 11 and kolkwitz but bg 11 produced a higher yield of biomass 44 maximum lipid content of dunaliella salina was achieved with nitrogen concentration of 2 nm however constant concentration of nitrogen with an increased light intensity could increase the biomass yield and lipid content of dunaliella salina 34 2 2 environmental remediation of wastewater using microalgae wastewater consists of a range of microorganisms i e bacteria and viruses that are mostly non toxic and these microorganisms can produce co2 to support the growth of microalgae 28 45 46 however some wastewater may also contain pathogenic microorganisms that may be harmful to microalgae and lead to the contamination of microalgae 22 47 seen in fig 4 therefore the cultivation of microalgae in wastewater requires extra monitoring the ratio of microalgae to bacteria also plays an important role for wastewater remediation and biomolecules productivity 48 microalgae in wastewater could provide a wide range benefits such as the removal of coliform bacteria nitrogen phosphorus and heavy metals and also reduction of the biochemical and chemical oxygen demand from the wastewater 47 49 50 cultivation of microalgae from wastewater utilises the nutrients from the wastewater to support its growth and allows the reduction of the production cost and greenhouse gas emissions 51 54 greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced as microalgae will act as the wastewater remediator carbon sink and less generation of electricity will be needed compared to the conventional method of wastewater treatment 18 a single gram of microalgae biomass could consume up of 0 063 g of nitrogen and 0 009 g phosphorous from the wastewater composition 55 56 table 3 summarizes the common species of microalgae used for the remediation of wastewater by microalgae microalgae can tolerate a wide range of water salinity ph and temperature it can also grow in high concentration of sulphur oxide co2 and nitrogen oxide which makes it suitable to be cultivated in wastewater 6 7 the cultivation of microalgae does not require a supply of freshwater as it can easily grow in wastewater that indirectly provides a wastewater treatment 28 67 wastewater is rich in nutrients and it serves as the potential cultivation medium for the microalgae to grow indirectly reducing the cost for cultivation 28 68 69 wastewater can be channelled from many sources such as the water discharge from sewage system industrial and manufacturing plants and agriculture typical wastewater contains organic and inorganic materials the organic compounds include carbohydrates proteins fats and amino acids 28 47 while inorganic compounds are sodium potassium calcium potassium chlorine phosphate ammonium salts and sulphur which favors the cultivation of microalgae 28 47 the united states department of energy states that the microalgae cultivation in wastewater for biofuel production is more cost effective compared to petroleum based diesel and the report emphasises that the biofuel production from microalgae is economically achievable when the wastewater treatment is coupled with microalgae cultivation 54 69 70 the utilisation of wastewater organic compounds increases the growth rate of microalgae that leads to higher production of biomass and lipid 71 73 production of lipid was the highest when the ratio of carbon to nitrogen was 15 with good removal rates of up to 90 5 87 2 and 88 6 for nitrogen cod and phosphorous respectively 51 table 4 summarizes the yield of microalgae biomass and lipid from wastewater cultivation 3 conventional technologies for the extraction of proteins and lipids from microalgae 3 1 conventional technologies for extraction of proteins from microalgae proteins are delicate and fragile they are easily denatured by harsh environments and chemicals the conventional methods of protein extractions are laborious time consuming and limited for commercial use the mechanical and enzymatic methods for protein extraction may disturb the integrity of the protein 77 78 cell disruption is required to improve the extraction process the cell disruption process helps to breakdown the rigid microalgae cell wall to increase the availability of protein to be extracted 78 the commonly used methods of cell disruptions are the bead milling high pressure homogenization high speed homogenizer ultrasound microwave enzymatic lysis chemical treatment and pulsed electric field 79 the conventional and emerging methods of cell disruption have been summarised 79 80 the conventional methods of protein extraction are chemical based techniques such as solvent extraction and enzymatic hydrolysis assisted with cell disruption or pre treatment processes such as pulsed electric field sonication bead milling high pressure homogenization and enzymatic treatment 3 2 conventional technologies for extraction of lipids from microalgae 3 2 1 supercritical carbon dioxide traditional ways of lipid extractions are soxhlet folch and bligh and dyer methods that require the use of solvents such as hexane methanol and chloroform these methods are efficient for the extraction of lipid however the use of these solvents arouses the concern of environmental hazards and human health through neurotoxic effects 81 these challenges such as technological and economical limitations and environmental hazards need to be overcome before commercialising microalgae biofuel 10 supercritical carbon dioxide scco2 method has gained attention for lipid extraction and it has been successfully introduced in industrial processes such as fatty acid refining coffee decaffeination and herbal productions 82 scco2 is effective in extracting lipid compared to conventional method of bligh dyer 83 ethanol is usually used as the conventional organic solvent coupled with a supercritical carbon dioxide this is because ethanol is known to be non toxic and has a strong ability to penetration through the cell wall of microalgae 84 utilization of ethanol allows 20 90 of microalgae lipids to be extracted 84 the drawback of scco2 is it requires an instalment of pressure pump and heater in order for the system to function which means extra cost is needed 83 the pressure pump and the heater are essential for producing the supercritical state of the solvent the supercritical solvent is introduced to the microalgae and dissolved the lipid lipids are extracted from the solvent by adjusting the pressure 84 other than that the operation of scco2 is not a continuous system meaning that the biomass needs to be removed and reloaded into the extractors by batch leading to higher operating expenses as more manpower is needed to load and unload the biomass 84 it has been reported that scco2 is one of the most efficient methods for extracting lipids from microalgae 84 table 5 summarises the recovery of lipid from microalgae using scco2 system the operation of scco2 method is suitable on a wet microalgae biomass without having to dewater it this is a good initiative to save energy because the drying process is no longer required 84 other than that scco2 is also able to extract other biomolecules from the microalgae making it one of the effective methods to make the best use of the microalgae the main advantage of this system is the utilisation of co2 compounds as the solvent whereby co2 is non hazardous the low critical temperature of co2 allows the extraction of biomolecules and it has been shown that scco2 to be a promising method for lipid extraction 85 scco2 penetrates into the microalgae cells leading to a decrease in ph and disrupts the cell membrane 86 the range of organic solvents can also be altered by controlling the density of the supercritical fluid carbon dioxide whereby it allows the extraction purification and fractionation of the selective biomolecules the scco2 system has seen to be able to preserve the natural properties of biomolecules 86 93 nevertheless the high pressure and temperature need to be monitored to ensure the quality of the biomolecules thus integration of scco2 system with non thermal technology was suggested 86 the quality of biomolecules remains good using the coupled system of scco2 with pulsed electric field 94 3 2 2 folch bligh dyer and soxhlet extraction methods the typical solvents used for the extraction of lipid from microalgae are n hexane ethanol 1 butanol dimethyl ether and mixtures of chloroform methanol n hexane isopropanol methylene chloride methanol chloroform methanol 95 the solvent mixtures of chloroform methanol with volume ratio of 2 1 is commonly used in folch method for the extraction of lipids from animal tissues 95 the types and ratio of solvents used in bligh and dyer method are similar to folch method with an addition of water and co solvent 95 the ratio and types of solvents used significantly affect the recovery of lipid from microalgae the lipid extraction was seen higher in chloroform methanol with volume ratio of 2 1 compared to hexane isopropanol with volume ratio of 3 2 dichloromethane ethanol with volume ratio of 1 1 acetone dichloromethane with volume ratio of 1 1 and dichloromethane methanol with volume ration of 1 1 96 mixture of solvent was investigated to see the amount of lipid recovery ethyl acetate methanol solvent system had shown to recover 98 more lipids compared to toluene methanol ethyl acetate methanol and hexane methanol systems 97 soxhlet extraction is one of the oldest lipid extraction methods hexane is used as the solvent for this method whereby it helps to dissolve tag produced by the microalgae 84 the extraction of lipid using soxhlet extraction involves the process of evaporation and condensation the main components of the soxhlet apparatus can be categorised into three which are the condenser for continuous cooling round bottom flask for continuous heating and soxhlet extractor to keep the microalgae biomass hexane is placed in a round bottomed flask for heating and the evaporated hexane will travel through the microalgae and condensed in the condenser 84 98 the condensed solvent containing lipid will be collected from the round bottom flask the solution will go through distillation for lipid recovery 84 98 the main problems of the conventional methods of biomolecule extraction include the time consuming of the processes and the use of toxic solvents such as hexane and chloroform that can have negative impacts on human health and environment 95 99 thus alternative methods of biomolecules extractions are the interest of the researchers 4 recent advances technologies for the extraction of proteins and lipids from microalgae 4 1 liquid biphasic flotation system membrane based technology and liquid biphasic flotation system are the emerging advanced techniques of biomolecules extractions because the processing method is cheap environmentally friendly and does not require high energy input 100 due to the demand for protein extraction technology the cost of protein recovery varies from 30 80 1 101 liquid biphasic flotation lbf is an emerging method of biomolecules extraction because it could overcome the limitations of conventional methods lbf also known as the aqueous two phase flotation atpf is an integrated separation method of the aqueous two phase system atps and solvent sublation ss involving the formation of two immiscible liquid phases that are equilibrium 102 103 lbf is efficient in extracting biomolecules because the process is simple environmentally friendly short processing time compared to the conventional extraction method has a high concentration coefficient scalability and versatility 104 the limitations of an lbf are it is not a continuous system thus microalgae are needed to be removed and added to the system by batch and it uses requires a large amount of chemicals nevertheless the chemicals are recyclable and can be used again for the subsequent batches of biomolecule extraction 105 106 the enhancement of biomolecules extraction using lbf is an ongoing research whereby the traditional mass transfer mode is altered using or substituting different types of chemicals in the system 107 the operation of lbf is carried out by having two immiscible liquid phases consisting of salt solution and an alcohol or a polymer solution 108 110 microalgae is mixed with the salt solution and placed at the bottom phase while alcohol or a polymer is placed at the top phase and air bubbles are injected at the bottom of the system known as sublation column 104 the core process of an lbf is the air bubbles whereby the natural active surface of the biomolecules will attach to the surface of the air bubbles in the salt solution and dissolve in the hydrophilic alcohol polymer once it reaches the top phase forming two phases the polymer or alcohol functions as biomolecule accumulator allowing the biomolecules to accumulate in the top phase 102 104 111 lbf was first used for the extraction of penicillin g from a fermented broth using polyethylene glycol as the top phase and ammonium sulphate in the bottom phase 107 since then many applications of lbf were reported such as the extraction of lipase 105 protein 102 penicillin 112 bacteriocin 113 and others 104 table 6 summarises the recovery of protein molecule from microalgae using the lbf system the type of solvents used in the top and bottom phase plays an important role in attaining the biomolecules and the separation efficiency while the separation efficiency depends on the biomolecules of interest a study demonstrated the used of polyethylene glycol and ammonium sulphate for the extraction of penicillin g and achieved the separation efficiency of 95 the same type of solutions and conditions were used to extract puerariae in a different study the separation efficiency was 87 and the total puerariae recovered was 70 107 114 the use of ethylene oxide propylene oxide and ammonium sulphate solutions for the extraction of lipase achieved the separation efficiency of 76 with lipase yield of 75 higher lipase yield recovery and separation efficiency were recorded using 2 propanol and potassium phosphate as solvents 105 115 low separation efficiency of 11 71 was recorded with 29 18 recovery of biomolecules using 1 propanol and sodium dihydrogen phosphate for the extraction of antioxidant peptides 116 the highest separation efficiency and biomolecule recovery of 98 38 and 99 01 were recorded respectively using ethanol and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 117 current studies are focusing on using ionic liquid in the system as it is environmentally friendly for many enzymatic reactions 103 the benefits of ionic liquid include high electricity and ionic conductors low vapour pressure and volatility non flammable stable heat conductor and have a high range of liquid temperature stability 103 125 ionic liquid and inorganic salt solutions have been tested in a study 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate were used in an lbf system to extract protein 96 22 of protein was recovered with purification factor of 6 56 123 in the earlier study extraction of chloramphenicol under the same conditions showed 97 1 101 9 recovery of chloramphenicol 126 apart from that a study on protein extraction using microwave assisted three phase partitioning have helped in the disruption of the microalgae cell wall to ease the process of protein recovery 63 2 of protein was recovered with a separation efficiency of 67 2 127 recovery of astaxanthin recorded to be 95 08 with separation efficiency of 99 74 using the ultrasound assisted lbf 128 recovery of betacyanins increased using an electric assisted lbf 99 of betacyanins was recovered with separation efficiency of 98 38 117 nonetheless lbf has shown promising performance in the extraction of biomolecules from microalgae 5 fundamental principles using membrane based technology for the extraction of biomolecules from microalgae membrane based is an emerging technology because the process is cheap and environmentally friendly compared to conventional methods 100 it is considered cheap because it does not require a lot of solvents and chemicals the chemicals and solvents can instead be recycled throughout the extraction process 129 membrane microfiltration and ultrafiltration have been used for the extraction of emulsified biomolecules in the food petroleum and metallurgy industries 130 this method is considered as one of suitable options for biomolecules extraction for large biomass of microalgae 131 the effectiveness of the membrane filtration method is influenced by the transmembrane pressure tmp shear rate membrane hydrophilicity permeate fluxes initial oil concentration salinity and ph 132 the advantages of the membrane technology include it having a simple and straightforward process requires low capital cost and footprint low energy requirements which makes it economically feasible effective in nutrients recovery low energy requirement able to treat variety types of wastewater and achieve the standard wastewater discharge it is also suitable to integrate the membrane technology with different technologies or processes to maximise the modularity of the system 25 133 the main challenges of membrane filtration method are correlated with membrane fouling which is the bottleneck of the system and needs to be tackled 134 membrane fouling happens when the surface or inside of the membrane pores are blocked with the deposition of organic material 132 hydrophilic membranes are used for the extraction of lipid to minimise the fouling of the membrane by organic matter 100 hydrophilic membranes can be made from cellulose polyethersulfone pes polyacrylonitrile pan hydrophilated polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf 135 apart from that membrane fouling can be reduced by creating turbulence and increasing the shear rate of the system allowing the organic matter to move away from the membrane 132 136 a research found that membrane fouling is less in a rotating disk filtration compared to a cross flow filtration due to the creation of turbulence bubbles 132 table 7 summarises the type of membrane correlated to its size range pore size and functions currently researchers are intensively trying to develop a new membrane to overcome these challenges 132 137 138 phospholipid 1 2 dipalmitoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine dppc membrane with porous diameter of 0 1 μm was developed high lipid content was extracted and recorded 139 improvement of pan membranes was done by immersing it into different concentrations of hydroxylamine hydrochloride the membrane could extract and remove oil from wastewater 138 the hydrophilicity and membrane fouling of polyvinyl chloride pvc membrane could be improved by immersing it into lignin 140 the membrane fouling hydrophilicity of polyethersulfone could also be improved by modifying it with calcium chloride manganese carbonate 141 polyethersulfone modified with calcium chloride showed tremendous increased in wastewater permeability 142 pure water flux increased by four times when modified polyethersulfone membrane was used in ultrafiltration 143 different types of membrane have different functions in extracting biomolecules from microalgae as shown in table 8 5 1 membrane based technology for protein extraction from microalgae microalgae biomass can also produce a high content of protein such as glycoprotein phycoerythrin and phycobiliproteins 7 the common types of microalgae used for the production of proteins are c vulgaris c phycocyanin c sorokiniana 7 146 membrane technology is extensively used in the dairy industry for proteins recovery from milk 147 membrane technology is the alternative methods of microalgae protein extraction as it is environmentally friendly and does not require high energy input 147 membrane technology is suitable to be coupled with seaweed as part of the cascading biorefinery process to increase the valorisation of microalgae components and avoid the presence of heavy metals in the final product 148 microfiltration can be used to remove materials of molecular weight greater than 200 kda such as the components of the algae cell wall and bacteria ultrafiltration can be used to separate proteins with other biomolecules of molecular weight between 1 200 kda the efficiency of different types of membrane using ultrafiltration and microfiltration are summarised in table 9 5 2 membrane based technology for lipid extraction from microalgae microalgae can produce high amount of lipids such as triacylglycerols monounsaturated fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids glycolipids phytosterols and waxes 7 73 microalgae is a promising source for biofuels because it can produce many types of bio products and oil compared to other crops and it was reported that microalgae can produce 5000 gallons of biofuels per acre per year and the production can be 10 to 20 times higher biofuels than from other crops 22 155 156 an ideal process of lipid extraction should be environmentally friendly economically feasible and efficient 11 162 the membrane based systems into the downstream processing of microalgae includethe harvesting of microalgae however this technology could also be adapted for clean separation and biomolecules extraction 100 the efficiency of lipid extraction of different types of membrane is summarised in table 10 the membrane based technologies have been proposed for the recovery of emulsified lipids in wastewater of different industries such as food and petroleum using micro or ultrafiltration process however the efficiency of lipid extraction is strongly correlated with the intensity of lipids and surfactants mixture 163 a study on oil water separation using a photocatalytic reactor combined with ultrafiltration membrane recorded a promising separation of oil from the water 164 combination methods of adsorption membrane filtration and reverse osmosis to treat an oilfield brine wastewater were done 165 from this study they found that lipid recovery was more than 60 higher than using the conventional method some studies have proposed to combine biological treatment with membrane filtration 166 recovery oil from wastewater managed to achieve pure drinking water using membrane filtration technology 167 these methods of oil filtrations have been applied in the process of biomolecules extraction of microalgae membrane based technology may be suitable for large scale microalgae extraction and it has been achieved using the ultrafiltration method 150 6 future perspective microalgae have emerged as an important source of biofuel for the future production of energy however they are still not economically feasible due to its expensive cultivation requirements such as large volume of water and nutrients on a side note wastewater has shown to be a good replacement for these requirements because wastewaters are rich in organic and inorganic molecules that favor the growth of microalgae nonetheless the content of molecules in wastewaters are inconsistent and may contain harmful substances that may lead to the contamination of microalgae and extra monitoring requirement to avoid contamination of the microalgae analysis on the present substances in the wastewater should be carried out present of toxic or harmful substances should be removed before used or extra monitoring will be required the cost of decontaminating microalgae and monitoring should be analysed in future studies to fully understand the cost effectiveness and the feasibility of growing microalgae in wastewater apart from that a study of wastewater remediation using other microorganisms such as bacterial and the relationship between the microalgae and pathogens e g concentration biomass productivity in wastewater should be further looked into also membrane based technology of lipid and protein extraction is environmentally friendly as it requires fewer chemicals and electricity usage compared to the conventional methods however this technology is strongly correlated to membrane fouling therefore development of new membranes should be further explored to overcome membrane fouling the other main disadvantage of membrane based technology is that the extraction of lipid is not a continuous process whereby feedstocks are added by batch and the membranes are required to be replaced for a certain period leading to high processing cost for the loading and unloading of feedstocks and membranes alternative continuous processes should be explored and the full cost of lipid extraction process using membrane based technology should be analysed in the future study furthermore the optimization of lbf system for biomolecules extractions can also be evaluated with prospects in integrating the membrane based system with the lbf system to observe the feasibility of recycling the phase solutions 7 practical applications from the study we found that wastewater is suitable to be used as the medium for microalgae cultivation because it is rich in nutrients and can support the nutrients needed for microalgae to grow factors influencing the growth of microalgae are temperature light intensity water source nutrients availability and also the concentration of co2 however different species may react differently to light intensity therefore a suitable species should be analysed and studied to ensure it is feasible and can grow in the natural environment apart from that actions to scale up the utilisation of microalgae is to genetically modified microalgae to allow higher production of biomolecules it was seen that the genetically modified microalgae could produce up to 35 more lipid 168 8 conclusion this study highlights that the cultivation of microalgae in wastewater supports the process of wastewater treatment wastewater is also a reliable source of nutrients for the production of biomolecules and microalgae biomass however different microalgae species may react differently to the content of the nutrients on the other hand advanced technologies of biomolecules extraction such as the lbf have shown to be able to extract more biomolecules compared to the conventional methods in addition the pre treatment process of the microalgae increased the recovery of biomolecules using the lbf system as the disrupted cell wall of the microalgae enhances the viability of biomolecule nonetheless membrane based technologies revealed its feasibility in the extraction of protein using polysulfone membrane with molecular cut offs of 0 1 μm 30 kda and 40 kda while the polysulfone membrane recovered the highest lipid with the molecular cut offs of 30 kda declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

13709,cultivating photosynthetic microbes in city wastewater may help to achieve environmental sustainability owing to concomitant pollutant removal biological transformation of the nutrients into bioproducts and atmospheric carbon fixation cyanobacteria are the most efficient photosynthetic fixers of atmospheric carbon along with the microalgae the present study was focused on optimizing the growth conditions for a newly isolated filamentous cyanobacterium plectonema terebrans berc10 to achieve enhanced biomass and metabolite productivity for a multiproduct biorefinery using various compositions of synthetic wastewaters higher biomass productivity of 140 mg l 1 d 1 dried mass with co2 sequestration rate of 250 mg l 1 day 1 was achieved by mimicking the summer 32 2 c cultivation conditions which was further favored by the wastewater derived alkalinity ph 10 0 11 0 the biomass produced was rich in carbohydrates and lipids having 58 68 mgg 1d 1 and 39 25 mgg 1d 1 of carbohydrate and lipid productivities respectively while winter cultivation conditions 22 2 c favored higher protein productivity 34 49 mgg 1d 1 when compared to summer conditions additionally in response to excessive nutrients and alkalinity ph 10 0 it produced 180 198 mgg 1 of phycobilins considering the multiproduct concept the phycobilins were extracted and lipids from the residual biomass were converted to biodiesel and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms intrestingly phycobilin extraction had no negative impact on the quality and content of the biodiesel in the residual biomass these features make the plectonema terebrans berc10 a promising candidate for the biological transformation of wastewater derived nutrients to biofuels and bioproducts keywords bioprospecting low cost cultivation environmental sustainability stress manipulation multiproduct biorefinery 1 introduction cyanobacteria are evolutionary important and divergent microbes which offer the potential to address the pressing concerns of renewable energy resources environmental mitigation water and energy conservation cyanobacteria are versatile feedstock with comprehensive biotechnological and biorefinery applications they often accumulate a high content of carbohydrates proteins lipids and pigments based on their biochemical composition different cyanobacteria could be exploited for a variety of valuable bio products including biodiesel bioethanol colorants and food supplements 1 environmental factors including ph nutrients and temperature influence the biochemical composition while manipulating these factors is a common approach for improving the metabolite content which has been discussed in detail previously 2 3 diverse culturing adaptability the highest co2 sequestration pollutant removal ability buoyancy regulation and ability to produce diverse metabolites in response to variable abiotic factors make the cyanobacteria and microalgae suitable biological resources to establish multiproduct biorefineries 4 many cyanobacterial species have been reported worldwide but only a few have been explored economically still there is a large gap in process optimization and understanding the molecular nature of these exceptional organisms thus far commercial use of cyanobacteria is potentially sustainable but economic feasibility is still to be achieved due to cultivation harvesting and processing constraints it is imperative to optimize cultivation conditions for enhanced biomass and metabolite production to attain the full potential of the cyanobacterial biomass 5 however their cultivation requires huge amounts of freshwater which puts a burden on already scarce water resources instead the utilization of wastewater as cultivation media in mixotrophic conditions has been recommended as a cost effective alternative to enhance the biomass productivity with concomitant removal of pollutants and photosynthetic fixation of atmospheric carbon 5 6 several studies have evaluated the feasibility of wastewater based cultivation of cyanobacteria and microalgae 7 9 and indicated predominance of cyanobacteria over microalgae in wastewater treatment systems 10 for instance arthrospira platensis produced 4 4 mg l 1 h 1 of biomass in olive oil mill wastewater treated with sodium hypochlorite 11 the same cyanobacterial strain produced 199 mg l 1day 1 of biomass with a high carbohydrate content 37 44 when cultivated in raw poultry litter leachate 12 while the consortia of chlorella and phormodium produced 3 48 gm 2d 1 of biomass in municipal wastewater without the control of external abiotic conditions 13 however biomass production in wastewater is often compromised due to the source of wastewater and associated contamination chances accordingly various approaches including the use of odd ph either high or low use of chemicals pesticides or ultra violet radiation 5 have been reported to control contaminations however these approaches either increase the operational cost or compromise the growth and yield of the target metabolites employment of alkaliphile cyanobacterial species offers a plausible solution to alleviate contamination risks alkaline solutions can rapidly scavenge co2 from the atmosphere and are predominant with bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 as dissolved inorganic carbon dic bicarbonates in aqueous solution provide readily available inorganic carbon that improves algal growth photosynthetic rate induce lipid accumulation and decrease photorespiration the competing process to carboxylation which inhibits co2 fixation and thus reduces photosynthetic efficiency 14 cyanobacteria s ability to readily utilize hco3 at extreme ph through carbon concentration mechanism ccm makes them powerful cell factories for co2 sequestration 15 and valuable metabolite production boatman et al discussed the detailed mechanism of ph dependent bicarbonate utilization via cyanobacteria cultivation 16 a novel concept which is based on combining bicarbonate based co2 absorption with wastewater based cultivation for algal growth offers a promising alternative to conventional standalone technologies this system offers the potential benefit of high efficiency and low contamination risks for cyanobacterial and algal growth while avoiding the bottlenecks of standalone processes 17 the bicarbonate rich swine wastewater enhanced the biomass production of dictyosphaerium by four fold 18 similarly ammonium bicarbonate supplementation of soybean wastewater resulted in a protein rich 48 1 mg l 1day 1 biomass of chlorella 83 3 mg l 1day 1 which showed 70 and 49 5 carbon conversion and removal efficiencies respectively however the biomass was shown to contain lower content of lipids 1 9 mg l 1day 1 and polysaccharides 1 1 mg l 1day 1 19 however limited information is available on cyanobacterial growth and biochemical composition by utilizing bicarbonate supplemented wastewater additionally the use of biofilm based biomass filamentous algae or cyanobacteria offers the benefits of easy harvesting 5 15 biomass by scrapping or flotation 20 reduced dewatering cost and high proliferation rate due to extra exposure of cells to illumination and nutrients moreover biofilm formation is also associated with survival mechanism that helps cyanobacteria and microalgae to tolerate stress conditions 21 cultivation of biofilms forming cyanobacteria in bicarbonate supplemented wastewater seems a promising strategy to enhance biomass production and metabolite content alkalophilic cyanobacteria arthrospira spirulina platensis could tolerate 0 23 mol l 1 of dissolved inorganic carbon at ph 9 8 to produce 782 mg l 1day 1 of biomass with 391 mg l 1day 1 of co2 fixation rate 22 however most of these studies were limited to the impact of bicarbonate on co2 fixation and growth patterns of the filamentous cyanobacteria and thus required further research initiatives to understand its impact on the biochemical composition of cyanobacteria the present study was focused on evaluating the growth pattern and biorefinery potential of a newly isolated cyanobacterial strain in response to stress manipulation by exploiting bicarbonate supplemented wastewater besides the study was aimed to evaluate the impact of diverse nutrient and varying seasonal conditions on the composition and content of the lipids carbohydrates proteins and pigments because these are the components that can be converted into various products additionally ph stress was employed as a strategy to control the contamination keeping in view the downstream processing in a biorefinery the pigment free biomass was assessed for lipid content and biodiesel related fame profiling to evaluate its potential applications in the biorefinery it is the first study on the bioprospecting and detailed characterization of haloalkaliphilic cyanobacterium plectonema terebrans berc10 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection purification and maintenance the wastewater sample showing greenish growth was collected from faisalabad punjab pakistan 31 24 23 n 73 3 40 e during early summer approximately 5 10 g fresh weight of the sample along with surrounding wastewater was cautiously collected in 250 ml plastic collection bottles which were capped underwater the sample was labeled with a specific number along with details of the collection site and was transferred to the lab on the same day for further processing given the diameter of the collected sample 20 μm it was passed through the mesh and rinsed twice with distilled water to remove attached nutrients sediments the strain was purified using dilution plating until the single type of cells were observed under the compound microscope optika microscope italy the purified sample named as berc10 was maintained at room temperature 25 1 c under cool fluorescent light in bg11 media 23 for the cultural enrichment 2 2 morphological and molecular identification the light microscope equipped with 5 megapixels digital camera optika microscope italy was used to obtain micrographs of the culture before and after purification the strain was filamentous and its micrographs were compared with the literature for morphological identification for molecular identification total genomic dna was isolated using the ctab cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method analyzed on 1 0 w v agarose gel and was quantified using nanodrop colibri microvolume spectrometer titertek berthold germany genomic dna was used as a template to amplify the 23s rrna gene using the specific primer pair 23f 5 ggacagaaagaccctatgaa 3 and 23r 5 tcagcctgttatccctagag 3 pcr polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed using the thermocycler multigene optimax thermocycler labnet international usa where initial degradation was performed at 94 c for 10 min followed by 35 cycles with degradation at 94 c for 5 min annealing at 57 c for 1 min extension at 72 c for 1 min and a final extension at 72 c for 10 min the amplicons were cloned into pjet pcr cloning vector thermo scientific kit k1231 us using the manufacturer s instruction and transformed into e coli competent cells by heat shock method the selection was made on ampicillin lb plates the positive clones were confirmed through colony pcr the plasmid of the positive clone was purified using the plasmid miniprep kit thermo scientific kit k0502 k0503 us and sent to macrogen korea for sequencing the sequences were cleaned through bioedit reference sequences were obtained through blast searching against the non redundant database taxonomic elucidation against related sequences was done through fasttree using maximum likelihood method for phylogenetic tree construction 24 whereas post scripting and visualization were improved by itol and coreldraw 25 2 3 optimization of growth conditions newly isolated strains usually require preliminary experiments to find the optimum growth conditions for this reason the conditions including growth media inoculum size irradiance and ph were studied in preliminary experiments and the set of conditions that favored maximum growth was considered as optimum all parameters were kept constant except the one being tested to optimize the cultivation media the strain was cultivated in autoclaved sterilized media standard media namely bg11 and bbm as shown in table s1 supplementary material 23 to optimize the inoculum size inoculum sizes ranging from 0 5 g l 1 to 2 g l 1 fresh biomass basis were used to find the optimum inoculum size two light intensities of 150 μmol m 2s 1 and 300 μmol m 2s 1 were tested to evaluate the impact of irradiance on the biomass production where the light was provided through cool fluorescent led lights philips japan the effect of varying initial ph ranging from ph 5 0 to ph 9 0 on biomass production and ph tolerance was evaluated by cultivating the sample in the optimum media while the initial ph of the media was maintained by using 1 0 m naoh or hcl all the experiments were conducted in triplicate at the lab scale in 500 ml flasks containing 200 ml media in 15 day batch cultivation under cool fluorescent light with 12 h light 12 h dark period 2 4 wastewater cultivation for enhanced biomass production the use of synthetic wastewater is feasible to evaluate the wastewater cultivation potential of novel cyanobacterial species the strain was cultivated in varying compositions of synthetic wastewaters to find the optimum nutrient composition and concentration supporting the biomass production varying synthetic wastewater compositions named sww synthetic municipal wastewater asw artificial synthetic wastewater and mbg modified bg11 synthetic wastewater were tested as shown in table s1 supplementary material to evaluate the one which mimics the composition and behavior of municipal wastewater mww municipal wastewater was collected from the local wastewater drainage site however prior to use it was filtered through ordinary strainer to remove the suspended solids and autoclaved to remove the biological contaminants ch3coonh4 kno3 and nano3 bicarbonate was used as major nutrient sources in sww asw and mbg respectively the strain was cultivated in standard medium bg11 ph 8 0 and in synthetic wastewater mbg under optimum conditions at ph 8 0 and ph 10 0 which were labeled as mbg 8 and mbg 10 respectively the temperature for both cultivation conditions was separately maintained at 32 2 c and 22 2 c to mimic the summer and winter conditions respectively 2 5 growth and co2 fixation rates growth was estimated at 5 10 and 15 days to study the impact of the set of conditions on the biomass and metabolite production the ph of the media was monitored at regular intervals using a handheld ph meter model ph 450 thermo scientific eutech usa the biomass was harvested and was freeze dried using lyophilization alpha 2 4 lscbasic christ germany the mass of the biomass was measured gravimetrically at regular intervals 5 10 and 15 days growth parameters like biomass production productivity eq 1 specific growth rate eq 2 and doubling time eq 3 were calculated by using the standard formula as described previously 23 1 pbiomass my mx ty tx where pbiomass is biomass productivity in mgl 1d 1

the biomass co2 fixation rate mgl 1d 1 was calculated by the following equation eq 4 derived from the typical molecular formula of algal biomass co0 48 h1 83 n0 11 p0 01 26 4 pco2 1 883 pbiomass 2 6 biochemical assays after harvesting and quantification the lyophilized biomass was subjected to biochemical analyses including total proteins carbohydrates and pigments carbohydrate content was measured by the modified dubois method 27 briefly 20 mg of biomass was treated with sulfuric acid for the hydrolysis of carbohydrates the released sugars were estimated by measuring the absorbance at λ490 nm using uv vis single beam spectrophotometer model ae s60 2u a e lab uk after phenolic reaction with furfural derivatives the absorbance values were converted into sugar concentration by the equation derived from a standard glucose curve similarly protein extraction was performed by hot alkaline treatment at 80 95 c with 0 5 n naoh while quantification was done through micro biuret method naoh extracts were assayed at λ430 nm in quartz cuvette with 2 ml of extract and 1 ml of 30 naoh copper sulfate as described previously 62 total chlorophylls were estimated to determine the photosynthetic efficiency while other pigments including carotenoids and phycobilins were estimated to evaluate the biotechnological applications for chlorophyll estimation 20 mg of freeze dried stored at 80 c biomass was treated with 5 ml of methanol at 4 c for 12 24 h to release the chlorophyll and carotenoids the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at λ664 nm λ649 nm λ470 nm and the amount of chlorophyll a eq 5 chlorophyll b eq 6 and carotenoids eq 7 were calculated by following formulae as described previously 28 5 chl a 13 36 a664 5 19 a649 6 chl b 27 43 a649 8 12 a664 7 c x c 1000 a470 2 13 chl a 97 63chl b 209 where a is absorbance chl a is chlorophyll a ch b chlorophyll b and cx c is carotenoids additionally 100 mg of freeze dried biomass was extracted with 0 1 m phosphate buffer 3 ml to extract phycobilins using teflon coated tubes the debris was removed by centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 10 min the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at λ562 nm λ620 nm and λ652 nm to estimate the amount of phycocyanin pc allophycocyanin apc and phycoerythrin pe respectively by using the following formulae 29 eqs 8 10 8 pc a620 0 047 a652 5 34 9 apc a652 0 208 a620 5 09 10 pe a562 2 41 pc 0 849 apc 9 62 while the residual biomass was oven dried at 50 c for 24 h and processed for lipid estimation using a similar method 30 which was used to extract the lipids from total biomass 2 7 lipid estimation and fatty acids methyl esters fame analysis the modified bligh dyer method 30 was employed to estimate the total lipid content briefly oven dried 50 c total biomass containing pigments and pigment free residual biomass 50 mg were separately treated with chloroform methanol 2 1 to release lipids the lipids from both samples were treated with nacl and chloroform methanol water mixture to remove the non lipid constituents solvent evaporation was performed at 50 c lipid content was measured by using the following formula 11 lipid content w2 w1 wd 100 extracted lipids from total biomass were trans esterified and analyzed by mass spectrometer equipped with the autosampler agilent 7000a triple quadrupole usa coupled with gas chromatogram agilent 7890 usa as described previously 31 mass hunter software agilent was used to process the data the same gc condition with a collision energy of 30 ev and a solvent delay of 5 min was used for quantification in an mrm mode the scan rate was 6 5 cycless 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 strain identification microscopic analysis of the unpurified sample showed the presence of two distinct species which included a unicellular and a filamentous strain however the filamentous strain was dominated and was selected for further studies the purified filamentous strain berc10 appeared light green to deep bluish green depending on its growing phase an interesting feature was the production of gas vesicles below the filaments during cultivation which provided the buoyancy and facilitated harvesting simply through flotation morphologically the filaments were non motile and long unbranched chain of cylindrical cells which were covered with transparent sheath containing heterocyst as shown in fig s1 supplementary material microscopic features filament structure and gas vesicles of berc10 exhibited a close resemblance with the predominant members of pseudanabaena limonthrix 32 and oscillatoria however morphological traits are influenced by environmental factors and are not stable which makes it difficult to distinguish between species taxonomic identification of the group oscillatoria is quite difficult due to its polyphyletic and heterogeneous nature especially for lyngbya plectonema and phormodium genera 33 the phylogenetic analysis which were based on the 23s rrna gene sequence showed that the berc10 strain belongs to the plectonema genus as it shared the highest similarity 81 with plectonema terebrans fig 1 however the conserved nature of genetic marker makes it difficult to identify the inter and intra species differences among members of the same genus and a similar problem happened in the present case 32 3 2 optimum growth conditions for enhanced biomass production environmental factors like nutrient media inoculum size ph and irradiance substantially modulate the growth and metabolite content of cyanobacteria these factors must be optimized to find the best conditions for improved biomass production maximum biomass production of 0 5 g l 1 and 0 3 g l 1 dry mass basis were observed when cultured in bg11 and bbm respectively which indicated that p terebrans berc10 performed better in bg11 fig s2 supplementary material which is often observed in cyanobacteria however cultivation media may vary depending on the cyanobacterial strain besides inoculum size is another important parameter for biomass production which influences the microbial population because cultivation conditions are not well studied for plectonema therefore inoculum size was optimized using bg11 as cultivation media and it using 0 5 g l 1 inoculum fresh biomass showed the highest biomass production 0 75 g l 1 dry biomass when compared to the other inoculum sizes it confirmed that biomass production depends on the inoculum size and it often shows an inverse relationship 34 thraustochytrium sp showed maximum biomass production of 4 5 g l 1 with 0 15 g l 1 inoculum size moreover the berc10 also show that an increase in inoculum size positively affected biomass production up to a certain limit however further higher concentrations had a negative effect which was following the previous studies 35 the reason for high biomass production in low inoculum could be better availability of nutrients and light due to minimum competition 36 the ph is another important growth parameter that influences the growth metabolite composition of the biomass availability of nutrients and co2 and sometimes can help to outcompete the contaminating microbes by increasing the cell density besides ph modification also improves the harvesting of biomass through flocculation and flotation though most of the species grow well at neutral ph 7 0 8 0 however a few species have shown to tolerate the ph up to 10 0 11 0 5 interestingly the p terebrans berc10 strain grew at all tested ph ranging from 7 5 to 10 0 however a maximum biomass production of 1 0 g l 1 was achieved at ph 10 followed by 0 9 g l 1 at ph 8 0 this biomass production was considerable when compared to chlorella neochloris arthronema which showed 0 32 g l 1 1 04 g l 1 and 0 54 g l 1 respectively at ph 9 0 37 this feature of p terebrans berc10 makes it suitable for cultivation in the media with variable ph including wastewater from various sources whereas its potential to grow at ph 10 0 can help to outcompete the contaminating microbes this might be a reason that we never observed any bacterial or fungal contamination in open pond 42 l culture in two years of experiments data not shown irradiance is another critical factor which modulate cell proliferation co2 fixation rate and biochemical composition especially light harvesting pigments of cyanobacteria however there is still a gap in understanding the light dependent growth pattern of cyanobacteria because this phenomenon is highly species specific here low light intensity favored the biomass production of berc10 to 1 3 g l 1 dried mass basis in bg11 while high light intensity favored biomass production to 0 8 g l 1 dried mass basis in the municipal wastewater it showed an inverse relationship between light intensity and biomass production these results were consistent with previous studies where anabaena and microcystic showed high growth in low light 25 μe m 2s 1 and poor growth in high light 200 μe m 2s 1 however aboim et al reported that high light was feasible for the growth of synechococcus and limonthrix in high nutrient concentration while in standard media low light intensity was appropriate for the growth of scenedesmus abundans and synechocystis 38 reduced growth at high light intensity could be due to photosystem produced h2o2 3 3 use of wastewater as low cost growth media wastewater is a major problem especially among the heavily populated countries including pakistan india and china its treatment is a burden on these economies however if it is used for the cultivation of microalgae and cyanobacteria it may not only save the pretreatment costs rather it will be considered as a low cost resource nitrates phosphates and carbonates are known to be the key nutrients pollutants which are present in the wastewater and considerably influence the growth and composition of the biomass in preliminary experiments of evaluating various compositions of wastewater table 1 it was shown that although p terebrans berc10 could utilize various nitrogen sources yet nano3 was the most preferred among various nitrogen sources data not shown accordingly the p terebrans berc10 strain showed a higher biomass production 1 8 2 2 g l 1 on dried mass basis when cultured in the synthetic wastewater named as mbg when compared to the biomass produced in municipal wastewater and other synthetic wastewater fig 2 a at both ph 8 0 and ph 10 0 it was demonstrated that the p terebrans berc10 performed exceptionally well when compared to the biomass produced by other strains cultivated in wastewater including tetraselmis 1 33 g l 1 nannochloropsis 1 81 g l 1 dunaliella 1 37 g l 1 39 scenedesmus quadricauda 0 36 g l 1 40 and spirulina 0 33 g l 1 41 the reason for high biomass production of p terebrans berc10 might be the robust utilization of higher concentrations of carbon and nitrogen in the synthetic wastewater however cultivation of algal consortia consisting of phormodium and chlorella in domestic grey wastewater produced 3 64 gm 2d 1 of biomass 42 the reason of higher growth could be due to combined nutrient utilization efficiency of consortia interestingly regardless of the initial ph of the medium mbg the culture always attained a maximum ph of 11 0 on the 10th day and then slightly reduced to ph 10 0 on the 15th day on the other hand all tested wastewaters tend to attain ph 7 0 fig 2b c it indicated that efficient photosynthesis resulted in a higher uptake rate of co2 which raised the ph of the synthetic wastewater mbg therefore enhanced biomass production with a concomitant increase in ph reduced the chances of contamination hence a combined effect of the nutrient availability and ph fluctuation can be an effective strategy for enhanced biomass production along with the reduced risk of contamination however it would be important to see how these conditions influence the metabolites being produced in the biomass 3 4 impact of stress conditions on biomass production it was found that under all cultivation conditions cells reached their exponential phase on the 15th day the maximum biomass production of 2 g l 1 was observed in the mbg 10 mbg11 ph 10 0 when compared to 1 12 g l 1 in bg11 control and 1 28 g l 1 in mbg 8 mbg11 ph 8 0 fig 3 a previously chou et al 43 achieved 1 99 g l 1 of biomass by cultivating chlorella 359 a mutant strain in a media supplemented with 5 co2 while similar biomass production was achieved by the wild type strain with sodium bicarbonate supplementation similarly the cultivation of synechocystis in 0 6 g l 1 of sodium bicarbonate produced 2 24 g l 1 of biomass with 0 22 g l 1day 1 of co2 fixation rate 44 cultivation of dunaliella salina in 5 g l 1 nahco3 produced 3 17 g l 1 of biomass 45 the maximum co2 fixation rate of 250 mgl 1day 1 and 210 mg l 1day 1 was observed in mbg 10 during summer and winter respectively although high nutrients slightly improved biomass production yet ph was shown to be the deciding factor that facilitated biomass production it was also observed that summer 32 c conditions favored biomass production and co2 fixation when compared to the winter 22 c conditions table 2 these results supported the fact that cyanobacteria convert hco3 to co2 at 25 35 c through photosynthesis and then fix it at a faster rate moreover the presence of bicarbonates 0 6 g l 1 in mbg improved biomass production and co2 fixation when compared to the control bg11 with no bicarbonate it was observed that consumption of co2 is replenished from the air and the higher alkalinity improved the rate of co2 transfer 46 the ph of the synthetic wastewater was shown to be increasing in a time specific manner to high alkalinity regardless of the initial ph value of the culture while a slight change in ph from 8 0 to 9 0 was observed when the same strain was cultivated in bg11 fig 3b these results indicated that in addition to the role of bicarbonates in ph manipulation the p terebrans berc10 might also have produced some extracellular compounds which might have helped in modifying the ph as a part of the cellular strategy to dominate the environment it is often observed that consumption of bicarbonates as carbon source increases ph which favors the high biomass production due to nitrate consumption and high availability of dissolved inorganic carbon as this ph facilitates the atmospheric carbon uptake 15 and photosynthesis rate these features make the p terebrans berc10 a suitable strain for outdoor cultivation for high biomass production with minimum risk of contamination due to its alkaliphilic nature 3 5 impact of stress conditions on carbohydrate and protein content macronutrients ph and carbon sources have shown to be important factors that influence the metabolite content of the p terebrans berc10 data indicated that temperature in combination with high nutrients and alkalinity remarkably influenced the carbohydrate content in summer nutrient sufficient conditions had a deleterious effect on carbohydrate content which reduced the content from 38 to 24 instead cultivation at alkaline ph enhanced the carbohydrate content from 24 to 29 while in winter the carbohydrate content was increased from 5 to 18 in response to alkaline ph fig 4 p terebrans berc10 shown to have a maximum carbohydrate productivity of 39 25 mg g 1 d 1 and 20 83 mg g 1 d 1 when cultured in alkaline synthetic wastewater mbg 10 under summer and winter conditions respectively carbohydrate content and carbohydrate productivity were higher in summer conditions coinciding with highest biomass productivity in summer conditions when compared to the winter condition the results are strengthening the fact that nutrient starved conditions are suitable for carbohydrate production because in the absence of nitrogen energy dynamics are shifted towards non nitrogenous pathways cyanobacteria often accumulate a large amount of proteins during exponential growth however temperature and nitrogen conditions can also modify the protein content in this study the protein content of p terebrans berc10 ranged from 14 to 39 during various cultivation conditions while the highest protein content 39 was observed during winter as compared to in summer 24 76 upon cultivation in standard media fig 4 however the p terebrans berc10 had 19 11 mg g 1 d 1 and 34 49 mg g 1 d 1 of protein productivity when cultured in mbg 10 alkaline synthetic wastewater ph 10 0 during summer and winter conditions respectively these results are consistence with the previous findings where increasing temperature impaired protein synthesis however this effect might be relieved by the synthesis of protective pigments phycobilin and carotenoids and efficient carbon fixation 47 moreover the high ph alone and or in combination with high nutrients had little or no effect on protein production previously nahco3 and nano3 supplemented cultivation of chlorella l38 had also exhibited a similar trend where carbohydrate and protein content was shown to be enhanced with increasing ph 48 similarly the alkalinity and bicarbonate supplementation improved the carbohydrate content of nostoc 49 and synechococcus 50 while in another study the carbohydrate contents of two cyanobacterial strains namely lyngbya limnetica and oscillatoria obscura were 0 219 gg 1 and 0 192 gg 1 dry biomass basis respectively when cultured at ph 9 0 51 3 6 impact of stress conditions on lipid profile and biodiesel production lipids are the metabolite of interest owing to their specific potential to produce biodiesel however to meet the commercial requirements of biodiesel production there is a need to enhance the lipid content and biodiesel quality to improve the recovery in financial terms manipulation of growth conditions has shown to be a cost effective and efficient strategy to achieve this fate in the case of p terebrans berc10 table 3 time course lipid production analysis showed that p terebrans berc10 is a lipid rich strain that produced 33 49 lipid content under various cultivation conditions fig 4 in summer high nutrients significantly improved the lipid content from 33 to 41 while in winter nutrient concentration had little or no impact on the lipid content moreover alkaline ph also had a positive impact on the lipid content during summer while had a negative impact in winter although 33 49 of lipid was produced when cultured in bg11 and mbg 8 modified bg11 synthetic wastewater ph 8 0 yet maximum lipid productivity of 58 68 mg g 1 d 1 and 47 79 mgg 1d 1 was obtained when cultured in mbg 10 medium modified bg11 alkaline synthetic wastewater ph 10 0 under summer and winter conditions respectively this means higher biomass productivity during summer conditions enhanced an overall higher lipid production when p terebrans berc10 was cultured in modified bg11 at ph 10 0 fatty acid fa composition determines the biodiesel production and its properties the qualitative gc ms analysis showed that the lipids of p terebrans berc10 were dominated by fatty acid methyl esters fame ranging from c16 to c18 moreover the media composition mainly affected the unsaturated fame content while it had almost no remarkable impact on saturated fame fig 5 a balanced combination of saturated and unsaturated fame is important because biodiesel rich in saturated fame could solidify easily while the one rich in unsaturated fame can be readily oxidized 55 it was observed that cultivation in high nutrients improved the monounsaturated fatty acid mufa content however negatively influenced the polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa content pufa to mufa conversion would have been occurred due to bicarbonate supplementation which would have triggered the accumulation of neutral polar lipids and triacylglycerides to strengthen the cell membrane thus activating the stress tolerant machinery and cellular oxygen evolving activity a similar trend was previously observed in the co2 supplemented algal cultures 56 fame composition remained same in response to high alkalinity which showed that cultivation of p terebrans berc10 in high alkalinity was feasible for lipid production without effecting the biodiesel composition mufa rich biodiesel has shown improved flow properties high solidification temperature and no oxidation dependent degradation 57 qualitative and quantitative analysis of the fame fig 5d e indicated that p terebrans berc10 biodiesel was rich in c16 1 followed by c18 1 while high nutrient conditions slightly modified the biodiesel composition the maximum amount of 19 3 mgg 1 and 2 81 mgg 1 of palmitic acid and oleic acid was produced when cultured in bg11 in response to high nutrients 13 07 mgg 1 of palmitic acid and 2 61 mgg 1 of oleic acid were produced indicating that this condition had a negative impact on palmitic acid with almost no effect on oleic acid however high ph reduced the amount of palmitic acid to 10 42 mgg 1 and methyl stearate to 1 73 mgg 1 3 7 impact of stress conditions on biosynthesis of pigments cyanobacteria are known to produce photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and carotenoids along with light harvesting proteins known as phycobilins phycocyanin allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin the production of phycobilins is species specific and depends on cultivation conditions the maximum photosynthetic activity was observed on the 15th day when p terebrans berc10 was cultured in bg11 followed by mbg 8 and mbg 10 the time course analysis revealed that 4 15 7 2 mgg 1 of chlorophyll a 0 86 3 67 mgg 1 of chlorophyll b and 0 22 1 16 mgg 1 of carotenoids were produced by p terebrans berc10 in response to various growth conditions fig 6 a phycobilins pb are high value resources due to their immense biotechnological applications in food health and cosmetic industry owing to their bioactive properties concentration and composition of phycobilin are modified in response to nutrient ph and temperature the efficient recovery of this resource needs a higher yield evaluation of p terebrans berc10 in response to various growth conditions has shown its remarkable ability to produce a high amount of phycobilins especially phycocyanin though maximum phycobilin content was produced during summer conditions 4 18 the strain also exhibited a remarkable potential to produce pigments during winter 8 11 fig 4 a similar trend was observed in synechocystic spirulina synechococcus anabaena nostoc and lyngbya where temperature above or equal to 30 c enhanced the pb production 58 the maximum phycobilin yield of 198 mgg 1 and 180 4 mgg 1 was obtained on the 10th day of cultivation when cultured in mbg 10 and on 15th day when cultured in mbg 8 respectively fig 6b which is higher than other pb producing cyanobacterial strains cultivated under similar conditions supplementation of spirulina with sodium bicarbonate enhanced phycoerythrin pe and allophycocyanin apc production while showed a negative impact on phycocyanin pc production 59 wastewater cultivated pseudanabaena mucicola produced 237 mgg 1 of pb 60 which is the highest reported yield to date as per our knowledge whereas the mbg 10 cultivated sample contained 198 6 mgg 1 of pb comprising of 154 9 mgg 1 of pc 37 1 mgg 1 of apc and 6 6 mgg 1 of pe while mbg 8 cultivated sample contained 180 4 mgg 1 pb comprising of 138 mgg 1 of pc 33 3 mgg 1 of apc and 9 1 mgg 1 of pe which is a comparable yield overall phycobilin production as well as concentrations of pc apc and pe have been affected by the addition of nitrogen due to nitrogen fixing ability of plectonema few studies are available on the impact of ph and carbon alone or combined on the phycobilin production therefore further detailed studies are required in this area however alkaline ph 8 0 11 0 often facilitates the biomass and phycobilin pb production 58 which is per our findings though the phenomenon is species specific it also indicated that pb production was enhanced in response to high nutrients while ph had no considerable effects on pb production 4 practical applications findings of the present study indicated that the cultivation of the p terebrans berc10 at high ph will promote growth without hampering the biosynthesis of valuable metabolites and will help to outcompete the contaminating microbes the filamentous nature of strain exhibited its additional potential for cost effective harvesting moreover the residual biomass after extraction of pigments did not show any significant difference when compared to the quality and quantity of the lipids present in total biomass this means that the pigment extracted biomass can be used to extract lipids for biodiesel and remaining biomass which is rich in carbohydrates can be subjected to either pyrolysis or biological fermentation that would lead to establishing a multiproduct biorefinery with almost zero waste with better economic profitability 5 future research prospects the substantially higher contents of the high value phycocyanin production of the best quality biodiesel and carbohydrate rich biomass demonstrated the potential of p terebrans berc10 to be used in a multiproduct biorefinery with almost no waste at the end of the processing pipeline however it would need further detailed studies in larger photobioreactors mass scale biomass production and process optimization for the biorefinery 6 conclusions a newly isolated cyanobacterial strain plectonema terebrans berc10 was characterized for its biomass production potential along with the use of its biomass for bioproducts in a biorefinery it showed the potential to be cultured in wastewater municipal and synthetic in an environment having a temperature ranging from 20 to 32 c ph ranging from 9 0 to 11 0 alkaline ph 10 0 favored the biomass and metabolite production especially of lipids carbohydrates and phycobilins pigment extracted biomass did not show any negative impact on lipid profile and biodiesel composition moreover substantial amounts of valuable metabolites in the biomass showed the potential of berc10 to become a candidate strain in a multiproduct biorefinery improved co2 fixation rate and filamentous nature of strain rendered reduced buoyancy resulted in the floatation of the biomass which offered an additional benefit of cost

13709,cultivating photosynthetic microbes in city wastewater may help to achieve environmental sustainability owing to concomitant pollutant removal biological transformation of the nutrients into bioproducts and atmospheric carbon fixation cyanobacteria are the most efficient photosynthetic fixers of atmospheric carbon along with the microalgae the present study was focused on optimizing the growth conditions for a newly isolated filamentous cyanobacterium plectonema terebrans berc10 to achieve enhanced biomass and metabolite productivity for a multiproduct biorefinery using various compositions of synthetic wastewaters higher biomass productivity of 140 mg l 1 d 1 dried mass with co2 sequestration rate of 250 mg l 1 day 1 was achieved by mimicking the summer 32 2 c cultivation conditions which was further favored by the wastewater derived alkalinity ph 10 0 11 0 the biomass produced was rich in carbohydrates and lipids having 58 68 mgg 1d 1 and 39 25 mgg 1d 1 of carbohydrate and lipid productivities respectively while winter cultivation conditions 22 2 c favored higher protein productivity 34 49 mgg 1d 1 when compared to summer conditions additionally in response to excessive nutrients and alkalinity ph 10 0 it produced 180 198 mgg 1 of phycobilins considering the multiproduct concept the phycobilins were extracted and lipids from the residual biomass were converted to biodiesel and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms intrestingly phycobilin extraction had no negative impact on the quality and content of the biodiesel in the residual biomass these features make the plectonema terebrans berc10 a promising candidate for the biological transformation of wastewater derived nutrients to biofuels and bioproducts keywords bioprospecting low cost cultivation environmental sustainability stress manipulation multiproduct biorefinery 1 introduction cyanobacteria are evolutionary important and divergent microbes which offer the potential to address the pressing concerns of renewable energy resources environmental mitigation water and energy conservation cyanobacteria are versatile feedstock with comprehensive biotechnological and biorefinery applications they often accumulate a high content of carbohydrates proteins lipids and pigments based on their biochemical composition different cyanobacteria could be exploited for a variety of valuable bio products including biodiesel bioethanol colorants and food supplements 1 environmental factors including ph nutrients and temperature influence the biochemical composition while manipulating these factors is a common approach for improving the metabolite content which has been discussed in detail previously 2 3 diverse culturing adaptability the highest co2 sequestration pollutant removal ability buoyancy regulation and ability to produce diverse metabolites in response to variable abiotic factors make the cyanobacteria and microalgae suitable biological resources to establish multiproduct biorefineries 4 many cyanobacterial species have been reported worldwide but only a few have been explored economically still there is a large gap in process optimization and understanding the molecular nature of these exceptional organisms thus far commercial use of cyanobacteria is potentially sustainable but economic feasibility is still to be achieved due to cultivation harvesting and processing constraints it is imperative to optimize cultivation conditions for enhanced biomass and metabolite production to attain the full potential of the cyanobacterial biomass 5 however their cultivation requires huge amounts of freshwater which puts a burden on already scarce water resources instead the utilization of wastewater as cultivation media in mixotrophic conditions has been recommended as a cost effective alternative to enhance the biomass productivity with concomitant removal of pollutants and photosynthetic fixation of atmospheric carbon 5 6 several studies have evaluated the feasibility of wastewater based cultivation of cyanobacteria and microalgae 7 9 and indicated predominance of cyanobacteria over microalgae in wastewater treatment systems 10 for instance arthrospira platensis produced 4 4 mg l 1 h 1 of biomass in olive oil mill wastewater treated with sodium hypochlorite 11 the same cyanobacterial strain produced 199 mg l 1day 1 of biomass with a high carbohydrate content 37 44 when cultivated in raw poultry litter leachate 12 while the consortia of chlorella and phormodium produced 3 48 gm 2d 1 of biomass in municipal wastewater without the control of external abiotic conditions 13 however biomass production in wastewater is often compromised due to the source of wastewater and associated contamination chances accordingly various approaches including the use of odd ph either high or low use of chemicals pesticides or ultra violet radiation 5 have been reported to control contaminations however these approaches either increase the operational cost or compromise the growth and yield of the target metabolites employment of alkaliphile cyanobacterial species offers a plausible solution to alleviate contamination risks alkaline solutions can rapidly scavenge co2 from the atmosphere and are predominant with bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 as dissolved inorganic carbon dic bicarbonates in aqueous solution provide readily available inorganic carbon that improves algal growth photosynthetic rate induce lipid accumulation and decrease photorespiration the competing process to carboxylation which inhibits co2 fixation and thus reduces photosynthetic efficiency 14 cyanobacteria s ability to readily utilize hco3 at extreme ph through carbon concentration mechanism ccm makes them powerful cell factories for co2 sequestration 15 and valuable metabolite production boatman et al discussed the detailed mechanism of ph dependent bicarbonate utilization via cyanobacteria cultivation 16 a novel concept which is based on combining bicarbonate based co2 absorption with wastewater based cultivation for algal growth offers a promising alternative to conventional standalone technologies this system offers the potential benefit of high efficiency and low contamination risks for cyanobacterial and algal growth while avoiding the bottlenecks of standalone processes 17 the bicarbonate rich swine wastewater enhanced the biomass production of dictyosphaerium by four fold 18 similarly ammonium bicarbonate supplementation of soybean wastewater resulted in a protein rich 48 1 mg l 1day 1 biomass of chlorella 83 3 mg l 1day 1 which showed 70 and 49 5 carbon conversion and removal efficiencies respectively however the biomass was shown to contain lower content of lipids 1 9 mg l 1day 1 and polysaccharides 1 1 mg l 1day 1 19 however limited information is available on cyanobacterial growth and biochemical composition by utilizing bicarbonate supplemented wastewater additionally the use of biofilm based biomass filamentous algae or cyanobacteria offers the benefits of easy harvesting 5 15 biomass by scrapping or flotation 20 reduced dewatering cost and high proliferation rate due to extra exposure of cells to illumination and nutrients moreover biofilm formation is also associated with survival mechanism that helps cyanobacteria and microalgae to tolerate stress conditions 21 cultivation of biofilms forming cyanobacteria in bicarbonate supplemented wastewater seems a promising strategy to enhance biomass production and metabolite content alkalophilic cyanobacteria arthrospira spirulina platensis could tolerate 0 23 mol l 1 of dissolved inorganic carbon at ph 9 8 to produce 782 mg l 1day 1 of biomass with 391 mg l 1day 1 of co2 fixation rate 22 however most of these studies were limited to the impact of bicarbonate on co2 fixation and growth patterns of the filamentous cyanobacteria and thus required further research initiatives to understand its impact on the biochemical composition of cyanobacteria the present study was focused on evaluating the growth pattern and biorefinery potential of a newly isolated cyanobacterial strain in response to stress manipulation by exploiting bicarbonate supplemented wastewater besides the study was aimed to evaluate the impact of diverse nutrient and varying seasonal conditions on the composition and content of the lipids carbohydrates proteins and pigments because these are the components that can be converted into various products additionally ph stress was employed as a strategy to control the contamination keeping in view the downstream processing in a biorefinery the pigment free biomass was assessed for lipid content and biodiesel related fame profiling to evaluate its potential applications in the biorefinery it is the first study on the bioprospecting and detailed characterization of haloalkaliphilic cyanobacterium plectonema terebrans berc10 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection purification and maintenance the wastewater sample showing greenish growth was collected from faisalabad punjab pakistan 31 24 23 n 73 3 40 e during early summer approximately 5 10 g fresh weight of the sample along with surrounding wastewater was cautiously collected in 250 ml plastic collection bottles which were capped underwater the sample was labeled with a specific number along with details of the collection site and was transferred to the lab on the same day for further processing given the diameter of the collected sample 20 μm it was passed through the mesh and rinsed twice with distilled water to remove attached nutrients sediments the strain was purified using dilution plating until the single type of cells were observed under the compound microscope optika microscope italy the purified sample named as berc10 was maintained at room temperature 25 1 c under cool fluorescent light in bg11 media 23 for the cultural enrichment 2 2 morphological and molecular identification the light microscope equipped with 5 megapixels digital camera optika microscope italy was used to obtain micrographs of the culture before and after purification the strain was filamentous and its micrographs were compared with the literature for morphological identification for molecular identification total genomic dna was isolated using the ctab cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method analyzed on 1 0 w v agarose gel and was quantified using nanodrop colibri microvolume spectrometer titertek berthold germany genomic dna was used as a template to amplify the 23s rrna gene using the specific primer pair 23f 5 ggacagaaagaccctatgaa 3 and 23r 5 tcagcctgttatccctagag 3 pcr polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed using the thermocycler multigene optimax thermocycler labnet international usa where initial degradation was performed at 94 c for 10 min followed by 35 cycles with degradation at 94 c for 5 min annealing at 57 c for 1 min extension at 72 c for 1 min and a final extension at 72 c for 10 min the amplicons were cloned into pjet pcr cloning vector thermo scientific kit k1231 us using the manufacturer s instruction and transformed into e coli competent cells by heat shock method the selection was made on ampicillin lb plates the positive clones were confirmed through colony pcr the plasmid of the positive clone was purified using the plasmid miniprep kit thermo scientific kit k0502 k0503 us and sent to macrogen korea for sequencing the sequences were cleaned through bioedit reference sequences were obtained through blast searching against the non redundant database taxonomic elucidation against related sequences was done through fasttree using maximum likelihood method for phylogenetic tree construction 24 whereas post scripting and visualization were improved by itol and coreldraw 25 2 3 optimization of growth conditions newly isolated strains usually require preliminary experiments to find the optimum growth conditions for this reason the conditions including growth media inoculum size irradiance and ph were studied in preliminary experiments and the set of conditions that favored maximum growth was considered as optimum all parameters were kept constant except the one being tested to optimize the cultivation media the strain was cultivated in autoclaved sterilized media standard media namely bg11 and bbm as shown in table s1 supplementary material 23 to optimize the inoculum size inoculum sizes ranging from 0 5 g l 1 to 2 g l 1 fresh biomass basis were used to find the optimum inoculum size two light intensities of 150 μmol m 2s 1 and 300 μmol m 2s 1 were tested to evaluate the impact of irradiance on the biomass production where the light was provided through cool fluorescent led lights philips japan the effect of varying initial ph ranging from ph 5 0 to ph 9 0 on biomass production and ph tolerance was evaluated by cultivating the sample in the optimum media while the initial ph of the media was maintained by using 1 0 m naoh or hcl all the experiments were conducted in triplicate at the lab scale in 500 ml flasks containing 200 ml media in 15 day batch cultivation under cool fluorescent light with 12 h light 12 h dark period 2 4 wastewater cultivation for enhanced biomass production the use of synthetic wastewater is feasible to evaluate the wastewater cultivation potential of novel cyanobacterial species the strain was cultivated in varying compositions of synthetic wastewaters to find the optimum nutrient composition and concentration supporting the biomass production varying synthetic wastewater compositions named sww synthetic municipal wastewater asw artificial synthetic wastewater and mbg modified bg11 synthetic wastewater were tested as shown in table s1 supplementary material to evaluate the one which mimics the composition and behavior of municipal wastewater mww municipal wastewater was collected from the local wastewater drainage site however prior to use it was filtered through ordinary strainer to remove the suspended solids and autoclaved to remove the biological contaminants ch3coonh4 kno3 and nano3 bicarbonate was used as major nutrient sources in sww asw and mbg respectively the strain was cultivated in standard medium bg11 ph 8 0 and in synthetic wastewater mbg under optimum conditions at ph 8 0 and ph 10 0 which were labeled as mbg 8 and mbg 10 respectively the temperature for both cultivation conditions was separately maintained at 32 2 c and 22 2 c to mimic the summer and winter conditions respectively 2 5 growth and co2 fixation rates growth was estimated at 5 10 and 15 days to study the impact of the set of conditions on the biomass and metabolite production the ph of the media was monitored at regular intervals using a handheld ph meter model ph 450 thermo scientific eutech usa the biomass was harvested and was freeze dried using lyophilization alpha 2 4 lscbasic christ germany the mass of the biomass was measured gravimetrically at regular intervals 5 10 and 15 days growth parameters like biomass production productivity

biochemical assays after harvesting and quantification the lyophilized biomass was subjected to biochemical analyses including total proteins carbohydrates and pigments carbohydrate content was measured by the modified dubois method 27 briefly 20 mg of biomass was treated with sulfuric acid for the hydrolysis of carbohydrates the released sugars were estimated by measuring the absorbance at λ490 nm using uv vis single beam spectrophotometer model ae s60 2u a e lab uk after phenolic reaction with furfural derivatives the absorbance values were converted into sugar concentration by the equation derived from a standard glucose curve similarly protein extraction was performed by hot alkaline treatment at 80 95 c with 0 5 n naoh while quantification was done through micro biuret method naoh extracts were assayed at λ430 nm in quartz cuvette with 2 ml of extract and 1 ml of 30 naoh copper sulfate as described previously 62 total chlorophylls were estimated to determine the photosynthetic efficiency while other pigments including carotenoids and phycobilins were estimated to evaluate the biotechnological applications for chlorophyll estimation 20 mg of freeze dried stored at 80 c biomass was treated with 5 ml of methanol at 4 c for 12 24 h to release the chlorophyll and carotenoids the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at λ664 nm λ649 nm λ470 nm and the amount of chlorophyll a eq 5 chlorophyll b eq 6 and carotenoids eq 7 were calculated by following formulae as described previously 28 5 chl a 13 36 a664 5 19 a649 6 chl b 27 43 a649 8 12 a664 7 c x c 1000 a470 2 13 chl a 97 63chl b 209 where a is absorbance chl a is chlorophyll a ch b chlorophyll b and cx c is carotenoids additionally 100 mg of freeze dried biomass was extracted with 0 1 m phosphate buffer 3 ml to extract phycobilins using teflon coated tubes the debris was removed by centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 10 min the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at λ562 nm λ620 nm and λ652 nm to estimate the amount of phycocyanin pc allophycocyanin apc and phycoerythrin pe respectively by using the following formulae 29 eqs 8 10 8 pc a620 0 047 a652 5 34 9 apc a652 0 208 a620 5 09 10 pe a562 2 41 pc 0 849 apc 9 62 while the residual biomass was oven dried at 50 c for 24 h and processed for lipid estimation using a similar method 30 which was used to extract the lipids from total biomass 2 7 lipid estimation and fatty acids methyl esters fame analysis the modified bligh dyer method 30 was employed to estimate the total lipid content briefly oven dried 50 c total biomass containing pigments and pigment free residual biomass 50 mg were separately treated with chloroform methanol 2 1 to release lipids the lipids from both samples were treated with nacl and chloroform methanol water mixture to remove the non lipid constituents solvent evaporation was performed at 50 c lipid content was measured by using the following formula 11 lipid content w2 w1 wd 100 extracted lipids from total biomass were trans esterified and analyzed by mass spectrometer equipped with the autosampler agilent 7000a triple quadrupole usa coupled with gas chromatogram agilent 7890 usa as described previously 31 mass hunter software agilent was used to process the data the same gc condition with a collision energy of 30 ev and a solvent delay of 5 min was used for quantification in an mrm mode the scan rate was 6 5 cycless 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 strain identification microscopic analysis of the unpurified sample showed the presence of two distinct species which included a unicellular and a filamentous strain however the filamentous strain was dominated and was selected for further studies the purified filamentous strain berc10 appeared light green to deep bluish green depending on its growing phase an interesting feature was the production of gas vesicles below the filaments during cultivation which provided the buoyancy and facilitated harvesting simply through flotation morphologically the filaments were non motile and long unbranched chain of cylindrical cells which were covered with transparent sheath containing heterocyst as shown in fig s1 supplementary material microscopic features filament structure and gas vesicles of berc10 exhibited a close resemblance with the predominant members of pseudanabaena limonthrix 32 and oscillatoria however morphological traits are influenced by environmental factors and are not stable which makes it difficult to distinguish between species taxonomic identification of the group oscillatoria is quite difficult due to its polyphyletic and heterogeneous nature especially for lyngbya plectonema and phormodium genera 33 the phylogenetic analysis which were based on the 23s rrna gene sequence showed that the berc10 strain belongs to the plectonema genus as it shared the highest similarity 81 with plectonema terebrans fig 1 however the conserved nature of genetic marker makes it difficult to identify the inter and intra species differences among members of the same genus and a similar problem happened in the present case 32 3 2 optimum growth conditions for enhanced biomass production environmental factors like nutrient media inoculum size ph and irradiance substantially modulate the growth and metabolite content of cyanobacteria these factors must be optimized to find the best conditions for improved biomass production maximum biomass production of 0 5 g l 1 and 0 3 g l 1 dry mass basis were observed when cultured in bg11 and bbm respectively which indicated that p terebrans berc10 performed better in bg11 fig s2 supplementary material which is often observed in cyanobacteria however cultivation media may vary depending on the cyanobacterial strain besides inoculum size is another important parameter for biomass production which influences the microbial population because cultivation conditions are not well studied for plectonema therefore inoculum size was optimized using bg11 as cultivation media and it using 0 5 g l 1 inoculum fresh biomass showed the highest biomass production 0 75 g l 1 dry biomass when compared to the other inoculum sizes it confirmed that biomass production depends on the inoculum size and it often shows an inverse relationship 34 thraustochytrium sp showed maximum biomass production of 4 5 g l 1 with 0 15 g l 1 inoculum size moreover the berc10 also show that an increase in inoculum size positively affected biomass production up to a certain limit however further higher concentrations had a negative effect which was following the previous studies 35 the reason for high biomass production in low inoculum could be better availability of nutrients and light due to minimum competition 36 the ph is another important growth parameter that influences the growth metabolite composition of the biomass availability of nutrients and co2 and sometimes can help to outcompete the contaminating microbes by increasing the cell density besides ph modification also improves the harvesting of biomass through flocculation and flotation though most of the species grow well at neutral ph 7 0 8 0 however a few species have shown to tolerate the ph up to 10 0 11 0 5 interestingly the p terebrans berc10 strain grew at all tested ph ranging from 7 5 to 10 0 however a maximum biomass production of 1 0 g l 1 was achieved at ph 10 followed by 0 9 g l 1 at ph 8 0 this biomass production was considerable when compared to chlorella neochloris arthronema which showed 0 32 g l 1 1 04 g l 1 and 0 54 g l 1 respectively at ph 9 0 37 this feature of p terebrans berc10 makes it suitable for cultivation in the media with variable ph including wastewater from various sources whereas its potential to grow at ph 10 0 can help to outcompete the contaminating microbes this might be a reason that we never observed any bacterial or fungal contamination in open pond 42 l culture in two years of experiments data not shown irradiance is another critical factor which modulate cell proliferation co2 fixation rate and biochemical composition especially light harvesting pigments of cyanobacteria however there is still a gap in understanding the light dependent growth pattern of cyanobacteria because this phenomenon is highly species specific here low light intensity favored the biomass production of berc10 to 1 3 g l 1 dried mass basis in bg11 while high light intensity favored biomass production to 0 8 g l 1 dried mass basis in the municipal wastewater it showed an inverse relationship between light intensity and biomass production these results were consistent with previous studies where anabaena and microcystic showed high growth in low light 25 μe m 2s 1 and poor growth in high light 200 μe m 2s 1 however aboim et al reported that high light was feasible for the growth of synechococcus and limonthrix in high nutrient concentration while in standard media low light intensity was appropriate for the growth of scenedesmus abundans and synechocystis 38 reduced growth at high light intensity could be due to photosystem produced h2o2 3 3 use of wastewater as low cost growth media wastewater is a major problem especially among the heavily populated countries including pakistan india and china its treatment is a burden on these economies however if it is used for the cultivation of microalgae and cyanobacteria it may not only save the pretreatment costs rather it will be considered as a low cost resource nitrates phosphates and carbonates are known to be the key nutrients pollutants which are present in the wastewater and considerably influence the growth and composition of the biomass in preliminary experiments of evaluating various compositions of wastewater table 1 it was shown that although p terebrans berc10 could utilize various nitrogen sources yet nano3 was the most preferred among various nitrogen sources data not shown accordingly the p terebrans berc10 strain showed a higher biomass production 1 8 2 2 g l 1 on dried mass basis when cultured in the synthetic wastewater named as mbg when compared to the biomass produced in municipal wastewater and other synthetic wastewater fig 2 a at both ph 8 0 and ph 10 0 it was demonstrated that the p terebrans berc10 performed exceptionally well when compared to the biomass produced by other strains cultivated in wastewater including tetraselmis 1 33 g l 1 nannochloropsis 1 81 g l 1 dunaliella 1 37 g l 1 39 scenedesmus quadricauda 0 36 g l 1 40 and spirulina 0 33 g l 1 41 the reason for high biomass production of p terebrans berc10 might be the robust utilization of higher concentrations of carbon and nitrogen in the synthetic wastewater however cultivation of algal consortia consisting of phormodium and chlorella in domestic grey wastewater produced 3 64 gm 2d 1 of biomass 42 the reason of higher growth could be due to combined nutrient utilization efficiency of consortia interestingly regardless of the initial ph of the medium mbg the culture always attained a maximum ph of 11 0 on the 10th day and then slightly reduced to ph 10 0 on the 15th day on the other hand all tested wastewaters tend to attain ph 7 0 fig 2b c it indicated that efficient photosynthesis resulted in a higher uptake rate of co2 which raised the ph of the synthetic wastewater mbg therefore enhanced biomass production with a concomitant increase in ph reduced the chances of contamination hence a combined effect of the nutrient availability and ph fluctuation can be an effective strategy for enhanced biomass production along with the reduced risk of contamination however it would be important to see how these conditions influence the metabolites being produced in the biomass 3 4 impact of stress conditions on biomass production it was found that under all cultivation conditions cells reached their exponential phase on the 15th day the maximum biomass production of 2 g l 1 was observed in the mbg 10 mbg11 ph 10 0 when compared to 1 12 g l 1 in bg11 control and 1 28 g l 1 in mbg 8 mbg11 ph 8 0 fig 3 a previously chou et al 43 achieved 1 99 g l 1 of biomass by cultivating chlorella 359 a mutant strain in a media supplemented with 5 co2 while similar biomass production was achieved by the wild type strain with sodium bicarbonate supplementation similarly the cultivation of synechocystis in 0 6 g l 1 of sodium bicarbonate produced 2 24 g l 1 of biomass with 0 22 g l 1day 1 of co2 fixation rate 44 cultivation of dunaliella salina in 5 g l 1 nahco3 produced 3 17 g l 1 of biomass 45 the maximum co2 fixation rate of 250 mgl 1day 1 and 210 mg l 1day 1 was observed in mbg 10 during summer and winter respectively although high nutrients slightly improved biomass production yet ph was shown to be the deciding factor that facilitated biomass production it was also observed that summer 32 c conditions favored biomass production and co2 fixation when compared to the winter 22 c conditions table 2 these results supported the fact that cyanobacteria convert hco3 to co2 at 25 35 c through photosynthesis and then fix it at a faster rate moreover the presence of bicarbonates 0 6 g l 1 in mbg improved biomass production and co2 fixation when compared to the control bg11 with no bicarbonate it was observed that consumption of co2 is replenished from the air and the higher alkalinity improved the rate of co2 transfer 46 the ph of the synthetic wastewater was shown to be increasing in a time specific manner to high alkalinity regardless of the initial ph value of the culture while a slight change in ph from 8 0 to 9 0 was observed when the same strain was cultivated in bg11 fig 3b these results indicated that in addition to the role of bicarbonates in ph manipulation the p terebrans berc10 might also have produced some extracellular compounds which might have helped in modifying the ph as a part of the cellular strategy to dominate the environment it is often observed that consumption of bicarbonates as carbon source increases ph which favors the high biomass production due to nitrate consumption and high availability of dissolved inorganic carbon as this ph facilitates the atmospheric carbon uptake 15 and photosynthesis rate these features make the p terebrans berc10 a suitable strain for outdoor cultivation for high biomass production with minimum risk of contamination due to its alkaliphilic nature 3 5 impact of stress conditions on carbohydrate and protein content macronutrients ph and carbon sources have shown to be important factors that influence the metabolite content of the p terebrans berc10 data indicated that temperature in combination with high nutrients and alkalinity remarkably influenced the carbohydrate content in summer nutrient sufficient conditions had a deleterious effect on carbohydrate content which reduced the content from 38 to 24 instead cultivation at alkaline ph enhanced the carbohydrate content from 24 to 29 while in winter the carbohydrate content was increased from 5 to 18 in response to alkaline ph fig 4 p terebrans berc10 shown to have a maximum carbohydrate productivity of 39 25 mg g 1 d 1 and 20 83 mg g 1 d 1 when cultured in alkaline synthetic wastewater mbg 10 under summer and winter conditions respectively carbohydrate content and carbohydrate productivity were higher in summer conditions coinciding with highest biomass productivity in summer conditions when compared to the winter condition the results are strengthening the fact that nutrient starved conditions are suitable for carbohydrate production because in the absence of nitrogen energy dynamics are shifted towards non nitrogenous pathways cyanobacteria often accumulate a large amount of proteins during exponential growth however temperature and nitrogen conditions can also modify the protein content in this study the protein content of p terebrans berc10 ranged from 14 to 39 during various cultivation conditions while the highest protein content 39 was observed during winter as compared to in summer 24 76 upon cultivation in standard media fig 4 however the p terebrans berc10 had 19 11 mg g 1 d 1 and 34 49 mg g 1 d 1 of protein productivity when cultured in mbg 10 alkaline synthetic wastewater ph 10 0 during summer and winter conditions respectively these results are consistence with the previous findings where increasing temperature impaired protein synthesis however this effect might be relieved by the synthesis of protective pigments phycobilin and carotenoids and efficient carbon fixation 47 moreover the high ph alone and or in combination with high nutrients had little or no effect on protein production previously nahco3 and nano3 supplemented cultivation of chlorella l38 had also exhibited a similar trend where carbohydrate and protein content was shown to be enhanced with increasing ph 48 similarly the alkalinity and bicarbonate supplementation improved the carbohydrate content of nostoc 49 and synechococcus 50 while in another study the carbohydrate contents of two cyanobacterial strains namely lyngbya limnetica and oscillatoria obscura were 0 219 gg 1 and 0 192 gg 1 dry biomass basis respectively when cultured at ph 9 0 51 3 6 impact of stress conditions on lipid profile and biodiesel production lipids are the metabolite of interest owing to their specific potential to produce biodiesel however to meet the commercial requirements of biodiesel production there is a need to enhance the lipid content and biodiesel quality to improve the recovery in financial terms manipulation of growth conditions has shown to be a cost effective and efficient strategy to achieve this fate in the case of p terebrans berc10 table 3 time course lipid production analysis showed that p terebrans berc10 is a lipid rich strain that produced 33 49 lipid content under various cultivation conditions fig 4 in summer high nutrients significantly improved the lipid content from 33 to 41 while in winter nutrient concentration had little or no impact on the lipid content moreover alkaline ph also had a positive impact on the lipid content during summer while had a negative impact in winter although 33 49 of lipid was produced when cultured in bg11 and mbg 8 modified bg11 synthetic wastewater ph 8 0 yet maximum lipid productivity of 58 68 mg g 1 d 1 and 47 79 mgg 1d 1 was obtained when cultured in mbg 10 medium modified bg11 alkaline synthetic wastewater ph 10 0 under summer and winter conditions respectively this means higher biomass productivity during summer conditions enhanced an overall higher lipid production when p terebrans berc10 was cultured in modified bg11 at ph 10 0 fatty acid fa composition determines the biodiesel production and its properties the qualitative gc ms analysis showed that the lipids of p terebrans berc10 were dominated by fatty acid methyl esters fame ranging from c16 to c18 moreover the media composition mainly affected the unsaturated fame content while it had almost no remarkable impact on saturated fame fig 5 a balanced combination of saturated and unsaturated fame is important because biodiesel rich in saturated fame could solidify easily while the one rich in unsaturated fame can be readily oxidized 55 it was observed that cultivation in high nutrients improved the monounsaturated fatty acid mufa content however negatively influenced the polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa content pufa to mufa conversion would have been occurred due to bicarbonate supplementation which would have triggered the accumulation of neutral polar lipids and triacylglycerides to strengthen the cell membrane thus activating the stress tolerant machinery and cellular oxygen evolving activity a similar trend was previously observed in the co2 supplemented algal cultures 56 fame composition remained same in response to high alkalinity which showed that cultivation of p terebrans berc10 in high alkalinity was feasible for lipid production without effecting the biodiesel composition mufa rich biodiesel has shown improved flow properties high solidification temperature and no oxidation dependent degradation 57 qualitative and quantitative analysis of the fame fig 5d e indicated that p terebrans berc10 biodiesel was rich in c16 1 followed by c18 1 while high nutrient conditions slightly modified the biodiesel composition the maximum amount of 19 3 mgg 1 and 2 81 mgg 1 of palmitic acid and oleic acid was produced when cultured in bg11 in response to high nutrients 13 07 mgg 1 of palmitic acid and 2 61 mgg 1 of oleic acid were produced indicating that this condition had a negative impact on palmitic acid with almost no effect on oleic acid however high ph reduced the amount of palmitic acid to 10 42 mgg 1 and methyl stearate to 1 73 mgg 1 3 7 impact of stress conditions on biosynthesis of pigments cyanobacteria are known to produce photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and carotenoids along with light harvesting proteins known as phycobilins phycocyanin allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin the production of phycobilins is species specific and depends on cultivation conditions the maximum photosynthetic activity was observed on the 15th day when p terebrans berc10 was cultured in bg11 followed by mbg 8 and mbg 10 the time course analysis revealed that 4 15 7 2 mgg 1 of chlorophyll a 0 86 3 67 mgg 1 of chlorophyll b and 0 22 1 16 mgg 1 of carotenoids were produced by p terebrans berc10 in response to various growth conditions fig 6 a phycobilins pb are high value resources due to their immense biotechnological applications in food health and cosmetic industry owing to their bioactive properties concentration and composition of phycobilin are modified in response to nutrient ph and temperature the efficient recovery of this resource needs a higher yield evaluation of p terebrans berc10 in response to various growth conditions has shown its remarkable ability to produce a high amount of phycobilins especially phycocyanin though maximum phycobilin content was produced during summer conditions 4 18 the strain also exhibited a remarkable potential to produce pigments during winter 8 11 fig 4 a similar trend was observed in synechocystic spirulina synechococcus anabaena nostoc and lyngbya where temperature above or equal to 30 c enhanced the pb production 58 the maximum phycobilin yield of 198 mgg 1 and 180 4 mgg 1 was obtained on the 10th day of cultivation when cultured in mbg 10 and on 15th day when cultured in mbg 8 respectively fig 6b which is higher than other pb producing cyanobacterial strains cultivated under similar conditions supplementation of spirulina with sodium bicarbonate enhanced phycoerythrin pe and allophycocyanin apc production while showed a negative impact on phycocyanin pc production 59 wastewater cultivated pseudanabaena mucicola produced 237 mgg 1 of pb 60 which is the highest reported yield to date as per our knowledge whereas the mbg 10 cultivated sample contained 198 6 mgg 1 of pb comprising of 154 9 mgg 1 of pc 37 1 mgg 1 of apc and 6 6 mgg 1 of pe while mbg 8 cultivated sample contained 180 4 mgg 1 pb comprising of 138 mgg 1 of pc 33 3 mgg 1 of apc and 9 1 mgg 1 of pe which is a comparable yield overall phycobilin production as well as concentrations of pc apc and pe have been affected by the addition of nitrogen due to nitrogen fixing ability of plectonema few studies are available on the impact of ph and carbon alone or combined on the phycobilin production therefore further detailed studies are required in this area however alkaline ph 8 0 11 0 often facilitates the biomass and phycobilin pb production 58 which is per our findings though the phenomenon is species specific it also indicated that pb production was enhanced in response to high nutrients while ph had no considerable effects on pb production 4 practical applications findings of the present study indicated that the cultivation of the p terebrans berc10 at high ph will promote growth without hampering the biosynthesis of valuable metabolites and will help to outcompete the contaminating microbes the filamentous nature of strain exhibited its additional potential for cost effective harvesting moreover the residual biomass after extraction of pigments did not show any significant difference when compared to the quality and quantity of the lipids present in total biomass this means that the pigment extracted biomass can be used to extract lipids for biodiesel and remaining biomass which is rich in carbohydrates can be subjected to either pyrolysis or biological fermentation that would lead to establishing a multiproduct biorefinery with almost zero waste with better economic profitability 5 future research prospects the substantially higher contents of the high value phycocyanin production of the best quality biodiesel and carbohydrate rich biomass demonstrated the potential of p terebrans berc10 to be used in a multiproduct biorefinery with almost no waste at the end of the processing pipeline however it would need further detailed studies in larger photobioreactors mass scale biomass production and process optimization for the biorefinery 6 conclusions a newly isolated cyanobacterial strain plectonema terebrans berc10 was characterized for its biomass production potential along with the use of its biomass for bioproducts in a biorefinery it showed the potential to be cultured in wastewater municipal and synthetic in an environment having a temperature ranging from 20 to 32 c ph ranging from 9 0 to 11 0 alkaline ph 10 0 favored the biomass and metabolite production especially of lipids carbohydrates and phycobilins pigment extracted biomass did not show any negative impact on lipid profile and biodiesel composition moreover substantial amounts of valuable metabolites in the biomass showed the potential of berc10 to become a candidate strain in a multiproduct biorefinery improved co2 fixation rate and filamentous nature of strain rendered reduced buoyancy resulted in the floatation of the biomass which offered an additional benefit of cost effective harvesting and mitigation of the environmental carbon credit authorship contribution statement ayesha shahid investigation writing original draft methodology funding acquisition sana malik
