reusable rapidly deployable and most reliable kind of wave absorber or breakwater in order to protect the marine structures from damage by severe sea conditions the applications of floating breakwaters in addition to the main task of coastal shoreline protection bento et al 2014 rusu and guedes soares 2013 can also protect aquaculture installations silva et al 2018 as shown in the studies that used renewable energy devices as a sort of floating breakwater during the past two decades there has been significant interest in flexible porous structures for application to breakwaters as this kind of structures are effective in dissipating wave energy and creating a tranquillity zone recently much attention has been paid to porous membranes and nets as a good choice because they have great advantages compared to rigid and nonporous kind of structures as the structure porosity helps in dissipating a large amount of wave energy for applications to coastal protection the net type structures are also used for fish farming and it is known that the water inside the fish cages is much calmer than the waters outside fishnets which demonstrates that porous membranes can provide tranquillity zone for fish farming therefore many studies about the ability of wave energy dissipation the incident wave reflection the trapping of incident waves and the dynamic response of flexible porous structures have been done and are reviewed here in the last two decades efforts have been made to study the various aspects of wave interaction with porous structures and porous media based on numerical and experimental analysis losada et al 1995 studied experimentally the kinematics and the dynamics of oscillatory flow in porous media by measuring the velocity the pressure field and the wave height inside the porous structure they found that dissipation is the most important factor in the transmission region and the porous structure works as a filter filtering out the higher frequencies as the oscillation propagates towards the lee side of the structure further losada et al 1996 studied the wave reflection by modelling the transformation and the interaction of regular wave trains with submerged permeable structures based on two different models an eigenfunction expansion 3 d model and a 2 d model using the mild slope equation for porous media losada et al 1997 conducted an experiment in a wave flume to study the harmonic evolution of monochromatic waves propagating over submerged porous step under non breaking conditions hur and mizutani 2003 developed two numerical models associated with two and three dimensional porous bodies on submerged breakwater by combining the vof method and porous body model to compare their estimated and measured wave forces mendez and losada 2004 presented a simple and innovative method to solve explicitly the dispersion relation for water waves over dissipative media using a perturbation numerical scheme lara et al 2006 demonstrated the capability of the cobras model to reproduce irregular wave interaction with a submerged permeable breakwaters by comparing numerical results with experimental data of a laboratory test loukogeorgaki et al 2017 conducted 3d experiments to investigate the hydroelastic and the structural flexible connectors response of a pontoon type modular floating breakwater under the action of oblique regular waves and observed that the floating breakwaters hydroelastic and structural response depend strongly upon the wave period the wave height and the oblique wave angle in the low frequency range christensen et al 2018 analysed three basic cross sections of floating breakwaters in two dimensions a regular pontoon a regular pontoon with wing plates attached and a regular pontoon with wing plates and porous media attached to the sides they observed that the cross sections with wing plates and porous media attached to the sides reduced the reflection and the transmission most effectively on the other hand liu and li 2013 provided a new analytical solution for wave reflection and transmission by a surface piercing porous structure without using complex wave number in the porous dispersion relation and they compared the results with traditional solutions by solving the complex dispersion relation and boundary element solutions recently another interesting aspect of submerged horizontal porous structures is the study of the effect of perforated or porous plates on the hydroelastic response of floating elastic plates which has been analysed by many investigators using darcy s law and complex dispersion relations cho et al 2013 investigated the oblique wave interaction with a submerged horizontal porous plate using matched eigenfunction expansion method mefem and numerical boundary element method by comparing the result of reflection and transmission coefficients liu et al 2012 provided a new analytical solution for wave scattering by a submerged horizontal porous plate with finite thickness using mefem based on linearized potential theory in the presence of a not complex dispersion relation over porous media mohapatra et al 2018a b studied the combined effect of the porous parameter and the mooring stiffness on the submerged porous elastic plate by analysing the reflection the transmission and the dissipation coefficients based on a theoretical approach cheng et al 2016a investigated the hydroelastic response of a mat like rectangular very large floating structure edged with dual horizontal and inclined perforated plates using an analytical approach mefem a numerical method hybrid fem bem and experimental tests cheng et al 2016a b studied the effect of porosity water depth inclined angle and the gap distance between dual perforated anti motion plates on the hydroelastic behaviour of a very large floating structure using the boundary element method based on the time domain modal expansion theory cheng et al 2014 investigated the response reduction efficiency of a very large floating structure by adopting submerged horizontal non perforated perforated or their combination plates in the context of numerical theory and experimental tests on the surface of porous membranes and nets there are many pores whose diameters are very small compared to the dimension of the structure see fig 1 thus porous membranes and the net can be considered as a sheet of porous media which has been investigated by many researchers darcy 1856 conducted an experiment to study the movement of water through sand and proposed a semi empirical law which is known as darcy s law philip 1970 generalized the darcy s law into a more compact expression which shows a linear relationship between the flow velocity vector and the pressure gradient sollitt and cross 1973 proposed that the forces exerted by the porous medium on the flow include two components the resistance force and the inertial force chwang and chan 1998 reviewed the applications and the limitations of darcy s law for analysing waves moving past a porous structure darcy s law has been used by many researchers to investigate the interaction between waves and porous structures cho and kim 2000 liu et al 2008 park et al 2010 karmakar et al 2012 mandal et al 2013 karmakar and guedes soares 2014 su et al 2015 mandal and sahoo 2016 koley and sahoo 2017b meylan et al 2017 mohapatra et al 2018a b according to darcy s law it is assumed that the normal velocity of the fluid passing through the porous structure is linearly proportional to the pressure difference between the two sides of the structures the proportional constant is a complex number its imaginary part is related to the inertia effect and thus has nothing to do with energy dissipation and can be neglected when the porous structure is thin and the size of holes is not large the real part is called the porous effect parameter it represents viscous effects and it can directly be obtained from experiments cho and kim 2013 generally the darcy s law applied to flexible porous membranes or net type structures can be expressed as yu 1995 1 v k 0 ρ ω g p ς t where v is the flow velocity vector g is the porous effect parameter defined as g g r i g i γ k 0 b f i s f 2 s 2 s 1 c m 1 γ γ γ is the porosity constant which is defined as the ratio of the porous area to the whole area of the membrane f is the resistance force coefficient s is the inertial force coefficient c m is the added mass coefficient ρ is the density of fluid ω is the angular frequency of the wave motion k 0 is the incident wave number b is the thickness of the porous media p is the pressure of the fluid ϛ is the deflection of the flexible porous structures t is time and is the gradient operator the parameters f and s may be evaluated empirically following madsen 1974 darcy s law requires the porous medium to be fixed and if porous mediums move the inertial effect should be considered chwang 1983 although darcy s law has been widely used by many researchers it is only applicable to laminar flow mickeley et al 1965 kirkhara 1967 macdonald et al 1979 and dybbs and edwards 1984 confirmed the existence of turbulence within a saturated porous medium then patursson et al 2006 2010 zhao et al 2013a 2013b bi et al 2014a 2014b 2017 and chen and christensen 2016 2017 studied the porous media model and used it to simulate the flow through and around net structures by taking turbulence model into consideration it is worth mentioning that up to now there exists well documented review papers in the literature in the broad area of wave structure interaction problems for instance chen et al 2006 reviewed four different types of existing hydroelastic theories and their applications to the analysis of very large floating structures wang et al 2010 reviewed the design and performance of anti motion devices such as breakwaters submerged plates oscillating water column breakwaters air cushion auxiliary attachments and mechanical joints for mitigating the hydroelastic response of very large floating structures under wave action karmakar et al 2011 reviewed the existing analytical hydroelasticity theories to analyse different types of floating and submerged structures applications for very large floating structures and large ice sheets klebert et al 2013 reviewed the present status of the flow hydrodynamics within and around sea cages by presenting the contemporary experiments on drag forces on the net panels model scale cages biological effects of fish fish movements and fouling dai et al 2018 presented a literature review on research and developments of floating breakwaters associated with the performance of different types of floating breakwaters and wave attenuating devices from the above literature it is confirmed that until now there is no review reported to the public related to the recent research and developments on models for the dynamics of porous membranes and net type structures therefore the objective of this paper is to present a literature review on research and developments of different types of models of porous membrane and net type structures for floating breakwaters in the field of coastal engineering and fish cages often associated with marine technology this review is arranged as follows section 2 describes the modelling approaches of the dynamic analysis of flexible porous membranes and net type structures based on the frequency domain and time domain analysis under the assumption of linearized water wave theory and structural response section 3 presents the review on the dynamic behaviour of the porous membranes associated with the models for i horizontal flexible porous membrane ii vertical flexible porous membrane and iii combined models of floating structure and vertical flexible porous membrane section 4 is devoted to the description on the models of the dynamics of net type structures associated with analytical numerical and experimental approaches in this section initially analytical models associated with cylindrical cages of flexible porous membrane along with their governing equations and boundary conditions are discussed then different numerical models such as the truss model the mass spring model and the panel net element model are described and some other models are discussed to study the different environmental effects on the dynamics of the net type structures finally the experimental models on net type structures for sea cage and floating breakwaters are reviewed section 5 summarizes the conclusion and future scope of the present review using flexible porous membranes 2 modelling approaches of the dynamic analysis of the flexible porous membrane and net type structures in the mathematical modelling of wave interaction with flexible porous membranes as well as with the net type structures for the dynamics analysis the following models are used in general the flexible porous membrane is modelled as a thin and inextensible sheet under tension the structural porosity is modelled using the darcy s law for wave past porous membrane to incorporate both frictional force and inertia force the theoretical and numerical analysis may be carried out in the frequency domain or in the time domain it may be mentioned that most of the dynamic analyses for flexible porous membranes and net type structures are carried out in the frequency domain as this kind of analysis is simpler in comparison to the rather complex time domain analysis however for transient responses and for nonlinear equations of motion due to nonlinear waves as in severe wave conditions it is necessary to perform the analysis in the time domain the dynamic analysis of flexible porous membranes and net type structures is based on the following assumptions the flexible porous membrane is modelled as strings of uniform mass density acting under uniform tension the fluid is incompressible inviscid and its motion is irrotational so that velocity potential exists and linear wave theory is used the amplitude of the incident wave and the motions of the structure are both assumed to be small 2 1 frequency domain analysis the commonly used approaches for the analysis of flexible porous membranes and net type structures in the frequency domain are the matched eigenfunction expansion method the boundary elements method and green s function technique under the assumption of linearized water waves based on potential flow theory matched eigenfunction expansion method is usually used as the analytical method for the problem of wave interaction with floating submerged flexible membrane or porous structures as in mohapatra and sahoo 2014a 2014b mohapatra and guedes soares 2016 mohapatra et al 2018a b in two or three dimensional problems the main idea of this method is to expand the velocity potentials with appropriate eigenfunctions and unknown coefficients firstly the complex wave numbers are obtained by solving the corresponding dispersion relation then the unknown coefficients are determined by using various boundary conditions with appropriate orthogonal property or the least square approximation method to obtain a matrix system chan and lee 2001 studied the scattering of a surface wave by a vertical flexible fishnet in finite water depth the boundary value problem bvp was solved by using the eigenfunction expansion method and the least squares approximation method kumar et al 2007 investigated analytically the wave scattering by a flexible porous vertical membrane barrier in a two layer fluid a new orthogonality relation along with the least square approximation method has been utilized to reduce the mixed bvp into a linear equation system based on the eigenfunction expansion method bhattacharjee and guedes soares 2011 investigated the performance of a vertical porous membrane barrier as a breakwater to reduce the wave load on a floating structure near a wall as shown in fig 9 the method of eigenfunction expansion and the corresponding orthogonal mode coupling relations were used to obtain an analytic solution to the bvp karmakar et al 2012 studied the scattering of gravity waves by single multiple vertically moored surface piercing floating porous membrane based on the matched eigenfunction expansion method as for the case of multiple surface piercing membranes the method of wide spacing approximation was adopted mandal et al 2013 conducted a hydroelastic analysis for surface wave interaction with concentric porous and flexible cylinder systems in which the inner cylinder is rigid and the outer cylinder is porous and flexible the scattering potentials are evaluated using fourier bessel series expansion method and the least square approximation method mandal and sahoo 2016 and su et al 2015 studied the interaction of waves with a flexible cage system in finite water depths under the assumption of small wave amplitude wave and structural response by using the matching eigenfunction expansion method and the least squares approximation method koley and sahoo 2017b studied the oblique wave scattering by permeable vertical flexible membrane wave barriers and the performance of bottom standing surface piercing and fully extended membrane wave barriers were analysed the analytic solution of the physical problem was obtained using the eigenfunction expansion method and a coupled boundary element finite difference method had been used to get the numerical solution where the membrane response and velocity potentials were solved simultaneously on the other hand cho and kim 2000 developed a multidomain boundary element method to study the interaction of monochromatic incident waves with a horizontal porous flexible membrane kee et al 2003 numerically evaluated the performance of floating pontoon breakwater with triple vertical porous membranes in the oblique seas by using a boundary integral method this numerical method was validated by checking the accuracy and convergence based on the energy conservation formula and it was further verified through comparison with experiments kee 2005 investigated wave interactions with fully submerged dual buoy vertical porous membrane floating breakwaters the boundary element method was used to obtain numerical solutions based on a discrete porous membrane dynamic model and simple source distribution over the entire fluid boundaries green s function technique has been used to study the dynamics of flexible porous membrane based on frequency domain analysis for instance recently green s function technique and green s identity were used to obtain numerical solutions koley and sahoo 2017a deal with the oblique wave scattering by a horizontal floating porous membrane with the green s function technique the associated bvp is converted into pairs of fredholm integral equations which can be reduced to a system of linear algebraic equations by using simpson s quadrature formula 2 2 time domain analysis on the other hand analysis for flexible porous membranes and net type structures has also been conducted in the time domain bessonneau and marichal 1998 and le bris and marichal 1998 proposed a constant time step method to solve the equations system obtained from each knot of the truss system for a supple net another method by using the fourth fifth sixth order runge kutta method to solve the system of motion equations in the time domain has been adopted by huang et al 2006 li et al 2006 zhao et al 2007a 2007b 2007c and lee et al 2008 to investigate the interaction between fluids and net type structures dong et al 2010 investigated the dynamic response of a gravity cage in current and waves and in irregular waves respectively the statistical approach and fourier transform are applied to analyse the cage motion response and the mooring line tension response in both time and frequency domain kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 used an improved screen type force model and the truss model to calculate viscous current and wave loads on aquaculture nets the net shape is solved based on a time stepping procedure that involves solving a linear system of equations for the unknown tensions at each time step chen and christensen 2016 proposed a new approach to calculate the porous resistance coefficients of a porous media based on the transformation of the morison type load model the transformation follows the principle that the total forces acting on a net panel from the morison type load model should be equal to the forces obtained from the porous media model analyses were performed to examine the convergence property in the time domain for net cages in both steady and unsteady flows cifuentes and kim 2017 carried out a complete time domain analysis of the hydrodynamic response of a single cage under current regular waves regular waves current and irregular waves current loading condition under the consideration of the shielding and blockage effect bi et al 2017 studied numerically the wave propagation through a square array of 16 net cages with different levels of biofouling based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd model and experimental validation is conducted to compare against numerical results tang et al 2017 analysed the impact of the cultured fish on the flow field through a net cage and the deformation of the net cage in the time domain they observed that the drag force on the net cage decreased significantly with the increasing fish stocking density but the most severe deformation of net cage occurred in the case of medium fish stocking density ji et al 2017 simulated the interaction of regular waves with a cylindrical dual pontoon net floating breakwater in the time domain by establishing a fully nonlinear numerical wave tank using a time higher order boundary element method 3 models for the dynamics of the flexible porous membrane in order to investigate the dynamic behaviour of flexible porous membranes many researchers adopted a continuous tensioned string dynamic model to model their motions cho and kim 2000 kee et al 2003 kee 2005 kumar et al 2007 bhattacharjee and guedes soares 2011 karmakar et al 2012 koley and sahoo 2017a 2017b mandal and sahoo 2016 on top of the string model one dimensional beam model was used by williams and wang 2003 and the cylindrical shell theory was adopted by phadke and cheung 1999 to model a flexible membrane the porous membrane is a flexible structure and therefore it generates deformations under the action of incident waves the mathematical complexity of this class of problem is the existence of higher order boundary conditions on the structural boundary associated with two dimensional three dimensional governing equation which lead to a non sturm liouville in nature the study of flexible porous membranes can be date back to the last two decades and mainly focus on two kinds of layout horizontal porous membranes and vertical porous membranes 3 1 model for horizontal flexible porous membrane researchers have been concerned with the dynamics of a horizontal porous flexible membrane which can be either submerged or floating on the water cho and kim 2000 investigated the interaction of monochromatic incident waves with a horizontal submerged flexible porous membrane in finite water depths as shown in fig 2 according to darcy s law the boundary condition on the porous flexible membrane is given by 2 ϕ y y d 0 i ω ξ i k 0 g ϕ y d 0 ϕ y d 0 x a y d where i 1 ω is the incident wave frequency k 0 is the incident wave number g is the porous effect parameter ξ is the deflection of the porous membrane in space ϕ is the velocity potential the motion of the submerged porous membrane is expanded in terms of a set of natural modes of the membrane which satisfy the membrane equation 1d wave equation and the end edge condition by using the matched eigenfunction expansion method motion amplitudes of impermeable membranes are compared with results for porous membranes and it is found that the general trend is similar however the maximum response amplitude is significantly reduced when a porous membrane is used later koley and sahoo 2017a studied the oblique wave scattering by a floating flexible porous membrane in finite and infinite water depths as shown in fig 3 the boundary condition and equation of motion of the floating porous membrane can be expressed in the following forms 3 ϕ y i ω ξ i k 0 g ϕ on y 0 x m 4 t d 2 d x 2 k z 2 ξ ρ g m m ω 2 ξ i ρ ω ϕ j y 0 x m where t is the tension of the membrane m m ρ m d m is the uniform mass per unit length of the membrane with d m ρ m the thickness and the density of the membrane respectively g is the gravity acceleration and k z is the z component of the wave number k associated with the incident waves further the edge conditions depend on the specific bvp arising in the wave structure interaction problems this study demonstrates that membrane deflection can be reduced significantly with the inclusion of structural porosity moreover the number of optima in the membrane deflection increases with a decrease in membrane tension recently guo et al 2020 investigated the oblique wave energy dissipation by a finite moored submerged horizontal flexible porous membrane and the results are compared with numerical results and experimental data available in the literature see fig 4 the boundary condition on the porous membrane is same as eq 2 and the equation of motion is given by 5 t d 2 d x 2 k z 2 ξ m m ω 2 ξ i ρ ω ϕ 2 ϕ 3 for a x a y h the edge condition of the horizontal moored submerged porous membrane is given by 6 t d ξ d x k s ξ x a y h where k s is the spring constant the analytical results of reflection and transmission coefficients presented are compared against the published experimental results with submerged porous plate of cho and kim 2013 as shown in fig 5 however there is a little difference in their data points in fig 5 this attributed may be due to the uncertainties in the amount of viscous or material damping nonlinear effects gap or end effects in the experiment further also the results are compared with bem numerical results of cho and kim 1998 are presented in fig 6 it is observed that the present analytical results agree well with the bem numerical results 3 2 model for vertical flexible porous membrane attention was paid to the dynamics and the efficiency of breakwater of single or multiple vertical flexible porous based on the analytical models however there are not many studies done on that topic in the literature kumar et al 2007 investigated analytically the wave scattering by a flexible porous vertical membrane barrier with its two ends fixed at the free surface and the seabed in a two layer fluid as shown in fig 7 the boundary condition and equation of motion of the vertical porous membrane can be expressed in the following forms 7 ϕ 1 x ϕ 2 x i ω ξ i k 0 g ϕ 2 ϕ 1 on x 0 0 y h 8 d 2 ξ d y 2 m m ω 2 t ξ i ω ρ 1 t ϕ 2 ϕ 1 for x 0 0 y h i ω ρ 2 t ϕ 2 ϕ 1 for x 0 h y h where ρ 1 and ρ 2 are the densities of the upper and the lower layer fluids ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are the velocity potentials of the upper and the lower layer fluids respectively it is observed that the porous membrane has larger deflection amplitude at a location nearer to the interface and the deflection is found to be larger when the interface is closer to the free surface besides the membrane deflection is found to increase with the increase in fluid density ratio and membrane tension in addition a large membrane deflection is observed for higher values of the imaginary part of the porous effect parameter g the inertia effect of the fluid inside the porous barrier karmakar et al 2012 studied the scattering of gravity waves by single and multiple vertically moored surface piercing floating porous membrane as shown in fig 8 based on the matched eigenfunction expansion method by considering three different types of edge conditions fixed moored moored fixed moored moored for the surface piercing membranes the boundary condition and equation of motion for each vertical porous membrane are same as eqs 7 and 8 in the region of y 0 d the fixed and moored edge conditions are defined as 9 fixed edge condition ξ y 0 10 moored edge condition ξ y k d ξ where k d is the spring constant as for a single surface piercing vertical porous membrane with the increase in the tension of the membrane the reflection coefficient increases whilst the transmission coefficient and deflection of the membrane decrease however increased porosity constant for the porous membrane leads to decreased reflection coefficient and deflection of the porous membrane in addition fixed upper edge and moored lower edge makes higher wave reflection compared with other two types of edge conditions as the mooring stiffness increases the displacement of the membrane edge decreases for multiple surface piercing vertical porous membranes bragg s resonance appears for the reflection coefficient and the resonance frequency is observed to be higher for a larger distance between two membranes and higher value of the tension of membranes bhattacharjee and guedes soares 2011 investigated the performance of a vertical porous membrane barrier as a breakwater to reduce the wave load on a floating structure near a wall as shown in fig 9 the boundary condition and the equation of motion for the submerged vertical porous membrane are also same as eq 7 and eq 8 in the region of x r y h 1 h fig 10 shows that the free surface elevation in region 4 is almost identical for different membrane tension however the wave amplitude is reduced significantly in comparison to the incident wave region hence the wave load on the wall will be less than what it will experience if it is subject to direct incident wave attack 3 3 combined model of a floating structure and vertical flexible porous membrane dynamics and efficiency of single or multiple vertical membranes attached to floating structures as a floating breakwater also attracted much attention kee et al 2003 evaluated numerically the performance of floating pontoon breakwater with triple vertical porous membranes fig 11 in oblique seas by using a boundary integral method in finite water depths the boundary condition and equation of motion for the submerged vertical porous membrane are also same as eq 7 and eq 8 the boundary condition on the floating buoy is 11 ϕ l n i ω η 1 n x η 3 n θ ϕ 0 n 0 l 1 2 3 4 where l 1 2 3 4 represents four fluid domains n θ x n y y n x η 1 and η 3 represent complex sway and roll responses ϕ 0 is the velocity potential of an incident wave the heave response of the floating pontoon is negligible therefore the coupled equations of motion for sway and roll are given by 12 m ω 2 x f p k hs k m x l 1 3 f t i f d where x is displacement of sway and roll m is a mass matrix of pontoon f p is hydrodynamic forces and moments on pontoon k hs is the restoring forces and moments due to the hydrostatic pressure k m is sway and roll mooring stiffness matrix including the effects of pretension f d is the nonlinear viscous drag force f t i i 1 2 3 is forces and moments on the pontoon caused by the initial tension of membranes at the connection points between membranes and pontoon it is found from the calculated results that the multi layer porous membrane system can significantly increase the overall wave blocking efficiency in normal and oblique incident waves including relatively long wave regions in addition applying proper permeability on the membranes eliminates the inevitable resonance of the system and reduces wave transmission kee 2005 investigated wave interactions with fully submerged dual buoy vertical porous membrane floating breakwaters fig 12 this problem was solved by using the same method as kee et al 2003 to formulate the boundary condition and equation of motion for the two submerged porous membranes and dual buoys it is found that the permeability imposed on the membrane further enhances its performance suppressing the reflected and transmitted waves simultaneously and even eliminating the possible resonances of the system 4 models for the dynamics of the flexible net type structure the flexible net type structure is supple discontinuous anisotropic and has no definite shape unless external forces are acting on it therefore when the water flows on or through a net the latter deforms and disturbs the motion of the water particles which leads to a very complex hydrodynamic problem associated with wave interaction with floating flexible net type structures in order to handle these complex problems both analytical and numerical methods have been adopted based on the net panel and 3d net cage these nets are modelled as a porous membrane to obtain analytical solutions under potential flow theory on the other hand many efforts have been also devoted to numerical calculations of panel nets and net cages by using finite element analysis in order to validate the analytical and numerical results model tests have been also carried out the details of the analytical and the numerical models are discussed in the following subsections 4 1 analytical models flexible net type structures such as cylindrical cages as shown in fig 13 consisting of a vertical cylindrical cage surface and a porous bottom are usually applied for sea fish farming similar to the flexible porous membrane the vertical cylindrical cage surface of a net cage can be modelled as an one dimensional string mandal and sahoo 2016 or as a beam mandal et al 2013 su et al 2015 mohapatra et al 2018a b the boundary condition and equation of motion of the vertical cylindrical net cage surface which is modelled as string are given as 13 ϕ 1 r ϕ 2 r i k 0 g ϕ 2 ϕ 1 i ω η cos θ on r a h z d 14 d 2 η d z 2 m m ω 2 t η 2 a i ω ρ t 0 π ϕ 1 ϕ 2 cos π θ d θ on r a h z d where η is the transverse deflection of the porous flexible cylinder with r is the radial distance from the z axis θ is the angle about the x axis and z is the axe of the three dimensional polar coordinate system r θ z the horizontal porous bottom is often considered as a two dimensional membrane as in mandal and sahoo 2016 or as a rigid porous plate see su et al 2015 the boundary condition and equation of motion of the horizontal submerged porous net which is modelled as a two dimensional membrane are given as 15 ϕ 2 z z d 0 i k 0 g ϕ 2 z d 0 ϕ 2 z d 0 i ω ξ on r a z d 16 r θ 2 m m ω 2 t ξ i ρ ω t ϕ 2 z d 0 ϕ 2 z d 0 on r a z d where ξ is the vertical deflection of the submerged porous net in space 2 is the laplacian or laplace operator by using appropriate boundary conditions on the fluid domain and the surface of the net type structure as well as the equation of motion of the structure the incident wave interaction with net type structure can be solved based on the potential flow theory chan and lee 2001 studied the scattering of a surface wave by a vertical flexible fishnet in finite water depths by modelling it as a catenary in this model the bvp was solved by using the eigenfunction expansion method and the least squares approximation method the results see figs 14 and 15 show that as the stiffness of the fishnet increases the deformation of the net decreases which results to an increase of the reflection coefficient mandal et al 2013 implemented a hydroelastic analysis for investigating the interaction with concentric porous and flexible cylinder systems in these systems the inner cylinder was rigid and the outer cylinder was porous and flexible it was found that the outer cylinder cannot only be used for protection of the inner impermeable rigid wall it but can also be used for developing an effective wave trapping system further mandal and sahoo 2016 and su et al 2015 studied the wave interaction with a flexible cage system in finite water depths see fig 13 under the assumption of small amplitude wave and assessed its structural response by using the matching eigenfunction expansion method and the least squares approximation method they observed that the porous effect parameter reduces the wave forces on the cage system due to the maximum wave energy dissipation and moderate membrane tension along with a judicious choice of the cage radius which suggests an effective cage system 4 2 numerical models it is difficult to gain knowledge only from theoretical methods to investigate the hydrodynamic behaviour of fishing nets numerous studies have been conducted by physical model tests numerical simulation and field measurements it is seen that the numerical simulation method is simpler inexpensive and time saver than those of model tests and field measurements therefore in recent decades some researchers have attempted to simulate the dynamic behaviour of fishing nets with finite element analysis and have also used many advanced useful methods one of the most important aspect for the finite element analysis of net type structures is to divide the supple net into discrete elements different numerical approaches to study the dynamics of net type structures are discussed in the following subsections 4 2 1 the truss model theret 1993 and bessonneau 1997 firstly put forward the truss model in order to describe a supple net the truss model uses a set of rigid cylindrical bars to model the mesh as shown in fig 16 to consider twine looseness each mesh side is broken down into two rigid bars articulated around an intermediary rotoidal link located in the middle of the twine thus it is assumed that the internal linking forces are reduced to a single traction component t which is assumed to be constant along the rigid element with the intention of getting a better approach to the behaviour of each mesh side it is possible to increase the number of intermediary knots all actual knots links between mesh sides and intermediary junction points are supposed to be rotoidal links and cannot transmit any momentum to rigid bars bessonneau and marichal 1998 the hydrodynamic force acting on rigid cylindrical bars can be calculated according to the morison equation or the net screen force model forces applied to each rigid bar are equally distributed between the two ends of the cylindrical element each knot mass is equal to half the mass of all rigid elements around it applying newton s second law to each knot n mechanical equations where n is the number of knots can be given by 17 j n 1 i n k i t j i 1 2 t p j i f j i a p j i p j i j n 1 i n k i 1 2 m j i γ i where k number of the first adjacent knots of knot i n 1 i n k i first adjacent knot numbers of i t j i tension of bar ji where i is one end of the bar and j the

gravitational forces of bar ji j n 1 i n k i 1 2 m j i is the total mass of knot i γ i is the acceleration of knot i moreover the length of rigid bars is considered as fixed therefore m additional equations where m is the number of rigid bars can be obtained as 18 x j x i 2 y j y i 2 z j z i 2 l j i 2 for i 1 n and j n 1 i n k i where x i y i z i and x j y j z j are coordinates of knot i and j l ji is the length of bar ji bessonneau and marichal 1998 le bris and marichal 1998 fredheim and faltinsen 2001 and moe et al 2010 modelled the trawls and aquaculture net cages with the truss model marichal 2003 generalized this truss model to incorporate elasticity by considering the constraint that the length of each truss remains constant this improved truss model has been applied by kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 2015 he et al 2018 and shen et al 2018 to aquaculture net cages 4 2 2 the mass spring model in the mass spring model the net is modelled as a series of lumped mass points that are interconnected with springs without mass as shown in fig 17 lumped mass points are set at each knot and at the centre of the mesh bar all the external forces such as the drag the buoyancy which work on the element are applied only on the mass points the springs are not considered as external forces but as internal forces derived from the elasticity of the line between the points the mass point at a mesh knot is assumed to be a spherical point where the fluid force coefficient is constant in motion direction so the motion equation of the mass point in a mesh knot is easy to be set up according to eq 19 19 m i δ m i a j 1 n t i j f d w b where m i and δm i are the mass and the added mass of point i a is the acceleration of the mass point t i j is the vector of the tension in bar ij n is the numbers of adjacent knots of point i f d w and b are the drag force the gravity force and the buoyancy force respectively however since mesh bars are assumed to be cylindrical elements the direction of the fluid forces acting on the point masses at each mesh bar should be considered therefore the motion equation of the point mass i at the centre of a mesh bar within the local coordinates τ η ξ which passes point i can be expressed by 20a m i δ m τ τ i t τ f d τ w τ b τ 20b m i δ m η η i t η f d η w η b η 20c m i δ m ξ ξ i t ξ f d ξ w ξ b ξ where δ m τ δ m η δ m ξ are the added masses of the τ η ξ components this method makes it possible to model the flexible structure in a variety of forms in other words bars or ropes could be divided into several points and then assigned in order to model large meshes or ropes for simulating them in detail lee et al 2005 using a mass spring model takagi et al 2002a 2002b suzuki et al 2003 and li et al 2006 investigated the dynamic behaviour of a submerged plane net in a current cha and lee 2002 and lee et al 2005 conducted a dynamic simulation of a midwater trawl system and an underwater flexible structure respectively zhao et al 2007a 2007b 2007c 2007d lee et al 2008 zhao et al 2009 dong et al 2010 and bi et al 2014a 2014b investigated the hydrodynamic behaviour of the 3d gravity cage system in current waves combined wave current flow and irregular waves respectively further chen et al 2012 analysed the hydrodynamic behaviours of two net cages due to wave action and xu et al 2012 studied the hydrodynamic response of four net cages in waves cha and lee 2018 utilized the mass spring model to represent of the copper alloy net cage in which the cage and the buoy with the mooring ropes were modelled as mass points and springs 4 2 3 the panel net element model another interesting model for a net type structure is dividing it into panel elements as shown in fig 18 each panel is assumed to be plane but it is otherwise allowed full flexibility movement of the node points is not restricted and the node points are allowed full 3d movement the orientation vector of all panel elements must be constant in time and equal for all elements the panel element is assumed to have structural characteristics similar to that of a nonlinear spring forces acting on each element are equally distributed to its two node points and the mass is also distributed to the node points the equation of motion of each node is given by 21 f s n 1 n e n 1 f s n n e n 1 2 f d n 1 f l n 1 f d n f l n 1 2 w n 1 w n g n g 1 2 m n 1 m n a n where n e n 1 n e n are the unit vector of panel element n 1 and panel element n f s n 1 f s n are structural forces of panel element n 1 and n f d n 1 f d n are the drag force vectors of panel element n 1 and n f l n 1 f l n are the lift force vectors of panel element n 1 and n w n 1 w n are the weights of panel element n 1 and n g is the gravity acceleration n g is the gravity unit vector m n 1 m n are the mass of panel element n 1 and n a n is the acceleration vector of node n using the panel flexible net element lader et al 2001 developed a dynamic model of a simple plane net exposed to waves and current in order to study its dynamic behaviour lader and fredheim 2001 2006 studied the influence of different parameters on the behaviour of the net exposed to waves and current based on the panel net element lader et al 2003 developed a super element to model the 3d net structures exposed to waves and current the elements are four sided with a node at each corner and each node is connected with the other nodes through a non linear spring movement of the free nodes is not restricted and the node points are allowed full 3d movement huang et al 2006 2007 2008 conducted a dynamic analysis of net cages using a lumped mass method and net plane element based model 4 2 4 other models many other kinds of models are available in the literature other than the ones discussed in section 4 2 1 4 2 3 which are associated with porous net type structures for example wan et al 2002 modelled each mesh bar in the net as an infinitely flexible rope element connected at each end to other elements by a frictionless hinge tsukrov et al 2003 developed a consistent finite element to assess the hydrodynamic response of net panels martin et al 2018 discretized the net based on the tension element method given by leitzke 1983 however it is obvious that direct finite element modelling of all the meshes of the net is impractical because it requires the enormously large number of finite elements therefore a mesh grouping method or equivalent truss method for the net developed by theret 1993 should be used to reduce the number of unknowns in the problem and the computational effort this method models a given number of actual meshes by a fictitious equivalent mesh the equivalent mesh has the same physical qualities as the actual meshes including the projected area of the netting the specific mass the weight and so on xu et al 2012 bardestani and faltinsen 2013 used the equivalent trusses to model the net of a floating fish farm and calculated the hydrodynamic forces on the netting structure in waves and current with the effect of snap loads 4 2 5 effects of waves and currents on the dynamics of net type structures studies of the dynamics of nets have been carried out mainly focused on ocean aquaculture and floating breakwaters many researchers have proved that waves have a great effect on the efficiency of floating breakwaters whilst the current load may be more significant than the wave load for the gravity cages in ocean aquaculture therefore it is important to study the dynamics of nets subjected to waves currents and combined waves and currents 4 2 5 1 action of waves lee and pei wen 2001 studied the dynamic motion of a large scale tension leg platform with net cage system subjected to waves they found that besides the wave properties the cage motion was related to the solidity ratio of the net cage the material properties of the tether the draft of the platform and the dimension of the cage fredriksson et al 2003 studied the optimum design of fish cage and mooring performance by utilizing the physical and numerical modelling techniques in the energetic open ocean a stochastic approach was used to analyse the motion response heave surge and pitch characteristics of the fish cage and the load tension response in an anchor line to wave forcing further in order to validate these approaches the dynamics of a fish cage and mooring system deployed in the gulf of maine were simulated with physical and numerical models and compared with field observations zhao et al 2007a simulated the behaviour of the float collar and fishing net of gravity cage under the linear wave theory and stokes fifth order theory in this study a series of physical model tests have also been carried out to validate the numerical results dong et al 2010 studied the hydrodynamic behaviour of a gravity cage in irregular waves and the results show that the system s responses decrease with the increase in wave frequencies tang et al 2011 investigated the dynamic properties of a dual pontoon floating structure with an attached fish net by using physical and numerical models based on the boundary element method the results of dynamic behaviour of a dual pontoon floating structure showed that a fishnet system causes the resonant response of body motions and mooring forces to be slightly lower due to the net s damping effect xu et al 2012 investigated the hydrodynamic behaviour of multiple net cages with two kinds of arrangement in waves based on the lumped mass method they found that there is not a significant difference between the effective fish cage volumes of the two cage arrangements chen et al 2012 analysed the hydrodynamic behaviour of the two net cages with grid mooring system under wave action the vertical motion amplitude of the two cages was almost the same while with respect to horizontal motion amplitude one cage moved much farther than the other chen and christensen 2015 developed a moving porous media model based on a coupled cfd fem model in the open source library openfoam to simulate wave interaction with moving net structures the net structure was described as a sheet of porous media with prescribed rigid body motion and mesh motion was incorporated to confirm the motion of the net zhao et al 2014 2015 established a two dimensional numerical wave flume based on the finite volume method to study the impact of wave heights and wavelength on the wave propagation through net panels and the accuracy of the numerical results was verified with the theoretical results in their numerical simulation the net panel was simplified as porous media entirely and the coefficients of the porous media are determined by the least square method further the vof method was adopted to solve the interface between water and air in the numerical model the governing equations were discretized and solved by the finite volume method second order upwind scheme was used to discretize the convection term and second order implicit scheme is used to discretize the time term pressure velocity coupling employs the piso algorithm in addition in order to validate the numerical model the numerical results were compared with the data obtained from corresponding physical model tests and the numerical results and the corresponding experimental data showed reasonably good agreement it was found that the wave force acting on the net panel increases with increasing net solidity and with the increase of the wave height the transmission coefficient remains constant furthermore the transmission coefficient increases with increasing wavelength but the increase in wavelength does not have much effect on the force acting on the net panel further zhao et al 2016 established a three dimensional numerical model to simulate the interaction between waves and net cages where the porous media fluid model was introduced to model the net cage in waves in this numerical model the flow motion of an incompressible viscous fluid was described by navier stokes equations and the free surface is tracked by volume of fluid vof method bi et al 2017 adopted a porous media fluid model to study waves propagating through a square array of 16 net cages with different levels of biofouling of a net cage model with clean netting the numerical model was validated by comparing the numerical data with corresponding experimental measurements they found that as the number of net cages increases from 1 to 4 the wave transmission coefficient downstream from the net cage decreases gradually due to the increasing damping effect li and ong 2017 investigated a semi submergible type offshore fish farm system for open seas which consists of a semi submersible support structure with pontoons and braces a catenary mooring system and net cages see fig 19 whilst the main dimensions of the semi submergible fish farm are presented in table 1 the linear hydrodynamic properties using different composite models with panel and morison elements are computed based on the hydrodynamic analysis linearized frequency domain and coupled time domain analysis are performed to predict the extreme motions of the support structure and the extreme tensions in the mooring lines the results indicated that the frequency domain method underestimates the extreme responses and the couplings between the structure and the mooring system need to be considered in the time domain the coefficients were selected based on the two dimensional coefficients from dnv recommended practice dnv rp c205 ji et al 2017 proposed a cylindrical dual pontoon net floating breakwater model see fig 20 and simulated the interaction of regular waves with the innovative floating breakwater based on numerical a time higher order boundary element method and mixed eulerian lagrangian and experimental approach the numerical results agreed well with the experimental results fig 21 indicates that more rows of net leads to greater wave blocking effectiveness due to the viscosity effect and energy loss from the fluid net interaction fig 22 shows that the reflection coefficient decreases with increasing net porosity for all wave periods and vice versa for transmission coefficient in the short waves region on the other hand when the net height increases the variation of the reflection and transmission coefficients become insignificant however when the net height increases beyond d net h 0 3 no significant wave blocking effectiveness can be observed because the wave energy concentrates mainly on the near free surface 4 2 5 2 action of current there are various environmental effects such as wind tidal thermal and coriolis effects that generate ocean currents and hence current is a common feature in most of the marine environment therefore the effect of current forces on the net type structure is important to be studied based on analytical and numerical models different analytical formulae to the resistance or drag coefficients of nets subjected to steady currents were proposed by kawakami 1959 1964 aarsnes et al 1990 løland 1991 1993 and zhan et al 2006 in order to calculate the current forces on a net structure and its deformation based on the porous media model and the transformation of morison type load model chen and christensen 2016 proposed a new approach to calculate the porous resistance coefficients of fishing net structures in both steady and unsteady flows and the agreement between the numerical and experimental results was fair theret 1993 developed software to investigate the shape and the tension of a trawl towed at a constant speed with a large number of meshes in a net based on a mesh grouping method further by generalizing théret s numerical model bessonneau and marichal 1998 and le bris and marichal 1998 developed a numerical method to simulate the dynamic behaviour of submerged trawls in a current based on modelling the net with the truss model and solving the mechanical equations for the knots some examples of the dynamic behaviour of a particular trawl were presented and qualitatively compared with flume tank observations wan et al 2002 simulated the configuration and tension distribution of submerged plane nets in a uniform current by using a non linear finite element method cha and lee 2002 simulated the dynamics of the fishing gear having different fishing conditions takagi et al 2002a 2002b investigated the dynamic behaviour of a rectangular fishing net in uniform current and different mesh group models were studied to compare the difference in calculation time accurate comparisons between this numerical simulation and experimental results were carried out by suzuki et al 2003 lee et al 2005 simulated the behaviour of a fishing gear system with a steady towing speed and automatic modelling methods were applied using numerical integral calculus huang et al 2006 analysed the dynamic properties of a net cage system exposed to steady currents line elements and plane surface elements were used to model the mooring lines and the net cage results obtained by this numerical method were in good agreement with the experimental data though the total force on the net cage may be underestimated for small values of reynolds number li et al 2006 investigated the shape and the tension distribution of plane fishing nets in current the simultaneous motion equations were solved by the runge kutta verner fifth order and sixth order method according to the simulation results the material made with the netting has an evident effect on the deformation and the tension of plane nets zhao et al 2007b 2007d investigated the effects of the structure size ratio the mesh type and system s weight on the deformation and the hydrodynamic behaviour of a gravity cage under the action of current the numerical results indicate that the decrease in structure size ratio is practically feasible for improving the cage net deformation the bottom collar sinker system is practically feasible for improving the cage net volume deformation using the finite element method software abaqus explicit moe et al 2010 conducted a structural analysis of aquaculture net cages in a uniform current the model was validated by comparing the results to physical model tests of a cage without bottom performed in a flume tank lader and enerhaug 2005 it is observed that the drag loads and cage volume are dependent on the net cage size and system weight further the drag loads increased almost proportionally to the current velocity for velocities in the range of 0 2 0 5 m s whilst the cage volume was reduced proportionally to the current velocity the corresponding lift forces increased with an increase in velocity with varying rates of change the cage volume was reduced almost proportionally with the current velocity decew et al 2010 investigated the submergence behaviour of a small volume fish cage in a single point mooring system under currents based on numerical model and results were validated with physical model tow test bi et al 2014a studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of a net cage in a steady current based on a numerical approach the numerical results show that the deformation of the net cage increases with increasing incoming velocity and the cage deformation decreases with increasing weight mass of the net cage using the lumped mass method and the porous media fluid model together bi et al 2014b simulated the dynamics of net planes in a steady current and took the interaction between the fluid and the nets into consideration kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 investigated the mooring loads on an aquaculture net cage in current and waves based on model test and numerical simulations the model tests were performed to provide benchmark data while the numerical model was used to study the effect and sensitivity of different load models and parameters the discussed numerical simulation results were first benchmarked towards the experimental data cifuentes and kim 2015 studied the drag force on the cylindrical net under steady current by using the commercial software orcaflex which is a fully nonlinear finite element software capable to compute forces and displacements of the net when exposed to current and wave loading føre et al 2016 investigated the hydrodynamic loads acting on high solidity net cage models under high uniform flow velocities and deformation of the net cage based on model tests and standard morison type numerical analyses ma et al 2016 proposed an innovative hybrid method to determine the hydroelastic response of full scale floater and net systems more accurately as shown in fig 23 within this method the hydroelastic response of a two dimensional example of a full length net panel with steady currents and floater oscillations was studied in detail it was demonstrated that this hybrid method was able to produce correct hydroelastic response for both steady and oscillatory flows tang et al 2017 developed a net fluid interaction numerical model to analyse the impact of the cultured fish on the flow field through a net cage and the deformation of the net cage it was found that the drag force on the net cage is significantly decreased with the increase of fish stocking density and a medium fish stocking density produces the most severe net cage deformation cha and lee 2018 studied the load on a circular fish cage with a copper alloy net under the action of ocean currents and waves respectively with a series of experiments it was found that with increasing current velocity the volume of the cage hardly changed while the mooring line load increased exponentially zhao et al 2019 developed a numerical model to investigate the deformations and stress distribution of floating pipes of fish cage subjected to the flow and the modelling approach was based on the combination of the finite element method using the shell element to simulate the floating pipes and the hydrodynamic model improved from the morison s equation and lumped mass method the numerical results were compared with the data obtained from corresponding physical model tests and the simulations of fish cage in currents were performed to investigate the maximum deformation and the stress distribution of the floating collars simulations of the fish cage in different flow velocity were performed to analyse the effect of the net and flow velocity on the deformations and stress of the floating pipes the simulation results show that the stress and deformations drastically increase with the increase of flow velocity and the net has great influence on the stress distribution the simulations of the single point mooring cage system with multiple net cages in current were performed and the results show that the middle cage was most dangerous for the tripartite cage system 4 2 5 3 combined effect of wave and current flow wave current interaction problems are very complex in nature and it is very difficult to analyse and derive physical insight from direct computational results due to the mutual interaction between waves and the underlying currents wave characteristics such as wavelength and wave period may change significantly leading to a change in structural load therefore wave current interaction is an important branch of study in the fields of coastal and offshore engineering and it is a common feature in most of the marine environments the interaction of waves and currents not only changes the characteristics of the waves but also transforms the current flow field at the same time tsukrov et al 1999 2000 studied the dynamic performance of an offshore fish cage and submerged mooring grid system by using the finite element method under the action of combined waves and currents lader et al 2001 tsukrov et al 2003 and lader and fredheim 2001 2006 studied the dynamics of a net plane exposed to waves and current by modelling the net with panel elements consistent net elements and super elements lader et al 2003 studied the dynamics of a 3d cylindrical net structure exposed to waves and current and the numerical results of the net structures were validated by model tests huang et al 2007 2008 investigated the effects of waves and currents on the behaviour of a gravity type cage system which use a tube sinker to replace the common weights hanged at the bottom of net cages to overcome the deformation it was found that currents had a more important effect on the net cage system than waves only and shallower water depths lead to higher mooring tension and volume deformation zhao et al 2007c investigated the effects of combined wave current flow on the behaviour of a gravity type cage system by using a numerical model based on rigid body kinematics and the lumped mass method lee et al 2008 and zhao et al 2009 investigated the hydrodynamic behaviour of a gravity cage system in current and waves the motion net deformation and the mooring line forces of the gravity cage were calculated under current only waves only and combined wave and current flow respectively some calculated results from zhao et al 2009 are presented here to explain the effects of different environmental conditions it can be found from fig 24 that the cage net deformation increases as the current velocity increases figs 25 and 26 show that both the horizontal and the vertical motion of the net cage increase as the wave condition gets stronger fig 27 shows the dynamic motion of the gravity cage at different time periods in combined wave current flow and the obvious deflection of the gravity cage net in the current direction can be seen together with dynamic loading from the waves kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 analysed the mooring loads on an aquaculture net cage in current and wave in this analysis a numerical sensitivity study was implemented to identify the dominating factors for modelling fish farms in waves and current where in total 32 variations of rational models and parameters were made this study suggested that the mooring loads are not particularly sensitive to any of the variations shen et al 2015 studied the interaction between flow and the flexible net in waves and current by constructing the finite element model and adopting modified morison equation to estimate the deformation of the net sheet the deformation of the net sheet was investigated quantitatively by estimating the minimum projected area and comparing the area reduction ratio under each test case li et al 2017 presented a preliminary concept of a vessel shaped floating fish farm based on numerical panel method where the hydrodynamic analysis of this vessel shaped fish farm concept was studied in the frequency domain on the environmental loads due to wind waves and current for open sea applications see fig 28 on the other hand time domain simulations were performed by coupling the hull with the mooring system and the global responses of the system and the mooring line loads were compared in various waves and current conditions the effects due to misalignment of waves and current directions on the responses were also studied which were the limitations of this study the main geometry of the submerged part of the vessel hull is presented in fig 29 taking shielding and blockage effect into consideration cifuentes and kim 2017 carried out a complete analysis of the hydrodynamic response of a single cage under current regular waves regular waves and current and irregular waves and current loading condition based on the equivalent net model and a morison force model the study shows that current load dominates in most of the wave and current conditions analysed yet for large and steep waves its effect is of similar importance as the current load gutiérrez romero et al 2019 studied the influence on fish farm mooring behaviour in different sea states based on cfd numerical modelling and a procedure to carry out realistic simulation saving computational cost is presented by see fig 30 they concluded that it should be pay attention in two key parameters in the design process the first was marine currents and the second the computation of viscous drift forces large deviations in the computation gave an increase in cost project of this type of floating devices 4 3 physical models for net type structures 4 3 1 physical models for fish cage based on net type structures linfoot and hall 1987 gave a detailed description of the instrumentation and the data analysis technique needed for model and prototype sea cages tests in a random wave system the results of model sea cage showed that accurate prediction of the prototype motions could be obtained from physical model tests colbourne and allen 2001 studied wave induced loads and motions in fish cages through full scale and model scale measurements the full scale measurements showed that the wave action was not the primary environmental load on fish cages lader and enerhaug 2005 carried out experiments in a flume tank to measure the global forces and net deformation of a flexible net cage in a uniform current the results showed that the forces on the net cage and the deformation of the net cage were highly dependent on each other the forces on a flexible net structure were dependent on the reynolds number a series of experiments were carried out by tang et al 2011 in order to investigate the dynamic properties of a dual pontoon floating structure with an attached fish net for cage aquaculture as shown in fig 31 the results displayed that a fishnet system made the resonant response of body motions and mooring forces to be slightly lower due to the net s damping effect xu et al 2012 conducted a series of experiments to validate the numerical model used to predict the hydrodynamic response of a fish cage and mooring grid system in regular waves by comparing the experimental results the numerical model presented was considered reliable in the dynamic analysis of an offshore fish cage and submerged mooring grid system in waves kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 conducted a series of model tests to study an aquaculture net cage with a floater in waves and current turner et al 2015 investigated experimentally the hydrodynamic wake properties on model arrays of circular fish cages and observed that the results show high velocity deficits behind the cages causing accelerations in the flow underneath and around the sides of the cages see fig 32 high amounts of unsteadiness were found to be generated at the bottom of the cages due to the presence of a shear layer in the wake of the cages experiments were completed at the largest recirculating flume tank in the world located at the fisheries and marine institute of memorial university in st john s newfoundland the tank cross section is 8 m width x 4 m depth spanning 22 25 m in length see winger et al 2006 james et al 2016 carried out model tests and prototype measurements to measure tensions in the mooring chains and motions of the sea cage under different waves and towing conditions cha and lee 2018 studied the load on a circular fish cage with a copper alloy net under the action of ocean currents and waves respectively with a series of experiments it was found that by increasing the current velocity the volume of the cage hardly changed while the mooring line load exponentially increased kitazawa et al 2017 proposed a submergible cage using flexible tubes to farm silver salmon in deeper and cooler waters where the cage was submerged and floated up by ejecting air from and injecting air into the flexible tubes see fig 33 the cage was submerged or floated up changing the methods of air ejection or injection the submersion was also faster if the length of an injection tube between the vents and air compressor was shortened to reduce the pressure loss however the maximum inclination angle of the cage was determined by the diameter of the cage and the submerged depth not depending on the methods of air injection or ejection similar results were observed in the field test consequently silver salmon could be farmed in deeper and cooler waters until the middle of august the inclination of the cage was not the problem for silver salmon while it may have unfavourable effects on the other species through the deformation of netting fu et al 2014 studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of a floater net system in oscillatory and steady flows through forced oscillation experiments in a towing tank in this experiment the effects of keulegan carpenter number reynolds number and reduced velocity were investigated the results indicated that in oscillatory flow the added mass coefficient of the floater was larger than that of the floater net system whereas the drag coefficient was smaller the proportion of the drag force exerted on the floating cylinder reaches its maximum in oscillatory flow and its minimum in steady current flow føre et al 2016 studied the hydrodynamic loads acting on high solidity net cage models under high uniform flow velocities and deformation of the net cage of net cylinders with a simulated current and standard morison type numerical analyses were performed based on the model tests this study shows that a basic reduced velocity model was not sufficient to model the interaction between the fluid flow and net hydroelasticity for high solidity net cages subjected to high flow velocities for high solidities and large deformations numerical tools should account for changes in water flow and the global drag coefficient of the net qu et al 2019 investigated the deformation and drag force of model square fish cage in uniform flow based on model experiments the model cages were designed using different netting materials mesh types and cage depths where the shape deformation volume reduction and drag force were used as key parameters to characterize the cage performance the shape deformation and the volume reduction of model cages under uniform flow is shown in fig 34 and fig 35 separately it can be concluded that cages using polyethylene netting for the four sides and wire netting for the bottom generally show better performance than those composed entirely of polyethylene netting specifically the former undergoes less shape deformation and volume reduction than the latter the mesh type square or diamond mesh had a noticeable effect on shape deformation and drag force but a limited effect on cage volume reduction 4 3 2 physical models for net type floating breakwaters dong et al 2008 conducted a series of physical model tests to investigate the wave transmission coefficients of three types of floating breakwaters fbs the single box the double box and the board net as fig 36 under regular waves with or without currents it can be concluded from fig 37 that nets effectively reduce transmitted waves although the number of net rows exhibited almost no difference in the transmission coefficients in addition 20 current velocity can be reduced by the board net fb under the combined wave current conditions fig 38 shows that the stronger of the current the worse performance of the board net fb ji et al 2015 2016b investigated a cylindrical fb with a mesh cage and balls as shown in fig 39 in a two dimensional wave flume and a three dimensional wave basin respectively it can be found from fig 40 and fig 41 that transmission coefficients of model 2 are much smaller than that of model 1 which means the mesh cage attached to the cylindrical fb effectively reduce the transmitted waves moreover balls inside the mesh cage also play a significant role in the wave attenuation the efficiency of the other two types of mesh cage fbs as shown in fig 42 and fig 43 were compared with a cylindrical fb and a porous fb by ji et al 2016a fig 44 and fig 45 show that both types of mesh cage fbs model 3 and model 4 have a better performance on preventing wave transmission compared with the cylindrical fb and the porous fb further a cylindrical dual pontoon net floating breakwater model with rows of nets see fig 20 also was investigated by ji et al 2017 by a series of experiments in a wave flume 4 4 comparisons of numerical and experimental models of fish cages use of numerical modelling is inexpensive and flexible though a high level of technical proficiency is required physical modelling requires a tank facility instruments and accurately scaled models but offers the additional benefit of direct visual observation often providing a better understanding of system behaviour however in order to check the accuracy of proposed numerical models comparisons between numerical results and experimental data is necessary therefore in this subsection a significant survey of comparisons of numerical and experimental of fish cage models relevant to the present review are presented and results are discussed xu et al 2011 developed a mathematical model of a gravity cage system under irregular waves based on the lumped mass method and rigid body kinematics theory to simulate the hydrodynamic response of cage system by including the tension of mooring lines and motion of float collar in order to examine the numerical model quantitative comparisons were carried out between calculated and experimental results the arrangement of the physical model in the wave tank is shown in fig 46 fig 47 shows the comparisons of the average of one tenth highest mooring line tensions between calculated and experimental results on the other hand fig 48 demonstrates comparisons of the top one tenth cage surge and heave motions between simulated and experimental results respectively it was found that the mean relative error of the mooring line forces were 6 9 and the mean relative errors of the cage surge and heave motions were 9 9 and 4 2 respectively further xu et al 2013a analysed the hydrodynamic behaviour of a submergible net cage and mooring system under the action of waves and current the results were compared between numerical simulations and physical model in different cases fig 49 a b compare the heave and surge motion responses of float collar obtained from the simulated and experimental results respectively for the motion response of the float collar the largest relative errors of the heave and surge motion responses of the float collar are 11 1 and 13 4 respectively the mean relative errors of the heave and surge motion responses of the float collar are 4 5 and 7 1 respectively then xu et al 2013b analysed the hydrodynamic behaviour of multiple net cages and submerged mooring grid systems under waves and current flow by performing numerical simulations and a series of experiments the numerical model and physical model of the fish cage and mooring systems are shown in fig 50 and fig 51 separately the detail of the numerical model of net cage and mooring system was introduced in xu et al 2012 to simplify numerical simulation this study considers elements as a small body compared to the characteristic wave length this means that the scattering effects on the flow field due to the interactions of fluids particles and the elements were negligible the results show that for the maximum mooring line tension force the largest relative error is 13 0 and the mean value of the relative error is 6 1 for the motion response of the float collar the largest error of the vertical and horizontal displacements of the float collar is 7 1 and 10 9 respectively the mean relative errors of the vertical and horizontal displacements of the float collar are 3 7 and 5 5 respectively the discrepancies between the simulated and experimental results may arise from three main sources that are difficult to avoid first the influence of the gravity cage on the wave field is neglected in the numerical simulation because it is difficult to examine in physical experiments and to consider in numerical modelling next in this study the float collar is assumed to be a rigid body to simplify the motion equations whereas a little flexibility exists in practical physical modelling tests in addition to these discrepancies experimental and calculated errors are unavoidable although a great effort has been made to reduce them bi et al 2015 investigated the damping effect of net cages in waves based on experimental and numerical analysis a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the damping effect of net cages in waves and the wave transmission coefficient of the net cage was also investigated with different wave periods wave heights numbers of net cages net solidities measurement positions geometrical shapes of the net cage and reynolds numbers three net cage models a b and c were used in the experiments see fig 52 a net cage model consists of a top frame a net chamber and a bottom frame attached to the bottom of the net chamber the geometrical shapes of models a and b were circular while their net chambers were made of two different fishing nets see fig 53 model c was a square net cage with the same net chamber as model a from fig 54 it was seen that for a single net cage comparisons of wave transmission coefficient downstream from the net cage show that the numerical results agree well with the experimental data in different wave periods and wave heights the maximum relative error was 1 23 see fig 54 a b as the number of net cages increases the wave transmission coefficient downstream from the net cages decreases gradually numerical simulations were performed with different numbers of net cages and the wave height was measured downstream from the net cages in fig 54 c the wave transmission coefficient trend of the numerical simulation is consistent with the experimental data wang et al 2016 investigated numerically the dynamics of gravity cage based on the finite element program aqua fetm with two different meshes square mesh net and diamond mesh net as shown in fig 55 in waves and currents in both case studies they were considering several loading conditions consisting of different uniform currents and monochromatic waves and investigated the motion response heave surge and pitch characteristics of the fish cages with square mesh net and diamond mesh net their deformation and the resultant tension in mooring lines further the two case studies of the dynamics of cages were compared with water tank results from fig 56 it can be seen that the simulation results of the fish cage with square mesh net or diamond mesh net were close to the total drag force obtained from water tank tests the total drag force on the fish cage was in proportion to the square of current velocity the mesh shape of the fish cage has some influences on the drag force on the cage the drag force on the cage with diamond mesh net are larger than that with square mesh net especially for large current velocities fig 57 describes the motion of the fish cage model in waves the motion response amplitude operators raos including surge rao and heave rao for two selected points in the floating collar were calculated the mesh shape has significant influence on the horizontal displacement the surge motion of the floating collar with square mesh net were larger than that with diamond mesh net endresen et al 2014 studied the forces and deformations of fish farm of aquaculture net cage placed in a mooring system under waves and current with the numerical model of fhsim the numerical results were validated through comparison with experiments fig 58 shows that forces on anchor lines were 56 and 35 higher in the simulation than in the experiments for cw1 and cw2 respectively as the system under the action of waves and current simulated forces on the chain connected to the buoy were in good agreement with the experiments with 9 overestimation in cw1 and 0 deviation in cw2 the forces on the bridles were overestimated by numerical simulation with 49 for cw1 and 27 for cw2 gansel et al 2013 proposed a new net material for fish cages better prevent escapes protect fish from predator attacks improve the stability of fish cages and reduce bio fouling and studied the deformation of the nets with bending stiffness under different currents and influences of the net deformation on drag forces based on numerical model fhsim it was observed that the fhsim able to predict net deformation of nets with bending stiffness well and it was shown that fhsim could not only account for the effect of bending stiffness on net deformation but also that the model captures the structural dynamics of nets with bending stiffness in a current 5 conclusions this paper presented a detailed review on the research and development of the models for the dynamics of the horizontal or vertical flexible porous membranes and net type structures based on analytical numerical and experimental studies under various effects in addition the recent development of the physical models of the sea cages and net type floating structures are also surveyed further the comparisons of numerical and experimental of different fish cage models and their results are reviewed and discussed on the analytical models of the dynamics of the flexible porous membranes and circular cage systems analysis have been applied mainly on horizontal or vertical floating or submerged flexible porous membrane for the response of the membranes under the action of normal or oblique waves the qualitative or quantitative analysis on the behaviour in currents combined effect waves and currents various edge conditions along with design parameters and the comparisons against different methodologies in three dimensions are still unexplored on the numerical methods for the flexible net type structure models the truss model the mass spring model and the panel net model have been developed to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the structures under the action of waves and currents a focus on a eulerian fluid model based on lagrangian approach or coupling methodology will allow a better understanding of the hydrodynamics through porous nets and fluid flow for aquaculture applications however even though numerical methods could be used as a tool for the design and analysis of floating fish farms and components its accuracy still need to be improved by verifying with different methodologies on the physical models of the sea cages and net type floating breakwaters experiments have been conducted under full scale and model scale experiments with action of waves and uniform current in which the major analysis for hydrodynamic response and mooring grid system were investigated by comparing against numerical methods whilst in the case of net type floating breakwater analyses the efficiency of floating breakwaters due to the energy loss from the fluid net porous membrane interaction are investigated in terms of wave transmission coefficients however research development of this topic is still limited and also there is a gap between current technology and demands a significant focus on the ways to reduce the tension on the mooring lines and investigation of sway motions by including the effects of hydroelastic structural deformations flexural mode and compressive force into the net cages and horizontal floating breakwater could have major analysis future studies of floating or submerged porous membrane and net type structures models may include more comprehensive comparisons of relevant methodologies and results as well as analysis of various edge conditions and loads on the structures to optimize the model characteristics in terms of numerical model capabilities for application to floating breakwaters and fish cages on the other hand the porous media model can be used to simulate the flow field around net type structures and this model can be combined with a mechanical model of the net to study the coupled fluid structure interaction

membrane net type structure floating breakwater membrane dynamics fish cages 1 introduction over the years researchers have been working on finding a flexible cost efficient environmentally friendly reusable rapidly deployable and most reliable kind of wave absorber or breakwater in order to protect the marine structures from damage by severe sea conditions the applications of floating breakwaters in addition to the main task of coastal shoreline protection bento et al 2014 rusu and guedes soares 2013 can also protect aquaculture installations silva et al 2018 as shown in the studies that used renewable energy devices as a sort of floating breakwater during the past two decades there has been significant interest in flexible porous structures for application to breakwaters as this kind of structures are effective in dissipating wave energy and creating a tranquillity zone recently much attention has been paid to porous membranes and nets as a good choice because they have great advantages compared to rigid and nonporous kind of structures as the structure porosity helps in dissipating a large amount of wave energy for applications to coastal protection the net type structures are also used for fish farming and it is known that the water inside the fish cages is much calmer than the waters outside fishnets which demonstrates that porous membranes can provide tranquillity zone for fish farming therefore many studies about the ability of wave energy dissipation the incident wave reflection the trapping of incident waves and the dynamic response of flexible porous structures have been done and are reviewed here in the last two decades efforts have been made to study the various aspects of wave interaction with porous structures and porous media based on numerical and experimental analysis losada et al 1995 studied experimentally the kinematics and the dynamics of oscillatory flow in porous media by measuring the velocity the pressure field and the wave height inside the porous structure they found that dissipation is the most important factor in the transmission region and the porous structure works as a filter filtering out the higher frequencies as the oscillation propagates towards the lee side of the structure further losada et al 1996 studied the wave reflection by modelling the transformation and the interaction of regular wave trains with submerged permeable structures based on two different models an eigenfunction expansion 3 d model and a 2 d model using the mild slope equation for porous media losada et al 1997 conducted an experiment in a wave flume to study the harmonic evolution of monochromatic waves propagating over submerged porous step under non breaking conditions hur and mizutani 2003 developed two numerical models associated with two and three dimensional porous bodies on submerged breakwater by combining the vof method and porous body model to compare their estimated and measured wave forces mendez and losada 2004 presented a simple and innovative method to solve explicitly the dispersion relation for water waves over dissipative media using a perturbation numerical scheme lara et al 2006 demonstrated the capability of the cobras model to reproduce irregular wave interaction with a submerged permeable breakwaters by comparing numerical results with experimental data of a laboratory test loukogeorgaki et al 2017 conducted 3d experiments to investigate the hydroelastic and the structural flexible connectors response of a pontoon type modular floating breakwater under the action of oblique regular waves and observed that the floating breakwaters hydroelastic and structural response depend strongly upon the wave period the wave height and the oblique wave angle in the low frequency range christensen et al 2018 analysed three basic cross sections of floating breakwaters in two dimensions a regular pontoon a regular pontoon with wing plates attached and a regular pontoon with wing plates and porous media attached to the sides they observed that the cross sections with wing plates and porous media attached to the sides reduced the reflection and the transmission most effectively on the other hand liu and li 2013 provided a new analytical solution for wave reflection and transmission by a surface piercing porous structure without using complex wave number in the porous dispersion relation and they compared the results with traditional solutions by solving the complex dispersion relation and boundary element solutions recently another interesting aspect of submerged horizontal porous structures is the study of the effect of perforated or porous plates on the hydroelastic response of floating elastic plates which has been analysed by many investigators using darcy s law and complex dispersion relations cho et al 2013 investigated the oblique wave interaction with a submerged horizontal porous plate using matched eigenfunction expansion method mefem and numerical boundary element method by comparing the result of reflection and transmission coefficients liu et al 2012 provided a new analytical solution for wave scattering by a submerged horizontal porous plate with finite thickness using mefem based on linearized potential theory in the presence of a not complex dispersion relation over porous media mohapatra et al 2018a b studied the combined effect of the porous parameter and the mooring stiffness on the submerged porous elastic plate by analysing the reflection the transmission and the dissipation coefficients based on a theoretical approach cheng et al 2016a investigated the hydroelastic response of a mat like rectangular very large floating structure edged with dual horizontal and inclined perforated plates using an analytical approach mefem a numerical method hybrid fem bem and experimental tests cheng et al 2016a b studied the effect of porosity water depth inclined angle and the gap distance between dual perforated anti motion plates on the hydroelastic behaviour of a very large floating structure using the boundary element method based on the time domain modal expansion theory cheng et al 2014 investigated the response reduction efficiency of a very large floating structure by adopting submerged horizontal non perforated perforated or their combination plates in the context of numerical theory and experimental tests on the surface of porous membranes and nets there are many pores whose diameters are very small compared to the dimension of the structure see fig 1 thus porous membranes and the net can be considered as a sheet of porous media which has been investigated by many researchers darcy 1856 conducted an experiment to study the movement of water through sand and proposed a semi empirical law which is known as darcy s law philip 1970 generalized the darcy s law into a more compact expression which shows a linear relationship between the flow velocity vector and the pressure gradient sollitt and cross 1973 proposed that the forces exerted by the porous medium on the flow include two components the resistance force and the inertial force chwang and chan 1998 reviewed the applications and the limitations of darcy s law for analysing waves moving past a porous structure darcy s law has been used by many researchers to investigate the interaction between waves and porous structures cho and kim 2000 liu et al 2008 park et al 2010 karmakar et al 2012 mandal et al 2013 karmakar and guedes soares 2014 su et al 2015 mandal and sahoo 2016 koley and sahoo 2017b meylan et al 2017 mohapatra et al 2018a b according to darcy s law it is assumed that the normal velocity of the fluid passing through the porous structure is linearly proportional to the pressure difference between the two sides of the structures the proportional constant is a complex number its imaginary part is related to the inertia effect and thus has nothing to do with energy dissipation and can be neglected when the porous structure is thin and the size of holes is not large the real part is called the porous effect parameter it represents viscous effects and it can directly be obtained from experiments cho and kim 2013 generally the darcy s law applied to flexible porous membranes or net type structures can be expressed as yu 1995 1 v k 0 ρ ω g p ς t where v is the flow velocity vector g is the porous effect parameter defined as g g r i g i γ k 0 b f i s f 2 s 2 s 1 c m 1 γ γ γ is the porosity constant which is defined as the ratio of the porous area to the whole area of the membrane f is the resistance force coefficient s is the inertial force coefficient c m is the added mass coefficient ρ is the density of fluid ω is the angular frequency of the wave motion k 0 is the incident wave number b is the thickness of the porous media p is the pressure of the fluid ϛ is the deflection of the flexible porous structures t is time and is the gradient operator the parameters f and s may be evaluated empirically following madsen 1974 darcy s law requires the porous medium to be fixed and if porous mediums move the inertial effect should be considered chwang 1983 although darcy s law has been widely used by many researchers it is only applicable to laminar flow mickeley et al 1965 kirkhara 1967 macdonald et al 1979 and dybbs and edwards 1984 confirmed the existence of turbulence within a saturated porous medium then patursson et al 2006 2010 zhao et al 2013a 2013b bi et al 2014a 2014b 2017 and chen and christensen 2016 2017 studied the porous media model and used it to simulate the flow through and around net structures by taking turbulence model into consideration it is worth mentioning that up to now there exists well documented review papers in the literature in the broad area of wave structure interaction problems for instance chen et al 2006 reviewed four different types of existing hydroelastic theories and their applications to the analysis of very large floating structures wang et al 2010 reviewed the design and performance of anti motion devices such as breakwaters submerged plates oscillating water column breakwaters air cushion auxiliary attachments and mechanical joints for mitigating the hydroelastic response of very large floating structures under wave action karmakar et al 2011 reviewed the existing analytical hydroelasticity theories to analyse different types of floating and submerged structures applications for very large floating structures and large ice sheets klebert et al 2013 reviewed the present status of the flow hydrodynamics within and around sea cages by presenting the contemporary experiments on drag forces on the net panels model scale cages biological effects of fish fish movements and fouling dai et al 2018 presented a literature review on research and developments of floating breakwaters associated with the performance of different types of floating breakwaters and wave attenuating devices from the above literature it is confirmed that until now there is no review reported to the public related to the recent research and developments on models for the dynamics of porous membranes and net type structures therefore the objective of this paper is to present a literature review on research and developments of different types of models of porous membrane and net type structures for floating breakwaters in the field of coastal engineering and fish cages often associated with marine technology this review is arranged as follows section 2 describes the modelling approaches of the dynamic analysis of flexible porous membranes and net type structures based on the frequency domain and time domain analysis under the assumption of linearized water wave theory and structural response section 3 presents the review on the dynamic behaviour of the porous membranes associated with the models for i horizontal flexible porous membrane ii vertical flexible porous membrane and iii combined models of floating structure and vertical flexible porous membrane section 4 is devoted to the description on the models of the dynamics of net type structures associated with analytical numerical and experimental approaches in this section initially analytical models associated with cylindrical cages of flexible porous membrane along with their governing equations and boundary conditions are discussed then different numerical models such as the truss model the mass spring model and the panel net element model are described and some other models are discussed to study the different environmental effects on the dynamics of the net type structures finally the experimental models on net type structures for sea cage and floating breakwaters are reviewed section 5 summarizes the conclusion and future scope of the present review using flexible porous membranes 2 modelling approaches of the dynamic analysis of the flexible porous membrane and net type structures in the mathematical modelling of wave interaction with flexible porous membranes as well as with the net type structures for the dynamics analysis the following models are used in general the flexible porous membrane is modelled as a thin and inextensible sheet under tension the structural porosity is modelled using the darcy s law for wave past porous membrane to incorporate both frictional force and inertia force the theoretical and numerical analysis may be carried out in the frequency domain or in the time domain it may be mentioned that most of the dynamic analyses for flexible porous membranes and net type structures are carried out in the frequency domain as this kind of analysis is simpler in comparison to the rather complex time domain analysis however for transient responses and for nonlinear equations of motion due to nonlinear waves as in severe wave conditions it is necessary to perform the analysis in the time domain the dynamic analysis of flexible porous membranes and net type structures is based on the following assumptions the flexible porous membrane is modelled as strings of uniform mass density acting under uniform tension the fluid is incompressible inviscid and its motion is irrotational so that velocity potential exists and linear wave theory is used the amplitude of the incident wave and the motions of the structure are both assumed to be small 2 1 frequency domain analysis the commonly used approaches for the analysis of flexible porous membranes and net type structures in the frequency domain are the matched eigenfunction expansion method the boundary elements method and green s function technique under the assumption of linearized water waves based on potential flow theory matched eigenfunction expansion method is usually used as the analytical method for the problem of wave interaction with floating submerged flexible membrane or porous structures as in mohapatra and sahoo 2014a 2014b mohapatra and guedes soares 2016 mohapatra et al 2018a b in two or three dimensional problems the main idea of this method is to expand the velocity potentials with appropriate eigenfunctions and unknown coefficients firstly the complex wave numbers are obtained by solving the corresponding dispersion relation then the unknown coefficients are determined by using various boundary conditions with appropriate orthogonal property or the least square approximation method to obtain a matrix system chan and lee 2001 studied the scattering of a surface wave by a vertical flexible fishnet in finite water depth the boundary value problem bvp was solved by using the eigenfunction expansion method and the least squares approximation method kumar et al 2007 investigated analytically the wave scattering by a flexible porous vertical membrane barrier in a two layer fluid a new orthogonality relation along with the least square approximation method has been utilized to reduce the mixed bvp into a linear equation system based on the eigenfunction expansion method bhattacharjee and guedes soares 2011 investigated the performance of a vertical porous membrane barrier as a breakwater to reduce the wave load on a floating structure near a wall as shown in fig 9 the method of eigenfunction expansion and the corresponding orthogonal mode coupling relations were used to obtain an analytic solution to the bvp karmakar et al 2012 studied the scattering of gravity waves by single multiple vertically moored surface piercing floating porous membrane based on the matched eigenfunction expansion method as for the case of multiple surface piercing membranes the method of wide spacing approximation was adopted mandal et al 2013 conducted a hydroelastic analysis for surface wave interaction with concentric porous and flexible cylinder systems in which the inner cylinder is rigid and the outer cylinder is porous and flexible the scattering potentials are evaluated using fourier bessel series expansion method and the least square approximation method mandal and sahoo 2016 and su et al 2015 studied the interaction of waves with a flexible cage system in finite water depths under the assumption of small wave amplitude wave and structural response by using the matching eigenfunction expansion method and the least squares approximation method koley and sahoo 2017b studied the oblique wave scattering by permeable vertical flexible membrane wave barriers and the performance of bottom standing surface piercing and fully extended membrane wave barriers were analysed the analytic solution of the physical problem was obtained using the eigenfunction expansion method and a coupled boundary element finite difference method had been used to get the numerical solution where the membrane response and velocity potentials were solved simultaneously on the other hand cho and kim 2000 developed a multidomain boundary element method to study the interaction of monochromatic incident waves with a horizontal porous flexible membrane kee et al 2003 numerically evaluated the performance of floating pontoon breakwater with triple vertical porous membranes in the oblique seas by using a boundary integral method this numerical method was validated by checking the accuracy and convergence based on the energy conservation formula and it was further verified through comparison with experiments kee 2005 investigated wave interactions with fully submerged dual buoy vertical porous membrane floating breakwaters the boundary element method was used to obtain numerical solutions based on a discrete porous membrane dynamic model and simple source distribution over the entire fluid boundaries green s function technique has been used to study the dynamics of flexible porous membrane based on frequency domain analysis for instance recently green s function technique and green s identity were used to obtain numerical solutions koley and sahoo 2017a deal with the oblique wave scattering by a horizontal floating porous membrane with the green s function technique the associated bvp is converted into pairs of fredholm integral equations which can be reduced to a system of linear algebraic equations by using simpson s quadrature formula 2 2 time domain analysis on the other hand analysis for flexible porous membranes and net type structures has also been conducted in the time domain bessonneau and marichal 1998 and le bris and marichal 1998 proposed a constant time step method to solve the equations system obtained from each knot of the truss system for a supple net another method by using the fourth fifth sixth order runge kutta method to solve the system of motion equations in the time domain has been adopted by huang et al 2006 li et al 2006 zhao et al 2007a 2007b 2007c and lee et al 2008 to investigate the interaction between fluids and net type structures dong et al 2010 investigated the dynamic response of a gravity cage in current and waves and in irregular waves respectively the statistical approach and fourier transform are applied to analyse the cage motion response and the mooring line tension response in both time and frequency domain kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 used an improved screen type force model and the truss model to calculate viscous current and wave loads on aquaculture nets the net shape is solved based on a time stepping procedure that involves solving a linear system of equations for the unknown tensions at each time step chen and christensen 2016 proposed a new approach to calculate the porous resistance coefficients of a porous media based on the transformation of the morison type load model the transformation follows the principle that the total forces acting on a net panel from the morison type load model should be equal to the forces obtained from the porous media model analyses were performed to examine the convergence property in the time domain for net cages in both steady and unsteady flows cifuentes and kim 2017 carried out a complete time domain analysis of the hydrodynamic response of a single cage under current regular waves regular waves current and irregular waves current loading condition under the consideration of the shielding and blockage effect bi et al 2017 studied numerically the wave propagation through a square array of 16 net cages with different levels of biofouling based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd model and experimental validation is conducted to compare against numerical results tang et al 2017 analysed the impact of the cultured fish on the flow field through a net cage and the deformation of the net cage in the time domain they observed that the drag force on the net cage decreased significantly with the increasing fish stocking density but the most severe deformation of net cage occurred in the case of medium fish stocking density ji et al 2017 simulated the interaction of regular waves with a cylindrical dual pontoon net floating breakwater in the time domain by establishing a fully nonlinear numerical wave tank using a time higher order boundary element method 3 models for the dynamics of the flexible porous membrane in order to investigate the dynamic behaviour of flexible porous membranes many researchers adopted a continuous tensioned string dynamic model to model their motions cho and kim 2000 kee et al 2003 kee 2005 kumar et al 2007 bhattacharjee and guedes soares 2011 karmakar et al 2012 koley and sahoo 2017a 2017b mandal and sahoo 2016 on top of the string model one dimensional beam model was used by williams and wang 2003 and the cylindrical shell theory was adopted by phadke and cheung 1999 to model a flexible membrane the porous membrane is a flexible structure and therefore it generates deformations under the action of incident waves the mathematical complexity of this class of problem is the existence of higher order boundary conditions on the structural boundary associated with two dimensional three dimensional governing equation which lead to a non sturm liouville in nature the study of flexible porous membranes can be date back to the last two decades and mainly focus on two kinds of layout horizontal porous membranes and vertical porous membranes 3 1 model for horizontal flexible porous membrane researchers have been concerned with the dynamics of a horizontal porous flexible membrane which can be either submerged or floating on the water cho and kim 2000 investigated the interaction of monochromatic incident waves with a horizontal submerged flexible porous membrane in finite water depths as shown in fig 2 according to darcy s law the boundary condition on the porous flexible membrane is given by 2 ϕ y y d 0 i ω ξ i k 0 g ϕ y d 0 ϕ y d 0 x a y d where i 1 ω is the incident wave frequency k 0 is the incident wave number g is the porous effect parameter ξ is the deflection of the porous membrane in space ϕ is the velocity potential the motion of the submerged porous membrane is expanded in terms of a set of natural modes of the membrane which satisfy the membrane equation 1d wave equation and the end edge condition by using the matched eigenfunction expansion method motion amplitudes of impermeable membranes are compared with results for porous membranes and it is found that the general trend is similar however the maximum response amplitude is significantly reduced when a porous membrane is used later koley and sahoo 2017a studied the oblique wave scattering by a floating flexible porous membrane in finite and infinite water depths as shown in fig 3 the boundary condition and equation of motion of the floating porous membrane can be expressed in the following forms 3 ϕ y i ω ξ i k 0 g ϕ on y 0 x m 4 t d 2 d x 2 k z 2 ξ ρ g m m ω 2 ξ i ρ ω ϕ j y 0 x m where t is the tension of the membrane m m ρ m d m is the uniform mass per unit length of the membrane with d m ρ m the thickness and the density of the membrane respectively g is the gravity acceleration and k z is the z component of the wave number k associated with the incident waves further the edge conditions depend on the specific bvp arising in the wave structure interaction problems this study demonstrates that membrane deflection can be reduced significantly with the inclusion of structural porosity moreover the number of optima in the membrane deflection increases with a decrease in membrane tension recently guo et al 2020 investigated the oblique wave energy dissipation by a finite moored submerged horizontal flexible porous membrane and the results are compared with numerical results and experimental data available in the literature see fig 4 the boundary condition on the porous membrane is same as eq 2 and the equation of motion is given by 5 t d 2 d x 2 k z 2 ξ m m ω 2 ξ i ρ ω ϕ 2 ϕ 3 for a x a y h the edge condition of the horizontal moored submerged porous membrane is given by 6 t d ξ d x k s ξ x a y h where k s is the spring constant the analytical results of reflection and transmission coefficients presented are compared against the published experimental results with submerged porous plate of cho and kim 2013 as shown in fig 5 however there is a little difference in their data points in fig 5 this attributed may be due to the uncertainties in the amount of viscous or material damping nonlinear effects gap or end effects in the experiment further also the results are compared with bem numerical results of cho and kim 1998 are presented in fig 6 it is observed that the present analytical results agree well with the bem numerical results 3 2 model for vertical flexible porous membrane attention was paid to the dynamics and the efficiency of breakwater of single or multiple vertical flexible porous based on the analytical models however there are not many studies done on that topic in the literature kumar et al 2007 investigated analytically the wave scattering by a flexible porous vertical membrane barrier with its two ends fixed at the free surface and the seabed in a two layer fluid as shown in fig 7 the boundary condition and equation of motion of the vertical porous membrane can be expressed in the following forms 7 ϕ 1 x ϕ 2 x i ω ξ i k 0 g ϕ 2 ϕ 1 on x 0 0 y h 8 d 2 ξ d y 2 m m ω 2 t ξ i ω ρ 1 t ϕ 2 ϕ 1 for x 0 0 y h i ω ρ 2 t ϕ 2 ϕ 1 for x 0 h y h where ρ 1 and ρ 2 are the densities of the upper and the lower layer fluids ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are the velocity potentials of the upper and the lower layer fluids respectively it is observed that the porous membrane has larger deflection amplitude at a location nearer to the interface and the deflection is found to be larger when the interface is closer to the free surface besides the membrane deflection is found to increase with the increase in fluid density ratio and membrane tension in addition a large membrane deflection is observed for higher values of the imaginary part of the porous effect parameter g the inertia effect of the fluid inside the porous barrier karmakar et al 2012 studied the scattering of gravity waves by single and multiple vertically moored surface piercing floating porous membrane as shown in fig 8 based on the matched eigenfunction expansion method by considering three different types of edge conditions fixed moored moored fixed moored moored for the surface piercing membranes the boundary condition and equation of motion for each vertical porous membrane are same as eqs 7 and 8 in the region of y 0 d the fixed and moored edge conditions are defined as 9 fixed edge condition ξ y 0 10 moored edge condition ξ y k d ξ where k d is the spring constant as for a single surface piercing vertical porous membrane with the increase in the tension of the membrane the reflection coefficient increases whilst the transmission coefficient and deflection of the membrane decrease however increased porosity constant for the porous membrane leads to decreased reflection coefficient and deflection of the porous membrane in addition fixed upper edge and moored lower edge makes higher wave reflection compared with other two types of edge conditions as the mooring stiffness increases the displacement of the membrane edge decreases for multiple surface piercing vertical porous membranes bragg s resonance appears for the reflection coefficient and the resonance frequency is observed to be higher for a larger distance between two membranes and higher value of the tension of membranes bhattacharjee and guedes soares 2011 investigated the performance of a vertical porous membrane barrier as a breakwater to reduce the wave load on a floating structure near a wall as shown in fig 9 the boundary condition and the equation of motion for the submerged vertical porous membrane are also same as eq 7 and eq 8 in the region of x r y h 1 h fig 10 shows that the free surface elevation in region 4 is almost identical for different membrane tension however the wave amplitude is reduced significantly in comparison to the incident wave region hence the wave load on the wall will be less than what it will experience if it is subject to direct incident wave attack 3 3 combined model of a floating structure and vertical flexible porous membrane dynamics and efficiency of single or multiple vertical membranes attached to floating structures as a floating breakwater also attracted much attention kee et al 2003 evaluated numerically the performance of floating pontoon breakwater with triple vertical porous membranes fig 11 in oblique seas by using a boundary integral method in finite water depths the boundary condition and equation of motion for the submerged vertical porous membrane are also same as eq 7 and eq 8 the boundary condition on the floating buoy is 11 ϕ l n i ω η 1 n x η 3 n θ ϕ 0 n 0 l 1 2 3 4 where l 1 2 3 4 represents four fluid domains n θ x n y y n x η 1 and η 3 represent complex sway and roll responses ϕ 0 is the velocity potential of an incident wave the heave response of the floating pontoon is negligible therefore the coupled equations of motion for sway and roll are given by 12 m ω 2 x f p k hs k m x l 1 3 f t i f d where x is displacement of sway and roll m is a mass matrix of pontoon f p is hydrodynamic forces and moments on pontoon k hs is the restoring forces and moments due to the hydrostatic pressure k m is sway and roll mooring stiffness matrix including the effects of pretension f d is the nonlinear viscous drag force f t i i 1 2 3 is forces and moments on the pontoon caused by the initial tension of membranes at the connection points between membranes and pontoon it is found from the calculated results that the multi layer porous membrane system can significantly increase the overall wave blocking efficiency in normal and oblique incident waves including relatively long wave regions in addition applying proper permeability on the membranes eliminates the inevitable resonance of the system and reduces wave transmission kee 2005 investigated wave interactions with fully submerged dual buoy vertical porous membrane floating breakwaters fig 12 this problem was solved by using the same method as kee et al 2003 to formulate the boundary condition and equation of motion for the two submerged porous membranes and dual buoys it is found that the permeability imposed on the membrane further enhances its performance suppressing the reflected and transmitted waves simultaneously and even eliminating the possible resonances of the system 4 models for the dynamics of the flexible net type structure the flexible net type structure is supple discontinuous anisotropic and has no definite shape unless external forces are acting on it therefore when the water flows on or through a net the latter deforms and disturbs the motion of the water particles which leads to a very complex hydrodynamic problem associated with wave interaction with floating flexible net type structures in order to handle these complex problems both analytical and numerical methods have been adopted based on the net panel and 3d net cage these nets are modelled as a porous membrane to obtain analytical solutions under potential flow theory on the other hand many efforts have been also devoted to numerical calculations of panel nets and net cages by using finite element analysis in order to validate the analytical and numerical results model tests have been also carried out the details of the analytical and the numerical models are discussed in the following subsections 4 1 analytical models flexible net type structures such as cylindrical cages as shown in fig 13 consisting of a vertical cylindrical cage surface and a porous bottom are usually applied for sea fish farming similar to the flexible porous membrane the vertical cylindrical cage surface of a net cage can be modelled as an one dimensional string mandal and sahoo 2016 or as a beam mandal et al 2013 su et al 2015 mohapatra et al 2018a b the boundary condition and equation of motion of the vertical cylindrical net cage surface which is modelled as string are given as 13 ϕ 1 r ϕ 2 r i k 0 g ϕ 2 ϕ 1 i ω η cos θ on r a h z d 14 d 2 η d z 2 m m ω 2 t η 2 a i ω ρ t 0 π ϕ 1 ϕ 2 cos π θ d θ on r a h z d where η is the transverse deflection of the porous flexible cylinder with r is the radial distance from the z axis θ is the angle about the x axis and z is the axe of the three dimensional polar coordinate system r θ z the horizontal porous bottom is often considered as a two dimensional membrane as in mandal and sahoo 2016 or as a rigid porous plate see su et al 2015 the boundary condition and equation of motion of the horizontal submerged porous net which is modelled as a two dimensional membrane are given as 15 ϕ 2 z z d 0 i k 0 g ϕ 2 z d 0 ϕ 2 z d 0 i ω ξ on r a z d 16 r θ 2 m m ω 2 t ξ i ρ ω t ϕ 2 z d 0 ϕ 2 z d 0 on r a z d where ξ is the vertical deflection of the submerged porous net in space 2 is the laplacian or laplace operator by using appropriate boundary conditions on the fluid domain and the surface of the net type structure as well as the equation of motion of the structure the incident wave interaction with net type structure can be solved based on the potential flow theory chan and lee 2001 studied the scattering of a surface wave by a vertical flexible fishnet in finite water depths by modelling it as a catenary in this model the bvp was solved by using the eigenfunction expansion method and the least squares approximation method the results see figs 14 and 15 show that as the stiffness of the fishnet increases the deformation of the net decreases which results to an increase of the reflection coefficient mandal et al 2013 implemented a hydroelastic analysis for investigating the interaction with concentric porous and flexible cylinder systems in these systems the inner cylinder was rigid and the outer cylinder was porous and flexible it was found that the outer cylinder cannot only be used for protection of the inner impermeable rigid wall it but can also be used for developing an effective wave trapping system further mandal and sahoo 2016 and su et al 2015 studied the wave interaction with a flexible cage system in finite water depths see fig 13 under the assumption of small amplitude wave and assessed its structural response by using the matching eigenfunction expansion method and the least squares approximation method they observed that the porous effect parameter reduces the wave forces on the cage system due to the maximum wave energy dissipation and moderate membrane tension along with a judicious choice of the cage radius which suggests an effective cage system 4 2 numerical models it is difficult to gain knowledge only from theoretical methods to investigate the hydrodynamic behaviour of fishing nets numerous studies have been conducted by physical model tests numerical simulation and field measurements it is seen that the numerical simulation method is simpler inexpensive and time saver than those of model tests and field measurements therefore in recent decades some researchers have attempted to simulate the dynamic behaviour of fishing nets with finite element analysis and have also used many advanced useful methods one of the most important aspect for the finite element analysis of net type structures is to divide the supple net into discrete elements different numerical approaches to study the dynamics of net type structures are discussed in the following subsections 4 2 1 the truss model theret 1993 and bessonneau 1997 firstly put forward the truss model in order to describe a supple net the truss model uses a set of rigid cylindrical bars to model the mesh as shown in fig 16 to consider twine looseness each mesh side is broken down into two rigid bars articulated around an intermediary rotoidal link located in the middle of the twine thus it is assumed that the internal linking forces are reduced to a single traction component t which is assumed to be constant along the rigid element with the intention of getting a better approach to the behaviour of each mesh side it is possible to increase the number of intermediary knots all actual knots links between mesh sides and intermediary junction points are supposed to be rotoidal links and cannot transmit any momentum to rigid bars bessonneau and marichal 1998 the hydrodynamic force acting on rigid cylindrical bars can be calculated according to the morison equation or the net screen force model forces applied to each rigid bar are equally distributed between the two ends of the cylindrical element each knot mass is equal to half the mass of all rigid elements around it applying newton s second law to each knot n mechanical equations where n is the number of knots can be given by 17 j n 1 i n k i t j i 1 2 t p j i f j i a p j i p j i j n 1 i n k i 1 2 m j i γ i where k number of the first adjacent knots of knot i n 1 i n k i first adjacent knot numbers of i t j i tension of bar ji where i is one end of the bar and j the other t p j i is the drag pressure force perpendicular to bar ji f j i is the tangential friction force of bar ji a p j i is the added mass force of bar ji p j i is the combination of hydrostatic and gravitational forces of bar ji j n 1 i n k i 1 2 m j i is the total mass of knot i γ i is the acceleration of knot i moreover the length of rigid bars is considered as fixed therefore m additional equations where m is the number of rigid bars can be obtained as 18 x j x i 2 y j y i 2 z j z i 2 l j i 2 for i 1 n and j n 1 i n k i where x i y i z i and x j y j z j are coordinates of knot i and j l ji is the length of bar ji bessonneau and marichal 1998 le bris and marichal 1998 fredheim and faltinsen 2001 and moe et al 2010 modelled the trawls and aquaculture net cages with the truss model marichal 2003 generalized this truss model to incorporate elasticity by considering the constraint that the length of each truss remains constant this improved truss model has been applied by kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 2015 he et al 2018 and shen et al 2018 to aquaculture net cages 4 2 2 the mass spring model in the mass spring model the net is modelled as a series of lumped mass points that are interconnected with springs without mass as shown in fig 17 lumped mass points are set at each knot and at the centre of the mesh bar all the external forces such as the drag the buoyancy which work on the element are applied only on the mass points the springs are not considered as external forces but as internal forces derived from the elasticity of the line between the points the mass point at a mesh knot is assumed to be a spherical point where the fluid force coefficient is constant in motion direction so the motion equation of the mass point in a mesh knot is easy to be set up according to eq 19 19 m i δ m i a j 1 n t i j f d w b where m i and δm i are the mass and the added mass of point i a is the acceleration of the mass point t i j is the vector of the tension in bar ij n is the numbers of adjacent knots of point i f d w and b are the drag force the gravity force and the buoyancy force respectively however since mesh bars are assumed to be cylindrical elements the direction of the fluid forces acting on the point masses at each mesh bar should be considered therefore the motion equation of the point mass i at the centre of a mesh bar within the local coordinates τ η ξ which passes point i can be expressed by 20a m i δ m τ τ i t τ f d τ w τ b τ 20b m i δ m η η i t η f d η w η b η 20c m i δ m ξ ξ i t ξ f d ξ w ξ b ξ where δ m τ δ m η δ m ξ are the added masses of the τ η ξ components this method makes it possible to model the flexible structure in a variety of forms in other words bars or ropes could be divided into several points and then assigned in order to model large meshes or ropes for simulating them in detail lee et al 2005 using a mass spring model takagi et al 2002a 2002b suzuki et al 2003 and li et al 2006 investigated the dynamic behaviour of a submerged plane net in a current cha and lee 2002 and lee et al 2005 conducted a dynamic simulation of a midwater trawl system and an underwater flexible structure respectively zhao et al 2007a 2007b 2007c 2007d lee et al 2008 zhao et al 2009 dong et al 2010 and bi et al 2014a 2014b investigated the hydrodynamic behaviour of the 3d gravity cage system in current waves combined wave current flow and irregular waves respectively further chen et al 2012 analysed the hydrodynamic behaviours of two net cages due to wave action and xu et al 2012 studied the hydrodynamic response of four net cages in waves cha and lee 2018 utilized the mass spring model to represent of the copper alloy net cage in which the cage and the buoy with the mooring ropes were modelled as mass points and springs 4 2 3 the panel net element model another interesting model for a net type structure is dividing it into panel elements as shown in fig 18 each panel is assumed to be plane but it is otherwise allowed full flexibility movement of the node points is not restricted and the node points are allowed full 3d movement the orientation vector of all panel elements must be constant in time and equal for all elements the panel element is assumed to have structural characteristics similar to that of a nonlinear spring forces acting on each element are equally distributed to its two node points and the mass is also distributed to the node points the equation of motion of each node is given by 21 f s n 1 n e n 1 f s n n e n 1 2 f d n 1 f l n 1 f d n f l n 1 2 w n 1 w n g n g 1 2 m n 1 m n a n where n e n 1 n e n are the unit vector of panel element n 1 and panel element n f s n 1 f s n are structural forces of panel element n 1 and n f d n 1 f d n are the drag force vectors of panel element n 1 and n f l n 1 f l n are the lift force vectors of panel element n 1 and n w n 1 w n are the weights of panel element n 1 and n g is the gravity acceleration n g is the gravity unit vector m n 1 m n are the mass of panel element n 1 and n a n is the acceleration vector of node n using the panel flexible net element lader et al 2001 developed a dynamic model of a simple plane net exposed to waves and current in order to study its dynamic behaviour lader and fredheim 2001 2006 studied the influence of different parameters on the behaviour of the net exposed to waves and current based on the panel net element lader et al 2003 developed a super element to model the 3d net structures exposed to waves and current the elements are four sided with a node at each corner and each node is connected with the other nodes through a non linear spring movement of the free nodes is not restricted and the node points are allowed full 3d movement huang et al 2006 2007 2008 conducted a dynamic analysis of net cages using a lumped mass method and net plane element based model 4 2 4 other models many other kinds of models are available in the literature other than the ones discussed in section 4 2 1 4 2 3 which are associated with porous net type structures for example wan et al 2002 modelled each mesh bar in the net as an infinitely flexible rope element connected at each end to other elements by a frictionless hinge tsukrov et al 2003 developed a consistent finite element to assess the hydrodynamic response of net panels martin et al 2018 discretized the net based on the tension element method given by leitzke 1983 however it is obvious that direct finite element modelling of all the meshes of the net is impractical because it requires the enormously large number of finite elements therefore a mesh grouping method or equivalent truss method for the net developed by theret 1993 should be used to reduce the number of unknowns in the problem and the computational effort this method models a given number of actual meshes by a fictitious equivalent mesh the equivalent mesh has the same physical qualities as the actual meshes including the projected area of the netting the specific mass the weight and so on xu et al 2012 bardestani and faltinsen 2013 used the equivalent trusses to model the net of a floating fish farm and calculated the hydrodynamic forces on the netting structure in waves and current with the effect of snap loads 4 2 5 effects of waves and currents on the dynamics of net type structures studies of the dynamics of nets have been carried out mainly focused on ocean aquaculture and floating breakwaters many researchers have proved that waves have a great effect on the efficiency of floating breakwaters whilst the current load may be more significant than the wave load for the gravity cages in ocean aquaculture therefore it is important to study the dynamics of nets subjected to waves currents and combined waves and currents 4 2 5 1 action of waves lee and pei wen 2001 studied the dynamic motion of a large scale tension leg platform with net cage system subjected to waves they found that besides the wave properties the cage motion was related to the solidity ratio of the net cage the material properties of the tether the draft of the platform and the dimension of the cage fredriksson et al 2003 studied the optimum design of fish cage and mooring performance by utilizing the physical and numerical modelling techniques in the energetic open ocean a stochastic approach was used to analyse the motion response heave surge and pitch characteristics of the fish cage and the load tension response in an anchor line to wave forcing further in order to validate these approaches the dynamics of a fish cage and mooring system deployed in the gulf of maine were simulated with physical and numerical models and compared with field observations zhao et al 2007a simulated the behaviour of the float collar and fishing net of gravity cage under the linear wave theory and stokes fifth order theory in this study a series of physical model tests have also been carried out to validate the numerical results dong et al 2010 studied the hydrodynamic behaviour of a gravity cage in irregular waves and the results show that the system s responses decrease with the increase in wave frequencies tang et al 2011 investigated the dynamic properties of a dual pontoon floating structure with an attached fish net by using physical and numerical models based on the boundary element method the results of dynamic behaviour of a dual pontoon floating structure showed that a fishnet system causes the resonant response of body motions and mooring forces to be slightly lower due to the net s damping effect xu et al 2012 investigated the hydrodynamic behaviour of multiple net cages with two kinds of arrangement in waves based on the lumped mass method they found that there is not a significant difference between the effective fish cage volumes of the two cage arrangements chen et al 2012 analysed the hydrodynamic behaviour of the two net cages with grid mooring system under wave action the vertical motion amplitude of the two cages was almost the same while with respect to horizontal motion amplitude one cage moved much farther than the other chen and christensen 2015 developed a moving porous media model based on a coupled cfd fem model in the open source library openfoam to simulate wave interaction with moving net structures the net structure was described as a sheet of porous media with prescribed rigid body motion and mesh motion was incorporated to confirm the motion of the net zhao et al 2014 2015 established a two dimensional numerical wave flume based on the finite volume method to study the impact of wave heights and wavelength on the wave propagation through net panels and the accuracy of the numerical results was verified with the theoretical results in their numerical simulation the net panel was simplified as porous media entirely and the coefficients of the porous media are determined by the least square method further the vof method was adopted to solve the interface between water and air in the numerical model the governing equations were discretized and solved by the finite volume method second order upwind scheme was used to discretize the convection term and second order implicit scheme is used to discretize the time term pressure velocity coupling employs the piso algorithm in addition in order to validate the numerical model the numerical results were compared with the data obtained from corresponding physical model tests and the numerical results and the corresponding experimental data showed reasonably good agreement it was found that the wave force acting on the net panel increases with increasing net solidity and with the increase of the wave height the transmission coefficient remains constant furthermore the transmission coefficient increases with increasing wavelength but the increase in wavelength does not have much effect on the force acting on the net panel further zhao et al 2016 established a three dimensional numerical model to simulate the interaction between waves and net cages where the porous media fluid model was introduced to model the net cage in waves in this numerical model the flow motion of an incompressible viscous fluid was described by navier stokes equations and the free surface is tracked by volume of fluid vof method bi et al 2017 adopted a porous media fluid model to study waves propagating through a square array of 16 net cages with different levels of biofouling of a net cage model with clean netting the numerical model was validated by comparing the numerical data with corresponding experimental measurements they found that as the number of net cages increases from 1 to 4 the wave transmission coefficient downstream from the net cage decreases gradually due to the increasing damping effect li and ong 2017 investigated a semi submergible type offshore fish farm system for open seas which consists of a semi submersible support structure with pontoons and braces a catenary mooring system and net cages see fig 19 whilst the main dimensions of the semi submergible fish farm are presented in table 1 the linear hydrodynamic properties using different composite models with panel and morison elements are computed based on the hydrodynamic analysis linearized frequency domain and coupled time domain analysis are performed to predict the extreme motions of the support structure and the extreme tensions in the mooring lines the results indicated that the frequency domain method underestimates the extreme responses and the couplings between the structure and the mooring system need to be considered in the time domain the coefficients were selected based on the two dimensional coefficients from dnv recommended practice dnv rp c205 ji et al 2017 proposed a cylindrical dual pontoon net floating breakwater model see fig 20 and simulated the interaction of regular waves with the innovative floating breakwater based on numerical a time higher order boundary element method and mixed eulerian lagrangian and experimental approach the numerical results agreed well with the experimental results fig 21 indicates that more rows of net leads to greater wave blocking effectiveness due to the viscosity effect and energy loss from the fluid net interaction fig 22 shows that the reflection coefficient decreases with increasing net porosity for all wave periods and vice versa for transmission coefficient in the short waves region on the other hand when the net height increases the variation of the reflection and transmission coefficients become insignificant however when the net height increases beyond d net h 0 3 no significant wave blocking effectiveness can be observed because the wave energy concentrates mainly on the near free surface 4 2 5 2 action of current there are various environmental effects such as wind tidal thermal and coriolis effects that generate ocean currents and hence current is a common feature in most of the marine environment therefore the effect of current forces on the net type structure is important to be studied based on analytical and numerical models different analytical formulae to the resistance or drag coefficients of nets subjected to steady currents were proposed by kawakami 1959 1964 aarsnes et al 1990 løland 1991 1993 and zhan et al 2006 in order to calculate the current forces on a net structure and its deformation based on the porous media model and the transformation of morison type load model chen and christensen 2016 proposed a new approach to calculate the porous resistance coefficients of fishing net structures in both steady and unsteady flows and the agreement between the numerical and experimental results was fair theret 1993 developed software to investigate the shape and the tension of a trawl towed at a constant speed with a large number of meshes in a net based on a mesh grouping method further by generalizing théret s numerical model bessonneau and marichal 1998 and le bris and marichal 1998 developed a numerical method to simulate the dynamic behaviour of submerged trawls in a current based on modelling the net with the truss model and solving the mechanical equations for the knots some examples of the dynamic behaviour of a particular trawl were presented and qualitatively compared with flume tank observations wan et al 2002 simulated the configuration and tension distribution of submerged plane nets in a uniform current by using a non linear finite element method cha and lee 2002 simulated the dynamics of the fishing gear having different fishing conditions takagi et al 2002a 2002b investigated the dynamic behaviour of a rectangular fishing net in uniform current and different mesh group models were studied to compare the difference in calculation time accurate comparisons between this numerical simulation and experimental results were carried out by suzuki et al 2003 lee et al 2005 simulated the behaviour of a fishing gear system with a steady towing speed and automatic modelling methods were applied using numerical integral calculus huang et al 2006 analysed the dynamic properties of a net cage system exposed to steady currents line elements and plane surface elements were used to model the mooring lines and the net cage results obtained by this numerical method were in good agreement with the experimental data though the total force on the net cage may be underestimated for small values of reynolds number li et al 2006 investigated the shape and the tension distribution of plane fishing nets in current the simultaneous motion equations were solved by the runge kutta verner fifth order and sixth order method according to the simulation results the material made with the netting has an evident effect on the deformation and the tension of plane nets zhao et al 2007b 2007d investigated the effects of the structure size ratio the mesh type and system s weight on the deformation and the hydrodynamic behaviour of a gravity cage under the action of current the numerical results indicate that the decrease in structure size ratio is practically feasible for improving the cage net deformation the bottom collar sinker system is practically feasible for improving the cage net volume deformation using the finite element method software abaqus explicit moe et al 2010 conducted a structural analysis of aquaculture net cages in a uniform current the model was validated by comparing the results to physical model tests of a cage without bottom performed in a flume tank lader and enerhaug 2005 it is observed that the drag loads and cage volume are dependent on the net cage size and system weight further the drag loads increased almost proportionally to the current velocity for velocities in the range of 0 2 0 5 m s whilst the cage volume was reduced proportionally to the current velocity the corresponding lift forces increased with an increase in velocity with varying rates of change the cage volume was reduced almost proportionally with the current velocity decew et al 2010 investigated the submergence behaviour of a small volume fish cage in a single point mooring system under currents based on numerical model and results were validated with physical model tow test bi et al 2014a studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of a net cage in a steady current based on a numerical approach the numerical results show that the deformation of the net cage increases with increasing incoming velocity and the cage deformation decreases with increasing weight mass of the net cage using the lumped mass method and the porous media fluid model together bi et al 2014b simulated the dynamics of net planes in a steady current and took the interaction between the fluid and the nets into consideration kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 investigated the mooring loads on an aquaculture net cage in current and waves based on model test and numerical simulations the model tests were performed to provide benchmark data while the numerical model was used to study the effect and sensitivity of different load models and parameters the discussed numerical simulation results were first benchmarked towards the experimental data cifuentes and kim 2015 studied the drag force on the cylindrical net under steady current by using the commercial software orcaflex which is a fully nonlinear finite element software capable to compute forces and displacements of the net when exposed to current and wave loading føre et al 2016 investigated the hydrodynamic loads acting on high solidity net cage models under high uniform flow velocities and deformation of the net cage based on model tests and standard morison type numerical analyses ma et al 2016 proposed an innovative hybrid method to determine the hydroelastic response of full scale floater and net systems more accurately as shown in fig 23 within this method the hydroelastic response of a two dimensional example of a full length net panel with steady currents and floater oscillations was studied in detail it was demonstrated that this hybrid method was able to produce correct hydroelastic response for both steady and oscillatory flows tang et al 2017 developed a net fluid interaction numerical model to analyse the impact of the cultured fish on the flow field through a net cage and the deformation of the net cage it was found that the drag force on the net cage is significantly decreased with the increase of fish stocking density and a medium fish stocking density produces the most severe net cage deformation cha and lee 2018 studied the load on a circular fish cage with a copper alloy net under the action of ocean currents and waves respectively with a series of experiments it was found that with increasing current velocity the volume of the cage hardly changed while the mooring line load increased exponentially zhao et al 2019 developed a numerical model to investigate the deformations and stress distribution of floating pipes of fish cage subjected to the flow and the modelling approach was based on the combination of the finite element method using the shell element to simulate the floating pipes and the hydrodynamic model improved from the morison s equation and lumped mass method the numerical results were compared with the data obtained from corresponding physical model tests and the simulations of fish cage in currents were performed to investigate the maximum deformation and the stress distribution of the floating collars simulations of the fish cage in different flow velocity were performed to analyse the effect of the net and flow velocity on the deformations and stress of the floating pipes the simulation results show that the stress and deformations drastically increase with the increase of flow velocity and the net has great influence on the stress distribution the simulations of the single point mooring cage system with multiple net cages in current were performed and the results show that the middle cage was most dangerous for the tripartite cage system 4 2 5 3 combined effect of wave and current flow wave current interaction problems are very complex in nature and it is very difficult to analyse and derive physical insight from direct computational results due to the mutual interaction between waves and the underlying currents wave characteristics such as wavelength and wave period may change significantly leading to a change in structural load therefore wave current interaction is an important branch of study in the fields of coastal and offshore engineering and it is a common feature in most of the marine environments the interaction of waves and currents not only changes the characteristics of the waves but also transforms the current flow field at the same time tsukrov et al 1999 2000 studied the dynamic performance of an offshore fish cage and submerged mooring grid system by using the finite element method under the action of combined waves and currents lader et al 2001 tsukrov et al 2003 and lader and fredheim 2001 2006 studied the dynamics of a net plane exposed to waves and current by modelling the net with panel elements consistent net elements and super elements lader et al 2003 studied the dynamics of a 3d cylindrical net structure exposed to waves and current and the numerical results of the net structures were validated by model tests huang et al 2007 2008 investigated the effects of waves and currents on the behaviour of a gravity type cage system which use a tube sinker to replace the common weights hanged at the bottom of net cages to overcome the deformation it was found that currents had a more important effect on the net cage system than waves only and shallower water depths lead to higher mooring tension and volume deformation zhao et al 2007c investigated the effects of combined wave current flow on the behaviour of a gravity type cage system by using a numerical model based on rigid body kinematics and the lumped mass method lee et al 2008 and zhao et al 2009 investigated the hydrodynamic behaviour of a gravity cage system in current and waves the motion net deformation and the mooring line forces of the gravity cage were calculated under current only waves only and combined wave and current flow respectively some calculated results from zhao et al 2009 are presented here to explain the effects of different environmental conditions it can be found from fig 24 that the cage net deformation increases as the current velocity increases figs 25 and 26 show that both the horizontal and the vertical motion of the net cage increase as the wave condition gets stronger fig 27 shows the dynamic motion of the gravity cage at different time periods in combined wave current flow and the obvious deflection of the gravity cage net in the current direction can be seen together with dynamic loading from the waves kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 analysed the mooring loads on an aquaculture net cage in current and wave in this analysis a numerical sensitivity study was implemented to identify the dominating factors for modelling fish farms in waves and current where in total 32 variations of rational models and parameters were made this study suggested that the mooring loads are not particularly sensitive to any of the variations shen et al 2015 studied the interaction between flow and the flexible net in waves and current by constructing the finite element model and adopting modified morison equation to estimate the deformation of the net sheet the deformation of the net sheet was investigated quantitatively by estimating the minimum projected area and comparing the area reduction ratio under each test case li et al 2017 presented a preliminary concept of a vessel shaped floating fish farm based on numerical panel method where the hydrodynamic analysis of this vessel shaped fish farm concept was studied in the frequency domain on the environmental loads due to wind waves and current for open sea applications see fig 28 on the other hand time domain simulations were performed by coupling the hull with the mooring system and the global responses of the system and the mooring line loads were compared in various waves and current conditions the effects due to misalignment of waves and current directions on the responses were also studied which were the limitations of this study the main geometry of the submerged part of the vessel hull is presented in fig 29 taking shielding and blockage effect into consideration cifuentes and kim 2017 carried out a complete analysis of the hydrodynamic response of a single cage under current regular waves regular waves and current and irregular waves and current loading condition based on the equivalent net model and a morison force model the study shows that current load dominates in most of the wave and current conditions analysed yet for large and steep waves its effect is of similar importance as the current load gutiérrez romero et al 2019 studied the influence on fish farm mooring behaviour in different sea states based on cfd numerical modelling and a procedure to carry out realistic simulation saving computational cost is presented by see fig 30 they concluded that it should be pay attention in two key parameters in the design process the first was marine currents and the second the computation of viscous drift forces large deviations in the computation gave an increase in cost project of this type of floating devices 4 3 physical models for net type structures 4 3 1 physical models for fish cage based on net type structures linfoot and hall 1987 gave a detailed description of the instrumentation and the data analysis technique needed for model and prototype sea cages tests in a random wave system the results of model sea cage showed that accurate prediction of the prototype motions could be obtained from physical model tests colbourne and allen 2001 studied wave induced loads and motions in fish cages through full scale and model scale measurements the full scale measurements showed that the wave action was not the primary environmental load on fish cages lader and enerhaug 2005 carried out experiments in a flume tank to measure the global forces and net deformation of a flexible net cage in a uniform current the results showed that the forces on the net cage and the deformation of the net cage were highly dependent on each other the forces on a flexible net structure were dependent on the reynolds number a series of experiments were carried out by tang et al 2011 in order to investigate the dynamic properties of a dual pontoon floating structure with an attached fish net for cage aquaculture as shown in fig 31 the results displayed that a fishnet system made the resonant response of body motions and mooring forces to be slightly lower due to the net s damping effect xu et al 2012 conducted a series of experiments to validate the numerical model used to predict the hydrodynamic response of a fish cage and mooring grid system in regular waves by comparing the experimental results the numerical model presented was considered reliable in the dynamic analysis of an offshore fish cage and submerged mooring grid system in waves kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 conducted a series of model tests to study an aquaculture net cage with a floater in waves and current turner et al 2015 investigated experimentally the hydrodynamic wake properties on model arrays of circular fish cages and observed that the results show high velocity deficits behind the cages causing accelerations in the flow underneath and around the sides of the cages see fig 32 high amounts of unsteadiness were found to be generated at the bottom of the cages due to the presence of a shear layer in the wake of the cages experiments were completed at the largest recirculating flume tank in the world located at the fisheries and marine institute of memorial university in st john s newfoundland the tank cross section is 8 m width x 4 m depth spanning 22 25 m in length see winger et al 2006 james et al 2016 carried out model tests and prototype measurements to measure tensions in the mooring chains and motions of the sea cage under different waves and towing conditions cha and lee 2018 studied the load on a circular fish cage with a copper alloy net under the action of ocean currents and waves respectively with a series of experiments it was found that by increasing the current velocity the volume of the cage hardly changed while the mooring line load exponentially increased kitazawa et al 2017 proposed a submergible cage using flexible tubes to farm silver salmon in deeper and cooler waters where the cage was submerged and floated up by ejecting air from and injecting air into the flexible tubes see fig 33 the cage was submerged or floated up changing the methods of air ejection or injection the submersion was also faster if the length of an injection tube between the vents and air compressor was shortened to reduce the pressure loss however the maximum inclination angle of the cage was determined by the diameter of the cage and the submerged depth not depending on the methods of air injection or ejection similar results were observed in the field test consequently silver salmon could be farmed in deeper and cooler waters until the middle of august the inclination of the cage was not the problem for silver salmon while it may have unfavourable effects on the other species through the deformation of netting fu et al 2014 studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of a floater net system in oscillatory and steady flows through forced oscillation experiments in a towing tank in this experiment the effects of keulegan carpenter number reynolds number and reduced velocity were investigated the results indicated that in oscillatory flow the added mass coefficient of the floater was larger than that of the floater net system whereas the drag coefficient was smaller the proportion of the drag force exerted on the floating cylinder reaches its maximum in oscillatory flow and its minimum in steady current flow føre et al 2016 studied the hydrodynamic loads acting on high solidity net cage models under high uniform flow velocities and deformation of the net cage of net cylinders with a simulated current and standard morison type numerical analyses were performed based on the model tests this study shows that a basic reduced velocity model was not sufficient to model the interaction between the fluid flow and net hydroelasticity for high solidity net cages subjected to high flow velocities for high solidities and large deformations numerical tools should account for changes in water flow and the global drag coefficient of the net qu et al 2019 investigated the deformation and drag force of model square fish cage in uniform flow based on model experiments the model cages were designed using different netting materials mesh types and cage depths where the shape deformation volume reduction and drag force were used as key parameters to characterize the cage performance the shape deformation and the volume reduction of model cages under uniform flow is shown in fig 34 and fig 35 separately it can be concluded that cages using polyethylene netting for the four sides and wire netting for the bottom generally show better performance than those composed entirely of polyethylene netting specifically the former undergoes less shape deformation and volume reduction than the latter the mesh type square or diamond mesh had a noticeable effect on shape deformation and drag force but a limited effect on cage volume reduction 4 3 2 physical models for net type floating breakwaters dong et al 2008 conducted a series of physical model tests to investigate the wave transmission coefficients of three types of floating breakwaters fbs the single box the double box and the board net as fig 36 under regular waves with or without currents it can be concluded from fig 37 that nets effectively reduce transmitted waves although the number of net rows exhibited almost no difference in the transmission coefficients in addition 20 current velocity can be reduced by the board net fb under the combined wave current conditions fig 38 shows that the stronger of the current the worse performance of the board net fb ji et al 2015 2016b investigated a cylindrical fb with a mesh cage and balls as shown in fig 39 in a two dimensional wave flume and a three dimensional wave basin respectively it can be found from fig 40 and fig 41 that transmission coefficients of model 2 are much smaller than that of model 1 which means the mesh cage attached to the cylindrical fb effectively reduce the transmitted waves moreover balls inside the mesh cage also play a significant role in the wave attenuation the efficiency of the other two types of mesh cage fbs as shown in fig 42 and fig 43 were compared with a cylindrical fb and a porous fb by ji et al 2016a fig 44 and fig 45 show that both types of mesh cage fbs model 3 and model 4 have a better performance on preventing wave transmission compared with the cylindrical fb and the porous fb further a cylindrical dual pontoon net floating breakwater model with rows of nets see fig 20 also was investigated by ji et al 2017 by a series of experiments in a wave flume 4 4 comparisons of numerical and experimental models of fish cages use of numerical modelling is inexpensive and flexible though a high level of technical proficiency is required physical modelling requires a tank facility instruments and accurately scaled models but offers the additional benefit of direct visual observation often providing a better understanding of system behaviour however in order to check the accuracy of proposed numerical models comparisons between numerical results and experimental data is necessary therefore in this subsection a significant survey of comparisons of numerical and experimental of fish cage models relevant to the present review are presented and results are discussed xu et al 2011 developed a mathematical model of a gravity cage system under irregular waves based on the lumped mass method and rigid body kinematics theory to simulate the hydrodynamic response of cage system by including the tension of mooring lines and motion of float collar in order to examine the numerical model quantitative comparisons were carried out between calculated and experimental results the arrangement of the physical model in the wave tank is shown in fig 46 fig 47 shows the comparisons of the average of one tenth highest mooring line tensions between calculated and experimental results on the other hand fig 48 demonstrates comparisons of the top one tenth cage surge and heave motions between simulated and experimental results respectively it was found that the mean relative error of the mooring line forces were 6 9 and the mean relative errors of the cage surge and heave motions were 9 9 and 4 2 respectively further xu et al 2013a analysed the hydrodynamic behaviour of a submergible net cage and mooring system under the action of waves and current the results were compared between numerical simulations and physical model in different cases fig 49 a b compare the heave and surge motion responses of float collar obtained from the simulated and experimental results respectively for the motion response of the float collar the largest relative errors of the heave and surge motion responses of the float collar are 11 1 and 13 4 respectively the mean relative errors of the heave and surge motion responses of the float collar are 4 5 and 7 1 respectively then xu et al 2013b analysed the hydrodynamic behaviour of multiple net cages and submerged mooring grid systems under waves and current flow by performing numerical simulations and a series of experiments the numerical model and physical model of the fish cage and mooring systems are shown in fig 50 and fig 51 separately the detail of the numerical model of net cage and mooring system was introduced in xu et al 2012 to simplify numerical simulation this study considers elements as a small body compared to the characteristic wave length this means that the scattering effects on the flow field due to the interactions of fluids particles and the elements were negligible the results show that for the maximum mooring line tension force the largest relative error is 13 0 and the mean value of the relative error is 6 1 for the motion response of the float collar the largest error of the vertical and horizontal displacements of the float collar is 7 1 and 10 9 respectively the mean relative errors of the vertical and horizontal displacements of the float collar are 3 7 and 5 5 respectively the discrepancies between the simulated and experimental results may arise from three main sources that are difficult to avoid first the influence of the gravity cage on the wave field is neglected in the numerical simulation because it is difficult to examine in physical experiments and to consider in numerical modelling next in this study the float collar is assumed to be a rigid body to simplify the motion equations whereas a little flexibility exists in practical physical modelling tests in addition to these discrepancies experimental and calculated errors are unavoidable although a great effort has been made to reduce them bi et al 2015 investigated the damping effect of net cages in waves based on experimental and numerical analysis a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the damping effect of net cages in waves and the wave transmission coefficient of the net cage was also investigated with different wave periods wave heights numbers of net cages net solidities measurement positions geometrical shapes of the net cage and reynolds numbers three net cage models a b and c were used in the experiments see fig 52 a net cage model consists of a top frame a net chamber and a bottom frame attached to the bottom of the net chamber the geometrical shapes of models a and b were circular while their net chambers were made of two different fishing nets see fig 53 model c was a square net cage with the same net chamber as model a from fig 54 it was seen that for a single net cage comparisons of wave transmission coefficient downstream from the net cage show that the numerical results agree well with the experimental data in different wave periods and wave heights the maximum relative error was 1 23 see fig 54 a b as the number of net cages increases the wave transmission coefficient downstream from the net cages decreases gradually numerical simulations were performed with different numbers of net cages and the wave height was measured downstream from the net cages in fig 54 c the wave transmission coefficient trend of the numerical simulation is consistent with the experimental data wang et al 2016 investigated numerically the dynamics of gravity cage based on the finite element program aqua fetm with two different meshes square mesh net and diamond mesh net as shown in fig 55 in waves and currents in both case studies they were considering several loading conditions consisting of different uniform currents and monochromatic waves and investigated the motion response heave surge and pitch characteristics of the fish cages with square mesh net and diamond mesh net their deformation and the resultant tension in mooring lines further the two case studies of the dynamics of cages were compared with water tank results from fig 56 it can be seen that the simulation results of the fish cage with square mesh net or diamond mesh net were close to the total drag force obtained from water tank tests the total drag force on the fish cage was in proportion to the square of current velocity the mesh shape of the fish cage has some influences on the drag force on the cage the drag force on the cage with diamond mesh net are larger than that with square mesh net especially for large current velocities fig 57 describes the motion of the fish cage model in waves the motion response amplitude operators raos including surge rao and heave rao for two selected points in the floating collar were calculated the mesh shape has significant influence on the horizontal displacement the surge motion of the floating collar with square mesh net were larger than that with diamond mesh net endresen et al 2014 studied the forces and deformations of fish farm of aquaculture net cage placed in a mooring system under waves and current with the numerical model of fhsim the numerical results were validated through comparison with experiments fig 58 shows that forces on anchor lines were 56 and 35 higher in the simulation than in the experiments for cw1 and cw2 respectively as the system under the action of waves and current simulated forces on the chain connected to the buoy were in good agreement with the experiments with 9 overestimation in cw1 and 0 deviation in cw2 the forces on the bridles were overestimated by numerical simulation with 49 for cw1 and 27 for cw2 gansel et al 2013 proposed a new net material for fish cages better prevent escapes protect fish from predator attacks improve the stability of fish cages and reduce bio fouling and studied the deformation of the nets with bending stiffness under different currents and influences of the net deformation on drag forces based on numerical model fhsim it was observed that the fhsim able to predict net deformation of nets with bending stiffness well and it was shown that fhsim could not only account for the effect of bending stiffness on net deformation but also that the model captures the structural dynamics of nets with bending stiffness in a current 5 conclusions this paper presented a detailed review on the research and development of the models for the dynamics of the horizontal or vertical flexible porous membranes and net type structures based on analytical numerical and experimental studies under various effects in addition the recent development of the physical models of the sea cages and net type floating structures are also surveyed further the comparisons of numerical and experimental of different fish cage models and their results are reviewed and discussed on the analytical models of the dynamics of the flexible porous membranes and circular cage systems analysis have been applied mainly on horizontal or vertical floating or submerged flexible porous membrane for the response of the membranes under the action of normal or oblique waves the qualitative or quantitative analysis on the behaviour in currents combined effect waves and currents various edge conditions along with design parameters and the comparisons against different methodologies in three dimensions are still unexplored on the numerical methods for the flexible net type structure models the truss model the mass spring model and the panel net model have been developed to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the structures under the action of waves and currents a focus on a eulerian fluid model based on lagrangian approach or coupling methodology will allow a better understanding of the hydrodynamics through porous nets and fluid flow for aquaculture applications however even though numerical methods could be used as a tool for the design and analysis of floating fish farms and components its accuracy still need to be improved by verifying with different methodologies on the physical models of the sea cages and net type floating breakwaters experiments have been conducted under full scale and model scale experiments with action of waves and uniform current in which the major analysis for hydrodynamic response and mooring grid system were investigated by comparing against numerical methods whilst in the case of net type floating breakwater analyses the efficiency of floating breakwaters due to the energy loss from the fluid net porous membrane interaction are investigated in terms of wave transmission coefficients however research development of this topic is still limited and also there is a gap between current technology and demands a significant focus on the ways to reduce the tension on the mooring lines and investigation of sway motions by including the effects of hydroelastic structural deformations flexural mode and compressive force into the net cages and horizontal floating breakwater could have major analysis future studies of floating or submerged porous membrane and net type structures models may include more comprehensive comparisons of relevant methodologies and results as well as analysis of various edge conditions and loads on the structures to optimize the model characteristics in terms of numerical model capabilities for application to floating breakwaters and fish cages on the other hand the porous media model can be used to simulate the flow field around net type structures and this model can be combined with a mechanical model of the net to study the coupled fluid structure interaction between the flow and the net type structure declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgements the paper contributes to the project hydroelastic behaviour of

22021,this study aims to elucidate the possible risk factors considering the point of view of a ship operator by identifying the maximum collision risk bearing angle mcrba and the distance at which the collision risk begins to increase significantly dcrbis which are key factors affecting navigation safety in real maritime environments using two ships at sea in various vessel encounter situations relative bearing angles of 000 045 090 and 135 the perceived ship collision risk pscr was estimated by the ship operators then the mean values of all the measured parameters were used to identify the bearing angle corresponding to the highest pscr the mcrba was compared to the maximum frequency collision bearing angle mfcba derived by investigating 200 reported ship collision cases in korean waters the highest experimental pscr values were observed at a relative bearing angle of 135 which corresponded to the results of collision case analyses stating that the mfcba was equal to 112 5 135 notably the pscr magnitude increased most significantly at a distance of 1 25 1 nm in experiments involving various vessel encounter situations collision risk factors such as the mcrba and dcrbis can thus be used in the development of collision prevention protocols for ship operators keywords maritime ship experiment collision prevention ship operator perceived ship collision risk maximum

to ship collision accidents can lead to human and property losses as well as marine pollution they can occur owing to external factors such as inclement weather at sea and excessive navigation speed however the human factor must also be considered previous studies have reported that many collisions have been caused owing to errors of the ship operators so i e the persons navigating these ships hetherington et al 2006 kim 2017 rothblum 2000 therefore it is critical to design measures for the so to prevent collisions in an encounter situation with the target ship ts marine accidents such as ship collisions are not caused by any one element but by a combination of various elements forming an accident chain from the cause of the accident to the result rothblum 2000 van dorp et al 2001 suggested five steps of accident chains namely hazard peril risk consequence and impact marine accidents can be prevented if we can restrict or block the accident chain at any of these steps this study was conducted after recognizing the importance of breaking the accident chain by the navigator at the hazard peril and risk levels the collision risk perceived by the so during the encounter with the ts at sea is determined by various factors but the encounter bearing angle and distance are also important in this study in addition to the ship s speed and the complicated situation in the ship to ship encounter situation only the relative bearing and distance factors were studied the first parameter corresponding to the highest collision risk is defined as the maximum collision risk bearing angle mcrba the second parameter is the distance at which the collision risk begins to increase significantly dcrbis these two parameters must be considered together the mcrba and dcrbis are parameters describing the relative bearing angle and distance respectively the mcrba is the bearing angle in which the so perceives the highest collision risk in the encounter situation with tss navigators should consider the mcrba in the encounter situations and pay more attention than usual to prevent collisions through a careful look out of the ts s course and speed this is required to quickly escape from such encounter bearing angles if possible the so must operate the own ship os more carefully than usual at the dcrbis if the os is in the situation of the mcrba and the dcrbis it is more likely to lead to a collision compared to other scenarios hence the os must consider early avoidance actions to prevent collision ship collision can be actively prevented through effective avoidance measures that can be performed by the so in risk situations this study aims to determine the mcrba and the dcrbis which can be useful collision risk factor descriptors to navigators by measuring the perceived collision risk on the collision course that sos judge as a collision risk level if navigators are aware of the mcrba and dcrbis they can take measures to avoid collision at the right time during a close quarters situation therefore it is important to accurately determine the mcrba and dcrbis to achieve this objective while also considering the limitations of previous studies a collision risk measurement experiment was designed in which the so sees and perceives the ts in various encounter situations such as head on or crossing to identify the causes of collision related to the human factors of the so here the perceived ship collision risk pscr of the so means recording the perceived psychological level of the collision risk in the range of 1 100 values as the distance from the ts is gradually decreased by the encounter situation here perception refers to a process that includes all steps from detecting the existence of an object to its clear identification bernstein 2010 the collision risk felt by the officer on watch oow is especially high when the ship is in the position of a give way vessel according to the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs and has a legal obligation to perform collision avoidance navigation for a stand on vessel imo 2003 in identifying the mcrba and the dcrbis one method can be used which is specifically to measure the pscr of the ship operator by conducting a marine encounter experiment using two vessels however this task is difficult to accomplish in practice using large ships because of the possible collision risks and involved expenses therefore ais data simulators or surveys are typically utilized in most studies in the meantime various methods have been presented to study ship collision risk for example lin 2006 used a simulation experiment and a questionnaire to assess the evasive actions of the watch officer the environmental stress model developed by inoue 2000 considered the difficulty in ship navigation experienced by oows in encounter situations because of the influence of other ships in the study a simulator and a survey were used to obtain the stress values of oows in each encounter bearing however this research method had limitations in accurately identifying the difficulty in ship navigation experienced by the experiment participants because actual ship experiments were not performed for this purpose yim et al 2018 developed a multiple linear regression model to experimentally study risk perception on a ship in various collision encounter situations however no comparison of the experimental results with the existing collision accident records was performed as an example of the research related to ship operators wang 2012 modeled the shape index k as a fuzzy system that inputs proficiency and the navigator s physical and mental states to effectively consider the effect of the navigator s condition on the ship domain chin and debnath 2009 modeled the collision risk perceived during coastal navigation using information from surveys answered by maritime pilots silveira et al 2013 calculated the probability of ship collision from ais data much research has been conducted on ship collision risk measurement or assessment for example goerlandt et al 2015 presented a comprehensive rule based expert system with fuzzy inference in which the knowledge domain was defined through consultation eliciting knowledge using interviews and questionnaires lopez santander and lawry 2017 proposed a non linear model for risk estimation attempting to capture mariners judgement questionnaire data that captured and quantified mariners judgements of risk for craft in the vicinity were collected with each vessel being described using measurements that can be obtained easily from the data already present in the ship s navigational equipment the ship domain is a well known concept defined by goodwin 1975 as the surrounding effective water in which the navigator of a ship wants to keep clear of other ships or fixed objects szlapczynski et al 2018 carried out simulation experiments based on ship maneuverability data in a study of the ship domain to determine the distances required for collision avoidance maneuvers in give way situations however in studies on ship collisions using simulators the participants experienced less psychological pressure than that in real scenarios because the modeled scenarios were virtual to overcome this limitation first the mcrba and dcrbis were determined in this study by performing encounter situation experiments involving two actual ships korea coast guard large vessels and measuring the ship collision risks related to human errors next the ship collision cases obtained from the korea maritime safety tribunal kmst were analyzed and the maximum frequency collision bearing angle mfcba was determined the mcrba and dcrbis were verified by comparing these results 2 conceptual basis 2 1 relationship between increase in pscr value and ship collision the increases in the pscr value and ship collisions are closely related according to ross 1975 humans perceive risks when dangerous scenarios occur or are likely to occur here risk refers to the possibility of loss damage injury or any other adverse unwelcome circumstance a chance or situation involving such possibilities aven 2012 the navigators who operate ships also recognize this risk when collision risk scenarios occur with ships encountering each other at different bearing angles and distances the navigator performs a series of actions to avoid collision in this instance they perceive collision risks these risks can be instantly converted into the burden of avoidance navigation acute stress when the ship becomes a give way vessel in an encounter with a stand on vessel approaching from the starboard direction for crossing colregs 1972 in relation to this acute stress the navigator is under stress on a daily basis to avoid various close encounters with tss here the typical encounter situation is a head on and crossing situation as an exception the navigator may undergo acute stress in a stand on vessel when the ts which is give way vessel does not perform a collision avoidance action here stress is defined as the feeling of anxiety and threat when a person is in a scenario that is difficult to cope with psychologically or physically lazarus 1993 according to hetherington et al 2006 stress is one of the main causes of human errors when humans are under stress it affects their brain and heart resulting in various symptoms the effects of stress on the brain include hypersensitivity and degraded concentration in severe cases panic disorder or other panic phenomena may occur the blood pressure and heart rate increase when the heart is affected mental health america 2018 in particular acute stress that is instantaneously generated in the navigator of the give way vessel in an encounter with ts may cause human errors such as mistakes in performing collision avoidance actions in this regard positive correlations were found between reported stress and error and stress and violations westerman and haigney 2000 while driving a car if we meet another car driving on the wrong side of a motorway all of us would probably be stressed acute stress is the kind of stress someone experiences when encountering a difficult scenario a crisis an emergency situation or an acute situation the human error failure to perform prescribed actions induced in this manner can be a cause for ship collision with regard to this point various studies about human reliability analysis which shows the linkage between human error and accident have been conducted bot 2004 gould et al 2012 hashimoto et al 2015 straeter 2004 2 2 mcrba fig 1 shows the danger zone related to the collision risk i colregs 1972 rule 15 is a navigation rule applied in the event of a crossing encounter between two ships it stipulates that the ship that has another ship on its starboard side must avoid the path of that ship and not cross its bow as long as the situation allows ii assuming that the ship is subject to colregs 1972 rule 16 for the give way vessel the latter must alter its course to avoid a collision with an approaching stand on vessel as a result the navigator of the give way vessel feels the burden of avoidance navigation in such encounter situations the probability of collision increases if the navigator of the give way vessel makes human errors or if the stand on vessel does not cooperate with the give way vessel performing avoidance navigation the bearing angles of such scenarios range from 000 to 135 in the starboard direction fig 1 which is within the range of the collision risk bearing angle crba the mcrba is the bearing angle at which the oow perceives the highest ship collision risk the possibility of collision is the highest at the mcrba hence which relative bearing angle corresponds to the mcrba in ship encounter situations must be determined the setting range of the crba is limited to a relative bearing angle of 180 toward the starboard side based on the heading direction of the give way vessel 3 methods the experimental work was divided into studies a and b which were conducted according to the procedures described in fig 2 i in study a encounter situation experiments were performed at sea using actual vessels to measure the pscr of the so and the mcrba and the collision risk distance were estimated by statistically analyzing the obtained pscr data ii in study b the mfcba was determined by examining the actual collision accident cases and collecting and analyzing the collision bearing angles of a selected sample group iii the obtained mcrba and dcrbis were verified by comparing the results of studies a and b 3 1 study a pscr measurement experiment for determining the mcrba to measure the pscr value two ships were classified as the os and the ts actual ship experiments were then designed assuming a situation in which the os encounters the ts in a semicircle on the starboard side the nm was used as the distance measurement unit and speed was measured in knots thus the results of all experiments herein are expressed in nm and knots kt accordingly 1 nm is 1852 m and 1 knot refers to a speed of 1 nm per hour 1852 m 3600 s 3 1 1 experimental ships and participants two large patrol ships were provided by the korea coast guard ships with similar lengths and tonnages were selected to minimize experimental errors using merchant ships in the experiments was practically difficult because of the massive economic costs and collision risks in contrast the patrol ships could safely participate in encounter scenarios because of their well trained personnel and the presence of marine police officers with good navigation experience on board table 1 shows the characteristics of the vessels participating in the experiment the os had a length of 90 m and a gross tonnage of 1600 while the ts had a length of 91 m and a gross tonnage of 1500 the basic speed was set to 10 0 kt in the case of s4 the ts was 15 0 kt for both ships in accordance with the usual speed of coastal vessels appendix a supplementary material shows the ts used in the experiments the os has the same appearance appendix b supplementary material shows the maneuvering characteristics of the experimental ships the experimental participants were 30 coast guard officers on board the os the captain was in charge of maneuvering the os and the bridge team was divided into a group of 30 participants and a ship control group consisting of six officers the experimental participants group was asked to only measure their pscrs by monitoring their ts at the bridge in each encounter situation and the ship control group carried out the vessel maneuvering task without participating in the measurement experiment before the experiment each participant was instructed to assume that they were the oows in charge of safety of the seafaring vessels appendix c supplementary material shows the demographic characteristics of the participants their ages experience and qualifications are summarized as follows the average age of the participants was 38 27 with a standard deviation of 9 79 with 56 7 of them in their 20s or 30s and 43 3 in their 40s 50s or 60s 3 1 2 experimental scenarios four ship encounter situations for the pscr measurements were set up at four different bearing angles assuming that the ts approaches the os from the starboard direction appendix d supplementary material shows the four ship encounter scenarios according to colregs 1972 the navigation rules for ships state that the os has the position of the give way vessel in encounter situations s2 s4 s denotes situation because the ts is located in its starboard direction rule 16 therefore the os must alter its course toward the starboard side to avoid the path of the ts s1 is the head on situation in which both ships must alter their courses toward their respective starboard sides the pscr measurement distance was varied from 3 nm to 0 25 nm for the reasons stated below according to the ts perception distance analysis of the kmst collision accident written verdict where the perception distance is the distance from the os to the ts when the oow of the os first perceived the existence of the ts during seafaring accidents that occurred within a perception distance of 5 nm accounted for 88 5 of 625 collision accidents while those that occurred within 2 nm represented 66 3 kmst 2017 of all accidents in addition according to colregs 1972 article 22 visibility distance of light the minimum visibility of the side and stern lights of a ship longer than 50 m must be 3 nm hence measurements must be performed at distances equal to or longer than 3 nm in this study the initial measurement distance was set to 3 nm at which the ts could be clearly perceived by the naked eye furthermore the experiments were terminated at a distance of 0 25 nm and avoidance maneuvers were performed to prevent ship collision at that distance in the four experimental scenarios of s1 to s4 the shortest distance between both ships was set to 0 25 nm this is because the two ships were evaluated to safely avoid collision in a pre evasive maneuver test that was conducted at a speed of 10 kt before the pscr measurement experiment appendix e supplementary material shows a typical procedure performed in the s3 090 encounter situation between os left side and tss right side the os navigated at 000 speed 10 kt while the ts approached at a speed of 10 kt and a relative bearing angle of 090 the participants pscr measurement experiments began at the point where the distance between the two vessels was 3 nm these measurements were taken at decrements of 0 25 nm in ship to ship distance as the two experimental ships approached each other the experiments were terminated at a final distance of 0 25 nm from the anticipated collision point for the safety of the ships 3 1 3 pscr judgment criteria table 2 lists various judgment criteria for conducting the pscr measurements chin and debnath 2009 and inoue 2000 the participants were instructed to record the collision risks perceived while watching the approaching ts with their naked eyes on a scale of 0 100 by using separate sheets 3 1 4 ship encounter experimental procedure as shown in fig 3 the encounter experiments were performed using the two large korea coast guard patrol vessels located 10 nm southwest from gasa island near mokpo south korea in accordance with the described experimental scenarios at 12 o clock the weather was favorable for the experiments with a southeasterly wind at a speed of 6 8 m s a wave height of 1 1 25 m and visibility was more than 3 nm the encounter situations were realized in the order of s1 s2 s3 and s4 in accordance with the experimental scenarios the experimental procedure is described in detail below i step 1 movement to the experimental positions and control the two patrol ships moved from the mokpo port to the experimental area the participants on the os were informed of the judgment criteria for the pscr measurements in addition prior consent regarding the collision risk measurements was received from all participants because of the nature of the experiments furthermore the courses and speeds of both ships were controlled for safety ii step 2 encounter situation experiments the measurements started with s1 the os and tss began maneuvering at 10 kt and simultaneously headed toward the anticipated collision point the os periodically monitored the distance between the ships and the bearing angle using an electronic navigation chart with superimposed radar images to control the courses and speeds of the ships such that the predesigned encounter situations could be realized the 30 participants in the experiment who were on the bridge wheelhouse of the ship were requested not to talk during the experiment each person was asked to record their pscr values on the record paper only looking at the approach of the forward ts in addition communication between the participating vessels was made only when necessary for the safety of navigation between the ship control groups and not the experiment participants monitoring of distance and encounter situations was announced aloud by the radar operating personnel who did not participate in this test hence the participants could recognize each situation each participant was instructed to assume that they were the oows in charge of the safety of seafaring iii step 3 measurements of the pscr values the pscr values were simultaneously recorded on separate sheets by 30 participating marine police officers at 12 measurement positions located at every 0 25 nm from the point with a distance of 3 nm while watching the approaching ts from the window in front of the bridge of the os fig 4 the experiment took approximately 30 min for each situation the total time was approximately 3 h including the time it took for the ship to be located in the appropriate position and prepare for the maneuvering experiment in the interview after the experiment the participants answered that they barely acknowledged the possibility of biases because of the repeated measurement 3 1 5 data analysis statistical analysis of the measured pscr data was performed using the spss v 21 software 2011 at a significance level of 0 05 i reliability analysis was conducted to find out the reliability of the measurement data reliability refers to the degree to which repeated measurements of the same object provide the same results cronbach s alpha is the most commonly used method and is highly reliable if it is equal to equation 1 and 0 6 or higher 1 α n n 1 1 σ i 2 σ t 2 where n is the number of questions σ t 2 is the total variance and σ i 2 is the variance of each item ii normality was tested to determine whether the population distribution followed the normal distribution normality testing aims to test whether the observed values were taken in the population following the normal distribution the normality test was conducted to determine whether the data collected from the population can represent the whole group because data of the whole group could not be acquired when the probability density function f x of the continuous probability variable x is given as expression 2 the distribution of this x is called a normal distribution 2 f x 1 2 π σ e x m 2 2 σ 2 x where f x is the probability density function of x x is the probability m is the average of x and σ 2 denotes variance the normality test method uses the shapiro wilk test method iii the pscr mean values obtained at a distance of 1 nm for each encounter bearing angle were compared to estimate the mcrba 3 2 study b mfcba determination from collision accident written verdicts 3 2 1 collision bearing angle data collection and analysis study b was conducted to determine the mfcba values by analyzing the actual ship collision accidents that occurred in korean waters to obtain the collision bearing angle data 200 collision cases 400 colliding ships which fitted the research scope covering the collision accidents that occurred between 2002 and 2017 were selected as a sample group and used to build a quantification database the collision cases between the merchant ship merchant ship merchant ship fishing vessel and ferry fishing vessel were selected that is either the give way vessel or the stand on vessel was selected to include the merchant ship the collision cases were also selected as encounters of two ships with no traffic density and in fair weather conditions which was similar to the actual ship experiment at sea in most cases no communication occurred between the two ships before the collision if either the give way or stand on vessel had a weight of over 300 tons of merchant ship it was included in the database appendix f supplementary material shows the data on the ship collision cases of 200 cases 400 vessels based on the give way vessels fig 5 shows the classification criteria used for collecting the collision bearing angle data the range of the collision bearing angle was set to 22 5 at encounter bearing angles of 000 045 and 090 this was set such that it would be from 112 5 to 135 in the case of 135 here 000 22 5 is represented by s1 situation 1 045 22 5 is represented by s2 090 22 5 is represented by s3 and 112 5 135 is represented by s4 this classification method was used because actual collision cases rarely occurred at exactly the same bearing angles as the four encounter situations 000 045 090 135 of the actual maritime ship experiments 4 results 4 1 study a 4 1 1 pscr values table 3 lists the mean values and standard deviations in parentheses of the pscr magnitudes measured during the ship encounter experiments appendix g supplementary material shows the raw data obtained from the so the values exhibited an increasing trend as the distance between the ships decreased from the first encounter distance of 3 nm the pscr values were evaluated as follows according to the pscr judgment criteria in table 2 if actions aimed at avoiding collision must be performed for distances between 1 25 nm and 1 nm special measures e g communicating with the other ship must be taken in addition avoidance navigation is required for distances between 1 nm and 0 75 nm at 0 25 nm distance s2 s3 and s4 had pscr values of 91 or more which was collision imminent and required immediate avoidance action in table 3 no significant differences are observed in all encounter situations at distances above 1 25 nm however different increasing patterns are exhibited after that point the highest pscr values were obtained for s4 the s2 magnitudes were slightly higher than the s3 ones and the s1 values were the lowest compared to those determined in the other encounter situations 4 1 2 reliability analysis and normality test the reliability analysis targets consisted of the pscr data obtained in each encounter situation at 12 distances the resulting cronbach s α values were 0 927 for s1 0 965 for s2 0 958 for s3 and 0 955 for s4 the reliability of the measurements was considered high when cronbach s α was 0 6 or greater roh 2014 hence the obtained pscr magnitudes were reliable a normality test was conducted to determine whether the data obtained for a sample could represent the entire population table 4 presents the results of the normality testing of the pscr data the null hypothesis here is as follows the data follow the regular distribution the alternative hypothesis is the data do not follow the normal distribution ghasemi and zahediasl 2012 and razali and wah 2011 if the p value is smaller p 0 05 than the alpha level α 0 05 it rejects the null hypothesis and adopts the alternative hypothesis if the p value is greater than the alpha level p 0 05 it rejects the alternative hypothesis and adopts the null hypothesis the p values determined for each encounter situation were higher than the significance level α 0 05 confirming that all situations followed the normal distribution twelve distance sections up to 3 nm 0 25 nm for each encounter situations cannot be presented therefore the representative reference distance was set at 1 nm and the analysis result was shown in particular in nine of the collision case analysis results the encounter situation was changed when the oss and tss were close to 0 5 nm or more because the navigator suddenly altered course to avoid collision for this reason the distance standard of 1 nm was set the normality test of table 3 also showed effective results at other distances e g 0 5 nm and 1 5 nm 4 1 3 mcrba derivation fig 6 compares the mean pscr values obtained in different encounter situations at a distance range of 1 0 0 25 nm the horizontal axis represents the four encounter situations while the vertical axis denotes the mean pscr values the highest mean pscr values were in s4 135 followed by s2 045 s3 090 and s1 000 which was common in each encounter situation therefore the angle of 135 obtained in s4 was equal to the mcrba 4 1 4 determination of the distance corresponding to the maximum collision risk among the characteristics of the pscr measurements the distance corresponding to the largest difference between the mean pscr values dldmp was determined to estimate the dcrbis in table 3 the pscr demonstrated a tendency to increase as the distance decreased the case with the interval between 1 25 and 1 nm exhibited the largest differences in the mean values compared to those of the other intervals fig 7 illustrates the dldmp identification result the y axis label indicates the difference in the mean values of the pscr for each distance section of the x axis in the plots of the mean pscr values versus distance the distance intervals corresponding to the largest deviations of the mean values were analyzed the difference value of the pscr averaged by the distance section in the distance section of 1 nm distance between two experimental vessels was the largest 10 3 for s1 14 5 for s2 13 1 for s3 and 15 3 for s4 when compared to the other distance sections in addition s4 involved the point with the highest pscr value therefore the dldmp corresponding to the dcrbis was identified as 1 25 1 nm 4 2 results of study b mfcba derivation through collision accident data analysis 4 2 1 mfcba derivation the mfcba was determined by collecting and analyzing the collision bearing data obtained for a sample group of 200 give way vessels 200 cases among the actual collision accidents covered by the collision accident written verdict fig 8 illustrates the results of the frequency analysis conducted for 200 collision ships of the give way vessel in four different collision encounter situations the distance criterion was 1 nm for all cases the collision bearing of 67 ships at a distance of 1 nm was s4 112 5 135 with the maximum frequency thus s4 exhibited the maximum frequency at a distance of 1 nm therefore the mfcba corresponded to s4 the distribution characteristics of the sample group were as follows 134 merchant ships 67 0 nine ferries 4 5 and 57 fishing boats 28 5 were give way vessels while 89 merchant ships 44 5 18 ferries 9 0 and 93 fishing boats 46 5 were stand on vessels 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of the results of studies a and b mcrba verification the mcrba derived from the results of the ship encounter experiments conducted in study a was compared with the mfcba obtained in study b by examining the collision accident records fig 9 shows the mean pscr values distance of 1 nm obtained in different encounter situations a and results of the collision bearing frequency analysis conducted at a distance of 1 nm b in the collision cases of study b no changes in the encounter bearing were observed for the two ships at a distance of 3 1 nm however in nine collision cases course altering was performed by the oows of the give way vessel at closer distances within a 0 5 nm distance to avoid collisions the encounter situation should be based on the course before the rapid alter course of the close distance therefore the distance of 1 nm was adopted as the analysis criterion based on the results of studies a and b in fig 9 a the numbers represent the mean pscr values the highest pscr value was observed for s4 in fig 9 b the numbers represent the collision occurrence frequencies numbers of ships similar to fig 9 a the highest pscr value was also obtained for s4 a comparison of fig 9 a and b revealed that both the mean pscr and the collision frequency values ranked in the order of s4 s2 s3 s1 these results were compared with the results of the ship maneuvering simulator experiments conducted by inoue 2000 inoue suggested that the oows experienced the highest degree of difficulty during navigation at a bearing angle of 135 which is identical to the mcrba magnitude determined herein however he also reported that this degree of difficulty could be ranked in the order of s4 s3 s2 s1 which was different from the result obtained in this study s4 s2 s3 s1 while the orders of s2 and s3 were different the lowest degree of difficulty was obtained for s1 in both cases 5 2 review of the determined mcrba and dcrbis the results of studies a and b were verified as outlined below first the results were reviewed from an encounter bearing angle perspective the participants perceived the highest pscr at a relative bearing angle of 135 figs 6 and 9 a in all encounter situations the pscr slowly increased as the distance between the ships decreased however it began increasing at a higher rate at distance of 1 25 1 nm fig 7 5 2 1 review of the determined mcrba the largest mean pscr value s4 fig 6 was reviewed for the following reasons i according to the navigation law of colregs the os corresponds to the give way vessel and must avoid the path of the stand on vessel by altering its course however at a relative bearing of 135 the os has less room to avoid the ts than those in the encounter situations of 000 045 and 090 therefore avoiding the ts by altering the course toward the starboard side is considerably difficult which apparently increases the pscr value ii a relative bearing of 135 is highly likely to cause a collision accident because the oows may mistakenly judge that the ts is navigating in tandem with the os or that the ts is passing the os in a situation in which the ts is mistakenly judged to be passing the ts becomes the give way vessel and the os becomes the stand on vessel according to colregs rule 13 if the ts with a higher speed is passing the os as a result the oows of the os experience the highest pscr because the os is the stand on vessel according to the navigation law but they cannot easily judge whether the ts approaching from the rear starboard side is in a crossing or passing situation therefore the collision risks are the highest in this case because of the associated anxiety many collision cases supporting this conclusion were described in the results of a ship collision accident analysis performed by kmst 2017 ten maritime pilots from gun san and pyeongtaek ports who were selected as an expert group agreed with this opinion as regards the case of collision in the 135 encounter situation the busan kmst written verdict 2012 no 2012 042 reads as follows a collision occurred while two ships approached each other in a crossing state because the give way vessel was mistakenly judged to be navigating in tandem with the ts and the path of the ts could not be avoided earlier with sufficient room furthermore szlapczynski et al 2018 introduced a method for determining the action distances in give way situations when the os should perform a specified maneuver the method used a ship domain and related parameters as criteria for detecting potential close quarters situations the simulations covered the full spectrum of typical give way encounters for a range of circumstances head on crossing and overtaking the simulation results showed that when a stand on target ship is rapidly approaching from behind the traverse crossing may be one of the most dangerous encounter situations this is consistent with the experimental results obtained in this study where mcrba was derived as s4 similar to the way by which the results were obtained in the present study inoue calculated stress values using stress ranking data obtained from surveys of mariners regarding typical encounter situations such as head on 000 crossing 045 090 135 overtaking and being overtaken when other ships are present in the vicinity and there is a danger of collision with other ships according to the ship s direction of sail the mariner is put under stress the degree of difficulty handled by the ship becomes greatest in the case of the ship being overtaken from the rear quarter with the mariner s stress reaching levels three times that in a head on situation the mariner s stress level increases when another ship overtakes with a narrow clearance particularly when the difference in speed between the two ships is minimal 5 2 2 review of the determined dcrbis the obtained results were reviewed from the perspectives of the distance between the os and tss i as shown in fig 7 the largest differences in the mean pscr value are observed at a distance of 1 25 1 nm this effect was even more pronounced at an angle of 135 ii within a distance of 1 25 1 nm as the ships both ships with a length of 90 m and a speed of 10 kt approach each other they are less likely to avoid each other if the oows cannot perform collision avoidance actions at the right time the ships have high probability of colliding with each other therefore 1 25 1 nm is an important distance from a collision prevention perspective in other words at 135 for navigational safety the path of the ts must be possibly avoided before the distance reaches 1 25 1 nm according to the results of the ship collision case analysis the probability of collision is very high even if the course of the os is changed to avoid collision at distance of less than 1 25 1 nm according to the experimental results this distance can be expressed as a limit distance for collision avoidance by the navigator in the case of a 90 m ship sailing at a speed of 10 kt therefore the initial action distance for ts avoidance should be greater than 1 25 1 nm in the case of converting crossing dcrbis was derived from pscr values that were subjectively perceived by 30 navigators under certain experimental conditions and the close encounter conditions addressed in this study these will vary according to the relative velocity and also in the case of unfavorable weather conditions in a similar study 192 ship operators third mates or higher including the captain were surveyed and the highest response rate was found for 1 0 nm 67 of respondents of the subjective minimum safety passing distance which was required for securing safe passage of os in encounter situations with ts moreover most respondents stated that the initial action distance for ts avoidance was 3 0 nm for converting crossing lee et al 2014 the ship collision and grounding model was initially proposed by macduff 1974 based on this model the collision probability can be estimated by two independent probabilities geometrical probability which depends on the geometric parameters of the water area vessel size traffic volume vessel speed over ground sog course over ground cog etc and causation probability which is determined by the mariners operational skills and the vessel s maneuverability under accident scenarios as such ship speed is important for the parameters that influence the probability of a collision but in this experiment the simulated speed was limited to 10 kt the dcrbis would be affected by the speed at which ts approaches os when two vessels approach each other the pscr of oow will be affected by the relative speed of the os and ts that is as the speed of ts increases the pscr of oow will increase to a greater degree especially in the s4 situation relative to other encounter situations according to inoue 2000 as the passage becomes narrower and the ship speed increases the stress imposed on the mariner also increases 5 2 3 review of the impact of visual observation on experimental results in the present study experiments with actual ships were performed in normal seafaring situations in which visual monitoring is essential to prevent collisions with 30 navigators measuring their pscrs while watching the ts from the bridge of the os when the os and ts are approaching each other at a constant speed although navigators can recognize the presence of ts from a great distance through the arpa function of the radar and ais signal they usually confirm it using the naked eye or binoculars to clearly identify ts therefore this experiment addressed scenarios experienced by navigators every day during a voyage however it should be noted that ts monitoring using only the visual observations of the navigator can be greatly influenced by the size of ts this may result in smaller tss being perceived as being a lesser threat even if they are rapidly approaching however observations made using ais and arpa displays are less affected by the actual ship size therefore in addition to observations using the naked eye it would be effective for navigators to use the available navigational equipment such as the ais and arpa functions to prevent collisions 5 3 limitations and future work this study had the following limitations first there were limitations regarding the safety of participating vessels when experimenting with various situations therefore four typical encounter situations were selected to perform measurement experiments as described in section 3 1 2 experimental scenarios additionally the identified mcrba and dcrbis are the results obtained under conditions using a ship length of 90 m and a speed of 10 kt as shown in table 1 second experiments were conducted in a controlled test environment to prevent accidents and collisions moreover actual merchant ships were not used because of the enormous costs involved and the risk of actual collisions third in the merchant ship there is typically one oow who is on duty however in this experiment 30 officers participated in the experiment simultaneously and were assumed to be oows this was done to obtain measurement data simultaneously from several participants in the same situation fourth the collision cases were also selected as encounters of two ships with no traffic density and in fair weather conditions which was similar to the actual ship experiment at sea section 3 2 1 nevertheless the comparison of the actual ship testing and collision case analysis has limitations that cannot be precisely matched owing to situational differences such as ship size weather conditions maneuverability and traffic density furthermore in the actual ship experiment the stand on vessel used a single type of ship however the analysis of the accident cases included not only merchant ships but also passenger ships and fishing vessels this was done to study as many collision bearing frequencies as possible these limitations are challenges that need to be overcome for more precise measurements in the future 6 conclusions the main reasons for ship collisions include human errors made by ship operators navigating ships however many previous studies have excluded ship operators as the possible causes of ship collisions this study aimed to measure the collision risks of ship operators for navigation safety from the perspective of human errors considering the importance of human elements in other words the pscrs perceived by the ship operators were determined and analyzed by conducting ship experiments in an actual marine environment as a result both the mcrba and the dcrbis were identified study a in addition the data obtained for 200 ship collision cases caused by human error were selected as a sample group based on the ship collision accident written verdict and its mfcba was determined study b the following conclusions were derived by examining the results of both studies 1 the mcrba perceived by ship operators by performing a ship encounter experiment corresponded to a relative bearing angle of 135 which was confirmed by the frequency analysis of the collision bearing angles obtained for 200 collision cases that produced a value of 112 5 135 therefore ship operators must be aware of the maximum collision risk bearing angle while they are on duty collision prevention will be possible if they are aware that the probabilities of human errors and collisions increase at the verified mcrba and if they take appropriate collision avoidance actions e g alter course earlier 2 the pscr increased most dramatically at a relative bearing angle of 135 and distance of 1 25 1 nm therefore it is necessary for the navigator consider collision avoidance measures from a sufficiently long distance before the distance between the two vessels becomes 1 nm or lower to prevent collision in summary ship operators must be aware of the mcrba and the dcrbis for collision prevention which is the ultimate purpose of this study these identified risk factors are of high importance for preventing ship collisions the results of this study are expected to help prevent ship collision in the maritime transportation field however as limitations the ship encounter experiment for the pscr measurement by the officer is different from the actual merchant ship collision situation in that it was performed in a controlled test environment to prevent accidents and collisions that may occur during the maritime experiment in future studies the effects of the on board career of the ship operators license grades of mariners and their ages on the pscr will be considered to better identify possible human errors during seafaring funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public

22021,this study aims to elucidate the possible risk factors considering the point of view of a ship operator by identifying the maximum collision risk bearing angle mcrba and the distance at which the collision risk begins to increase significantly dcrbis which are key factors affecting navigation safety in real maritime environments using two ships at sea in various vessel encounter situations relative bearing angles of 000 045 090 and 135 the perceived ship collision risk pscr was estimated by the ship operators then the mean values of all the measured parameters were used to identify the bearing angle corresponding to the highest pscr the mcrba was compared to the maximum frequency collision bearing angle mfcba derived by investigating 200 reported ship collision cases in korean waters the highest experimental pscr values were observed at a relative bearing angle of 135 which corresponded to the results of collision case analyses stating that the mfcba was equal to 112 5 135 notably the pscr magnitude increased most significantly at a distance of 1 25 1 nm in experiments involving various vessel encounter situations collision risk factors such as the mcrba and dcrbis can

to ship collision accidents can lead to human and property losses as well as marine pollution they can occur owing to external factors such as inclement weather at sea and excessive navigation speed however the human factor must also be considered previous studies have reported that many collisions have been caused owing to errors of the ship operators so i e the persons navigating these ships hetherington et al 2006 kim 2017 rothblum 2000 therefore it is critical to design measures for the so to prevent collisions in an encounter situation with the target ship ts marine accidents such as ship collisions are not caused by any one element but by a combination of various elements forming an accident chain from the cause of the accident to the result rothblum 2000 van dorp et al 2001 suggested five steps of accident chains namely hazard peril risk consequence and impact marine accidents can be prevented if we can restrict or block the accident chain at any of these steps this study was conducted after recognizing the importance of breaking the accident chain by the navigator at the hazard peril and risk levels the collision risk perceived by the so during the encounter with the ts at sea is determined by various factors but the encounter bearing angle and distance are also important in this study in addition to the ship s speed and the complicated situation in the ship to ship encounter situation only the relative bearing and distance factors were studied the first parameter corresponding to the highest collision risk is defined as the maximum collision risk bearing angle mcrba the second parameter is the distance at which the collision risk begins to increase significantly dcrbis these two parameters must be considered together the mcrba and dcrbis are parameters describing the relative bearing angle and distance respectively the mcrba is the bearing angle in which the so perceives the highest collision risk in the encounter situation with tss navigators should consider the mcrba in the encounter situations and pay more attention than usual to prevent collisions through a careful look out of the ts s course and speed this is required to quickly escape from such encounter bearing angles if possible the so must operate the own ship os more carefully than usual at the dcrbis if the os is in the situation of the mcrba and the dcrbis it is more likely to lead to a collision compared to other scenarios hence the os must consider early avoidance actions to prevent collision ship collision can be actively prevented through effective avoidance measures that can be performed by the so in risk situations this study aims to determine the mcrba and the dcrbis which can be useful collision risk factor descriptors to navigators by measuring the perceived collision risk on the collision course that sos judge as a collision risk level if navigators are aware of the mcrba and dcrbis they can take measures to avoid collision at the right time during a close quarters situation therefore it is important to accurately determine the mcrba and dcrbis to achieve this objective while also considering the limitations of previous studies a collision risk measurement experiment was designed in which the so sees and perceives the ts in various encounter situations such as head on or crossing to identify the causes of collision related to the human factors of the so here the perceived ship collision risk pscr of the so means recording the perceived psychological level of the collision risk in the range of 1 100 values as the distance from the ts is gradually decreased by the encounter situation here perception refers to a process that includes all steps from detecting the existence of an object to its clear identification bernstein 2010 the collision risk felt by the officer on watch oow is especially high when the ship is in the position of a give way vessel according to the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs and has a legal obligation to perform collision avoidance navigation for a stand on vessel imo 2003 in identifying the mcrba and the dcrbis one method can be used which is specifically to measure the pscr of the ship operator by conducting a marine encounter experiment using two vessels however this task is difficult to accomplish in practice using large ships because of the possible collision risks and involved expenses therefore ais data simulators or surveys are typically utilized in most studies in the meantime various methods have been presented to study ship collision risk for example lin 2006 used a simulation experiment and a questionnaire to assess the evasive actions of the watch officer the environmental stress model developed by inoue 2000 considered the difficulty in ship navigation experienced by oows in encounter situations because of the influence of other ships in the study a simulator and a survey were used to obtain the stress values of oows in each encounter bearing however this research method had limitations in accurately identifying the difficulty in ship navigation experienced by the experiment participants because actual ship experiments were not performed for this purpose yim et al 2018 developed a multiple linear regression model to experimentally study risk perception on a ship in various collision encounter situations however no comparison of the experimental results with the existing collision accident records was performed as an example of the research related to ship operators wang 2012 modeled the shape index k as a fuzzy system that inputs proficiency and the navigator s physical and mental states to effectively consider the effect of the navigator s condition on the ship domain chin and debnath 2009 modeled the collision risk perceived during coastal navigation using information from surveys answered by maritime pilots silveira et al 2013 calculated the probability of ship collision from ais data much research has been conducted on ship collision risk measurement or assessment for example goerlandt et al 2015 presented a comprehensive rule based expert system with fuzzy inference in which the knowledge domain was defined through consultation eliciting knowledge using interviews and questionnaires lopez santander and lawry 2017 proposed a non linear model for risk estimation attempting to capture mariners judgement questionnaire data that captured and quantified mariners judgements of risk for craft in the vicinity were collected with each vessel being described using measurements that can be obtained easily from the data already present in the ship s navigational equipment the ship domain is a well known concept defined by goodwin 1975 as the surrounding effective water in which the navigator of a ship wants to keep clear of other ships or fixed objects szlapczynski et al 2018 carried out simulation experiments based on ship maneuverability data in a study of the ship domain to determine the distances required for collision avoidance maneuvers in give way situations however in studies on ship collisions using simulators the participants experienced less psychological pressure than that in real scenarios because the modeled scenarios were virtual to overcome this limitation first the mcrba and dcrbis were determined in this study by performing encounter situation experiments involving two actual ships korea coast guard large vessels and measuring the ship collision risks related to human errors next the ship collision cases obtained from the korea maritime safety tribunal kmst were analyzed and the maximum frequency collision bearing angle mfcba was determined the mcrba and dcrbis were verified by comparing these results 2 conceptual basis 2 1 relationship between increase in pscr value and ship collision the increases in the pscr value and ship collisions are closely related according to ross 1975 humans perceive risks when dangerous scenarios occur or are likely to occur here risk refers to the possibility of loss damage injury or any other adverse unwelcome circumstance a chance or situation involving such possibilities aven 2012 the navigators who operate ships also recognize this risk when collision risk scenarios occur with ships encountering each other at different bearing angles and distances the navigator performs a series of actions to avoid collision in this instance they perceive collision risks these risks can be instantly converted into the burden of avoidance navigation acute stress when the ship becomes a give way vessel in an encounter with a stand on vessel approaching from the starboard direction for crossing colregs 1972 in relation to this acute stress the navigator is under stress on a daily basis to avoid various close encounters with tss here the typical encounter situation is a head on and crossing situation as an exception the navigator may undergo acute stress in a stand on vessel when the ts which is give way vessel does not perform a collision avoidance action here stress is defined as the feeling of anxiety and threat when a person is in a scenario that is difficult to cope with psychologically or physically lazarus 1993 according to hetherington et al 2006 stress is one of the main causes of human errors when humans are under stress it affects their brain and heart resulting in various symptoms the effects of stress on the brain include hypersensitivity and degraded concentration in severe cases panic disorder or other panic phenomena may occur the blood pressure and heart rate increase when the heart is affected mental health america 2018 in particular acute stress that is instantaneously generated in the navigator of the give way vessel in an encounter with ts may cause human errors such as mistakes in performing collision avoidance actions in this regard positive correlations were found between reported stress and error and stress and violations westerman and haigney 2000 while driving a car if we meet another car driving on the wrong side of a motorway all of us would probably be stressed acute stress is the kind of stress someone experiences when encountering a difficult scenario a crisis an emergency situation or an acute situation the human error failure to perform prescribed actions induced in this manner can be a cause for ship collision with regard to this point various studies about human reliability analysis which shows the linkage between human error and accident have been conducted bot 2004 gould et al 2012 hashimoto et al 2015 straeter 2004 2 2 mcrba fig 1 shows the danger zone related to the collision risk i colregs 1972 rule 15 is a navigation rule applied in the event of a crossing encounter between two ships it stipulates that the ship that has another ship on its starboard side must avoid the path of that ship and not cross its bow as long as the situation allows ii assuming that the ship is subject to colregs 1972 rule 16 for the give way vessel the latter must alter its course to avoid a collision with an approaching stand on vessel as a result the navigator of the give way vessel feels the burden of avoidance navigation in such encounter situations the probability of collision increases if the navigator of the give way vessel makes human errors or if the stand on vessel does not cooperate with the give way vessel performing avoidance navigation the bearing angles of such scenarios range from 000 to 135 in the starboard direction fig 1 which is within the range of the collision risk bearing angle crba the mcrba is the bearing angle at which the oow perceives the highest ship collision risk the possibility of collision is the highest at the mcrba hence which relative bearing angle corresponds to the mcrba in ship encounter situations must be determined the setting range of the crba is limited to a relative bearing angle of 180 toward the starboard side based on the heading direction of the give way vessel 3 methods the experimental work was divided into studies a and b which were conducted according to the procedures described in fig 2 i in study a encounter situation experiments were performed at sea using actual vessels to measure the pscr of the so and the mcrba and the collision risk distance were estimated by statistically analyzing the obtained pscr data ii in study b the mfcba was determined by examining the actual collision accident cases and collecting and analyzing the collision bearing angles of a selected sample group iii the obtained mcrba and dcrbis were verified by comparing the results of studies a and b 3 1 study a pscr measurement experiment for determining the mcrba to measure the pscr value two ships were classified as the os and the ts actual ship experiments were then designed assuming a situation in which the os encounters the ts in a semicircle on the starboard side the nm was used as the distance measurement unit and speed was measured in knots thus the results of all experiments herein are expressed in nm and knots kt accordingly 1 nm is 1852 m and 1 knot refers to a speed of 1 nm per hour 1852 m 3600 s 3 1 1 experimental ships and participants two large patrol ships were provided by the korea coast guard ships with similar lengths and tonnages were selected to minimize experimental errors using merchant ships in the experiments was practically difficult because of the massive economic costs and collision risks in contrast the patrol ships could safely participate in encounter scenarios because of their well trained personnel and the presence of marine police officers with good navigation experience on board table 1 shows the characteristics of the vessels participating in the experiment the os had a length of 90 m and a gross tonnage of 1600 while the ts had a length of 91 m and a gross tonnage of 1500 the basic speed was set to 10 0 kt in the case of s4 the ts was 15 0 kt for both ships in accordance with the usual speed of coastal vessels appendix a supplementary material shows the ts used in the experiments the os has the same appearance appendix b supplementary material shows the maneuvering characteristics of the experimental ships the experimental participants were 30 coast guard officers on board the os the captain was in charge of maneuvering the os and the bridge team was divided into a group of 30 participants and a ship control group consisting of six officers the experimental participants group was asked to only measure their pscrs by monitoring their ts at the bridge in each encounter situation and the ship control group carried out the vessel maneuvering task without participating in the measurement experiment before the experiment each participant was instructed to assume that they were the oows in charge of safety of the seafaring vessels appendix c supplementary material shows the demographic characteristics of the participants their ages experience and qualifications are summarized as follows the average age of the participants was 38 27 with a standard deviation of 9 79 with 56 7 of them in their 20s or 30s and 43 3 in their 40s 50s or 60s 3 1 2 experimental scenarios four ship encounter situations for the pscr measurements were set up at four different bearing angles assuming that the ts approaches the os from the starboard direction appendix d supplementary material shows the four ship encounter scenarios according to colregs 1972 the navigation rules for ships state that the os has the position of the give way vessel in encounter situations s2 s4 s denotes situation because the ts is located in its starboard direction rule 16 therefore the os must alter its course toward the starboard side to avoid the path of the ts s1 is the head on situation in which both ships must alter their courses toward their respective starboard sides the pscr measurement distance was varied from 3 nm to 0 25 nm for the reasons stated below according to the ts perception distance analysis of the kmst collision accident written verdict where the perception distance is the distance from the os to the ts when the oow of the os first perceived the existence of the ts during seafaring accidents that occurred within a perception distance of 5 nm accounted for 88 5 of 625 collision accidents while those that occurred within 2 nm represented 66 3 kmst 2017 of all accidents in addition according to colregs 1972 article 22 visibility distance of light the minimum visibility of the side and stern lights of a ship longer than 50 m must be 3 nm hence measurements must be performed at distances equal to or longer than 3 nm in this study the initial measurement distance was set to 3 nm at which the ts could be clearly perceived by the naked eye furthermore the experiments were terminated at a distance of 0 25 nm and avoidance maneuvers were performed to prevent ship collision at that distance in the four experimental scenarios of s1 to s4 the shortest distance between both ships was set to 0 25 nm this is because the two ships were evaluated to safely avoid collision in a pre evasive maneuver test that was conducted at a speed of 10 kt before the pscr measurement experiment appendix e supplementary material shows a typical procedure performed in the s3 090 encounter situation between os left side and tss right side the os navigated at 000 speed 10 kt while the ts approached at a speed of 10 kt and a relative bearing angle of 090 the participants pscr measurement experiments began at the point where the distance between the two vessels was 3 nm these measurements were taken at decrements of 0 25 nm in ship to ship distance as the two experimental ships approached each other the experiments were terminated at a final distance of 0 25 nm from the anticipated collision point for the safety of the ships 3 1 3 pscr judgment criteria table 2 lists various judgment criteria for conducting the pscr measurements chin and debnath 2009 and inoue 2000 the participants were instructed to record the collision risks perceived while watching the approaching ts with their naked eyes on a scale of 0 100 by using separate sheets 3 1 4 ship encounter experimental procedure as shown in fig 3 the encounter experiments were performed using the two large korea coast guard patrol vessels located 10 nm southwest from gasa island near mokpo south korea in accordance with the described experimental scenarios at 12 o clock the weather was favorable for the experiments with a southeasterly wind at a speed of 6 8 m s a wave height of 1 1 25 m and visibility was more than 3 nm the encounter situations were realized in the order of s1 s2 s3 and s4 in accordance with the experimental scenarios the experimental procedure is described in detail below i step 1 movement to the experimental positions and control the two patrol ships moved from the mokpo port to the experimental area the participants on the os were informed of the judgment criteria for the pscr measurements in addition prior consent regarding the collision risk measurements was received from all participants because of the nature of the experiments furthermore the courses and speeds of both ships were controlled for safety ii step 2 encounter situation experiments the measurements started with s1 the os and tss began maneuvering at 10 kt and simultaneously headed toward the anticipated collision point the os periodically monitored the distance between the ships and the bearing angle using an electronic navigation chart with superimposed radar images to control the courses and speeds of the ships such that the predesigned encounter situations could be realized the 30 participants in the experiment who were on the bridge wheelhouse of the ship were requested not to talk during the experiment each person was asked to record their pscr values on the record paper only looking at the approach of the forward ts in addition communication between the participating vessels was made only when necessary for the safety of navigation between the ship control groups and not the experiment participants monitoring of distance and encounter situations was announced aloud by the radar operating personnel who did not participate in this test hence the participants could recognize each situation each participant was instructed to assume that they were the oows in charge of the safety of seafaring iii step 3 measurements of the pscr values the pscr values were simultaneously recorded on separate sheets by 30 participating marine police officers at 12 measurement positions located at every 0 25 nm from the point with a distance of 3 nm while watching the approaching ts from the window in front of the bridge of the os fig 4 the experiment took approximately 30 min for each situation the total time was approximately 3 h including the time it took for the ship to be located in the appropriate position and prepare for the maneuvering experiment in the interview after the experiment the participants answered that they barely acknowledged the possibility of biases because of the repeated measurement 3 1 5 data analysis statistical analysis of the measured pscr data was performed using the spss v 21 software 2011 at a significance level of 0 05 i reliability analysis was conducted to find out the reliability of the measurement data reliability refers to the degree to which repeated measurements of the same object provide the same results cronbach s alpha is the most commonly used method and is highly reliable if it is equal to equation 1 and 0 6 or higher 1 α n n 1 1 σ i 2 σ t 2 where n is the number of questions σ t 2 is the total variance and σ i 2 is the variance of each item ii normality was tested to determine whether the population distribution followed the normal distribution normality testing aims to test whether the observed values were taken in the population following the normal distribution the normality test was conducted to determine whether the data collected from the population can represent the whole group because data of the whole group could not be acquired when the probability density function f x of the continuous probability variable x is given as expression 2 the distribution of this x is called a normal distribution 2 f x 1 2 π σ e x m 2 2 σ 2 x where f x is the probability density function of x x is the probability m is the average of x and σ 2 denotes variance the normality test method uses the shapiro wilk test method iii the pscr mean values obtained at a distance of 1 nm for each encounter bearing angle were compared to estimate the mcrba 3 2 study b mfcba determination from collision accident written verdicts 3 2 1 collision bearing angle data collection and analysis study b was conducted to determine the mfcba values by analyzing the actual ship collision accidents that occurred in korean waters to obtain the collision bearing angle data 200 collision cases 400 colliding ships which fitted the research scope covering the collision accidents that occurred between 2002 and 2017 were selected as a sample group and used to build a quantification database the collision cases between the merchant ship merchant ship merchant ship fishing vessel and ferry fishing vessel were selected that is either the give way vessel or the stand on vessel was selected to include the merchant ship the collision cases were also selected as encounters of two ships with no traffic density and in fair weather conditions which was similar to the actual ship experiment at sea in most cases no communication occurred between the two ships before the collision if either the give way or stand on vessel had a weight of over 300 tons of merchant ship it was included in the database appendix f supplementary material shows the data on the ship collision cases of 200 cases 400 vessels based on the give way vessels fig 5 shows the classification criteria used for collecting the collision bearing angle data the range of the collision bearing angle was set to 22 5 at encounter bearing angles of 000 045 and 090 this was set such that it would be from 112 5 to 135 in the case of 135 here 000 22 5 is represented by s1 situation 1 045 22 5 is represented by s2 090 22 5 is represented by s3 and 112 5 135 is represented by s4 this classification method was used because actual collision cases rarely occurred at exactly the same bearing angles as the four encounter situations 000 045 090 135 of the actual maritime ship experiments 4 results 4 1 study a 4 1 1 pscr values table 3 lists the mean values and standard deviations in parentheses of the pscr magnitudes measured during the ship encounter experiments appendix g supplementary material shows the raw data obtained from the so the values exhibited an increasing trend as the distance between the ships decreased from the first encounter distance of 3 nm the pscr values were evaluated as follows according to the pscr judgment criteria in table 2 if actions aimed at avoiding collision must be performed for distances between 1 25 nm and 1 nm special measures e g communicating with the other ship must be taken in addition avoidance navigation is required for distances between 1 nm and 0 75 nm at 0 25 nm distance s2 s3 and s4 had pscr values of 91 or more which was collision imminent and required immediate avoidance action in table 3 no significant differences are observed in all encounter situations at distances above 1 25 nm however different increasing patterns are exhibited after that point the highest pscr values were obtained for s4 the s2 magnitudes were slightly higher than the s3 ones and the s1 values were the lowest compared to those determined in the other encounter situations 4 1 2 reliability analysis and normality test the reliability analysis targets consisted of the pscr data obtained in each encounter situation at 12 distances the resulting cronbach s α values were 0 927 for s1 0 965 for s2 0 958 for s3 and 0 955 for s4 the reliability of the measurements was considered high when cronbach s α was 0 6 or greater roh 2014 hence the obtained pscr magnitudes were reliable a normality test was conducted to determine whether the data obtained for a sample could represent the entire population table 4 presents the results of the normality testing of the pscr data the null hypothesis here is as follows the data follow the regular distribution the alternative hypothesis is the data do not follow the normal distribution ghasemi and zahediasl 2012 and razali and wah 2011 if the p value is smaller p 0 05 than the alpha level α 0 05 it rejects the null hypothesis and adopts the alternative hypothesis if the p value is greater than the alpha level p 0 05 it rejects the alternative hypothesis and adopts the null hypothesis the p values determined for each encounter situation were higher than the significance level α 0 05 confirming that all situations followed the normal distribution twelve distance sections up to 3 nm 0 25 nm for each encounter situations cannot be presented therefore the representative reference distance was set at 1 nm and the analysis result was shown in particular in nine of the collision case analysis results the encounter situation was changed when the oss and tss were close to 0 5 nm or more because the navigator suddenly altered course to avoid collision for this reason the distance standard of 1 nm was set the normality test of table 3 also showed effective results at other distances e g 0 5 nm and 1 5 nm 4 1 3 mcrba derivation fig 6 compares the mean pscr values obtained in different encounter situations at a distance range of 1 0 0 25 nm the horizontal axis represents the four encounter situations while the vertical axis denotes the mean pscr values the highest mean pscr values were in s4 135 followed by s2 045 s3 090 and s1 000 which was common in each encounter situation therefore the angle of 135 obtained in s4 was equal to the mcrba 4 1 4 determination of the distance corresponding to the maximum collision risk among the characteristics of the pscr measurements the distance corresponding to the largest difference between the mean pscr values dldmp was determined to estimate the dcrbis in table 3 the pscr demonstrated a tendency to increase as the distance decreased the case with the interval between 1 25 and 1 nm exhibited the largest differences in the mean values compared to those of the other intervals fig 7 illustrates the dldmp identification result the y axis label indicates the difference in the mean values of the pscr for each distance section of the x axis in the plots of the mean pscr values versus distance the distance intervals corresponding to the largest deviations of the mean values were analyzed the difference value of the pscr averaged by the distance section in the distance section of 1 nm distance between two experimental vessels was the largest 10 3 for s1 14 5 for s2 13 1 for s3 and 15 3 for s4 when compared to the other distance sections in addition s4 involved the point with the highest pscr value therefore the dldmp corresponding to the dcrbis was identified as 1 25 1 nm 4 2 results of study b mfcba derivation through collision accident data analysis 4 2 1 mfcba derivation the mfcba was determined by collecting and analyzing the collision bearing data obtained for a sample group of 200 give way vessels 200 cases among the actual collision accidents covered by the collision accident written verdict fig 8 illustrates the results of the frequency analysis conducted for 200 collision ships of the give way vessel in four different collision encounter situations the distance criterion was 1 nm for all cases the collision bearing of 67 ships at a distance of 1 nm was s4 112 5 135 with the maximum frequency thus s4 exhibited the maximum frequency at a distance of 1 nm therefore the mfcba corresponded to s4 the distribution characteristics of the sample group were as follows 134 merchant ships 67 0 nine ferries 4 5 and 57 fishing boats 28 5 were give way vessels while 89 merchant ships 44 5 18 ferries 9 0 and 93 fishing boats 46 5 were stand on vessels 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of the results of studies a and b mcrba verification the mcrba derived from the results of the ship encounter experiments conducted in study a was compared with the mfcba obtained in study b by examining the collision accident records fig 9 shows the mean pscr values distance of 1 nm obtained in different encounter situations a and results of the collision bearing frequency analysis conducted at a distance of 1 nm b in the collision cases of study b no changes in the encounter bearing were observed for the two ships at a distance of 3 1 nm however in nine collision cases course altering was performed by the oows of the give way vessel at closer distances within a 0 5 nm distance to avoid collisions the encounter situation should be based on the course before the rapid alter course of the close distance therefore the distance of 1 nm was adopted as the analysis criterion based on the results of studies a and b in fig 9 a the numbers represent the mean pscr values the highest pscr value was observed for s4 in fig 9 b the numbers represent the collision occurrence frequencies numbers of ships similar to fig 9 a the highest pscr value was also obtained for s4 a comparison of fig 9 a and b revealed that both the mean pscr and the collision frequency values ranked in the order of s4 s2 s3 s1 these results were compared with the results of the ship maneuvering simulator experiments conducted by inoue 2000 inoue suggested that the oows experienced the highest degree of difficulty during navigation at a bearing angle of 135 which is identical to the mcrba magnitude determined herein however he also reported that this degree of difficulty could be ranked in the order of s4 s3 s2 s1 which was different from the result obtained in this study s4 s2 s3 s1 while the orders of s2 and s3 were different the lowest degree of difficulty was obtained for s1 in both cases 5 2 review of the determined mcrba and dcrbis the results of studies a and b were verified as outlined below first the results were reviewed from an encounter bearing angle perspective the participants perceived the highest pscr at a relative bearing angle of 135 figs 6 and 9 a in all encounter situations the pscr slowly increased as the distance between the ships decreased however it began increasing at a higher rate at distance of 1 25 1 nm fig 7 5 2 1 review of the determined mcrba the largest mean pscr value s4 fig 6 was reviewed for the following reasons i according to the navigation law of colregs the os corresponds to the give way vessel and must avoid the path of the stand on vessel by altering its course however at a relative bearing of 135 the os has less room to avoid the ts than those in the encounter situations of 000 045 and 090 therefore avoiding the ts by altering the course toward the starboard side is considerably difficult which apparently increases the pscr value ii a relative bearing of 135 is highly likely to cause a collision accident because the oows may mistakenly judge that the ts is navigating in tandem with the os or that the ts is passing the os in a situation in which the ts is mistakenly judged to be passing the ts becomes the give way vessel and the os becomes the stand on vessel according to colregs rule 13 if the ts with a higher speed is passing the os as a result the oows of the os experience the highest pscr because the os is the stand on vessel according to the navigation law but they cannot easily judge whether the ts approaching from the rear starboard side is in a crossing or passing situation therefore the collision risks are the highest in this case because of the associated anxiety many collision cases supporting this conclusion were described in the results of a ship collision accident analysis performed by kmst 2017 ten maritime pilots from gun san and pyeongtaek ports who were selected as an expert group agreed with this opinion as regards the case of collision in the 135 encounter situation the busan kmst written verdict 2012 no 2012 042 reads as follows a collision occurred while two ships approached each other in a crossing state because the give way vessel was mistakenly judged to be navigating in tandem with the ts and the path of the ts could not be avoided earlier with sufficient room furthermore szlapczynski et al 2018 introduced a method for determining the action distances in give way situations when the os should perform a specified maneuver the method used a ship domain and related parameters as criteria for detecting potential close quarters situations the simulations covered the full spectrum of typical give way encounters for a range of circumstances head on crossing and overtaking the simulation results showed that when a stand on target ship is rapidly approaching from behind the traverse crossing may be one of the most dangerous encounter situations this is consistent with the experimental results obtained in this study where mcrba was derived as s4 similar to the way by which the results were obtained in the present study inoue calculated stress values using stress ranking data obtained from surveys of mariners regarding typical encounter situations such as head on 000 crossing 045 090 135 overtaking and being overtaken when other ships are present in the vicinity and there is a danger of collision with other ships according to the ship s direction of sail the mariner is put under stress the degree of difficulty handled by the ship becomes greatest in the case of the ship being overtaken from the rear quarter with the mariner s stress reaching levels three times that in a head on situation the mariner s stress level increases when another ship overtakes with a narrow clearance particularly when the difference in speed between the two ships is minimal 5 2 2 review of the determined dcrbis the obtained results were reviewed from the perspectives of the distance between the os and tss i as shown in fig 7 the largest differences in the mean pscr value are observed at a distance of 1 25 1 nm this effect was even more pronounced at an angle of 135 ii within a distance of 1 25 1 nm as the ships both ships with a length of 90 m and a speed of 10 kt approach each other they are less likely to avoid each other if the oows cannot perform collision avoidance actions at the right time the ships have high probability of colliding with each other therefore 1 25 1 nm is an important distance from a collision prevention perspective in other words at 135 for navigational safety the path of the ts must be possibly avoided before the distance reaches 1 25 1 nm according to the results of the ship collision case analysis the probability of collision is very high even if the course of the os is changed to avoid collision at distance of less than 1 25 1 nm according to the experimental results this distance can be expressed as a limit distance for collision avoidance by the navigator in the case of a 90 m ship sailing at a speed of 10 kt therefore the initial action distance for ts avoidance should be greater than 1 25 1 nm in the case of converting crossing dcrbis was derived from pscr values that were subjectively perceived by 30 navigators under certain experimental conditions and the close encounter conditions addressed in this study these will vary according to the relative velocity and also in the case of unfavorable weather conditions in a similar study 192 ship operators third mates or higher including the captain were surveyed and the highest response rate was found for 1 0 nm 67 of respondents of the subjective minimum safety passing distance which was required for securing safe passage of os in encounter situations with ts moreover most respondents stated that the initial action distance for ts avoidance was 3 0 nm for converting crossing lee et al 2014 the ship collision and grounding model was initially proposed by macduff 1974 based on this model the collision probability can be estimated by two independent probabilities geometrical probability which depends on the geometric parameters of the water area vessel size traffic volume vessel speed over ground sog course over ground cog etc and causation probability which is determined by the mariners operational skills and the vessel s maneuverability under accident scenarios as such ship speed is important for the parameters that influence the probability of a collision but in this experiment the simulated speed was limited to 10 kt the dcrbis would be affected by the speed at which ts approaches os when two vessels approach each other the pscr of oow will be affected by the relative speed of the os and ts that is as the speed of ts increases the pscr of oow will increase to a greater degree especially in the s4 situation relative to other encounter situations according to inoue 2000 as the passage becomes narrower and the ship speed increases the stress imposed on the mariner also increases 5 2 3 review of the impact of visual observation on experimental results in the present study experiments with actual ships were performed in normal seafaring situations in which visual monitoring is essential to prevent collisions with 30 navigators measuring their pscrs while watching the ts from the bridge of the os when the os and ts are approaching each other at a constant speed although navigators can recognize the presence of ts from a great distance through the arpa function of the radar and ais signal they usually confirm it using the naked eye or binoculars to clearly identify ts therefore this experiment addressed scenarios experienced by navigators every day during a voyage however it should be noted that ts monitoring using only the visual observations of the navigator can be greatly influenced by the size of ts this may result in smaller tss being perceived as being a lesser threat even if they are rapidly approaching however observations made using ais and arpa displays are less affected by the actual ship size therefore in addition to observations using the naked eye it would be effective for navigators to use the available navigational equipment such as the ais and arpa functions to prevent collisions 5 3 limitations and future work this study had the following limitations first there were limitations regarding the safety of participating vessels when experimenting with various situations therefore four typical encounter situations were selected to perform measurement experiments as described in section 3 1 2 experimental scenarios additionally the identified mcrba and dcrbis are the results obtained under conditions using a ship length of 90 m and a speed of 10 kt as shown in table 1 second experiments were conducted in a controlled test environment to prevent accidents and collisions moreover actual merchant ships were not used because of the enormous costs involved and the risk of actual collisions third in the merchant ship there is typically one oow who is on duty however in this experiment 30 officers participated in the experiment simultaneously and were assumed to be oows this was done to obtain measurement data simultaneously from several participants in the same situation fourth the collision cases were also selected as encounters of two ships with no traffic density and in fair weather conditions which was similar to the actual ship experiment at sea section 3 2 1 nevertheless the comparison of the actual ship testing and collision case analysis has limitations that cannot be precisely matched owing to situational differences such as ship size weather conditions maneuverability and traffic density furthermore in the actual ship experiment the stand on vessel used a single type of ship however the analysis of the accident cases included not only merchant ships but also passenger ships and fishing vessels this was done to study as many collision bearing frequencies as possible these limitations are challenges that need to be overcome for more precise measurements in the future 6 conclusions the main reasons for ship collisions include human errors made by ship operators navigating ships however many previous studies have excluded ship operators as the possible causes of ship collisions this study aimed to measure the collision risks of ship operators for navigation safety from the perspective of human errors considering the importance of human elements in other words the pscrs perceived by the ship operators were determined and analyzed by conducting ship experiments in an actual marine environment as a result both the mcrba and the dcrbis were identified study a in addition the data obtained for 200 ship collision cases caused by human error were selected as a sample group based on the ship collision accident written verdict and its mfcba was determined study b the following conclusions were derived by examining the results of both studies 1 the mcrba perceived by ship operators by performing a ship encounter experiment corresponded to a relative bearing angle of 135 which was confirmed by the frequency analysis of the collision bearing angles obtained for 200 collision cases that produced a value of 112 5 135 therefore ship operators must be aware of the maximum collision risk bearing angle while they are on duty collision prevention will be possible if they are aware that the probabilities of human errors and collisions increase at the verified mcrba and if they take appropriate collision avoidance actions e g alter course earlier 2 the pscr increased most dramatically at a relative bearing angle of 135 and distance of 1 25 1 nm therefore it is necessary for the navigator consider collision avoidance measures from a sufficiently long distance before the distance between the two vessels becomes 1 nm or lower to prevent collision in summary ship operators must be aware of the mcrba and the dcrbis for collision prevention which is the ultimate purpose of this study these identified risk factors are of high importance for preventing ship collisions the results of this study are expected to help prevent ship collision in the maritime transportation field however as limitations the ship encounter experiment for the pscr measurement by the officer is different from the actual merchant ship collision situation in that it was performed in a controlled test environment to prevent accidents and collisions that may occur during the maritime experiment in future studies the effects of the on board career of the ship operators license grades of mariners and their ages on the pscr will be considered to better identify possible human errors during seafaring funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public

22022,in this paper a trajectory tracking control strategy based on anti windup compensator is proposed for unmanned surface vessels subject to input saturation and full state constraints the saturation problem is handled by the anti windup compensator which utilizes an auxiliary system to compensate for the saturation difference directly in addition the barrier lyapunov function is employed to prevent states from violating the constraints it is proved that the proposed control strategy can achieve the semi global uniform boundedness of the closed loop system through lyapunov stability theory finally simulation results further demonstrate its excellent performance keywords unmanned surface vessel barrier lyapunov function anti windup compensator input saturation full state constraints 1 introduction at present ocean exploitation is paid more and more attention in different countries thus the tools for marine exploration and development like autonomous underwater vehicles auvs remotely operated vehicles rovs and unmanned surface vessels usvs are in a period of rapid development in order to realize accurate control of these unmanned vehicles much research has been conducted chin and lin 2018 have proposed a sliding mode control system for rov based on fuzzy inference mechanism and direction based genetic algorithm a lyapunov based model predictive control framework for auvs has been developed by shen et al 2018 in fact usv is a kind of low cost unmanned vehicles with wide application prospect in both military and civilian fields it not only prevents human beings from danger when working in the ocean but also has the ability to operate many tasks that people cannot finish therefore it is significant to conduct research on the control strategies of usvs in order to make usvs navigate as required various control algorithms have been presented such as path following control formation control and trajectory tracking control wang et al 2018 2019 have investigated the path following control scheme with a finite time observer for an underactuated surface vehicle wang et al 2017 have presented a formation control approach for usvs the formation controller of which utilized backstepping control technique and exponential remapping liu et al 2014 have investigated the roll stabilization and trajectory tracking control for underactuated surface vessels with an adaptive hierarchical sliding mode control approach the main issue in this study is about the trajectory tracking control design the principle of which is to let the usv navigate in the designed route and reach the destination on schedule many control strategies have been used to address the trajectory tracking problem wang et al 2017c such as sliding mode control backstepping technique and adaptive method for instance wang et al 2016a have proposed a finite time disturbance observer for a fully actuated marine surface vehicle subject to unknown disturbances zheng et al 2017 have presented an adaptive radial basis function neural network in the trajectory tracking control in the presence of external disturbances and asymmetric saturation actuators qu et al 2018 have investigated the trajectory tracking control scheme for usv with disturbance and system uncertainty for which an estimator based backstepping controller was proposed the system uncertainties are significant problems in the trajectory tracking control and the control performance will be greatly reduced if the uncertainties are ignored the uncertainties are mainly caused by the changes of navigation conditions leading the hydrodynamic derivatives to change as well in fact the parameters in the controller are nonlinear functions of hydrodynamic derivatives moreover there exist external disturbances such as wave ocean current and wind therefore these factors above will have a great influence on the tracking control of usvs in order to handle the system uncertainties the related control strategies have various solutions like neural network and adaptive method wang et al 2017b have designed a finite time uncertainty estimator based high accuracy tracking control scheme to handle the uncertainty problem of usv yin et al 2017a b have investigated the tracking control manipulation for surface vessels based on backstepping technique an adaptive feedback controller was designed to deal with the uncertainties and disturbances wang et al 2016b 2017a have employed the adaptive fuzzy approximator to tackle the uncertainties and unknown disturbances of surface vehicles tutsoy et al 2018 presented an adaptive controller for discrete time linear systems which addressed the problems of parametric uncertainties and internal external non parametric random uncertainties besides the adaptive estimator can also address the uncertainty problem in other fields tutsoy et al 2015a 2015b in general the adaptive method has the excellent ability to deal with the uncertainty problem and is employed in numerous studies in this research we utilize the adaptive method as well to address the influence of external disturbances it estimates the square of the upper bound of the unknown random disturbances and approximates its actual value thus the robustness of the system can be improved wang et al 2019a in addition to the system uncertainties the state constraint is also an important problem which needs to be tackled in the control design usvs will encounter some accidents and dangers when violating the constraints for example the usv may have a collision for deviating from the route or have equipment failure for exceeding the speed limit the barrier lyapunov function blf is a control technique based on potential function which can be used as an effective way to copy with the state constraints in many control strategies yin et al 2017a b employed a blf to avoid the violation of state constraints and utilized neural networks to approximate the system uncertainties of marine surface vessels he et al 2017 utilized an asymmetric blf to address the output constraints in the full state feedback and output feedback control for a marine surface vessel he et al 2018 proposed an adaptive fuzzy neural network control approach for a class of multiple input and multiple output mimo nonlinear systems in which integral lyapunov functions were employed for state constraints compared to the common lyapunov function the blf employed in this paper is radial bounded when the state reaches a certain boundary the value of the function tends to be infinite therefore the states will not violate the constraints if the boundedness of the blf in the closed loop system exists in addition its requirements for initial value have lower conservativeness in this study we combine the blf technique with usv system to achieve the trajectory tracking control with full state constraints the saturation problem also influences the trajectory tracking control the actuators of usvs provide finite control force and torque in reality some problems may occur when the control strategy is applied to actual engineering without considering the limited actuator capability at present the auxiliary variables are utilized as an effective solution in some studies for instance park 2017 presented an output feedback control method for underactuated surface vessels which utilized observer errors and auxiliary variables for input saturation problem based on backstepping method and neural networks zheng et al 2016 investigated the path following control of usv which employed the auxiliary design system to analyze the influence of input saturation besides wang et al 2016 2019b employed the gain feedback approach in the consensus problem of multi agent systems with input saturation another popular solution is to utilize the anti windup compensator which is an useful approach to handle the saturation problem the feature of the compensator is that it will modify the performance of the controller when the saturation occurs and keep inactive in the nominal conditions therefore it significantly augments the feasibility of the control strategy in addition the anti windup compensator is often combined with the adaptive method and auxiliary variables to deal with the saturation problem sarhadi et al 2016a b proposed a model reference adaptive control for the pitch and yaw channels of auvs the method utilized the integral state feedback and a riccati based anti windup compensator for uncertain dynamics and input saturations sarhadi et al 2016a b also presented an adaptive control with a dynamic anti windup compensator and a pid controller for auvs wu et al 2018 redesigned an adaptive control architecture with anti windup compensator for auvs in the presence of coupling disturbances and input saturation cui et al 2016 developed a sliding mode based adaptive control approach for the attitude control of auvs an auxiliary dynamic compensator was introduced for rudder saturation valentinis et al 2015 investigated a motion control system for attitude and speed of an underactuated slender hull unmanned underwater vehicle it designed an anti windup scheme for saturation problem in the final step at present there have been few works utilizing the anti windup compensator to handle the saturation problem of usvs in this study we employ the anti windup compensator in the trajectory tracking control scheme for usv an auxiliary system is designed to compensate for the actuator saturation the proposed control strategy in this study aims at the trajectory tracking control for usvs compared with other works it handles the problems of full state constraints and input saturation simultaneously firstly we employ an anti windup compensator to address the saturation problem of usv which is compensated by the auxiliary system then combined with the auxiliary system we utilize the blf to guarantee that the state variables remain in the boundary constraints the adaptive method is also utilized to address the external disturbances the characteristics of this research are listed as follows 1 the blf technique is employed to deal with the full state constraints 2 in regard to the actuator saturation problem an auxiliary system is designed based on the anti windup compensator which compensates the saturation difference directly 3 the external random disturbances are taken into account in the trajectory tracking control and addressed by the adaptive method the organization of this study is listed as follows in section 2 the basic knowledge is introduced including the usv dynamics variable introductions and some necessary assumptions in section 3 the design process of the proposed control approach is described in details an auxiliary system for saturation is presented based on the anti windup compensator in addition the blf is utilized for the state constraints and the adaptive method is employed for the system uncertainties in the end the control law and the signals of closed loop system can be bounded with the asymptotical tracking achieved in section 4 we carry out the numerical simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach section 5 draws the conclusion 2 problem formulation due to the fact that the actuators of usvs actually can not provide infinite control force and torque it is important to take the saturation problem into account which has a great influence on the control performance the saturation function is generally expressed as 1 s a t τ sat τ 1 sat τ 2 sat τ 3 t where sat τ i sgn τ i min τ i max τ i i 1 2 3 and τ i max is the amplitude of the saturation function τ τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 t is the control input which contains three directions of τ 1 surge τ 2 sway and τ 3 yaw the actual control input s a t τ produced by the actuator may be smaller than the desired control input τ as τ i sat τ i we can regard sat τ i τ i with δ τ i 0 then sat τ i is a continuous function and stays in the transient state as τ i sat τ i we regard sat τ i τ i δ τ i with δ τ i 0 then sat τ i is in stationary conditions consequently there exists a difference δ τ between them which is expressed as 2 δ τ s a t τ τ assumption 1 for 1 and 2 there exists a nonnegative real number θ which satisfies the following conditions 3 δ τ θ remark 1 if the difference between the desired control input and the actual control input is infinite when the input saturation occurs the system will be uncontrollable thus assumption 1 is reasonable the usv dynamics model which considers the saturation problem is expressed as 4 η j η ν m ν c ν ν d ν ν g η s a t τ h where the states η η x η y η ψ ℝ 3 represent the earth frame positions η x η y and heading η ψ respectively and ν v x ν y ν ψ ℝ 3 denotes surge sway and yaw velocities of usv respectively m ℝ 3 3 is the symmetric positive definite inertia matrix c ν ℝ 3 3 is the centripetal and coriolis torques d ν ℝ 3 3 is the damping matrix h represents the random disturbance of the surrounding environment and g η represents the restoring forces caused by force of gravity ocean currents and floatage j η is the nonsingular transformation matrix and it is defined as 5 j η cos η ψ sin η ψ 0 sin η ψ cos η ψ 0 0 0 1 let x 1 η x 2 ν thus the usv system 4 can be represented as 6 x 1 j x 1 x 2 x 2 m 1 s a t τ c

the desired trajectory x d t and its time derivatives x d t satisfy a 1 x d t a 1 a 2 x d t a 2 for t 0 assumption 3 the unknown random disturbance has a boundary i e there exists a constant h m ℝ

satisfies z i 0 b i b i if the inequality holds 10 v v η h 0 then z i t always satisfies z i b i b i as t 0 lemma 3 ren et al 2010 for the bounded initial condition if there exists a continuous positive definite lyapunov function v x real numbers π 1 π 2 ℝ n ℝ are class k functions and c 1 c 2 are positive constants satisfying 11 π 1 x v x π 2 x 12 v x c 1 v x c 2 then the system is uniformly bounded the control objective is to realize the trajectory tracking control of the usv with input saturation and full state constraints this study designs the appropriate control law and adaptive law based on the anti windup compensator and the blf it should track the desired trajectory of positions x d x d 1 t x d 2 t x d 3 t t and velocities x 2 d x 2 d 1 t x 2 d 2 t x 2 d 3 t t while all signals are bounded and the full state constraints of tracking errors are not violated 3 control law design this section will present the trajectory tracking control approach of usvs based on the anti windup compensator in the presence of the input saturation the blf is utilized for the state constraints while the adaptive method is employed for the unknown random disturbances first in order to eliminate the influence of input saturation on the system the auxiliary system is employed to compensate for the saturation problem which is designed as 13 ζ 1 c 1 ζ 1 j ζ 2 ζ 2 c 2 ζ 2 m 1 δ

function α is designed as 14 α j t x d k 1 z 1 c 1 ζ 1 as a result the tracking errors z 1 and z 2 are defined as 15 z 1 x 1 x d ζ 1 z 2 x 2 α ζ 2 substituting 15 into 6 we have 16 z 1 j z 2 α ζ 2 x d

satisfy the tracking control requirement assumption 6 the matrix j is known and has a boundary from assumption 2 it can be further assumed that there exist positive vectors b 0 b 01 b 02 b 03 t and a

t is the boundary of z 1 we can find that v 1 is positive definite and continuous when z 1 i b 1 i an adaptive algorithm is used to estimate the square of the upper bound of the unknown random disturbances so as to reduce the influence of disturbances and prevent the unnecessary chattering caused by the sign function therefore we let κ h m 2 and the adaptive estimation error is defined as κ κ κ ˆ with κ κ ˆ ˆ then combining the adaptive method and the auxiliary variables we design the blf as 19 v 2 v 1 i 1 3 1 2 ln b 2 i 2 b 2 i 2 z 2 i 2 1 2 z 2 t m z 2 1 2 ζ 2 t ζ 2 1 2 γ 0 κ 2 where b

γ 1 κ ˆ where ε γ 1 are positive constants and k 2 is a positive control gain next we prove the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy with the presentation and derivation of lyapunov function which illustrate the closed loop system stability theorem 1 consider the usv system 6 under assumptions 1 4 the signals of the closed loop system are semi globally uniformly bounded sgub with the

b 2 i 1 e 2 v 2 0 c β b 2 i t 0 therefore we can draw the conclusion that the signals z 1 and z 2 are sgub consequently it is obvious that the actual trajectories of positions x 1 and velocities x 2 can track their desired trajectories in the presence of the full state constraints of tracking errors and input saturation problem remark 2 it can be seen that the auxiliary system 13 is a linear and bounded input bounded output system liu 2017 according to lemma 1 the state variables of the auxiliary system ζ 1 ζ 2 are uniformly ultimately bounded thus δ τ is also bounded it explains the rationality of assumption 1 from another point of view 4 numerical simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control approach for usvs subject to input saturation and full state

the amplitudes of the saturation function are selected as τ 1 max 250 n τ 2 max 210 n and τ 3 max 150 nm the simulation results are shown in figs 2 6 in general the tracking performance has little difference between the case without input saturation and the case with anti windup compensator except for control input figs 2 and 3 indicate the desired trajectories x d x 2 d and actual trajectories x 1 x 2 which can realize the high precision tracking for the target figs 4 and 5 show the tracking errors between the desired and actual trajectories where z 1 z 2 can soon converge to zero in spite of the slight fluctuations at the initial time in addition the control strategy can guarantee that all the tracking errors remain in the constraint boundary regardless of the input saturation fig 6 presents the corresponding control inputs of the case a without input saturation and the case b with anti windup compensator obviously the control input τ in a is much larger than the sat τ in b especially at the initial time simultaneously the control inputs have the stable change trend and periodic variation therefore the proposed control scheme with anti windup compensator can improve the control performance and is realistic for actual actuators in conclusion compared with other control methods our study considers the effects of full state constraints and input saturation on the trajectory tracking control of usv the simulation results show that it can track the desired trajectory with input saturation and the tracking errors z 1 and z 2 remain in the constraint boundary simultaneously remark 3 in general the increase of control parameters like k 1 k 2 will accelerate the response speed of system but reduce the tracking precision however the state convergence rate will be very slow when the control parameters are too small remark 4 compared with the common quadratic lyapunov function the blf in our study can reduce the conservativeness for initial values therefore the proposed control method can choose a wider range of initial values in addition the anti windup compensator compensates for the saturation difference directly which also makes the control algorithm less conservative than other methods like the adaption techniques 5 conclusion in this paper a trajectory tracking control approach for usvs based on anti windup compensator and full state constraints is proposed it utilizes the anti windup technique to compensate for the saturation difference directly addressing the influence of the saturation problem on the control law besides the full state constraints are also solved by the blf so that the tracking errors can remain in the boundary meanwhile the employed adaptive approach has the ability to handle the external disturbances in the control design finally the actual trajectory can successfully track the desired trajectory under the proposed control algorithm meanwhile it ensures that the closed loop signals and control law are sgub and the asymptotic tracking is achieved the performance of the proposed strategy is verified by simulation example although our control scheme takes full state constraints and input saturation into account more influence factors need to be handled such as model uncertainty and fault tolerant control in the future work we will not only try to apply the control algorithm to the actual usv but also make further improvement such as handling the saturation problem with tanh function or hyperbolic tangent function declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

have investigated the path following control scheme with a finite time observer for an underactuated surface vehicle wang et al 2017 have presented a formation control approach for usvs the formation controller of which utilized backstepping control technique and exponential remapping liu et al 2014 have investigated the roll stabilization and trajectory tracking control for underactuated surface vessels with an adaptive hierarchical sliding mode control approach the main issue in this study is about the trajectory tracking control design the principle of which is to let the usv navigate in the designed route and reach the destination on schedule many control strategies have been used to address the trajectory tracking problem wang et al 2017c such as sliding mode control backstepping technique and adaptive method for instance wang et al 2016a have proposed a finite time disturbance observer for a fully actuated marine surface vehicle subject to unknown disturbances zheng et al 2017 have presented an adaptive radial basis function neural network in the trajectory tracking control in the presence of external disturbances and asymmetric saturation actuators qu et al 2018 have investigated the trajectory tracking control scheme for usv with disturbance and system uncertainty for which an estimator based backstepping controller was proposed the system uncertainties are significant problems in the trajectory tracking control and the control performance will be greatly reduced if the uncertainties are ignored the uncertainties are mainly caused by the changes of navigation conditions leading the hydrodynamic derivatives to change as well in fact the parameters in the controller are nonlinear functions of hydrodynamic derivatives moreover there exist external disturbances such as wave ocean current and wind therefore these factors above will have a great influence on the tracking control of usvs in order to handle the system uncertainties the related control strategies have various solutions like neural network and adaptive method wang et al 2017b have designed a finite time uncertainty estimator based high accuracy tracking control scheme to handle the uncertainty problem of usv yin et al 2017a b have investigated the tracking control manipulation for surface vessels based on backstepping technique an adaptive feedback controller was designed to deal with the uncertainties and disturbances wang et al 2016b 2017a have employed the adaptive fuzzy approximator to tackle the uncertainties and unknown disturbances of surface vehicles tutsoy et al 2018 presented an adaptive controller for discrete time linear systems which addressed the problems of parametric uncertainties and internal external non parametric random uncertainties besides the adaptive estimator can also address the uncertainty problem in other fields tutsoy et al 2015a 2015b in general the adaptive method has the excellent ability to deal with the uncertainty problem and is employed in numerous studies in this research we utilize the adaptive method as well to address the influence of external disturbances it estimates the square of the upper bound of the unknown random disturbances and approximates its actual value thus the robustness of the system can be improved wang et al 2019a in addition to the system uncertainties the state constraint is also an important problem which needs to be tackled in the control design usvs will encounter some accidents and dangers when violating the constraints for example the usv may have a collision for deviating from the route or have equipment failure for exceeding the speed limit the barrier lyapunov function blf is a control technique based on potential function which can be used as an effective way to copy with the state constraints in many control strategies yin et al 2017a b employed a blf to avoid the violation of state constraints and utilized neural networks to approximate the system uncertainties of marine surface vessels he et al 2017 utilized an asymmetric blf to address the output constraints in the full state feedback and output feedback control for a marine surface vessel he et al 2018 proposed an adaptive fuzzy neural network control approach for a class of multiple input and multiple output mimo nonlinear systems in which integral lyapunov functions were employed for state constraints compared to the common lyapunov function the blf employed in this paper is radial bounded when the state reaches a certain boundary the value of the function tends to be infinite therefore the states will not violate the constraints if the boundedness of the blf in the closed loop system exists in addition its requirements for initial value have lower conservativeness in this study we combine the blf technique with usv system to achieve the trajectory tracking control with full state constraints the saturation problem also influences the trajectory tracking control the actuators of usvs provide finite control force and torque in reality some problems may occur when the control strategy is applied to actual engineering without considering the limited actuator capability at present the auxiliary variables are utilized as an effective solution in some studies for instance park 2017 presented an output feedback control method for underactuated surface vessels which utilized observer errors and auxiliary variables for input saturation problem based on backstepping method and neural networks zheng et al 2016 investigated the path following control of usv which employed the auxiliary design system to analyze the influence of input saturation besides wang et al 2016 2019b employed the gain feedback approach in the consensus problem of multi agent systems with input saturation another popular solution is to utilize the anti windup compensator which is an useful approach to handle the saturation problem the feature of the compensator is that it will modify the performance of the controller when the saturation occurs and keep inactive in the nominal conditions therefore it significantly augments the feasibility of the control strategy in addition the anti windup compensator is often combined with the adaptive method and auxiliary variables to deal with the saturation problem sarhadi et al 2016a b proposed a model reference adaptive control for the pitch and yaw channels of auvs the method utilized the integral state feedback and a riccati based anti windup compensator for uncertain dynamics and input saturations sarhadi et al 2016a b also presented an adaptive control with a dynamic anti windup compensator and a pid controller for auvs wu et al 2018 redesigned an adaptive control architecture with anti windup compensator for auvs in the presence of coupling disturbances and input saturation cui et al 2016 developed a sliding mode based adaptive control approach for the attitude control of auvs an auxiliary dynamic compensator was introduced for rudder saturation valentinis et al 2015 investigated a motion control system for attitude and speed of an underactuated slender hull unmanned underwater vehicle it designed an anti windup scheme for saturation problem in the final step at present there have been few works utilizing the anti windup compensator to handle the saturation problem of usvs in this study we employ the anti windup compensator in the trajectory tracking control scheme for usv an auxiliary system is designed to compensate for the actuator saturation the proposed control strategy in this study aims at the trajectory tracking control for usvs compared with other works it handles the problems of full state constraints and input saturation simultaneously firstly we employ an anti windup compensator to address the saturation problem of usv which is compensated by the auxiliary system then combined with the auxiliary system we utilize the blf to guarantee that the state variables remain in the boundary constraints the adaptive method is also utilized to address the external disturbances the characteristics of this research are listed as follows 1 the blf technique is employed to deal with the full state constraints 2 in regard to the actuator saturation problem an auxiliary system is designed based on the anti windup compensator which compensates the saturation difference directly 3 the external random disturbances are taken into account in the trajectory tracking control and addressed by the adaptive method the organization of this study is listed as follows in section 2 the basic knowledge is introduced including the usv dynamics variable introductions and some necessary assumptions in section 3 the design process of the proposed control approach is described in details an auxiliary system for saturation is presented based on the anti windup compensator in addition the blf is utilized for the state constraints and the adaptive method is employed for the system uncertainties in the end the control law and the signals of closed loop system can be bounded with the asymptotical tracking achieved in section 4 we carry out the numerical simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach section 5 draws the conclusion 2 problem formulation due to the fact that the actuators of usvs actually can not provide infinite control force and torque it is important to take the saturation problem into account which has a great influence on the control performance the saturation function is generally expressed as 1 s a t τ sat τ 1 sat τ 2 sat τ 3 t where sat τ i sgn τ i min τ i max τ i i 1 2 3 and τ i max is the amplitude of the saturation function τ τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 t is the control input which contains three directions of τ 1 surge τ 2 sway and τ 3 yaw the actual control input s a t τ produced by the actuator may be smaller than the desired control input τ as τ i sat τ i we can regard sat τ i τ i with δ τ i 0 then sat τ i is a continuous function and stays in the transient state as τ i sat τ i we regard sat τ i τ i δ τ i with δ τ i 0 then sat τ i is in stationary conditions consequently there exists a difference δ τ between them which is expressed as 2 δ τ s a t τ τ assumption 1 for 1 and 2 there exists a nonnegative real number θ which satisfies the following conditions 3 δ τ θ remark 1 if the difference between the desired control input and the actual control input is infinite when the input saturation occurs the system will be uncontrollable thus assumption 1 is reasonable the usv dynamics model which considers the saturation problem is expressed as 4 η j η ν m ν c ν ν d ν ν g η s a t τ h where the states η η x η y η ψ ℝ 3 represent the earth frame positions η x η y and heading η ψ respectively and ν v x ν y ν ψ ℝ 3 denotes surge sway and yaw velocities of usv respectively m ℝ 3 3 is the symmetric positive definite inertia matrix c ν ℝ 3 3 is the centripetal and coriolis torques d ν ℝ 3 3 is the damping matrix h represents the random disturbance of the surrounding environment and g η represents the restoring forces caused by force of gravity ocean currents and floatage j η is the nonsingular transformation matrix and it is defined as 5 j η cos η ψ sin η ψ 0 sin η ψ cos η ψ 0 0 0 1 let x 1 η x 2 ν thus the usv system 4 can be represented as 6 x 1 j x 1 x 2 x 2 m 1 s a t τ c

the desired trajectory x d t and its time derivatives x d t satisfy a 1 x d t a 1 a 2 x d t a 2 for t 0 assumption 3 the unknown random disturbance has a boundary i e there exists a constant h m ℝ

the following system 7 η h t η where η w z n h ℝ n ℝ l 1 is piecewise continuous in t and locally lipschitz in z i uniformly in t on ℝ n assuming that the two positive definite functions u ℝ l ℝ and v i z i ℝ i 1 2 n are continuously differentiable in their respective domains such that 8 v i z i as z i b i 9 γ 1 w u w γ 2 w where γ 1 γ 2 are class k functions let v η i 1 n v i z i u w and z i 0 satisfies z i 0 b i b i if the inequality holds 10 v v η h 0 then z i t always satisfies z i b i b i as t 0 lemma 3 ren et al 2010 for the bounded initial condition if there exists a continuous positive definite lyapunov function v x real numbers π 1 π 2 ℝ n ℝ are class k functions and c 1 c 2 are positive constants satisfying 11 π 1 x v x π 2 x 12 v x c 1 v x c 2 then the system is uniformly bounded the control objective is to realize the trajectory tracking control of the usv with input saturation and full state constraints this study designs the appropriate control law and adaptive law based on the anti windup compensator and the blf it should track the desired trajectory of positions x d x d 1 t x d 2 t x d 3 t t and velocities x 2 d x 2 d 1 t x 2 d 2 t x 2 d 3 t t while all signals are bounded and the full state constraints of tracking errors are not violated 3 control law design this section will present the trajectory tracking control approach of usvs based on the anti windup compensator in the presence of the input saturation the blf is utilized for the state constraints while the adaptive method is employed for the unknown random disturbances first in order to eliminate the influence of input saturation on the system the auxiliary system is employed to compensate for the saturation problem which is designed as 13 ζ 1 c 1 ζ 1 j ζ 2 ζ 2 c 2 ζ 2 m 1 δ

satisfy the tracking control requirement assumption 6 the matrix j is known and has a boundary from assumption 2 it can be further assumed that there exist positive vectors b 0 b 01 b 02 b 03 t and a

t is the boundary of z 1 we can find that v 1 is positive definite and continuous when z 1 i b 1 i an adaptive algorithm is used to estimate the square of the upper bound of the unknown random disturbances so as to reduce the influence of disturbances and prevent the unnecessary chattering caused by the sign function therefore we let κ h m 2 and the adaptive estimation error is defined as κ κ κ ˆ with κ κ ˆ ˆ then combining the adaptive method and the auxiliary variables we design the blf as 19 v 2 v 1 i 1 3 1 2 ln b 2 i 2 b 2 i 2 z 2 i 2 1 2 z 2 t m z 2 1 2 ζ 2 t ζ 2 1 2 γ 0 κ 2 where b

γ 1 κ ˆ where ε γ 1 are positive constants and k 2 is a positive control gain next we prove the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy with the presentation and derivation of lyapunov function which illustrate the closed loop system stability theorem 1 consider the usv system 6 under assumptions 1 4 the signals of the closed loop system are semi globally uniformly bounded sgub with the

b 2 i 1 e 2 v 2 0 c β b 2 i t 0 therefore we can draw the conclusion that the signals z 1 and z 2 are sgub consequently it is obvious that the actual trajectories of positions x 1 and velocities x 2 can track their desired trajectories in the presence of the full state constraints of tracking errors and input saturation problem remark 2 it can be seen that the auxiliary system 13 is a linear and bounded input bounded output system liu 2017 according to lemma 1 the state variables of the auxiliary system ζ 1 ζ 2 are uniformly ultimately bounded thus δ τ is also bounded it explains the rationality of assumption 1 from another point of view 4 numerical simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control approach for usvs subject to input saturation and full state

other works he et al 2017 as references we choose the desired trajectories as 34 x 1 d t x 1 x d t x 1 y d t x 1 ψ d t t 35 x 1 x d t 4 sin 0 5 t x 1 y d t 1 4 cos 2 t x 1 ψ d t tan 1 x 1 y d x 1 x d 36 x 2 d j 1 x 1 d the restoring force is g x 1 2 cos x 13 3 6 sin x 13 2 sin x 13 3 6 cos x 13 1 8 t and the random disturbance is h 2 cos x 13 3 6 sin x 13 2 sin x 13 3 6 cos x 13 1 8 t the initial conditions are given as x 1 0 0 01 1 0 012 t and x 2 0 0 08 0 08 0 1 t the control parameters are chosen as k 1 diag 20 20 3 and k 2 diag 0 4 40 0 001 the constraint boundary are selected as b 1 0 8 0 9 0 6 t and b 2 1 7 8 3 t the adaptive parameters are given as γ 0 0 1 γ 1 0 01 and ε 0 5 the auxiliary coefficients for saturation compensation are chosen as c 1 diag 20 20 20 and c 2 diag 20 20 20 the amplitudes of the saturation function are selected as τ 1 max 250 n τ 2 max 210 n and τ 3 max 150 nm the simulation results are shown in figs 2 6 in general the tracking performance has little difference between the case without input saturation and the case with anti windup compensator except for control input figs 2 and 3 indicate the desired trajectories x d x 2 d and actual trajectories x 1 x 2 which can realize the high precision tracking for the target figs 4 and 5 show the tracking errors between the desired and actual trajectories where z 1 z 2 can soon converge to zero in spite of the slight fluctuations at the initial time in addition the control strategy can guarantee that all the tracking errors remain in the constraint boundary regardless of the input saturation fig 6 presents the corresponding control inputs of the case a without input saturation and the case b with anti windup compensator obviously the control input τ in a is much larger than the sat τ in b especially at the initial time simultaneously the control inputs have the stable change trend and periodic variation therefore the proposed control scheme with anti windup compensator can improve the control performance and is realistic for actual actuators in conclusion compared with other control methods our study considers the effects of full state constraints and input saturation on the trajectory tracking control of usv the simulation results show that it can track the desired trajectory with input saturation and the tracking errors z 1 and z 2 remain in the constraint boundary simultaneously remark 3 in general the increase of control parameters like k 1 k 2 will accelerate the response speed of system but reduce the tracking precision however the state convergence rate will be very slow when the control parameters are too small remark 4 compared with the common quadratic lyapunov function the blf in our study can reduce the conservativeness for initial values therefore the proposed control method can choose a wider range of initial values in addition the anti windup compensator compensates for the saturation difference directly which also makes the control algorithm less conservative than other methods like the adaption techniques 5 conclusion in this paper a trajectory tracking control approach for usvs based on anti windup compensator and full state constraints is proposed it utilizes the anti windup technique to compensate for the saturation difference directly addressing the influence of the saturation problem on the control law besides the full state constraints are also solved by the blf so that the tracking errors can remain in the boundary meanwhile the employed adaptive approach has the ability to handle the external disturbances in the control design finally the actual trajectory can successfully track the desired trajectory under the proposed control algorithm meanwhile it ensures that the closed loop signals and control law are sgub and the asymptotic tracking is achieved the performance of the proposed strategy is verified by simulation example although our control scheme takes full state constraints and input saturation into account more influence factors need to be handled such as model uncertainty and fault tolerant control in the future work we will not only try to apply the control algorithm to the actual usv but also make further improvement such as handling the saturation problem with tanh function or hyperbolic tangent function declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

affected zone finite element analysis 1 introduction stiffened panels as an assembly of plating and stiffeners are fundamental structures that form the primary structure of ships and offshore platforms the ultimate global strength of ship hull is considered as the first assessment in the ship structural design stage issc 2015 therefore many studies were performed numerically and experimentally in the various types of ships gordo et al 1996 2011 paik et al 2005 2008c pei et al 2013 yao 2016 liu et al 2018 vu et al 2018 tekgoz et al 2018 xu et al 2019 however the ultimate local strength of plating stiffened panels and supporting members is also an essential part of the structural design and analysis numerous investigations performed by employing analytical empirical experimental and numerical methods showed that the structural behaviour and ultimate load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels are strongly affected by the interaction between the various uncertainties including geometric and material properties strength deterioration in the heat affected zone haz of aluminium loading boundary conditions initial imperfections and structural changes including recent ones guedes soares and gordo 1997 issc 2018 paik 2018 woloszyk et al 2018 therefore additional studies are required for providing deeper insights into the effects of different parameters generally steels have been widely used in the thin walled structures for a long time however aluminium alloys are increasingly used nowadays in building high speed vessels and superstructures of ships instead of steels due to the high strength to the weight ratio and the corrosion resistance aalberg et al 2001 mazzolani 2006 kasten 2016 in aluminium stiffened plates fabricated by fusion welding the material softening takes place in the haz along the weld seam in contrast to the steel stiffened panel the yield stress in the haz of the welded aluminium panel is reduced significantly as compared to the base material hence this leads to the reduction of the ultimate compressive strength of aluminium panels khedmati et al 2009 the tensile residual stresses exist in the haz which are self equilibrated by the corresponding compressive stresses in the adjacent zones the welding induced residual stress is recognised to decrease the ultimate bearing capacity of both aluminium and steel panels gannon et al 2013 farajkhah and liu 2016 chen and guedes soares 2019 many experimental and numerical studies were performed concerning the effects of welding induced residual stress deflection and softening phenomenon in the haz on the ultimate strength of aluminium structures zha and moan 2001 2003 performed experimental and theoretical analyses of aluminium stiffened panels with primary torsional failure mode of stiffeners numerical sensitivity analyses on the structural behaviour and ultimate strength of aluminium panels under uniaxial compressive and combined loads were carried out by rigo et al 2003 khedmati et al 2009 2012 and paulo et al 2013 a series of collapse tests under axial compression were conducted to measure the initial distortions and welding induced residual stresses paik et al 2005 2008a b c 2009 ssc 2008 the ultimate strength analysis of welded aluminium stiffened panels subjected to in plane compressive load normal to the direction of the stiffeners was carried out by rønning et al 2010 khedmati and ghavami 2009 and li et al 2017 performed finite element fe analyses of the stiffened panels with fixed floating transverse frames farajkhah and liu 2016 simulated the effects of inert gas welding on aluminium panels li et al 2018 conducted a numerical investigation on the aluminium panels built from extruded profiles the influence of various cross section forms of stiffener was numerically studied by ren et al 2018 to find out the most suitable type to replace the original steel stiffener in the upper deck of a warship the studies mentioned above show that the extent of the haz varies mainly depending on the welding method and the thickness of the welded structures additionally the ultimate strength of aluminium stiffened panels is reduced considerably and is very sensitive to the residual stress the initial deformation and the deterioration of mechanical strength in the haz regarding the structural arrangement the presence of openings in the plated structures is necessary for inspection running hvac heating ventilation and air conditioning systems passing pipes cables access hatches lightning and other design reasons the existence of the openings can cause structural rupture stress concentrations and the decrease of ultimate strength the ultimate strength of plates with circular elliptical or rectangular openings has been extensively studied paik 2007 investigated the ultimate strength characteristics of steel plates with a single circular hole subjected to axial compression a series of fe analyses were carried out with different hole diameters and an empirical formulation was developed moen and schafer 2009 proposed simplified expressions to estimate the elastic buckling stress of thin plates with holes under compression or bending yu and lee 2012 analysed the effects of different sizes and locations of rectangular opening on the behaviour of plates under uniaxial compression saad eldeen et al 2014 conducted numerical analyses of the ultimate strength of steel plates with a large opening and a regression analysis was performed to develop a simple approximation results from this investigation showed that a vertical opening has a more significant reduction of the ultimate strength than a horizontal one saad eldeen et al 2019 also conducted a series of compressive collapse tests of deteriorated steel plates with multiple circular openings and realised that the number of openings plays an essential role in the structural response and capacity of perforated plates few studies were performed for stiffened plates with openings suneel kumar et al 2009 carried out numerical and experimental investigations on the ultimate strength of stiffened plates with a central square opening subjected to combined axial and lateral loads yu et al 2015 performed a series of numerical analyses of stiffened plates with a square opening under combined lateral pressure and uniaxial load saad eldeen et al 2018 carried out a series of compressive tests for the stiffened panels with different shapes sizes and steel materials the results from the above studies showed that the shape size and location of the openings on the plates affect the structural behaviour and ultimate load carrying capacity of perforated stiffened panels however a limited number of studies related to the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with openings on the web of stiffeners exist this type of structures is often used in large passenger and ro ro ships and large yachts there are few studies on the comparison of equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels designed based on the same criteria for instance kasten 2016 compared the strength of aluminium and steel plates based on the bending stiffness and the weight of structures liu et al 2014 proposed theoretical formulations to evaluate the impact strength of aluminium and steel plates of the same bending stiffness nevertheless the comparison of the ultimate strength of equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened structures is still not taken into account the objective of the present study is to analyse and compare the strength of equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels considering the effects of the haz boundary condition and initial imperfections additional analysis of the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels with openings is also performed in this study the nonlinear finite element analyses of the ultimate compressive strength of equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels are performed using the ansys finite element code the analysed panels part of the main deck structure of a fast displacement yacht are designed employing the lloyd s register lr rules lr 2019b the strength reduction in the haz of the aluminium cases and the effect of initial deflections are considered the different shapes sizes and locations of the openings on the web of longitudinal girders and the effect of openings on the behaviour and ultimate compressive capacity of stiffened panels are investigated 2 design of stiffened panels 2 1 equivalent design principles both aluminium alloys and steels can be used in the construction of ships and offshore platforms steels can be replaced by aluminium alloys respecting the same standards it is essential to apply the appropriate formulations for designing the substitute structure made of alternative material satisfying the requirements concerning the structural strength the structural stiffness deflection is the primary design criterion for aluminium structures while for steel the yield point of the material is considered instead of flexure and stiffness kasten 2016 besides the bending stiffness criterion is regularly chosen for the structures subjected to lateral load and the axial stiffness is used for the structures under compression thus both bending and axial stiffness should be taken into account in combined lateral and compressive load conditions furthermore the buckling and ultimate compressive strength of the stiffened panel are affected by the effective plate and stiffener slenderness ratios khedmati et al 2010 benson et al 2013 zhang 2015 seo et al 2016 kim et al 2017 2018 as many parameters have to be considered there are still no available formulations for analysing the scantlings of the equivalent stiffened panel when the steel is replaced by the aluminium alloy for the structural material based on the lr special service craft rules lr 2019b about the deck plate thickness t p and the scantlings of stiffening structures including the section modulus z moment of inertia i and web cross sectional area a w see appendix the following equations are established to specify the geometrical relationships of the stiffened panels made of aluminium alloys and steels 1 σ st t p st σ al t p al 2 σ st z st σ al z al 3 e st i st e al i al 4 σ st a w st σ al a w al where e and σ are young s modulus and yield strength and the subscripts st and al denote steel and aluminium respectively in the present study eq 1 is simplified from eq a1 and a3 eq 2 is simplified from eq a5 and a8 eq 3 is simplified from eq a6 and a9 eq 4 is simplified from eq a7 and a10 both axial compressive and bending loads are considered in the design of equivalent steel and aluminium stiffened panels for ship deck eqs 1 and 4 are involved in the behaviour of the stiffened panel under axial compressive load eqs 2 and 3 are related to the behaviour of the stiffened panel under bending load generally it is impossible to design an equivalent stiffened panel that simultaneously satisfies all the above proposed relationships eqs 1 4 therefore the equivalent steel and aluminium panels from now on are designed based on the hypothesis that the geometrical properties of the stiffening members satisfy as many of the above relationships as possible the selection of an adequate relationship should be much depending on the loading condition of the structure additionally to ensure the accuracy of the equivalent stiffened panel and the feasibility of the manufacturing process the geometrical arrangement of the equivalent stiffened panel should be similar to the original one and the thickness of all structural components should be an integer the study aims to design the equivalent stiffened aluminium alloy panels in the deck structures for fast displacement yachts lr 2019b this scope of application cannot be extended to the general ships designed using the lr rules for ships lr 2019a since different design principles are used furthermore the application of aluminium alloy materials in the hull structures of general ships cannot be achieved in the foreseeable future 2 2 stiffened panels without opening in the present study the stiffened panels are designed as a part of the main deck of an 80 m fast displacement yacht made of aluminium alloys or steels the aluminium and steel stiffened panels without opening also called intact panels are considered as the standard panels for the following comparisons the particular dimensions of the selected ship are given in table 1 while the mechanical properties and the dimensions of the equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels are shown in tables 2 and 3 the selected materials are aluminium alloy 5083 h116 and mild steel the coordinate system and the structural geometry of two stiffened panels are presented in fig 1 the geometrical characteristics of the structural components are given in table 4 the two panels have the same arrangement with twelve stiffeners two transverse frames and two longitudinal girders the length and width of the panels are 2 1 and 4 2 m respectively it is observed that the plating thickness of the aluminium panel is 10 mm and the corresponding plating thickness of the steel panel is 7 mm thus the thickness of the steel plate is smaller by 4 7 29 mm is the result from eq 1 also both designed panels have the same product of yield strength and section modulus σz of all stiffening members it means that the first and second relationships mentioned above eq 1 and 2 are satisfied unfortunately the web cross sectional area of stiffener transverse frame and longitudinal girder of steel panel are respectively 14 9 17 5 and 31 2 larger than that of aluminium panel notably the inertia moment of these steel members is considerably larger than that of aluminium ones 42 7 56 7 and 39 4 respectively the plate and stiffener slenderness ratios β and λ of aluminium panel are 9 7 and 24 1 larger than the steel panel respectively these differences are mainly induced by the change of the inertia moment and the cross sectional area these discrepancies may lead to different structural behaviour and ultimate strength of the stiffened panels 2 3 stiffened panels with openings on longitudinal girders this kind of structural arrangement is much more applicable for the deck of large yachts where the deck height is not enough to be able to run hvac piping systems and cables under the girders in this situation the girders should be designed with an adequate depth to accommodate the penetrations the size of the openings on the web of the longitudinal girders may range from 250 to 300 mm in the accommodation areas roy 2008 the openings with 250 mm height are more often designed in the longitudinal deck girders and this height is enough to run the cables pipes thus the 250 mm height is fixed in the openings and the novel aluminium and steel stiffened panels are designed by finding an appropriate depth for the web of the longitudinal girders the novel perforated longitudinal girders should not change widely the section modulus moment of inertia and cross sectional area in the case of the main deck the structure is subjected to alternative compression and tension loads therefore the axial stiffness criterion should be the top priority i e the perforated longitudinal girders have the same cross sectional area with the original girders while the other quantities should be kept as close as to that of the intact panels the dimensions of the novel longitudinal girders with 250 mm openings in equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels are designed with a t bar 460x10 160x15 and t bar 460x8 128x10 respectively two kinds of openings elliptical and circular are chosen the length of the elliptical hole is equal to twice its height it means that the dimension of the elliptical hole is 500 250 mm while the diameter of the circular one is 250 mm the inertia moments of longitudinal girders with attached plating change due to the increase of the web height and the presence of the openings this may lead to the change of structural behaviour and ultimate strength of the stiffened panels to investigate the effect of the opening on the ultimate compressive strength of the stiffened panels three additional sizes of openings 150 200 and 300 mm height are chosen see the second column in tables 6 and 7 the openings are either located in the middle height of the web or near the flange of the girder sixteen cases with different shapes sizes and positions of the openings are designed for the numerical analyses using the aluminium and steel materials respectively two models with 460 mm depth longitudinal girder without opening are also analysed for comparison al d460 and st d460 fig 2 illustrates the shape size and location of openings on the web of the longitudinal girders the notation of the panels is referred to the shape e for elliptical c for circular and location m for middle n for near flange of the openings in panels al ex m al cx m st ex m and st cx m the openings are located at the middle height of the web while they are placed near the flange in panels al ex n al cx n st ex n and st cx n where x is the height of the openings 3 finite element model the computations are performed using the finite element commercial software ansys taking into account both the material and geometric nonlinearities the typical finite element models are shown in figs 3 and 4 the mesh convergence test has been conducted in the intact stiffened panels with different sizes of the finite element 20 x 20 25 x 25 30 x 30 40 x 40 and 50 50 mm the optimal mesh size of 25 25 mm is selected considering the computational time and accuracy fig 5 the mesh size is fine enough to describe the deformation of the model properly 3 1 material model the shell181 element is employed in the elastic perfectly plastic models the deterioration of the yield strength in the welded areas is significant for the aluminium alloy and the welded material reduces approximate 30 50 the yield strength of the unwelded material collette 2007 paik 2007a paik et al 2008a b c sielski 2008 ssc 2008 lr 2019c here the yield stresses of 215 and 125 n mm2 are defined for the unwelded and welded materials respectively based on the lr rules table 2 the width of the haz along the welding lines of aluminium panels is considered following the results from experimental tests carried out by zha and moan 2001 i e the 50 mm width in the plate and 25 mm width in stiffener web fig 6 on the other hand the yield stress of 235 n mm2 is defined for the mild steel used in the steel panels table 2 3 2 initial imperfections the welding induced initial deflections can be either measured directly or be approximated by the trigonometric functions from the statistical data or the buckled eigenvalue analysis equivalent initial defects are adopted by superimposing the three types of distortions from buckling analysis the average level of the maximum amplitudes corresponding to the local plate deflection w opl column type distortion of the stiffener w oc and the sideways distortion of the stiffener w os are selected for the steel panels as b 200 1 5 mm a 1000 1 2 mm and a 1000 1 2 mm respectively paik and seo 2009 paik 2018 meanwhile for aluminium panels these values are 0 096β 2 t p 2 47 mm 0 0018a 2 16 mm and 0 001a 1 2 mm respectively paik 2018 paik et al 2006 2008a 2008b 2008c the welding induced residual stresses are ignored in the present study 3 3 boundary conditions it is important to apply suitable boundary conditions in longitudinal and transversal directions in the fe model since they significantly affect the final results xu et al 2013 therefore the investigation on the influence of boundary conditions has been performed to choose the adequate configuration that can accurately represent the interaction of the adjacent structures four types of boundary conditions are utilised on the 1 2 1 1 2 bays intact models without opening these models have the same initial imperfection to precisely predict the capacity of the panels the periodical boundary condition in the longitudinal direction and the symmetrical boundary condition in the transversal direction is used in the first type bc1 fig 1 meanwhile the fe models are assumed to be simply supported in the longitudinal direction in the second type bc2 restrained in the longitudinal direction in the third one bc3 and fully clamped conditions are applied in the last one bc4 the detailed descriptions are described as follows bc1 ae and dh uniform ux rotz 0 uy uz rotx roty on ae equal to that on dh ad and eh uniform uy rotx rotz 0 b c f g on the frames uz 0 rotx rotz 0 bc2 ae uniform ux uy uz rotz 0 dh ux uz 0 b c f and g on the frames uz 0 bc3 ae on the stiffeners and the plate uniform ux and uz dh ux 0 uniform uz b c f and g on the frames uz 0 b c uy 0 bc4 ae uniform ux uy uz rotx roty rotz 0 dh ux uy uz rotx roty rotz 0 b c f and g on the frames uz 0 the detailed discussion on the influence of boundary conditions is presented in the following section and the most suitable boundary condition periodical bc1 is selected for all analyses for receiving realistic results and the interference between adjacent panels 4 results and discussion 4 1 influence of boundary conditions fig 7 shows the average stress strain relationships of aluminium and steel panels under different types of boundary conditions here the average stress is defined by the ratio of a compressive load to cross sectional area 55 300 mm2 for aluminium panel and 37 960 mm2 for steel panel and the average strain is defined by the ratio of axial displacement to the total length of the panel 2 4 m fig 8 compares the ultimate compressive strength of these panels despite having the same deformation mode of the middle bay at the ultimate limit state due to the similar initial deflections the behaviour and ultimate strength of two panels are not the same the difference of the ultimate strength between the simply supported and fully clamped boundary conditions is minimal less than 2 for these two panels also the difference between aluminium and steel panels under the three boundary conditions bc2 bc3 and bc4 is not significant 6 3 and 5 while it is 8 for the periodic boundary condition bc1 it is observed that the three types of boundary conditions simply supported bc2 restrained bc3 and fully clamped bc4 overestimate the ultimate longitudinal load of the panels 19 28 and 26 33 higher than the ultimate strength of panels with periodic boundary condition bc1 for aluminium and steel panels respectively of which the fully clamped boundary condition shows the highest prediction it is due to the high appreciation of the contribution of the adjacent structures in these three types of boundary conditions all nodes in the transverse edges ae dh of bc2 and bc4 are assumed to fix in the z direction and to move uniformly in bc3 these nodes move freely due to being located at the mid span meanwhile all nodes on the ae edge are coupled corresponding to the nodes on the dh edge in order to have the same displacement and rotation in the periodical boundary condition this seems to give logical modelling to consider the continuity of the structures moreover this configuration is reasonable for both odd and even number half waves in buckling mode fujikubo et al 2005 paik et al 2008b xu et al 2014 2018 leheta et al 2016 therefore it is concluded that the periodical boundary condition is an adequate configuration for the 1 2 1 1 2 bays model 4 2 intact stiffened panels the numerical analyses are carried out employing the commercial software ansys to assess the structural behaviour and ultimate strength of equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels model al intact and st intact under uniaxial compressive load figs 9 and 10 show the deformations and von mises stress distributions at the ultimate limit state and the load shortening curves are plotted in fig 11 the load shortening curves of the two panels fig 11 can be divided into three stages in the first stage the compressive load increases linearly with the increase of longitudinal shortening of the panel afterwards the two curves gradually turn into the plastic regime when the applied load reaches a specific value where the first structural member buckles finally the compressive load continues to increase in this region until reaching the ultimate compressive strength and speedily decreases after that in the third stage generally the two panels deform in the same manner where the stiffeners firstly buckle together with the plate between longitudinal girders as a unit it may be due to the moderately small dimensions and quantities of stiffeners between longitudinal girders then the stiffeners located in the compression side undergo tripping at the mid span finally the buckling of the web of the longitudinal girder takes place resulting in instability of the entire structures this type of failure can be considered as a beam column collapse mode in general it is observed that the behaviour of the two panels is similar to the stiffened panels with several stiffeners between longitudinal girders as was also observed by tanaka et al 2014 the experimental results presented by ssc 2008 and the numerical results of rigo et al 2003 and özgüç et al 2007 also present the same structural behaviour the analyses reveal that the von mises stress distribution of the panel st intact is close to that of panel al intact and the maximum level of stresses is concentrated at the intersection between girders and deck plating in the mid span of the girders the distortion of the transverse frames implies the existence of rotational displacements along the intersection edges of frames and deck plating however the stress in transverses is quite small in comparison with the stress in longitudinal members the axial stiffness ea of the steel panel st intact is 3 910 mn which is twice higher than that of the aluminium panel al intact 1 936 mn as a result the st intact has a much smaller displacement in the x direction than the al intact the magnitude of ux displacement when the equivalent stress reaches the welded yield strength in st intact about 0 83 mm is 52 that in al intact 1 6 mm however at the ultimate limit state the magnitude of ux in st intact only equals 41 in al intact 2 45 versus 5 91 mm it proves that the axial strain rate of the aluminium panel in the plastic region is higher than that of the steel one generally the equivalent aluminium panel can suffer more significant axial deformation than the steel panels due to its larger plate thickness moreover the maximum vertical deflection when the von mises stress reaches the welded yield stress of st intact 3 69 mm is 37 smaller than that of al intact 5 90 mm corresponding to the difference of the bending stiffness table 4 this is 42 21 mm against 36 mm at the ultimate limit state it reveals that the normal deflection rate of the steel panel is smaller than that of the aluminium one after the first buckling takes place interestingly the two panels have approximately similar elastic limitations the ultimate compressive strength of the aluminium panel 4 552 kn is 8 larger than that of the steel one 4 180 kn this proves that the proposed criteria eqs 1 4 can be used to design the equivalent stiffened panel that has the close maximum compressive load as the original one in both the elastic and the ultimate limit fig 11 the mass of the aluminium panel 408 kg is only equal to 52 mass of the steel panel 798 kg this result coincides with the conclusion of kasten 2016 4 3 effect of openings the results of aluminium and steel stiffened panels with 250 mm openings on the web of the longitudinal girders are shown in figs 12 17 and the analysed ultimate loads are given in table 5 it is observed that all cases have the same collapse deformation beam column type that is similar to the intact panels figs 9 and 10 the ultimate strength of the aluminium and steel panels with 250 mm openings only shows a small discrepancy 4 with that of the intact panels thus the design of the novel stiffened panels with 460 mm depth girders including 250 mm openings are satisfactory in the aspect of same axial structural stiffness however the stress distribution in the longitudinal girders fig 14 and the behaviour of each panel in the plastic region differ to the others the aluminium and steel panels also show different structural behaviours regarding the aluminium panels with 250 mm openings fig 15 shows that the compressive stresses at the end of the linear regime and the beginning of the post buckling stage are slightly larger than that of the intact aluminium panel then they suddenly drop close to the stress strain curve of al intact panel due to the occurrence of the local buckling in the web of girders resulting from the stress concentration around the openings for instance fig 16 typically expresses the stress concentration and local buckling shape of the web plate of panel al e250 m and similar behaviours are also found in cases al e250 n al c250 m and al c250 n after reaching the ultimate limit the average stresses gradually reduce but still maintain high values the average stress strain curves of the steel stiffened panels with 250 mm openings fig 17 show the same trend to the aluminium ones fig 15 the compressive stresses of the steel panels with openings are not significantly higher than that of the intact steel panel during the entire loading process however the drop of the compressive stresses does not occur in the plastic region before the ultimate load table 5 shows that the ultimate strength of aluminium panels with 250 mm openings are higher 8 10 than that of the corresponding steel panels the novel panels with openings are slightly more massive than the intact panels specifically 4 5 for aluminium panels and 5 6 for steel panels moreover the ratios of the ultimate strength to the mass f u mass of the stiffened panels with openings are slightly smaller than that of the intact panels among these panels aluminium panel al c250 m and steel panel st c250 m show the highest values 11 1 and 5 1 kn kg respectively which are very close to the intact panels 11 2 and 5 2 kn kg respectively while panel al e250 n and st e250 n show the smallest values 10 5 and 4 8 kn kg the f u mass ratios of the steel panels are about 46 of the aluminium ones it demonstrates the effectiveness of aluminium alloy in comparison with mild steel the aluminium panels have not only higher ultimate strength but also almost 50 lighter weight than the steel ones returning to figs 9 and 10 it is observed that the von mises stress spreads rather uniformly along the length and the height of the girder however in the stiffened panels with perforated webs fig 14 the stress distribution on the longitudinal girders of all panels is not similar with different shapes and positions of the openings the maximum level of stresses concentrating at the upper and the lower edges of the openings are different from the intact panels in the panels with openings located at the mid height of the web al e250 m al c250 m st e250 m and st c250 m the stress distributes in a large area at the lower and upper edges of the openings while it concentrates in a small area near the flange in the panels al e250 n al c250 n st e250 n and st c250 n the concentration of the maximum stress probably causes the drop of compressive loads in the post buckling region of the aluminium panels fig 15 as a result the ultimate strength of the former with openings at the mid height of the web is more significant than that of the latter table 5 the maximum discrepancies of the ultimate strength found in cases al c250 and st e250 are about 4 the effect of different shapes sizes and positions of openings on the behaviour and the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels are depicted in fig 18 and tables 6 and 7 generally all cases show similar structural behaviour and their dominant failure mode is the beam column type similar to the intact panels the ultimate strength of the panels decreases with the increase of the opening size fig 18 tables 6 and 7 reveal a small divergence of the ultimate strength between the stiffened panels with different types of opening the panels with circular holes are likely to have a higher ultimate compressive load capacity than the panels with an elliptical hole even though the cutout area of the former is slightly larger than that of the latter it is mainly due to the longitudinal girder with uniformly distributed circular holes can suffer more significant compressive load than that with an elliptical hole at the mid span moreover the panels with openings at the middle of the height have slightly higher load carrying capacities than the panels with openings near the flange up to 6 tables 6 and 7 also show the ratio of the ultimate load to mass the panels with circular holes at the middle of the height show the maximum values while the panels with an elliptical hole near the flange present the minimum values the ratios of aluminium panels are almost twice that of steel panels this confirms the effectiveness of the aluminium alloy in comparison with the steel again 4 4 effect of haz both the width of the haz and the deterioration of yield stress in the haz may affect the structural behaviour and ultimate strength of welded aluminium structures thus two more analyses are performed in the intact aluminium stiffened panels one panel without haz al w0 while the other with 30 mm width of the haz al w30 as recommended in en1999 1 1 2009 the results show that the three stiffened panels have the same failure mode and nearly similar stress distribution at the ultimate limit state fig 19 shows that the structural behaviours in the elastic regime of the panel al w0 without haz al intact with 25 mm width of haz and al w30 with 30 mm width of haz are similar the ultimate strength of al intact 82 31 n mm2 is 5 9 smaller than that of al w0 87 46 n mm2 while the ultimate strength of al w30 81 40 n mm2 is 1 1 and 6 9 smaller than that of al intact and al w0 respectively it means that the reduction of yield strength in the haz and the width of haz does not make any change in the failure shape but significantly decreases the ultimate bearing capacity of the panel the width of the haz has a strong effect on the reduction of the ultimate strength the influence of haz could be more significant if considering the areas at the intersections between the web of stiffening members or between the web and flange therefore this characteristic needs to be taken into account during the design and strength assessment of welded aluminium structures 5 conclusions this study analyses and compares the ultimate compressive strength of equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels illustrating the influence of haz initial imperfections boundary conditions and presence of openings on the web of longitudinal girders based on the obtained results some concluding remarks are drawn as follows the aluminium alloys show a good replacement for the steels structures designed based on the proposed formulations although the equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels have the same strength in the linear elastic region the aluminium panels show not only higher ultimate compressive strength but also nearly 50 lighter than the equivalent steel panels the novel stiffened panels with 250 mm openings girders are in good agreement with the intact panels in the aspect of the deformation mode and the structural strength with no significant increase in the structural mass less than 6 in the considered panels this type of structure is a right substitute solution for fast displacement yachts large passenger or ro ro ships the opening takes an essential part in changing the stress distribution and diverging the ultimate load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels the ultimate strength of the panels varies significantly with the change of shape size and position of openings it is recommended that the openings are placed far away from the flange of the girders to prevent the ultimate strength loss the boundary conditions at the transverse edges have a considerable influence on the buckling and or collapse mode and the ultimate compressive strength of the stiffened panel in case of the double bay model the simply supported the fully clamped or the partially restrained boundary conditions are likely to change the structural behaviour and overestimate the ultimate strength of the panel while the periodic boundary condition seems to have a logical explanation on the effect of the adjacent structures however applying this boundary condition into an experimental test for validating the numerical simulation is not straightforward credit authorship contribution statement van tuyen doan methodology writing

22023,the ultimate compressive strength of equivalent stiffened panels made of aluminium and steel is analysed numerically and compared this equivalence is established based on the design formulations as defined by the classification society rules novel web girders with openings for passing pipes and cables are designed and their importance on the ultimate strength of stiffened plates is assessed this type of structural configuration is often applied in the design of the ship decks and superstructures a series of finite element analyses are performed in order to evaluate the ultimate compressive strength of the equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels employing different design solutions the welded heat affected zone of aluminium structures and different boundary conditions in finite element analyses are considered the results have shown that the equivalent stiffened panels yield at the same compressive load but the aluminium panels have higher ultimate strength than the steel panels finally the effect of the openings on web girders heat affected zone and boundary conditions are discussed keywords ultimate strength stiffened plate aluminium and steel opening heat affected zone finite element analysis 1 introduction stiffened panels as an assembly of plating and stiffeners are fundamental structures that form the primary structure of ships and offshore platforms the ultimate global strength of ship hull is considered as the first assessment in the ship structural design stage issc 2015 therefore many studies were performed numerically and experimentally in the various types of ships gordo et al 1996 2011 paik et al 2005 2008c pei et al 2013 yao 2016 liu et al 2018 vu et al 2018 tekgoz et al 2018 xu et al 2019 however the ultimate local strength of plating stiffened panels and supporting members is also an essential part of the structural design and analysis numerous investigations performed by employing analytical empirical experimental and numerical methods showed that the structural behaviour and ultimate load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels are strongly affected by the interaction between the various uncertainties including geometric and material properties strength deterioration in the heat affected zone haz of aluminium loading boundary conditions initial imperfections and structural changes including recent ones guedes soares and gordo 1997 issc 2018 paik 2018 woloszyk et al 2018 therefore additional studies are required for providing deeper insights into the effects of different parameters generally steels have been widely used in the thin walled structures for a long time however aluminium alloys are increasingly used nowadays in building high speed vessels and superstructures of ships instead of steels due to the high strength to the weight ratio and the corrosion resistance aalberg et al 2001 mazzolani 2006 kasten 2016 in aluminium stiffened plates fabricated by fusion welding the material softening takes place in the haz along the weld seam in contrast to the steel stiffened panel the yield stress in the haz of the welded aluminium panel is reduced significantly as compared to the base material hence this leads to the reduction of the ultimate compressive strength of aluminium panels khedmati et al 2009 the tensile residual stresses exist in the haz which are self equilibrated by the corresponding compressive stresses in the adjacent zones the welding induced residual stress is recognised to decrease the ultimate bearing capacity of both aluminium and steel panels gannon et al 2013 farajkhah and liu 2016 chen and guedes soares 2019 many experimental and numerical studies were performed concerning the effects of welding induced residual stress deflection and softening phenomenon in the haz on the ultimate strength of aluminium structures zha and moan 2001 2003 performed experimental and theoretical analyses of aluminium stiffened panels with primary torsional failure mode of stiffeners numerical sensitivity analyses on the structural behaviour and ultimate strength of aluminium panels under uniaxial compressive and combined loads were carried out by rigo et al 2003 khedmati et al 2009 2012 and paulo et al 2013 a series of collapse tests under axial compression were conducted to measure the initial distortions and welding induced residual stresses paik et al 2005 2008a b c 2009 ssc 2008 the ultimate strength analysis of welded aluminium stiffened panels subjected to in plane compressive load normal to the direction of the stiffeners was carried out by rønning et al 2010 khedmati and ghavami 2009 and li et al 2017 performed finite element fe analyses of the stiffened panels with fixed floating transverse frames farajkhah and liu 2016 simulated the effects of inert gas welding on aluminium panels li et al 2018 conducted a numerical investigation on the aluminium panels built from extruded profiles the influence of various cross section forms of stiffener was numerically studied by ren et al 2018 to find out the most suitable type to replace the original steel stiffener in the upper deck of a warship the studies mentioned above show that the extent of the haz varies mainly depending on the welding method and the thickness of the welded structures additionally the ultimate strength of aluminium stiffened panels is reduced considerably and is very sensitive to the residual stress the initial deformation and the deterioration of mechanical strength in the haz regarding the structural arrangement the presence of openings in the plated structures is necessary for inspection running hvac heating ventilation and air conditioning systems passing pipes cables access hatches lightning and other design reasons the existence of the openings can cause structural rupture stress concentrations and the decrease of ultimate strength the ultimate strength of plates with circular elliptical or rectangular openings has been extensively studied paik 2007 investigated the ultimate strength characteristics of steel plates with a single circular hole subjected to axial compression a series of fe analyses were carried out with different hole diameters and an empirical formulation was developed moen and schafer 2009 proposed simplified expressions to estimate the elastic buckling stress of thin plates with holes under compression or bending yu and lee 2012 analysed the effects of different sizes and locations of rectangular opening on the behaviour of plates under uniaxial compression saad eldeen et al 2014 conducted numerical analyses of the ultimate strength of steel plates with a large opening and a regression analysis was performed to develop a simple approximation results from this investigation showed that a vertical opening has a more significant reduction of the ultimate strength than a horizontal one saad eldeen et al 2019 also conducted a series of compressive collapse tests of deteriorated steel plates with multiple circular openings and realised that the number of openings plays an essential role in the structural response and capacity of perforated plates few studies were performed for stiffened plates with openings suneel kumar et al 2009 carried out numerical and experimental investigations on the ultimate strength of stiffened plates with a central square opening subjected to combined axial and lateral loads yu et al 2015 performed a series of numerical analyses of stiffened plates with a square opening under combined lateral pressure and uniaxial load saad eldeen et al 2018 carried out a series of compressive tests for the stiffened panels with different shapes sizes and steel materials the results from the above studies showed that the shape size and location of the openings on the plates affect the structural behaviour and ultimate load carrying capacity of perforated stiffened panels however a limited number of studies related to the ultimate strength of stiffened panels with openings on the web of stiffeners exist this type of structures is often used in large passenger and ro ro ships and large yachts there are few studies on the comparison of equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels designed based on the same criteria for instance kasten 2016 compared the strength of aluminium and steel plates based on the bending stiffness and the weight of structures liu et al 2014 proposed theoretical formulations to evaluate the impact strength of aluminium and steel plates of the same bending stiffness nevertheless the comparison of the ultimate strength of equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened structures is still not taken into account the objective of the present study is to analyse and compare the strength of equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels considering the effects of the haz boundary condition and initial imperfections additional analysis of the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels with openings is also performed in this study the nonlinear finite element analyses of the ultimate compressive strength of equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels are performed using the ansys finite element code the analysed panels part of the main deck structure of a fast displacement yacht are designed employing the lloyd s register lr rules lr 2019b the strength reduction in the haz of the aluminium cases and the effect of initial deflections are considered the different shapes sizes and locations of the openings on the web of longitudinal girders and the effect of openings on the behaviour and ultimate compressive capacity of stiffened panels are investigated 2 design of stiffened panels 2 1 equivalent design principles both aluminium alloys and steels can be used in the construction of ships and offshore platforms steels can be replaced by aluminium alloys respecting the same standards it is essential to apply the appropriate formulations for designing the substitute structure made of alternative material satisfying the requirements concerning the structural strength the structural stiffness deflection is the primary design criterion for aluminium structures while for steel the yield point of the material is considered instead of flexure and stiffness kasten 2016 besides the bending stiffness criterion is regularly chosen for the structures subjected to lateral load and the axial stiffness is used for the structures under compression thus both bending and axial stiffness should be taken into account in combined lateral and compressive load conditions furthermore the buckling and ultimate compressive strength of the stiffened panel are affected by the effective plate and stiffener slenderness ratios khedmati et al 2010 benson et al 2013 zhang 2015 seo et al 2016 kim et al 2017 2018 as many parameters have to be considered there are still no available formulations for analysing the scantlings of the equivalent stiffened panel when the steel is replaced by the aluminium alloy for the structural material based on the lr special service craft rules lr 2019b about the deck plate thickness t p and the scantlings of stiffening structures including the section modulus z moment of inertia i and web cross sectional area a w see appendix the following equations are established to specify the geometrical relationships of the stiffened panels made of aluminium alloys and steels 1 σ st t p st σ al t p al 2 σ st z st σ al z al 3 e st i st e al i al 4 σ st a w st σ al a w al where e and σ are young s modulus and yield strength and the subscripts st and al denote steel and aluminium respectively in the present study eq 1 is simplified from eq a1 and a3 eq 2 is simplified from eq a5 and a8 eq 3 is simplified from eq a6 and a9 eq 4 is simplified from eq a7 and a10 both axial compressive and bending loads are considered in the design of equivalent steel and aluminium stiffened panels for ship deck eqs 1 and 4 are involved in the behaviour of the stiffened panel under axial compressive load eqs 2 and 3 are related to the behaviour of the stiffened panel under bending load generally it is impossible to design an equivalent stiffened panel that simultaneously satisfies all the above proposed relationships eqs 1 4 therefore the equivalent steel and aluminium panels from now on are designed based on the hypothesis that the geometrical properties of the stiffening members satisfy as many of the above relationships as possible the selection of an adequate relationship should be much depending on the loading condition of the structure additionally to ensure the accuracy of the equivalent stiffened panel and the feasibility of the manufacturing process the geometrical arrangement of the equivalent stiffened panel should be similar to the original one and the thickness of all structural components should be an integer the study aims to design the equivalent stiffened aluminium alloy panels in the deck structures for fast displacement yachts lr 2019b this scope of application cannot be extended to the general ships designed using the lr rules for ships lr 2019a since different design principles are used furthermore the application of aluminium alloy materials in the hull structures of general ships cannot be achieved in the foreseeable future 2 2 stiffened panels without opening in the present study the stiffened panels are designed as a part of the main deck of an 80 m fast displacement yacht made of aluminium alloys or steels the aluminium and steel stiffened panels without opening also called intact panels are considered as the standard panels for the following comparisons the particular dimensions of the selected ship are given in table 1 while the mechanical properties and the dimensions of the equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels are shown in tables 2 and 3 the selected materials are aluminium alloy 5083 h116 and mild steel the coordinate system and the structural geometry of two stiffened panels are presented in fig 1 the geometrical characteristics of the structural components are given in table 4 the two panels have the same arrangement with twelve stiffeners two transverse frames and two longitudinal girders the length and width of the panels are 2 1 and 4 2 m respectively it is observed that the plating thickness of the aluminium panel is 10 mm and the corresponding plating thickness of the steel panel is 7 mm thus the thickness of the steel plate is smaller by 4 7 29 mm is the result from eq 1 also both designed panels have the same product of yield strength and section modulus σz of all stiffening members it means that the first and second relationships mentioned above eq 1 and 2 are satisfied unfortunately the web cross sectional area of stiffener transverse frame and longitudinal girder of steel panel are respectively 14 9 17 5 and 31 2 larger than that of aluminium panel notably the inertia moment of these steel members is considerably larger than that of aluminium ones 42 7 56 7 and 39 4 respectively the plate and stiffener slenderness ratios β and λ of aluminium panel are 9 7 and 24 1 larger than the steel panel respectively these differences are mainly induced by the change of the inertia moment and the cross sectional area these discrepancies may lead to different structural behaviour and ultimate strength of the stiffened panels 2 3 stiffened panels with openings on longitudinal girders this kind of structural arrangement is much more applicable for the deck of large yachts where the deck height is not enough to be able to run hvac piping systems and cables under the girders in this situation the girders should be designed with an adequate depth to accommodate the penetrations the size of the openings on the web of the longitudinal girders may range from 250 to 300 mm in the accommodation areas roy 2008 the openings with 250 mm height are more often designed in the longitudinal deck girders and this height is enough to run the cables pipes thus the 250 mm height is fixed in the openings and the novel aluminium and steel stiffened panels are designed by finding an appropriate depth for the web of the longitudinal girders the novel perforated longitudinal girders should not change widely the section modulus moment of inertia and cross sectional area in the case of the main deck the structure is subjected to alternative compression and tension loads therefore the axial stiffness criterion should be the top priority i e the perforated longitudinal girders have the same cross sectional area with the original girders while the other quantities should be kept as close as to that of the intact panels the dimensions of the novel longitudinal girders with 250 mm openings in equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels are designed with a t bar 460x10 160x15 and t bar 460x8 128x10 respectively two kinds of openings elliptical and circular are chosen the length of the elliptical hole is equal to twice its height it means that the dimension of the elliptical hole is 500 250 mm while the diameter of the circular one is 250 mm the inertia moments of longitudinal girders with attached plating change due to the increase of the web height and the presence of the openings this may lead to the change of structural behaviour and ultimate strength of the stiffened panels to investigate the effect of the opening on the ultimate compressive strength of the stiffened panels three additional sizes of openings 150 200 and 300 mm height are chosen see the second column in tables 6 and 7 the openings are either located in the middle height of the web or near the flange of the girder sixteen cases with different shapes sizes and positions of the openings are designed for the numerical analyses using the aluminium and steel materials respectively two models with 460 mm depth longitudinal girder without opening are also analysed for comparison al d460 and st d460 fig 2 illustrates the shape size and location of openings on the web of the longitudinal girders the notation of the panels is referred to the shape e for elliptical c for circular and location m for middle n for near flange of the openings in panels al ex m al cx m st ex m and st cx m the openings are located at the middle height of the web while they are placed near the flange in panels al ex n al cx n st ex n and st cx n where x is the height of the openings 3 finite element model the computations are performed using the finite element commercial software ansys taking into account both the material and geometric nonlinearities the typical finite element models are shown in figs 3 and 4 the mesh convergence test has been conducted in the intact stiffened panels with different sizes of the finite element 20 x 20 25 x 25 30 x 30 40 x 40 and 50 50 mm the optimal mesh size of 25 25 mm is selected considering the computational time and accuracy fig 5 the mesh size is fine enough to describe the deformation of the model properly 3 1 material model the shell181 element is employed in the elastic perfectly plastic models the deterioration of the yield strength in the welded areas is significant for the aluminium alloy and the welded material reduces approximate 30 50 the yield strength of the unwelded material collette 2007 paik 2007a paik et al 2008a b c sielski 2008 ssc 2008 lr 2019c here the yield stresses of 215 and 125 n mm2 are defined for the unwelded and welded materials respectively based on the lr rules table 2 the width of the haz along the welding lines of aluminium panels is considered following the results from experimental tests carried out by zha and moan 2001 i e the 50 mm width in the plate and 25 mm width in stiffener web fig 6 on the other hand the yield stress of 235 n mm2 is defined for the mild steel used in the steel panels table 2 3 2 initial imperfections the welding induced initial deflections can be either measured directly or be approximated by the trigonometric functions from the statistical data or the buckled eigenvalue analysis equivalent initial defects are adopted by superimposing the three types of distortions from buckling analysis the average level of the maximum amplitudes corresponding to the local plate deflection w opl column type distortion of the stiffener w oc and the sideways distortion of the stiffener w os are selected for the steel panels as b 200 1 5 mm a 1000 1 2 mm and a 1000 1 2 mm respectively paik and seo 2009 paik 2018 meanwhile for aluminium panels these values are 0 096β 2 t p 2 47 mm 0 0018a 2 16 mm and 0 001a 1 2 mm respectively paik 2018 paik et al 2006 2008a 2008b 2008c the welding induced residual stresses are ignored in the present study 3 3 boundary conditions it is important to apply suitable boundary conditions in longitudinal and transversal directions in the fe model since they significantly affect the final results xu et al 2013 therefore the investigation on the influence of boundary conditions has been performed to choose the adequate configuration that can accurately represent the interaction of the adjacent structures four types of boundary conditions are utilised on the 1 2 1 1 2 bays intact models without opening these models have the same initial imperfection to precisely predict the capacity of the panels the periodical boundary condition in the longitudinal direction and the symmetrical boundary condition in the transversal direction is used in the first type bc1 fig 1 meanwhile the fe models are assumed to be simply supported in the longitudinal direction in the second type bc2 restrained in the longitudinal direction in the third one bc3 and fully clamped conditions are applied in the last one bc4 the detailed descriptions are described as follows bc1 ae and dh uniform ux rotz 0 uy uz rotx roty on ae equal to that on dh ad and eh uniform uy rotx rotz 0 b c f g on the frames uz 0 rotx rotz 0 bc2 ae uniform ux uy uz rotz 0 dh ux uz 0 b c f and g on the frames uz 0 bc3 ae on the stiffeners and the plate uniform ux and uz dh ux 0 uniform uz b c f and g on the frames uz 0 b c uy 0 bc4 ae uniform ux uy uz rotx roty rotz 0 dh ux uy uz rotx roty rotz 0 b c f and g on the frames uz 0 the detailed discussion on the influence of boundary conditions is presented in the following section and the most suitable boundary condition periodical bc1 is selected for all analyses for receiving realistic results and the interference between adjacent panels 4 results and discussion 4 1 influence of boundary conditions fig 7 shows the average stress strain relationships of aluminium and steel panels under different types of boundary conditions here the average stress is defined by the ratio of a compressive load to cross sectional area 55 300 mm2 for aluminium panel and 37 960 mm2 for steel panel and the average strain is defined by the ratio of axial displacement to the total length of the panel 2 4 m fig 8 compares the ultimate compressive strength of these panels despite having the same deformation mode of the middle bay at the ultimate limit state due to the similar initial deflections the behaviour and ultimate strength of two panels are not the same the difference of the ultimate strength between the simply supported and fully clamped boundary conditions is minimal less than 2 for these two panels also the difference between aluminium and steel panels under the three boundary conditions bc2 bc3 and bc4 is not significant 6 3 and 5 while it is 8 for the periodic boundary condition bc1 it is observed that the three types of boundary conditions simply supported bc2 restrained bc3 and fully clamped bc4 overestimate the ultimate longitudinal load of the panels 19 28 and 26 33 higher than the ultimate strength of panels with periodic boundary condition bc1 for aluminium and steel panels respectively of which the fully clamped boundary condition shows the highest prediction it is due to the high appreciation of the contribution of the adjacent structures in these three types of boundary conditions all nodes in the transverse edges ae dh of bc2 and bc4 are assumed to fix in the z direction and to move uniformly in bc3 these nodes move freely due to being located at the mid span meanwhile all nodes on the ae edge are coupled corresponding to the nodes on the dh edge in order to have the same displacement and rotation in the periodical boundary condition this seems to give logical modelling to consider the continuity of the structures moreover this configuration is reasonable for both odd and even number half waves in buckling mode fujikubo et al 2005 paik et al 2008b xu et al 2014 2018 leheta et al 2016 therefore it is concluded that the periodical boundary condition is an adequate configuration for the 1 2 1 1 2 bays model 4 2 intact stiffened panels the numerical analyses are carried out employing the commercial software ansys to assess the structural behaviour and ultimate strength of equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels model al intact and st intact under uniaxial compressive load figs 9 and 10 show the deformations and von mises stress distributions at the ultimate limit state and the load shortening curves are plotted in fig 11 the load shortening curves of the two panels fig 11 can be divided into three stages in the first stage the compressive load increases linearly with the increase of longitudinal shortening of the panel afterwards the two curves gradually turn into the plastic regime when the applied load reaches a specific value where the first structural member buckles finally the compressive load continues to increase in this region until reaching the ultimate compressive strength and speedily decreases after that in the third stage generally the two panels deform in the same manner where the stiffeners firstly buckle together with the plate between longitudinal girders as a unit it may be due to the moderately small dimensions and quantities of stiffeners between longitudinal girders then the stiffeners located in the compression side undergo tripping at the mid span finally the buckling of the web of the longitudinal girder takes place resulting in instability of the entire structures this type of failure can be considered as a beam column collapse mode in general it is observed that the behaviour of the two panels is similar to the stiffened panels with several stiffeners between longitudinal girders as was also observed by tanaka et al 2014 the experimental results presented by ssc 2008 and the numerical results of rigo et al 2003 and özgüç et al 2007 also present the same structural behaviour the analyses reveal that the von mises stress distribution of the panel st intact is close to that of panel al intact and the maximum level of stresses is concentrated at the intersection between girders and deck plating in the mid span of the girders the distortion of the transverse frames implies the existence of rotational displacements along the intersection edges of frames and deck plating however the stress in transverses is quite small in comparison with the stress in longitudinal members the axial stiffness ea of the steel panel st intact is 3 910 mn which is twice higher than that of the aluminium panel al intact 1 936 mn as a result the st intact has a much smaller displacement in the x direction than the al intact the magnitude of ux displacement when the equivalent stress reaches the welded yield strength in st intact about 0 83 mm is 52 that in al intact 1 6 mm however at the ultimate limit state the magnitude of ux in st intact only equals 41 in al intact 2 45 versus 5 91 mm it proves that the axial strain rate of the aluminium panel in the plastic region is higher than that of the steel one generally the equivalent aluminium panel can suffer more significant axial deformation than the steel panels due to its larger plate thickness moreover the maximum vertical deflection when the von mises stress reaches the welded yield stress of st intact 3 69 mm is 37 smaller than that of al intact 5 90 mm corresponding to the difference of the bending stiffness table 4 this is 42 21 mm against 36 mm at the ultimate limit state it reveals that the normal deflection rate of the steel panel is smaller than that of the aluminium one after the first buckling takes place interestingly the two panels have approximately similar elastic limitations the ultimate compressive strength of the aluminium panel 4 552 kn is 8 larger than that of the steel one 4 180 kn this proves that the proposed criteria eqs 1 4 can be used to design the equivalent stiffened panel that has the close maximum compressive load as the original one in both the elastic and the ultimate limit fig 11 the mass of the aluminium panel 408 kg is only equal to 52 mass of the steel panel 798 kg this result coincides with the conclusion of kasten 2016 4 3 effect of openings the results of aluminium and steel stiffened panels with 250 mm openings on the web of the longitudinal girders are shown in figs 12 17 and the analysed ultimate loads are given in table 5 it is observed that all cases have the same collapse deformation beam column type that is similar to the intact panels figs 9 and 10 the ultimate strength of the aluminium and steel panels with 250 mm openings only shows a small discrepancy 4 with that of the intact panels thus the design of the novel stiffened panels with 460 mm depth girders including 250 mm openings are satisfactory in the aspect of same axial structural stiffness however the stress distribution in the longitudinal girders fig 14 and the behaviour of each panel in the plastic region differ to the others the aluminium and steel panels also show different structural behaviours regarding the aluminium panels with 250 mm openings fig 15 shows that the compressive stresses at the end of the linear regime and the beginning of the post buckling stage are slightly larger than that of the intact aluminium panel then they suddenly drop close to the stress strain curve of al intact panel due to the occurrence of the local buckling in the web of girders resulting from the stress concentration around the openings for instance fig 16 typically expresses the stress concentration and local buckling shape of the web plate of panel al e250 m and similar behaviours are also found in cases al e250 n al c250 m and al c250 n after reaching the ultimate limit the average stresses gradually reduce but still maintain high values the average stress strain curves of the steel stiffened panels with 250 mm openings fig 17 show the same trend to the aluminium ones fig 15 the compressive stresses of the steel panels with openings are not significantly higher than that of the intact steel panel during the entire loading process however the drop of the compressive stresses does not occur in the plastic region before the ultimate load table 5 shows that the ultimate strength of aluminium panels with 250 mm openings are higher 8 10 than that of the corresponding steel panels the novel panels with openings are slightly more massive than the intact panels specifically 4 5 for aluminium panels and 5 6 for steel panels moreover the ratios of the ultimate strength to the mass f u mass of the stiffened panels with openings are slightly smaller than that of the intact panels among these panels aluminium panel al c250 m and steel panel st c250 m show the highest values 11 1 and 5 1 kn kg respectively which are very close to the intact panels 11 2 and 5 2 kn kg respectively while panel al e250 n and st e250 n show the smallest values 10 5 and 4 8 kn kg the f u mass ratios of the steel panels are about 46 of the aluminium ones it demonstrates the effectiveness of aluminium alloy in comparison with mild steel the aluminium panels have not only higher ultimate strength but also almost 50 lighter weight than the steel ones returning to figs 9 and 10 it is observed that the von mises stress spreads rather uniformly along the length and the height of the girder however in the stiffened panels with perforated webs fig 14 the stress distribution on the longitudinal girders of all panels is not similar with different shapes and positions of the openings the maximum level of stresses concentrating at the upper and the lower edges of the openings are different from the intact panels in the panels with openings located at the mid height of the web al e250 m al c250 m st e250 m and st c250 m the stress distributes in a large area at the lower and upper edges of the openings while it concentrates in a small area near the flange in the panels al e250 n al c250 n st e250 n and st c250 n the concentration of the maximum stress probably causes the drop of compressive loads in the post buckling region of the aluminium panels fig 15 as a result the ultimate strength of the former with openings at the mid height of the web is more significant than that of the latter table 5 the maximum discrepancies of the ultimate strength found in cases al c250 and st e250 are about 4 the effect of different shapes sizes and positions of openings on the behaviour and the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels are depicted in fig 18 and tables 6 and 7 generally all cases show similar structural behaviour and their dominant failure mode is the beam column type similar to the intact panels the ultimate strength of the panels decreases with the increase of the opening size fig 18 tables 6 and 7 reveal a small divergence of the ultimate strength between the stiffened panels with different types of opening the panels with circular holes are likely to have a higher ultimate compressive load capacity than the panels with an elliptical hole even though the cutout area of the former is slightly larger than that of the latter it is mainly due to the longitudinal girder with uniformly distributed circular holes can suffer more significant compressive load than that with an elliptical hole at the mid span moreover the panels with openings at the middle of the height have slightly higher load carrying capacities than the panels with openings near the flange up to 6 tables 6 and 7 also show the ratio of the ultimate load to mass the panels with circular holes at the middle of the height show the maximum values while the panels with an elliptical hole near the flange present the minimum values the ratios of aluminium panels are almost twice that of steel panels this confirms the effectiveness of the aluminium alloy in comparison with the steel again 4 4 effect of haz both the width of the haz and the deterioration of yield stress in the haz may affect the structural behaviour and ultimate strength of welded aluminium structures thus two more analyses are performed in the intact aluminium stiffened panels one panel without haz al w0 while the other with 30 mm width of the haz al w30 as recommended in en1999 1 1 2009 the results show that the three stiffened panels have the same failure mode and nearly similar stress distribution at the ultimate limit state fig 19 shows that the structural behaviours in the elastic regime of the panel al w0 without haz al intact with 25 mm width of haz and al w30 with 30 mm width of haz are similar the ultimate strength of al intact 82 31 n mm2 is 5 9 smaller than that of al w0 87 46 n mm2 while the ultimate strength of al w30 81 40 n mm2 is 1 1 and 6 9 smaller than that of al intact and al w0 respectively it means that the reduction of yield strength in the haz and the width of haz does not make any change in the failure shape but significantly decreases the ultimate bearing capacity of the panel the width of the haz has a strong effect on the reduction of the ultimate strength the influence of haz could be more significant if considering the areas at the intersections between the web of stiffening members or between the web and flange therefore this characteristic needs to be taken into account during the design and strength assessment of welded aluminium structures 5 conclusions this study analyses and compares the ultimate compressive strength of equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels illustrating the influence of haz initial imperfections boundary conditions and presence of openings on the web of longitudinal girders based on the obtained results some concluding remarks are drawn as follows the aluminium alloys show a good replacement for the steels structures designed based on the proposed formulations although the equivalent aluminium and steel stiffened panels have the same strength in the linear elastic region the aluminium panels show not only higher ultimate compressive strength but also nearly 50 lighter than the equivalent steel panels the novel stiffened panels with 250 mm openings girders are in good agreement with the intact panels in the aspect of the deformation mode and the structural strength with no significant increase in the structural mass less than 6 in the considered panels this type of structure is a right substitute solution for fast displacement yachts large passenger or ro ro ships the opening takes an essential part in changing the stress distribution and diverging the ultimate load carrying capacity of the stiffened panels the ultimate strength of the panels varies significantly with the change of shape size and position of openings it is recommended that the openings are placed far away from the flange of the girders to prevent the ultimate strength loss the boundary conditions at the transverse edges have a considerable influence on the buckling and or collapse mode and the ultimate compressive strength of the stiffened panel in case of the double bay model the simply supported the fully clamped or the partially restrained boundary conditions are likely to change the structural behaviour and overestimate the ultimate strength of the panel while the periodic boundary condition seems to have a logical explanation on the effect of the adjacent structures however applying this boundary condition into an experimental test for validating the numerical simulation is not straightforward credit authorship contribution statement van tuyen doan methodology writing

22024,large diameter monopiles supporting offshore wind turbines owts are subjected to intermittent episodes of cycling and reconsolidation during the lifetime the lateral soil pile stiffness is likely to degrade during the cycling but tends to recover during the subsequent reconsolidation the former effect has been widely acknowledged in monopile design while the latter is less commonly recognized this study aims to a investigate the effects of episodic cycling and reconsolidation on the evolution of cumulative displacement stiffness and bending moment of large diameter monopiles in soft clay and to b analyze their consequences to the structural safety of the owt i e evolving natural frequency f n and thus likelihood of resonance a series of centrifuge tests were performed to simulate laterally loaded monopiles subjected to multi stage episodic cycling and reconsolidation the experimental results show that the lateral soil pile stiffness degrades during the initial cycling episode but it entirely recovers during the subsequent reconsolidation to exceed the initial stiffness with a percentage increase up to 50 consequently the cumulative lateral pile head displacement and maximum bending moment induced by the 3rd episode of cycling can be 63 and 15 smaller than that due to the 1st episode respectively the effects of episodic cycling and reconsolidation on the lateral stiffness displacement and bending moment of the pile become more pronounced as the cyclic amplitude increases despite these observed beneficial effects the stiffer lateral pile response after the reconsolidation would have increased f n of a typical 6 mw turbine founded on the monopile by up to 13 i e from 0 206 to 0 232 hz forcing it to unfavorably approach the 3p frequency limit that could trigger resonance keywords centrifuge modeling monopile soft clay cyclic loading reconsolidation 1 introduction monopiles are widely used for supporting offshore wind turbines owts zhang et al 2016 stone et al 2018 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 accounting for more than 80 of currently installed owts ewea 2016 differing from the piles with relatively small diameters d less than 2 5 m used in the offshore oil and gas industry the diameters of the piles supporting owts are usually in the range between 4 and 6 m leblanc et al 2010 negro et al 2017 which can be regarded as large diameter monopiles achmus et al 2007 ahmed and hawlader 2016 in the lifetime of an offshore foundation it often experiences intermittent episodes of severe cyclic loading e g during storm event with long intervening periods of minimal loading in calm weather between each storm zhang et al 2011 yi et al 2014 it has been revealed from t bar penetrometer tests involving episodes of cyclic remolding and reconsolidations that the soil stiffness and strength reduce during the remolding and partly or fully recover during the reconsolidation depending on the cyclic amplitude hodder et al 2009a b white and hodder 2010 these important findings have posed additional challenge in predicting the lifetime variations of lateral pile soil stiffness of a monopile which governs the cumulative displacement and dynamic response e g resonance of the owt jia et al 2018 to understand the lifetime variation in lateral pile soil stiffness valuable efforts in the form of physical and numerical investigations have been taken by many researchers matlock 1970 jeanjean 2009 zhang et al 2011 bhattacharya and adhikari 2011 su et al 2014 wang et al 2015 lau 2015 he et al 2017 hong et al 2017a truong 2017 chong 2017 chong and pasten 2018 chong et al 2019 liang et al 2018 liao et al 2018 wang et al 2019a 2019b in these studies all the possible loadings that a pile can experience in its lifetime were typically converted to one extreme episode of constant amplitude cycling or to a few successive episodes of loading with an increasing amplitude with no attempt made to capture the effect of reconsolidation the combined effects of episodic cycling and reconsolidation on lateral response of a pile in soft clay were explored by zhang et al 2011 through one centrifuge model test in the test a fixed head small diameter short rigid pile diameter d 0 6 m embedded length l 4 5 m in prototype was loaded by episodes of cyclic translational displacement at a large amplitude 0 5d with an intervening period of reconsolidation between each loading episode the experimental results shown that the lateral pile soil stiffness had degraded to 43 of the initial intact stiffness after the 1st episode of remolding while it had partly recovered back to 75 of the initial stiffness after the subsequent five episodes of reconsolidation these results had offered novel insights into the effect of reconsolidation on the lateral stiffness of fix head small diameter short rigid piles subjected to large cyclic displacement which fully remolded the soil around the pile the findings of zhang et al 2011 are mainly applicable to the fixed head zero rotation at pile head small diameter pile which exhibits a translational movement equal lateral displacement at different pile depths during the lateral loading under this circumstance a laterally loaded fixed head pile would remold the soil around the full embedded depth of the pile causing reconsolidation to occur along the full pile depth during the intervening period after cycling the quantitative results reported by zhang et al 2011 may not be extrapolated to the widely used free head large diameter pile free rotation at pile head which may only deflect near its upper half under a cyclic lateral loading and cause reconsolidation in the soil at shallow depth the lack of investigation into the evolution of the lateral stiffness of free head large diameter monopiles due to episodic cycling and reconsolidation has limited reliable analysis of the cumulative lateral displacement and the variation in the natural frequency of an owt supported by a monopile this study presents a series of centrifuge tests to investigate the lateral behavior of large diameter monopiles i e d 4 and 6 m in normally consolidated fine grained seabed subjected to multi stage episodic cycling and reconsolidation the test program has considered typical diameters of monopile i e d 4 and 6 m and a broad range of cyclic amplitudes i e 25 65 of the monotonic ultimate capacity the influence of reconsolidation between stages of cyclic loads on the lateral displacement stiffness and bending moment of the monopile was investigated and quantified their consequences to the structural safety of an owt supported by a monopile i e the evolving natural frequency and likelihood of resonance were also examined and discussed with the practical implications 2 centrifuge modeling all the centrifuge model tests reported in this study were performed at a centrifugal acceleration of 100 g at the geotechnical centrifuge facility of the hong kong university of science and technology the centrifuge has an arm radius of 4 2 m and can operate at up to 150 g with a maximum payload of 400 g t further details on the centrifuge have been reported by ng et al 2001a 2002 2 1 test program and objective typical diameters of a monopile fall within the range between 4 and 6 m in practice leblanc et al 2010 negro et al 2017 thus two representative diameter monopiles i e d 4 and 6 m were adopted in this study the test program consists of two monotonic tests on piles with two diameters d 4 and 6 m in prototype and two multi stage cyclic loading tests on the two piles the monotonic tests were firstly carried out to identify the monotonic ultimate lateral capacity f u of the two piles each cyclic loading test for piles with d 4 and 6 m respectively consists of three stages where repeated lateral loading with three different cyclic amplitudes i e 25 45 and 65 f u was successively applied after each episode of cycling an intervening period of reconsolidation was simulated to allow dissipation of pore water pressure before the commencement of the next loading stage the duration for each episode of reconsolidation was determined based on the dissipation curve of pore water pressure measured adjacent to the pile fig 1 shows the typical procedures of the episodic cycling and reconsolidation of the 6 m diameter monopile although the standard procedure of multi stage cycling with an increasing cyclic amplitude was adopted matlock 1970 jeanjean 2009 hong et al 2017a it is possible that the pile response would be affected by the previous loading history the stress history effects can be minimized when the magnitude of the cyclic stress is larger than the previous cyclic stress levels brown and hyde 1975 provided that applied stress does not induce a ratcheting response in plastic strain i e the plastic strain rate increases with number of cycles it was also found by jeanjean 2009 and hong et al 2017a through centrifuge tests simulating cyclically loaded piles in clay that a preceding loading episode with a lower cyclic amplitude had barely altered the pile response due to the subsequent cycling episode with a higher cyclic amplitude in this study the response of the pile subjected to cycling episodes at 65 f u was therefore unlikely to be significantly altered by the previous cycling episodes at 25 and 45 f u in practice a pile is to be cyclically loaded with a frequency ranging between 0 01 and 1 hz under the combined action of wind and wave nikitas et al 2017 according to the scaling law for frequency which is 1 n see taylor 1995 where n means the centrifugal acceleration is n times of the gravitational acceleration the frequency of input cyclic load in the centrifuge test would fall into the range between 1 and 100 hz in model scale to avoid any inertial effects caused by high frequency loading the lower bound of the frequency range i e 1 hz was adopted in this study and also elsewhere jeanjean 2009 zakeri et al 2016 hong et al 2017a it has been a common practice to study the lateral cyclic behavior of piles subjected to either one way or symmetrical two way cycling matlock 1970 jeanjean 2009 hong et al 2017a truong 2017 wang et al 2017 as elaborated schematically in fig 2 in this study only one way cycling fig 2 a was adopted in each cyclic loading test because the one way cycling is intuitively anticipated to and has been shown to produce larger cumulative lateral displacement than the symmetrical two way cycling long and vanneste 1994 haiderali et al 2015 he et al 2017 in other words one way cycling represents the worst case scenario if the cumulative lateral displacement is a major concern e g for piles supporting offshore wind turbines 2 2 centrifuge model package fig 3 a shows the plan view of the centrifuge model package at 100 g the dimensions of the model box represent a plan area of 99 0 m 124 5 m and a depth of 85 m in prototype in this study different values were adopted for the spacing between the pile and the container 8d and for the spacing between neighboring piles 5d these spacings were pre determined based on preliminary three dimensional finite element analyses before the centrifuge tests the numerical analyses were carried out using an advanced hypoplastic clay model masin 2005 2014 which had been calibrated against centrifuge tests on cyclically loaded lateral piles in kaolin clay hong et al 2017a the computed results suggest that the boundary effect becomes almost negligible when the spacing between the pile and the container reaches 8d meanwhile the interaction between the two neighboring piles being laterally loaded in the opposite direction as shown in fig 3 a tends to minimize while adopting a spacing of 5d the former i e 8d between the pile and the container is similar to the computed results revealed from dong et al 2018 s study which suggests a spacing of 7 5d between pile and lateral boundary of container while the latter a spacing of 5d between piles is further confirmed in our centrifuge model tests where negligible bending moment and excess pore water pressure were developed along the neighboring pile located 5d away from the pile subjected to lateral load see section 3 2 monotonic lateral response for details fig 3 b shows the elevation view of the centrifuge model package which consists of two strata namely a 720 mm thick 72 m in prototype malaysia kaolin layer underlain with a 50 mm thick 5 m in prototype sandy layer for bottom drainage floating piles with an identical embedded depth of 600 mm 60 m in prototype were installed in the upper fine grained soil two pore water pressure transducers ppts were installed in the soil adjacent to the two cyclically loaded piles to measure the cumulative excess pore water pressure due to cyclic loading each pile was laterally loaded with either monotonic or repeated forces the servo controlled hydraulic actuator which was mounted on a rigid reaction beam the location and loading direction of the hydraulic actuator can be flexibly adjusted for the loading test of each pile a load cell was attached to the extension rod of the actuator for measuring the lateral load imposed to the pile the lateral displacement at the loading point of each pile was measured via one linear variable differential transformer lvdt attached to the extension rod of the actuator 2 3 model piles fig 4 shows the instrumented model piles with a diameter of 40 and 60 mm 4 and 6 m in prototype respectively adopted in the centrifuge tests each model pile was made of a 750 mm long 75 m in prototype aluminum alloy pipe different from the short embedded length of monopiles in europe i e 20 30 m leblanc et al 2010 where the owts usually sit on overconsolidated stiff clay abadie 2015 lau 2015 a very soft clayey or silty seabed is frequently encountered in the chinese offshore wind farm cai et al 2010 di et al 2013 under this circumstance relatively long embedded depth i e usually exceeding 55 m liao et al 2018 is required to ensure sufficient lateral resistance for monopiles in soft clay or silt a typical embedded length of 600 mm 60 m in prototype was therefore chosen for each pile simulated in the centrifuge tests reported herein the elastic modulus of the model piles e p was 72 gpa the moment of inertia i p for the cross section of the hollow cylinder can be calculated by i p π d 4 64 1 d 2 t d 4 where d and t denote the outer diameter and wall thickness of the hollow pile respectively based on the scaling law for the flexural rigidity e p i p of the pile 1 n4 where n is the centrifugal acceleration see taylor 1995 the prototype value e p i p of the piles with diameters of 4 and 6 m in prototype is 3 11 108 knm2 and 11 05 108 knm2 respectively it can be readily deduced that these values of flexural rigidity of the model piles of the former and the latter are corresponding to those of the 4 and 6 m diameter steel piles with a wall thickness of 0 06 m in prototype these pile dimensions in both model and prototype scale are summarized in table 1 if the model piles were made of steel the wall thickness has to be as thin as 0 6 mm to achieve the same flexural rigidity given the difficulty of fabricating the steel pipe with an ultra thin wall thickness 0 6 mm aluminum pipe was adopted in this study and also elsewhere lau 2015 zhu et al 2016 hong et al 2017a it is worth noting that for model piles the scaling relationships were mainly concerned with pile dimensions and flexural rigidity which have been readily satisfied in this study on the other hand the pile mass had not been intentionally scaled and compensated in this study as it was found to display a negligible effect on the lateral pile behavior haiderali et al 2013 the type of aluminum alloy used is 7075 t6 which exhibits an ultimate yield strength of 503 mpa each model pile was instrumented with 27 sets of strain gauges full wheatstone bridge configuration to measure the bending moments strain gauges were fixed on the surface of each model pile a 1 mm thick coating of epoxy was applied to the surface of each instrumented model pile for protection and waterproof of the strain gauges direct shear box tests on the interface between epoxy and kaolin suggest the friction coefficient μ between the two materials is approximately 0 30 hong and ng 2013 this closely mimics the interface between steel pile and soft clay i e μ 0 31 randolph and wroth 1981 the flexural stiffness of the foil type of strain gauge is almost negligible as compared to that of the aluminum pile while the stiffness of the epoxy coating young s modulus 2 1 gpa cannot be ignored with the known dimensions and modulus of the epoxy coating it can be readily calculated that its presence has resulted in an increase of flexural stiffness of each model pile by no more than 2 in the calibration for bending moment measurement each instrumented pile was horizontally aligned with its two edges being simply supported see fig 5 a a point load was applied to the middle span of the pile five successive steps of dead weight were applied by adding the cumulative mass of 1 3 5 10 15 kg to the loading plate the loading mass was then released one by one for unloading three cycles of loading and unloading were repeated after applying step of loading or unloading the bending moment at each location with presence of a full wheatstone bridge strain gauges can be readily calculated using the beam theory and correlated to the output voltage given by the wheatstone bridge circuit the two variables for each level of strain gauges were found to linearly correlated with the coefficient of determination r2 exceeding 0 97 fig 5 b shows the calibration factor of each level of strain gauges installed on the two model piles with different diameters 4 and 6 m in prototype it can be seen that the calibration factors for different level of strain gauges vary slightly with a mean value of approximately 150 n m mv as proposed by poulos and hull 1989 the relative pile soil stiffness can be expressed as e p i p e s l 4 where e s and l are the soil modulus and pile embedded length respectively the critical values to define flexible and rigid piles are 0 0025 and 0 208 respectively poulos and hull 1989 i e pile behaves flexible or rigid when e p i p e s l 4 is either lower than 0 0025 or higher than 0 208 respectively the e s of malaysia kaolin used in this study is found to be approximately 400 times of its undrained shear strength wang et al 2019c i e e s 400s u following this correlation e s was estimated based on the average s u within the pile embedded depth kuo et al 2012 i e s u 46 2 kpa the dimensionless parameter e p i p e s l 4 of the pile with a diameter of 4 m is 0 0013 which suggests that it would have behaved as a flexible pile meanwhile the e p i p e s l 4 of the pile with a prototype diameter of 6 m is 0 0046 which exceeds the upper bound for a flexible pile 0 0025 but is below the lower bound for a rigid pile 0 208 which imply that it tends to behave as a semi rigid pile hong et al 2017a the major difference between semi rigid and rigid pile lies in the soil flow mechanisms around the two types of piles it has been revealed from hong et al 2017a s centrifuge tests and numerical analyses that the soils around a laterally loaded semi rigid pile exhibit three flow mechanisms i e wedge type mechanism near the surface full flow mechanism near the mid depth and rotational shear mechanism at greater depth on the other hand a laterally loaded rigid pile only results in wedge type mechanism near the surface and rotational shear mechanism at greater depth hong et al 2017a 2 4 model soil preparation the soil used in the centrifuge tests was malaysia kaolin which has been extensively used for geotechnical model tests ilyas et al 2004 xie et al 2012 hong et al 2017b zhu et al 2018 compression and shear behavior of the soil have been compressive tested as reported by hong et al 2017b 2019 table 2 summaries the index properties and geotechnical parameters of malaysia kaolin before placing any soil into the model box silicone grease was applied to its inner lateral boundaries for minimizing the friction between the soil and the model box a thin layer of toyoura sand 50 mm thick was then rained into the model box to serves as a drainage layer the sandy layer was saturated by applying a low hydraulic gradient seepage flow from the bottom of the model box after the saturation of the bottom sandy layer a piece of geotextile was placed on the top of the sand surface before pouring the slurry of the malaysia kaolin into the model box to avoid the flow of the kaolin slurry into the voids between the sand particles de aired slurry of malaysia kaolin with an initial water content being approximately twice of its liquid limit i e 130 was then carefully poured into the model box to avoid introducing gas bubbles which could significantly alter the mechanical behavior of the fine grained soil hong et al 2020 the slurry was consolidated one dimensionally at 1 g by applying deadweight on a rigid plate that covers the top of the soil surface five successive steps of vertical loading were applied with the cumulative vertical loading equal to 1 5 10 15 and 20 kpa after the consolidation at 1 g the model box was transferred to the platform of the centrifuge and spun up to 100 g for self weight consolidation the degree of consolidation was determined based on the ground surface settlements measured by the two lvdts see fig 3 b in conjunction with tan et al 1991 s method in the method the relationship between the measured consolidation settlement s and time t is fitted by a hyperbolic function of s t α βt where α and β are two fitting parameters the ultimate soil settlement s ult was estimated to be 1 β the instantaneous degree of consolidation u can then be readily calculated as u s s ult fig 6 a shows the distribution of effective vertical stress in the clay bed after primary consolidation at 100 g which was solely due to the self weight of the clay the figure also includes the distribution of effective vertical stress in the clay immediately before the centrifuge model test at 1 g but after soil sample preparation this distribution was resulted from both surface surcharge 20 kpa and the self weight of the clay at 1 g while calculating the self weight of the clay bed an average value of effective unit weight γ 6 kn m3 was adopted based on the distributions of the effective vertical stress in fig 6 a the variation of overconsolidation ratio ocr of malaysia kaolin with depth as shown in fig 6 b can be readily calculated by 1 ocr σ vp σ vs where σ vp and σ vs denote the historical maximum of vertical effective stress and the current vertical effective stress at 100 g respectively at 100 g the clay within a depth of 3 m in prototype is over consolidated because the current effective vertical stress in this region is smaller than its historical maximum 20 kpa when the depth exceeds 3 m in prototype the current effective vertical stress of the soil at 100 g was larger than the historical maximum vertical stress 20 kpa and thus it became normally consolidated ocr 1 the undrained shear strength profile of the soil sample was assessed in flight by a t bar penetrometer where the diameter and length of the bar are 6 5 and 35 mm in model scale respectively the location of the t bar penetration is also included in fig 3 a the distance from the outer boundary of the t bar to its closet boundary of the model container 23b bar is larger than the minimum allowable distance that would eliminate the boundary effect for t bar penetration testing i e 10b bar house et al 2001 einav and randolph 2005 given the availability of different devices to obtain the undrained shear strength profile e g t bar penetrometer and cone penetrometer the former is used in the centrifuge model tests reported herein this is because the process of the bar penetrating through soft clay is associated with a well recognized failure mechanism i e full flow around the bar einav and randolph 2005 martin and randolph 2006 mahmoodzadeh et al 2015 for which the ultimate penetration resistance and thus the undrained shear strength can be rigorously quantified by an exact solution proposed by randolph and houlsby 1984 to ensure an undrained condition of clay during t bar penetration or pile soil interaction the moving rate v of t bar or pile in the soil should meet the following criterion stewart and randolph 1991 2 v 20 c v b where c v and b represent the diameter of the t bar penetrometer or pile and the vertical consolidation coefficient of the soil c v 40 m2 year of malaysia kaolin purwana 2007 respectively based on the bar diameter b bar 6 5 mm in model scale and the coefficient of consolidation of the soil the undrained penetration rate should exceed 3 9 mm s in model scale a penetration rate of 5 mm s was therefore adopted in this study after the t bar penetration test at 100 g the centrifuge was spun down to 1 g for installing model piles ppts and lateral pile loading system to facilitate the installation of ppts one lateral wall of the model box was dismantled small holes were drilled horizontally through the malaysia kaolin to the target positions using a hand auger with a horizontal guiding plate the ppts were then inserted into the pre drilled holes following the installation kaolin slurry was injected to fill up the cavity if any surrounding each ppt each pile was pushed vertically into the designed embedded depth by an actuator to avoid pile bulking during the installation process the model piles were installed at 1 g rather than high g which is commonly adopted in centrifuge modeling of laterally loaded piles jeanjean 2009 truong and lehane 2017 hong et al 2017a installing piles at high g will generate large horizontal stresses around the pile shaft comparing to that at 1 g which significantly affects axial pile responses ko et al 1984 taylor 1995 however for laterally loaded piles the effects of pile installation at 1 g is generally thought to be less pronounced craig 1984 compared the lateral behavior for piles installed at 1 g and 52 5 g and concluded the differences between the two were minor for example the initial stiffness of a pile installed at 1 g was approximately 10 smaller than that of a pile installed at 52 5g bouafia and garnier 1991 and anusic et al 2019 also found that various installation methods including jacking hammering and placement in boreholes presumably at 1 g have negligible effect on lateral responses of pile this is likely because the lateral pile response is controlled by soil extending some distance away from the zone of installation induced disturbance gabr et al 1994 instead of the local stress distribution in the close vicinity to the pile after all the preparations the entire model package was spun up to 100 g again for re consolidation lateral monotonic or cyclic pile test was carried out after the primary consolidation of the soil as indicated by the measured soil settlement and dissipation of excess pore pressures for clarity all the procedures for model soil preparation are summarized in table 3 3 interpretation of the test results in the following sections all the results are presented in prototype scale unless stated otherwise 3 1 undrained shear strength profile fig 6 b shows the profile of undrained shear strength s u deduced from the t bar penetration test the undrained soil strength s u can be determined by s u q n kt where n kt and q denote the bearing capacity factor of the t bar penetrometer and the penetration resistance respectively the value of n kt is taken as 10 5 which was suggested by randolph and houlsby 1984 based on a plasticity analysis and has been widely used in the interpretation of t bar penetration results in centrifuge and field tests stewart and randolph 1991 martin and randolph 2006 wang and brandenberg 2013 the measured strength profile reveals an approximately linear increase in s u with depth the rate of increase of s u per unit depth is 1 54 kpa m in prototype scale which is close to those ranging between 1 45 and 1 56 kpa m obtained by zhu et al 2018 and xie et al 2012 who carried out t bar penetration tests on malaysia kaolin the major influence depth of the laterally loaded pile is approximately within a depth of 6 d randolph and gourvenec 2011 he et al 2017 liao et al 2018 i e 24 and 36 m for the piles with d 4 and 6 m respectively based on the fitted strength profile i e s u 1 54z as see fig 6 b it can be readily calculated that the average s u values of the soil within the major influence depth for the piles with d 4 and 6 m are approximately 18 and 28 kpa respectively 3 2 monotonic lateral response fig 7 shows the measured monotonic load displacement response of the 4 and 6 m diameter monopiles at a location of 8 m above the ground surface of each pile see the inset of the figure given the lack of an obvious yield point in each load displacement curve kulhawy and chen 1995 s method was used to deduce the ultimate lateral capacity f u of each pile details of the method has been given in the literature e g kulhawy and chen 1995 ng et al 2001b hong et al 2017a following kulhawy and chen 1995 s method a hyperbolic curve is used to fit the measured load displacement data as follows 3 f y m n y where f and y are the lateral load and the resulting lateral pile displacement respectively m and n are both fitting parameters the reciprocal of n is related to the interpreted ultimate lateral resistance f u the fitting results are also shown in fig 7 the value of f u of the monopile with d 4 and 6 m can be deduced as 30 and 54 mn in prototype respectively these have offered the bases to determine the cycling amplitudes i e 25 45 and 65 f u see fig 1 to be applied in the multi stage cyclic loading tests to evaluate if the spacing between the piles in the same model box is sufficiently large for minimizing the boundary effect the influence of a laterally loaded pile d 6 m on its neighboring pile d 4 m was examined fig 8 a illustrates the bending moment of the pile with d 4 m in response to the monotonic lateral loading of the adjacent pile with d 6 m see the inset in fig 8 a while fig 8 b shows the pore water pressure in front of the pile with d 4 m see the inset in the figure for its location during the monotonic lateral loading of the adjacent pile with d 6 m no notable response was observed in terms of bending moment in the pile with d 4 m and the pore water pressure adjacent to the pile during the entire process of the lateral loading of the pile with d 6 m it is worth noting that the 6 m diameter monopile was monotonically pushed to a large lateral displacement of up to 0 3d at the loading point which is larger than the cumulative displacement in the cyclically loaded piles see fig 9 these observations suggest the influence of either monotonic or cyclically loaded piles on their neighboring piles could be negligible i e with no notable boundary effect 3 3 effect of episodic cycling and reconsolidation on load displacement response fig 9 shows the typical cyclic load displacement responses of the monopile with d 6 m during the three successive episodes of repeated loading at a cyclic amplitude of 65 f u for clarity only the cyclic responses during the 1st 10th and 90th 100th cycles in each loading episode are plotted in fig 9 a and b respectively the soil around the cyclically loaded pile exhibited an undrained response during each loading cycle but was partially drained during each full loading episode that consists of 100 cycles it is worth noting the soil sample was undergoing consolidation under during the entire process of the pile testing during the cycling the loading frequency 1 hz was relatively high such that the rate of loading exceeded the rate of pore water pressure dissipation causing significant accumulation of excess pore water pressure with number of cycles see fig 10 following each cycling episode the lateral loading was removed while the irrecoverable component of excess pore water pressure see δu ir in fig 10 still remained and would dissipate during the subsequent intervening period of reconsolidation without load as anticipated each episode of undrained cycling has led to an increase in the cumulative displacement including both peak and residual displacements with number of cycles which was accompanied by degradation of the unloading stiffness i e secant stiffness between the load reversal points leblanc et al 2010 the rates of both displacement accumulation and stiffness degradation in each loading episode reduce with number of cycles which suggest a progressively stabilized or shakedown response after each episode of undrained cycling the lateral load applied to the pile was released which allowed an intervening period of reconsolidation i e dissipation of the excess pore water pressure accompanied by a reduced void ratio of the soil around the pile owing to this reconsolidation effect the pile behaves stiffer during the subsequent loading episode compared to that at the corresponding number of cycle during the preceding loading episode as a result each intervening period of reconsolidation has led to a smaller cumulative lateral pile displacement and less significant stiffness degradation during the subsequent cycling at a given amplitude the percentage reductions of the former and latter due to the episodic reconsolidation are up to 63 and 5 respectively more detailed interpretation and quantification of the cumulative displacement and stiffness variation of the pile are presented in the following sections 3 4 pore water pressure response fig 10 a shows a typical pore water pressure response in front of the 6 m diameter monopole during the three episodes of cycling cyclic amplitude 65 f u and the intervened reconsolidation process the pore water pressure was measured at a distance of 4 m 0 67d in front of the monopile and at a depth of 24 m 4d below the ground surface in the figure the excess pore water pressure δu is normalized by the initial vertical effective stress σ v at the corresponding location as anticipated a positive excess pore water pressure is developed in the fine grained soil during each episode of cycling this is followed by a dissipation of excess pore water pressure during each subsequent reconsolidation process for clarity the excess pore water pressure response during each episode of cycling was extracted and replotted with number of cycles as shown in fig 10 b as illustrated at any given loading cycle in each episode the total excess pore water pressure is composed of a recoverable component δu r and an irrecoverable component δu ir the magnitude of δu ir is associated with the level of plastic strain developed in the soil during the 1st episode of cycling the magnitude of δu ir significantly accumulates but at a decreasing rate with number of cycles this is accompanied by plastic straining and softened the soil around the pile as implied from the accumulation of irrecoverable lateral pile displacement and degradation of lateral pile stiffness see fig 9 after each episode of reconsolidation the accumulation rate of the excess pore water pressure during the subsequent episode of loading with the same cyclic amplitude is smaller than that induced by the preceding episode of lateral cycling quantitatively the cumulative δu ir due to the 3rd episode of cycling is 67 smaller than that induced by the 1st episode of cycling this suggests the state of the soil around the pile becomes denser after each reconsolidation which has led to smaller irrecoverable cumulative pile displacement and less degradation of lateral pile stiffness see fig 9 3 5 cumulative lateral pile displacement during episodic cycling and reconsolidation fig 11 a and fig 11 b show the developments of the normalized cumulative peak displacement y p n y p 1 and the residual displacement y r n y r 1 of the 6 m diameter monopile respectively the terms y p 1 and y p n denote the cumulative peak displacement at the 1st and n th cycles in each loading episode while the terms y r 1 and y r n denote the cumulative residual displacement at the 1st and n th cycles in each loading episode respectively for a given amplitude of cyclic loading much smaller cumulative peak and residual pile displacements are induced in the 3rd loading episode compared to those in the 1st this is because the lateral stiffness of the pile has increased which will be quantified in the following section as a result of reconsolidation during the loading episodes this suggests that the most pronounced cumulative lateral displacement of a monopile developed during the 1st storm event in its lifetime given that the loading amplitudes in the subsequent storm events are similar the displacement accumulation of the pile depends on the accumulation of strain in the soil chong and santamarina 2016 summarized the different functions used to quantify the evolution of permanent strains of soils experiencing cyclic loadings more details of the function are also given in chong 2017 a simple yet powerful numerical approach was developed by chong 2017 to simulate offshore foundations that are subjected to repetitive loads through incorporating a polynomial type strain accumulation function such a polynomial type function was also used in this study to fit and establish the relationship between the normalized cumulative displacement y p n y p 1 and y r n y r 1 and the number of cycles n 4 y n y 1 1 b 1 a n 1 a 1 c n 1 where a b and c are three fitting parameters the y n y 1 value increases with b value but decreases as a increases with this equation c 0 characterizes a shakedown response whereas c 0 features a ratcheting response the above equation was adopted in this study for fitting the measured cumulative displacement as shown in fig 11 a and b it can be seen that the trends of the cumulative peak and residual displacements induced by all cyclic amplitudes are well captured by the polynomial type function the fitting parameters a b and c of the monopiles with d 4 m and d 6 m are summarized in table 4 as can be seen all the values of c are equal to 0 which indicate a shakedown response of all the cumulative displacements during the 1st cycling episode the values of a for both the cumulative peak and residual displacements are approximately 0 85 being irrespective of the cyclic amplitude and pile diameter the values of b for the cumulative peak and residual displacements are approximately 0 06 and 0 16 respectively after the 1st intervening episode of reconsolidation the values of a increase while the values of b decrease both of which suggest less pile displacement accumulation in addition during the subsequent episodic cycling and reconsolidation the variations in both a and b values are negligible signifying the shakedown response of the pile the observed long term displacements of the large diameter monopiles d 4 and 6 m have offered valuable data to verify the existing theoretical or numerical models chong 2017 chong and pasten 2018 chong et al 2019 further parametric studies based on these models will in turn lead to a better understanding of long term response of monopiles 3 6 evolution of unloading stiffness during episodic cycling and reconsolidation fig 12 a and fig 12 b show the evaluation of the unloading and reloading stiffness of the two monopiles d 4 and 6 m during three successive loading episodes at a typical cyclic amplitude of 65 f u respectively the conventional definition of unloading and reloading stiffness of a laterally loaded pile i e secant stiffness between the reversal points of the unloading and reloading process on the pile load displacement curve leblanc et al 2010 wang et al 2018 achmus et al 2019 respectively is adopted in this study for the ease of comparison as presented during each episode of cycling of the piles the unloading and reloading stiffness degrades with number of cycles but at a decreasing rate after after each intervening period of reconsolidation however both the unloading and reloading stiffness are fully recovered and exceed the initial value during the preceding episode showing a similar trend for the monopile with d 6 m the initial unloading and reloading stiffness in the 3rd cycling episode are 1 50 and 1 47 times of those in the 1st loading episode respectively meanwhile the percentage reduction of the unloading and reloading stiffness due to 100 cycles of loading in the 3rd cycling episode becomes only 33 and 21 of that in the 1st loading episode similarly after two episodes of reconsolidation the unloading and reloading stiffness of the pile with d 4 m also exceeds the initial value during the first episode which are 1 38 and 1 34 times of those in the 1st loading episode respectively fig 13 a illustrates the evolution of the normalized unloading stiffness k n k 1 of the two monopiles d 4 and 6 with the increase with number of cycles at the loading amplitudes of 45 and 65 f u the terms k n and k 1 denote the unloading stiffness at the n th and 1st cycles of each episode of cycling this figure further suggests that for all the diameters and cycling amplitudes considered herein the most significant stiffness degradation occurs during the 1st loading episode obviously based on fig 13 a it is not possible to generalize the various trends in stiffness degradation exhibited by piles with different diameters under varying amplitudes of cycling by fitting with a single equation an attempt was therefore made to link the normalized stiffness degradation k n k 1 to the normalized cumulative residual displacement y r n y r 1 of each pile in each loading episode as shown in fig 13 b the results of the two monopiles d 4 and 6 m are all shown in the figure as observed all the data pertaining to the stiffness degradation broadly merge into a single trend which can be described by a single linear equation see fig 13 b irrespective of the number of loading episodes loading amplitude and pile diameter this is probably owing to the reason that the residual displacement of a pile reflects the level of plastic strain developed in the soil around the pile which determines the degradation in soil stiffness the unified trend shown in fig 13 b suggests that the degradation in lateral pile stiffness in any storm season can be approximated based on the measured cumulative residual displacement in that season with there being no need to explicitly consider the history of reconsolidation it is worth noting that the linear equation from fig 13 b are deduced from only the two tests on piles with two diameters in the same soil subjected to the cyclic loading with the same characteristic i e multi stage one way cycling with the same cyclic amplitude it has been well recognized that the stiffness degradation rate of a soil under cycling depends on many factors including soil plasticity or plastic index andersen 2015 and loading characteristic e g one way or two way cycling he et al 2017 therefore the extrapolation of the linear equation in fig 13 b to other scenarios should be treated with caution fig 14 shows the gain in the stiffness of the monopiles with d 4 and 6 m due to the intervening reconsolidation after the cycling episodes at different loading amplitudes 25 45 and 65 f u the figure also includes the results of the relevant centrifuge test zhang et al 2011 which simulated a fixed head small diameter short rigid pile in soft clay that was subjected to episodes of severe cycling translational cyclic displacement of 0 5d with a period of reconsolidation between successive loading episodes in the figure k ep n 1 and k ep 1 1 refer to the unloading lateral stiffness during the 1st cyclic of the n th and 1st loading episodes respectively despite the degradation in the stiffnesses of the two monopiles induced during each cycling episode see fig 13 a they fully recover after the reconsolidation and exceed the initial stiffness see fig 14 this implies that the effect of stiffness recovery due to reconsolidation plays a more predominate role by combating the damaging effects of cyclic loading the percentage stiffness gain increases with an increase in pile diameter and is up to 38 and 50 for the piles with d of 4 and 6 m respectively given the small difference in terms of percentage stiffness gain 12 and the lack of repeating tests it remains unclear if such difference was due to the influence of pile diameter or the variability in the data further tests covering a broad range of pile diameters will be carried out to investigate and quantify the effect of pile diameter on the level of stiffness gain due to reconsolidation unlike the observed full compensation of stiffness k ep n 1 k ep 1 1 1 by reconsolidation in the centrifuge tests reported herein the reconsolidation in zhang et al 2011 s tests had only led to a partial recovery of stiffness k ep n 1 k ep 1 1 1 after four episodes of cycling and reconsolidation the lateral pile stiffness was still 20 lower than its initial stiffness this is likely attribute to the specific experimental condition modelled in zhang et al 2011 s study in their study the cycling episode was likely to full remold the soil around the pile as a result of the large cyclic displacement imposed i e with a constant cyclic displacement equal of 0 5 d which is much larger than that in this study in other words the severe damaging effect of the large amplitude remolding in zhang et al 2011 s tests is more dominating than the reconsolidation effect due to the subsequent reconsolidation 3 7 peak and locked in bending moments fig 15 shows the typical profiles of the peak bending moment m p of the 6 m diameter pile which is induced in the last cycle i e the 100th cycle of each cycling episode at a loading amplitude of 65 f u the corresponding bending moment profiles at zero lateral load m l namely residual moment which was also defined as locked in bending moment by kirkwood and haigh 2014 are also included for comparison the locked in bending moment is linked to the residual deformation of the pile as a consequence of the plastic strain developed in the soil around the pile the values of both peak and locked in bending moments decrease when the number of loading episodes increases due to the stiffer response of the soil around the pile which results from reconsolidation in other words reconsolidation has played a beneficial role in reducing the peak load accommodate by the monopile it can be readily deduced from fig 15 that the difference between m l max and m p max at the 100th cycle during the 1st loading episode is 580 mnm this has been increased to 605 mnm at the 100th cycle during the 3rd loading episode as a result of the two intervening episodes of reconsolidation this suggests an increasing amplitude of cyclic bending stress and consequently an intensified level of fatigue damage following the episodes of reconsolidation in addition to the absolute values of m l and m p it is also critical to assess the ratio between maximum locked in bending moment and peak bending moment i e m l max m p max because the m l max m p max is associated with variation of cyclic bending stress and thus the fatigue damage accumulated in the monopile to generalize an equation for predicting the m l max m p max an attempt was made to plot the value of m l max m p max against normalized peak displacement y p d and cumulative residual displacement y r d in each episode of cycling of the two monopiles d 4 and 6 m subjected to various loading amplitudes i e 25 45 and 65 f u as shown in fig 16 a and fig 16 b respectively as shown in fig 16 a the normalized locked in moment m l max m p max does not appear to exhibit a unique trend with cumulative peak displacement conversely all the results of m l max m p max are converged to a single trend of linear correlation with the normalized residual displacement irrespective of the episodes of reconsolidation cyclic amplitude and pile diameter see fig 16 b similar observations were made from he et al 2017 s field experiments on laterally loaded piles in soft clay subjected to repeated loading without considering the effect of reconsolidation these experimental evidences suggest that the normalized locked in bending moment is intrinsically associated with the normalized residual displacement of pile which reflects the average level of plastic strain developed in the soil around the pile the m l max m p max could be therefore approximated solely based on the measured residual lateral displacement at the pile head 3 8 cyclic p y curves considering episodic cycling and reconsolidation based on the measured bending moment the soil reaction force p and the lateral pile deflection y can be deduced a 6th order polynomial is used to fit each bending moment profile which is found to yield the best fitting in this study and elsewhere zhu et al 2017 he et al 2017 the values of p and y are then respectively deduced by double derivation and double integration of the fitted bending moment profile i e p d 2 m d z 2 and y m e i d z 2 fig 17 a and fig 17 b show the deduced cyclic p y curves of the 6 m diameter monopile at two typical depths i e 2d and 4d below the ground surface as expected the cyclic p y curves at deeper depth exhibit higher soil resistance and stiffness at either depth the 1st episode of cycling without occurrence of reconsolidation has led to the degradation of the lateral soil resistance and accumulation of lateral pile displacement with increasing number of cycles similar observations were also made by jeanjean 2009 truong 2017 and liao et al 2018 after each intervening period of reconsolidation the resulted cyclic p y curves exhibit higher values of soil resistance and stiffness in conjunction with smaller rates in degradation of soil resistance and accumulation of lateral pile displacement a comparison between fig 17 a and b reveals that the effect of reconsolidation is more pronounced at shallower depth this is because the soil at shallower depth should have experienced a larger amplitude of cyclic loading relative to the strength at the corresponding depth causing higher level of soil densification and therefore strength and stiffness recovery during the subsequent reconsolidation 4 implications for structural safety of a monopile supporting an owt evolution of natural frequency the variations of lateral pile soil stiffness as measured in this experimental study have offered the opportunity to assess the evolution of natural frequency of an owt founded on a monopile in soft clay a simens 6 mw turbine arany et al 2016 in conjunction with the monopile with d 6 m as studied in the centrifuge test reported herein were adopted for the natural frequency analysis some key parameters of the simens 6 mw turbine are shown in fig 18 a to avoid any resonance and ultimately increased fatigue damage the initial natural frequency f n of the turbine structure should lie outside the so called 1p and 3p bands 1p is defined as the 1st order natural frequency of the turbine rotor it is worth noting that 1p is not a single frequency but a range of frequency associated with the lowest and the highest rotational speed of the rotor 3p is related to the dynamic load triggered when either of the three blades of a wind turbine passes the tower of the turbine structure once each of the blades passes the tower it obscures the shielded area of tower by the presence of the passing blade from the action of wind load resulting a dynamic load having frequency equal to three times the rotor frequency 3p for three bladed wind turbines arany et al 2016 according to the angular velocity of the turbine the 1p and 3p band of the wind turbine are 0 083 0 183 hz and 0 250 0 550 hz respectively following the routine practice the natural frequency of the simens 6 mw turbine was calculated using the simplified structural model as shown in fig 18 a following the routine practice for calculating the natural frequency of a wind turbine structure lombardi 2010 bhattacharya et al 2010 yang et al 2018 the soil that governs the dynamics of the turbine is simplified by two springs on the mudline i e transverse spring k l and rotational spring k r as suggested by lombardi 2010 the values of k l and k r can be respectively determined from the stiffness of the horizontal load displacement f y curve and moment rotation m θ curve on the mudline at a very small lateral pile displacement i e y d 1000 these values were deduced from the measured centrifuge test results at the 1st loading cycle of each cycling episode of the 6 m diameter monopile the numerical analysis was performed by building a beam spring model in the finite element program abaqus as shown in fig 18 b the tower was simulated by three dimensional beam elements b31 it was assumed to be linear elastic with typical properties of elastic modulus of 210 gpa poisson s ratio of 0 3 and density of 7850 kg m3 for steel the rotor and nacelle were modelled as a point mass placed at the top of the tower as routinely practiced for the springs on the mudline as shown in fig 18 a the spring 1 element in abaqus was adopted this type of spring element has six degrees of freedom as discussed only two degrees of freedom were considered in this study with adoption of k l and k r values deduced from the tests as the input parameters the dynamic analysis step in abaqus i e frequency was set to obtain the frequency of the owt the optimum mesh size of the beam i e δl was determined through trial and error it was found that when δl is no larger than 0 5 m a further decease of element length had resulted in a negligible change in the calculated frequency the δl value of 0 5 m was therefore adopted in this study fig 18 c shows the typical computed 1st frequency mode shape of the owt after two episodes of cycling and reconsolidation f 65 f u fig 19 shows the computed evolution of natural frequency of the owt it can be seen that the natural frequency of the owt structure increases with number of cycling episode due to a stiffer lateral pile response following each reconsolidation the level of increase in natural frequency becomes more pronounced at a higher cyclic amplitude which could have generated more excess pore water pressures around the pile and thus higher stiffness recovery after reconsolidation see fig 14 it is worth noting that the natural frequency of the owt structure after the 3rd cycling episode with a loading amplitude of 65 f u has unfavorably approached the 3p frequency limit to quantify the effect of episodic cycling and reconsolidation on the likelihood of resonance of the owt structure a factor of safety fs resonance is defined as follows 5 f s r e s o n a n c e f 3 p lb f 1 p ub f f 1 p ub where f is the natural frequency of the owt structure f 1p ub and f 3p lb are the upper bound of the 1p band and lower bound of the 3p band of the owt structure respectively when f exceeds f 3p lb fs resonance becomes smaller than the unity indicating the occurrence of resonance and vice versa according to this definition the initial factor of safety against resonance of the monopile with d 6 m supporting a simens 6 mw turbine is 3 2 as shown in fig 19 after three episodes of constant amplitude cycling with intervening periods of reconsolidation fs resonance decreases to 2 3 1 7 and 1 4 when the cyclic amplitude is 25 45 and 65 f u respectively this implies that the seasonal storm loadings with an intervening period of reconsolidation which often occurs in offshore areas of china may gradually increase the potential of resonance ignorance of such effect could have led to a non conservative structural design for the owt 5 summary and conclusions this study presents a series of centrifuge model tests to investigate the effects of episodic cycling and reconsolidation on the lateral cyclic responses of large diameter monopiles d 4 and 6 m in soft clay the physical investigation has led to the following conclusions 1 the unloading stiffness of a laterally loaded pile degrades during each cycling episode nevertheless it fully recovers during the subsequent intervening period of reconsolidation and exceeds its initial lateral stiffness the effect of reconsolidation on the recovery of lateral pile stiffness becomes more pronounced for piles subjected to higher cycling amplitudes the unloading stiffnesses of the monopiles with d 4 and 6 m increased to 138 and 150 of the initial value after two episodes of cycling and reconsolidation 2 after each episode of reconsolidation subsequent cycling episode results in a much smaller degradation in the lateral pile stiffness compared to that in the preceding episode for the same cycling amplitude the normalized stiffness degradations k n k 1 in all the cycling episodes however exhibit a unique linear relationship with the normalized cumulative residual displacement y r n y r 1 of the pile 3 in line with the evolutional trend of the lateral pile stiffness the cumulative lateral displacement cumulative peak displacement y p n and cumulative residual displacement y r n bending moment peak moment m p and locked in moment m l of the monopiles all increase with number of cycles in each cycling episode but reduce in the subsequent cycling episode owing to the stiffness gained during the intervening period of reconsolidation the ratio of m l max m p max which links the variation of cyclic bending stress and the fatigue damage in the pile shows a unique linear relationship with the residual pile displacement irrespective of the occurrence of reconsolidation cycling amplitude and pile diameter 4 after intervening periods of reconsolidation the resulted p y curves exhibit higher values of soil resistance and the soil resistance gain increases with pile diameter but decreases with soil depth 5 after three episodes of cycling and reconsolidation the natural frequency of a siemens 6 mw turbine on a 6 m diameter monopile would have increased from 0 206 to 0 232 hz which approaches the 3p frequency limit 0 25 hz ignorance of the reconsolidation effect on natural frequency can lead to a non conservative structural design for owt it should be noted that above conclusions were drawn based on centrifuge tests considering only two pile diameters d 4 and 6 m and may be specific to the particular test conditions and soil type adopted any extrapolation of the

22024,large diameter monopiles supporting offshore wind turbines owts are subjected to intermittent episodes of cycling and reconsolidation during the lifetime the lateral soil pile stiffness is likely to degrade during the cycling but tends to recover during the subsequent reconsolidation the former effect has been widely acknowledged in monopile design while the latter is less commonly recognized this study aims to a investigate the effects of episodic cycling and reconsolidation on the evolution of cumulative displacement stiffness and bending moment of large diameter monopiles in soft clay and to b analyze their consequences to the structural safety of the owt i e evolving natural frequency f n and thus likelihood of resonance a series of centrifuge tests were performed to simulate laterally loaded monopiles subjected to multi stage episodic cycling and reconsolidation the experimental results show that the lateral soil pile stiffness degrades during the initial cycling episode but it entirely recovers during the subsequent reconsolidation to exceed the initial stiffness with a percentage increase up to 50 consequently the cumulative lateral pile head displacement and maximum bending moment induced by the 3rd episode of cycling can be 63 and 15 smaller than that due to the 1st episode respectively the effects of episodic cycling and reconsolidation on the lateral stiffness displacement and bending moment of the pile become more pronounced as the cyclic amplitude increases despite these observed beneficial effects the stiffer lateral pile response after the reconsolidation would have increased f n of a typical 6 mw turbine founded on the monopile by up to 13 i e from 0 206 to 0 232 hz forcing it to unfavorably approach the 3p frequency limit that could trigger resonance keywords centrifuge modeling monopile soft clay cyclic loading reconsolidation 1 introduction monopiles are widely used for supporting offshore wind turbines owts zhang et al 2016 stone et al 2018 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 accounting for more than 80 of currently installed owts ewea 2016 differing from the piles with relatively small diameters d less than 2 5 m used in the offshore oil and gas industry the diameters of the piles supporting owts are usually in the range between 4 and 6 m leblanc et al 2010 negro et al 2017 which can be regarded as large diameter monopiles achmus et al 2007 ahmed and hawlader 2016 in the lifetime of an offshore foundation it often experiences intermittent episodes of severe cyclic loading e g during storm event with long intervening periods of minimal loading in calm weather between each storm zhang et al 2011 yi et al 2014 it has been revealed from t bar penetrometer tests involving episodes of cyclic remolding and reconsolidations that the soil stiffness and strength reduce during the remolding and partly or fully recover during the reconsolidation depending on the cyclic amplitude hodder et al 2009a b white and hodder 2010 these important findings have posed additional challenge in predicting the lifetime variations of lateral pile soil stiffness of a monopile which governs the cumulative displacement and dynamic response e g resonance of the owt jia et al 2018 to understand the lifetime variation in lateral pile soil stiffness valuable efforts in the form of physical and numerical investigations have been taken by many researchers matlock 1970 jeanjean 2009 zhang et al 2011 bhattacharya and adhikari 2011 su et al 2014 wang et al 2015 lau 2015 he et al 2017 hong et al 2017a truong 2017 chong 2017 chong and pasten 2018 chong et al 2019 liang et al 2018 liao et al 2018 wang et al 2019a 2019b in these studies all the possible loadings that a pile can experience in its lifetime were typically converted to one extreme episode of constant amplitude cycling or to a few successive episodes of loading with an increasing amplitude with no attempt made to capture the effect of reconsolidation the combined effects of episodic cycling and reconsolidation on lateral response of a pile in soft clay were explored by zhang et al 2011 through one centrifuge model test in the test a fixed head small diameter short rigid pile diameter d 0 6 m embedded length l 4 5 m in prototype was loaded by episodes of cyclic translational displacement at a large amplitude 0 5d with an intervening period of reconsolidation between each loading episode the experimental results shown that the lateral pile soil stiffness had degraded to 43 of the initial intact stiffness after the 1st episode of remolding while it had partly recovered back to 75 of the initial stiffness after the subsequent five episodes of reconsolidation these results had offered novel insights into the effect of reconsolidation on the lateral stiffness of fix head small diameter short rigid piles subjected to large cyclic displacement which fully remolded the soil around the pile the findings of zhang et al 2011 are mainly applicable to the fixed head zero rotation at pile head small diameter pile which exhibits a translational movement equal lateral displacement at different pile depths during the lateral loading under this circumstance a laterally loaded fixed head pile would remold the soil around the full embedded depth of the pile causing reconsolidation to occur along the full pile depth during the intervening period after cycling the quantitative results reported by zhang et al 2011 may not be extrapolated to the widely used free head large diameter pile free rotation at pile head which may only deflect near its upper half under a cyclic lateral loading and cause reconsolidation in the soil at shallow depth the lack of investigation into the evolution of the lateral stiffness of free head large diameter monopiles due to episodic cycling and reconsolidation has limited reliable analysis of the cumulative lateral displacement and the variation in the natural frequency of an owt supported by a monopile this study presents a series of centrifuge tests to investigate the lateral behavior of large diameter monopiles i e d 4 and 6 m in normally consolidated fine grained seabed subjected to multi stage episodic cycling and reconsolidation the test program has considered typical diameters of monopile i e d 4 and 6 m and a broad range of cyclic amplitudes i e 25 65 of the monotonic ultimate capacity the influence of reconsolidation between stages of cyclic loads on the lateral displacement stiffness and bending moment of the monopile was investigated and quantified their consequences to the structural safety of an owt supported by a monopile i e the evolving natural frequency and likelihood of resonance were also examined and discussed with the practical implications 2 centrifuge modeling all the centrifuge model tests reported in this study were performed at a centrifugal acceleration of 100 g at the geotechnical centrifuge facility of the hong kong university of science and technology the centrifuge has an arm radius of 4 2 m and can operate at up to 150 g with a maximum payload of 400 g t further details on the centrifuge have been reported by ng et al 2001a 2002 2 1 test program and objective typical diameters of a monopile fall within the range between 4 and 6 m in practice leblanc et al 2010 negro et al 2017 thus two representative diameter monopiles i e d 4 and 6 m were adopted in this study the test program consists of two monotonic tests on piles with two diameters d 4 and 6 m in prototype and two multi stage cyclic loading tests on the two piles the monotonic tests were firstly carried out to identify the monotonic ultimate lateral capacity f u of the two piles each cyclic loading test for piles with d 4 and 6 m respectively consists of three stages where repeated lateral loading with three different cyclic amplitudes i e 25 45 and 65 f u was successively applied after each episode of cycling an intervening period of reconsolidation was simulated to allow dissipation of pore water pressure before the commencement of the next loading stage the duration for each episode of reconsolidation was determined based on the dissipation curve of pore water pressure measured adjacent to the pile fig 1 shows the typical procedures of the episodic cycling and reconsolidation of the 6 m diameter monopile although the standard procedure of multi stage cycling with an increasing cyclic amplitude was adopted matlock 1970 jeanjean 2009 hong et al 2017a it is possible that the pile response would be affected by the previous loading history the stress history effects can be minimized when the magnitude of the cyclic stress is larger than the previous cyclic stress levels brown and hyde 1975 provided that applied stress does not induce a ratcheting response in plastic strain i e the plastic strain rate increases with number of cycles it was also found by jeanjean 2009 and hong et al 2017a through centrifuge tests simulating cyclically loaded piles in clay that a preceding loading episode with a lower cyclic amplitude had barely altered the pile response due to the subsequent cycling episode with a higher cyclic amplitude in this study the response of the pile subjected to cycling episodes at 65 f u was therefore unlikely to be significantly altered by the previous cycling episodes at 25 and 45 f u in practice a pile is to be cyclically loaded with a frequency ranging between 0 01 and 1 hz under the combined action of wind and wave nikitas et al 2017 according to the scaling law for frequency which is 1 n see taylor 1995 where n means the centrifugal acceleration is n times of the gravitational acceleration the frequency of input cyclic load in the centrifuge test would fall into the range between 1 and 100 hz in model scale to avoid any inertial effects caused by high frequency loading the lower bound of the frequency range i e 1 hz was adopted in this study and also elsewhere jeanjean 2009 zakeri et al 2016 hong et al 2017a it has been a common practice to study the lateral cyclic behavior of piles subjected to either one way or symmetrical two way cycling matlock 1970 jeanjean 2009 hong et al 2017a truong 2017 wang et al 2017 as elaborated schematically in fig 2 in this study only one way cycling fig 2 a was adopted in each cyclic loading test because the one way cycling is intuitively anticipated to and has been shown to produce larger cumulative lateral displacement than the symmetrical two way cycling long and vanneste 1994 haiderali et al 2015 he et al 2017 in other words one way cycling represents the worst case scenario if the cumulative lateral displacement is a major concern e g for piles supporting offshore wind turbines 2 2 centrifuge model package fig 3 a shows the plan view of the centrifuge model package at 100 g the dimensions of the model box represent a plan area of 99 0 m 124 5 m and a depth of 85 m in prototype in this study different values were adopted for the spacing between the pile and the container 8d and for the spacing between neighboring piles 5d these spacings were pre determined based on preliminary three dimensional finite element analyses before the centrifuge tests the numerical analyses were carried out using an advanced hypoplastic clay model masin 2005 2014 which had been calibrated against centrifuge tests on cyclically loaded lateral piles in kaolin clay hong et al 2017a the computed results suggest that the boundary effect becomes almost negligible when the spacing between the pile and the container reaches 8d meanwhile the interaction between the two neighboring piles being laterally loaded in the opposite direction as shown in fig 3 a tends to minimize while adopting a spacing of 5d the former i e 8d between the pile and the container is similar to the computed results revealed from dong et al 2018 s study which suggests a spacing of 7 5d between pile and lateral boundary of container while the latter a spacing of 5d between piles is further confirmed in our centrifuge model tests where negligible bending moment and excess pore water pressure were developed along the neighboring pile located 5d away from the pile subjected to lateral load see section 3 2 monotonic lateral response for details fig 3 b shows the elevation view of the centrifuge model package which consists of two strata namely a 720 mm thick 72 m in prototype malaysia kaolin layer underlain with a 50 mm thick 5 m in prototype sandy layer for bottom drainage floating piles with an identical embedded depth of 600 mm 60 m in prototype were installed in the upper fine grained soil two pore water pressure transducers ppts were installed in the soil adjacent to the two cyclically loaded piles to measure the cumulative excess pore water pressure due to cyclic loading each pile was laterally loaded with either monotonic or repeated forces the servo controlled hydraulic actuator which was mounted on a rigid reaction beam the location and loading direction of the hydraulic actuator can be flexibly adjusted for the loading test of each pile a load cell was attached to the extension rod of the actuator for measuring the lateral load imposed to the pile the lateral displacement at the loading point of each pile was measured via one linear variable differential transformer lvdt attached to the extension rod of the actuator 2 3 model piles fig 4 shows the instrumented model piles with a diameter of 40 and 60 mm 4 and 6 m in prototype respectively adopted in the centrifuge tests each model pile was made of a 750 mm long 75 m in prototype aluminum alloy pipe different from the short embedded length of monopiles in europe i e 20 30 m leblanc et al 2010 where the owts usually sit on overconsolidated stiff clay abadie 2015 lau 2015 a very soft clayey or silty seabed is frequently encountered in the chinese offshore wind farm cai et al 2010 di et al 2013 under this circumstance relatively long embedded depth i e usually exceeding 55 m liao et al 2018 is required to ensure sufficient lateral resistance for monopiles in soft clay or silt a typical embedded length of 600 mm 60 m in prototype was therefore chosen for each pile simulated in the centrifuge tests reported herein the elastic modulus of the model piles e p was 72 gpa the moment of inertia i p for the cross section of the hollow cylinder can be calculated by i p π d 4 64 1 d 2 t d 4 where d and t denote the outer diameter and wall thickness of the hollow pile respectively based on the scaling law for the flexural rigidity e p i p of the pile 1 n4 where n is the centrifugal acceleration see taylor 1995 the prototype value e p i p of the piles with diameters of 4 and 6 m in prototype is 3 11 108 knm2 and 11 05 108 knm2 respectively it can be readily deduced that these values of flexural rigidity of the model piles of the former and the latter are corresponding to those of the 4 and 6 m diameter steel piles with a wall thickness of 0 06 m in prototype these pile dimensions in both model and prototype scale are summarized in table 1 if the model piles were made of steel the wall thickness has to be as thin as 0 6 mm to achieve the same flexural rigidity given the difficulty of fabricating the steel pipe with an ultra thin wall thickness 0 6 mm aluminum pipe was adopted in this study and also elsewhere lau 2015 zhu et al 2016 hong et al 2017a it is worth noting that for model piles the scaling relationships were mainly concerned with pile dimensions and flexural rigidity which have been readily satisfied in this study on the other hand the pile mass had not been intentionally scaled and compensated in this study as it was found to display a negligible effect on the lateral pile behavior haiderali et al 2013 the type of aluminum alloy used is 7075 t6 which exhibits an ultimate yield strength of 503 mpa each model pile was instrumented with 27 sets of strain gauges full wheatstone bridge configuration to measure the bending moments strain gauges were fixed on the surface of each model pile a 1 mm thick coating of epoxy was applied to the surface of each instrumented model pile for protection and waterproof of the strain gauges direct shear box tests on the interface between epoxy and kaolin suggest the friction coefficient μ between the two materials is approximately 0 30 hong and ng 2013 this closely mimics the interface between steel pile and soft clay i e μ 0 31 randolph and wroth 1981 the flexural stiffness of the foil type of strain gauge is almost negligible as compared to that of the aluminum pile while the stiffness of the epoxy coating young s modulus 2 1 gpa cannot be ignored with the known dimensions and modulus of the epoxy coating it can be readily calculated that its presence has resulted in an increase of flexural stiffness of each model pile by no more than 2 in the calibration for bending moment measurement each instrumented pile was horizontally aligned with its two edges being simply supported see fig 5 a a point load was applied to the middle span of the pile five successive steps of dead weight were applied by adding the cumulative mass of 1 3 5 10 15 kg to the loading plate the loading mass was then released one by one for unloading three cycles of loading and unloading were repeated after applying step of loading or unloading the bending moment at each location with presence of a full wheatstone bridge strain gauges can be readily calculated using the beam theory and correlated to the output voltage given by the wheatstone bridge circuit the two variables for each level of strain gauges were found to linearly correlated with the coefficient of determination r2 exceeding 0 97 fig 5 b shows the calibration factor of each level of strain gauges installed on the two model piles with different diameters 4 and 6 m in prototype it can be seen that the calibration factors for different level of strain gauges vary slightly with a mean value of approximately 150 n m mv as proposed by poulos and hull 1989 the relative pile soil stiffness can be expressed as e p i p e s l 4 where e s and l are the soil modulus and pile embedded length respectively the critical values to define flexible and rigid piles are 0 0025 and 0 208 respectively poulos and hull 1989 i e pile behaves flexible or rigid when e p i p e s l 4 is either lower than 0 0025 or higher than 0 208 respectively the e s of malaysia kaolin used in this study is found to be approximately 400 times of its undrained shear strength wang et al 2019c i e e s 400s u following this correlation e s was estimated based on the average s u within the pile embedded depth kuo et al 2012 i e s u 46 2 kpa the dimensionless parameter e p i p e s l 4 of the pile with a diameter of 4 m is 0 0013 which suggests that it would have behaved as a flexible pile meanwhile the e p i p e s l 4 of the pile with a prototype diameter of 6 m is 0 0046 which exceeds the upper bound for a flexible pile 0 0025 but is below the lower bound for a rigid pile 0 208 which imply that it tends to behave as a semi rigid pile hong et al 2017a the major difference between semi rigid and rigid pile lies in the soil flow mechanisms around the two types of piles it has been revealed from hong et al 2017a s centrifuge tests and numerical analyses that the soils around a laterally loaded semi rigid pile exhibit three flow mechanisms i e wedge type mechanism near the surface full flow mechanism near the mid depth and rotational shear mechanism at greater depth on the other hand a laterally loaded rigid pile only results in wedge type mechanism near the surface and rotational shear mechanism at greater depth hong et al 2017a 2 4 model soil preparation the soil used in the centrifuge tests was malaysia kaolin which has been extensively used for geotechnical model tests ilyas et al 2004 xie et al 2012 hong et al 2017b zhu et al 2018 compression and shear behavior of the soil have been compressive tested as reported by hong et al 2017b 2019 table 2 summaries the index properties and geotechnical parameters of malaysia kaolin before placing any soil into the model box silicone grease was applied to its inner lateral boundaries for minimizing the friction between the soil and the model box a thin layer of toyoura sand 50 mm thick was then rained into the model box to serves as a drainage layer the sandy layer was saturated by applying a low hydraulic gradient seepage flow from the bottom of the model box after the saturation of the bottom sandy layer a piece of geotextile was placed on the top of the sand surface before pouring the slurry of the malaysia kaolin into the model box to avoid the flow of the kaolin slurry into the voids between the sand particles de aired slurry of malaysia kaolin with an initial water content being approximately twice of its liquid limit i e 130 was then carefully poured into the model box to avoid introducing gas bubbles which could significantly alter the mechanical behavior of the fine grained soil hong et al 2020 the slurry was consolidated one dimensionally at 1 g by applying deadweight on a rigid plate that covers the top of the soil surface five successive steps of vertical loading were applied with the cumulative vertical loading equal to 1 5 10 15 and 20 kpa after the consolidation at 1 g the model box was transferred to the platform of the centrifuge and spun up to 100 g for self weight consolidation the degree of consolidation was determined based on the ground surface settlements measured by the two lvdts see fig 3 b in conjunction with tan et al 1991 s method in the method the relationship between the measured consolidation settlement s and time t is fitted by a hyperbolic function of s t α βt where α and β are two fitting parameters the ultimate soil settlement s ult was estimated to be 1 β the instantaneous degree of consolidation u can then be readily calculated as u s s ult fig 6 a shows the distribution of effective vertical stress in the clay bed after primary consolidation at 100 g which was solely due to the self weight of the clay the figure also includes the distribution of effective vertical stress in the clay immediately before the centrifuge model test at 1 g but after soil sample preparation this distribution was resulted from both surface surcharge 20 kpa and the self weight of the clay at 1 g while calculating the self weight of the clay bed an average value of effective unit weight γ 6 kn m3 was adopted based on the distributions of the effective vertical stress in fig 6 a the variation of overconsolidation ratio ocr of malaysia kaolin with depth as shown in fig 6 b can be readily calculated by 1 ocr σ vp σ vs where σ vp and σ vs denote the historical maximum of vertical effective stress and the current vertical effective stress at 100 g respectively at 100 g the clay within a depth of 3 m in prototype is over consolidated because the current effective vertical stress in this region is smaller than its historical maximum 20 kpa when the depth exceeds 3 m in prototype the current effective vertical stress of the soil at 100 g was larger than the historical maximum vertical stress 20 kpa and thus it became normally consolidated ocr 1 the undrained shear strength profile of the soil sample was assessed in flight by a t bar penetrometer where the diameter and length of the bar are 6 5 and 35 mm in model scale respectively the location of the t bar penetration is also included in fig 3 a the distance from the outer boundary of the t bar to its closet boundary of the model container 23b bar is larger than the minimum allowable distance that would eliminate the boundary effect for t bar penetration testing i e 10b bar house et al 2001 einav and randolph 2005 given the availability of different devices to obtain the undrained shear strength profile e g t bar penetrometer and cone penetrometer the former is used in the centrifuge model tests reported herein this is because the process of the bar penetrating through soft clay is associated with a well recognized failure mechanism i e full flow around the bar einav and randolph 2005 martin and randolph 2006 mahmoodzadeh et al 2015 for which the ultimate penetration resistance and thus the undrained shear strength can be rigorously quantified by an exact solution proposed by randolph and houlsby 1984 to ensure an undrained condition of clay during t bar penetration or pile soil interaction the moving rate v of t bar or pile in the soil should meet the following criterion stewart and randolph 1991 2 v 20 c v b where c v and b represent the diameter of the t bar penetrometer or pile and the vertical consolidation coefficient of the soil c v 40 m2 year of malaysia kaolin purwana 2007 respectively based on the bar diameter b bar 6 5 mm in model scale and the coefficient of consolidation of the soil the undrained penetration rate should exceed 3 9 mm s in model scale a penetration rate of 5 mm s was therefore adopted in this study after the t bar penetration test at 100 g the centrifuge was spun down to 1 g for installing model piles ppts and lateral pile loading system to facilitate the installation of ppts one lateral wall of the model box was dismantled small holes were drilled horizontally through the malaysia kaolin to the target positions using a hand auger with a horizontal guiding plate the ppts were then inserted into the pre drilled holes following the installation kaolin slurry was injected to fill up the cavity if any surrounding each ppt each pile was pushed vertically into the designed embedded depth by an actuator to avoid pile bulking during the installation process the model piles were installed at 1 g rather than high g which is commonly adopted in centrifuge modeling of laterally loaded piles jeanjean 2009 truong and lehane 2017 hong et al 2017a installing piles at high g will generate large horizontal stresses around the pile shaft comparing to that at 1 g which significantly affects axial pile responses ko et al 1984 taylor 1995 however for laterally loaded piles the effects of pile installation at 1 g is generally thought to be less pronounced craig 1984 compared the lateral behavior for piles installed at 1 g and 52 5 g and concluded the differences between the two were minor for example the initial stiffness of a pile installed at 1 g was approximately 10 smaller than that of a pile installed at 52 5g bouafia and garnier 1991 and anusic et al 2019 also found that various installation methods including jacking hammering and placement in boreholes presumably at 1 g have negligible effect on lateral responses of pile this is likely because the lateral pile response is controlled by soil extending some distance away from the zone of installation induced disturbance gabr et al 1994 instead of the local stress distribution in the close vicinity to the pile after all the preparations the entire model package was spun up to 100 g again for re consolidation lateral monotonic or cyclic pile test was carried out after the primary consolidation of the soil as indicated by the measured soil settlement and dissipation of excess pore pressures for clarity all the procedures for model soil preparation are summarized in table 3 3 interpretation of the test results in the following sections all the results are presented in prototype scale unless stated otherwise 3 1 undrained shear strength profile fig 6 b shows the profile of undrained shear strength s u deduced from the t bar penetration test the undrained soil strength s u can be determined by s u q n kt where n kt and q denote the bearing capacity factor of the t bar penetrometer and the penetration resistance respectively the value of n kt is taken as 10 5 which was suggested by randolph and houlsby 1984 based on a plasticity analysis and has been widely used in the interpretation of t bar penetration results in centrifuge and field tests stewart and randolph 1991 martin and randolph 2006 wang and brandenberg 2013 the measured strength profile reveals an approximately linear increase in s u with depth the rate of increase of s u per unit depth is 1 54 kpa m in prototype scale which is close to those ranging between 1 45 and 1 56 kpa m obtained by zhu et al 2018 and xie et al 2012 who carried out t bar penetration tests on malaysia kaolin the major influence depth of the laterally loaded pile is approximately within a depth of 6 d randolph and gourvenec 2011 he et al 2017 liao et al 2018 i e 24 and 36 m for the piles with d 4 and 6 m respectively based on the fitted strength profile i e s u 1 54z as see fig 6 b it can be readily calculated that the average s u values of the soil within the major influence depth for the piles with d 4 and 6 m are approximately 18 and 28 kpa respectively 3 2 monotonic lateral response fig 7 shows the measured monotonic load displacement response of the 4 and 6 m diameter monopiles at a location of 8 m above the ground surface of each pile see the inset of the figure given the lack of an obvious yield point in each load displacement curve kulhawy and chen 1995 s method was used to deduce the ultimate lateral capacity f u of each pile details of the method has been given in the literature e g kulhawy and chen 1995 ng et al 2001b hong et al 2017a following kulhawy and chen 1995 s method a hyperbolic curve is used to fit the measured load displacement data as follows 3 f y m n y where f and y are the lateral load and the resulting lateral pile displacement respectively m and n are both fitting parameters the reciprocal of n is related to the interpreted ultimate lateral resistance f u the fitting results are also shown in fig 7 the value of f u of the monopile with d 4 and 6 m can be deduced as 30 and 54 mn in prototype respectively these have offered the bases to determine the cycling amplitudes i e 25 45 and 65 f u see fig 1 to be applied in the multi stage cyclic loading tests to evaluate if the spacing between the piles in the same model box is sufficiently large for minimizing the boundary effect the influence of a laterally loaded pile d 6 m on its neighboring pile d 4 m was examined fig 8 a illustrates the bending moment of the pile with d 4 m in response to the monotonic lateral loading of the adjacent pile with d 6 m see the inset in fig 8 a while fig 8 b shows the pore water pressure in front of the pile with d 4 m see the inset in the figure for its location during the monotonic lateral loading of the adjacent pile with d 6 m no notable response was observed in terms of bending moment in the pile with d 4 m and the pore water pressure adjacent to the pile during the entire process of the lateral loading of the pile with d 6 m it is worth noting that the 6 m diameter monopile was monotonically pushed to a large lateral displacement of up to 0 3d at the loading point which is larger than the cumulative displacement in the cyclically loaded piles see fig 9 these observations suggest the influence of either monotonic or cyclically loaded piles on their neighboring piles could be negligible i e with no notable boundary effect 3 3 effect of episodic cycling and reconsolidation on load displacement response fig 9 shows the typical cyclic load displacement responses of the monopile with d 6 m during the three successive episodes of repeated loading at a cyclic amplitude of 65 f u for clarity only the cyclic responses during the 1st 10th and 90th 100th cycles in each loading episode are plotted in fig 9 a and b respectively the soil around the cyclically loaded pile exhibited an undrained response during each loading cycle but was partially drained during each full loading episode that consists of 100 cycles it is worth noting the soil sample was undergoing consolidation under during the entire process of the pile testing during the cycling the loading frequency 1 hz was relatively high such that the rate of loading exceeded the rate of pore water pressure dissipation causing significant accumulation of excess pore water pressure with number of cycles see fig 10 following each cycling episode the lateral loading was removed while the irrecoverable component of excess pore water pressure see δu ir in fig 10 still remained and would dissipate during the subsequent intervening period of reconsolidation without load as anticipated each episode of undrained cycling has led to an increase in the cumulative displacement including both peak and residual displacements with number of cycles which was accompanied by degradation of the unloading stiffness i e secant stiffness between the load reversal points leblanc et al 2010 the rates of both displacement accumulation and stiffness degradation in each loading episode reduce with number of cycles which suggest a progressively stabilized or shakedown response after each episode of undrained cycling the lateral load applied to the pile was released which allowed an intervening period of reconsolidation i e dissipation of the excess pore water pressure accompanied by a reduced void ratio of the soil around the pile owing to this reconsolidation effect the pile behaves stiffer during the subsequent loading episode compared to that at the corresponding number of cycle during the preceding loading episode as a result each intervening period of reconsolidation has led to a smaller cumulative lateral pile displacement and less significant stiffness degradation during the subsequent cycling at a given amplitude the percentage reductions of the former and latter due to the episodic reconsolidation are up to 63 and 5 respectively more detailed interpretation and quantification of the cumulative displacement and stiffness variation of the pile are presented in the following sections 3 4 pore water pressure response fig 10 a shows a typical pore water pressure response in front of the 6 m diameter monopole during the three episodes of cycling cyclic amplitude 65 f u and the intervened reconsolidation process the pore water pressure was measured at a distance of 4 m 0 67d in front of the monopile and at a depth of 24 m 4d below the ground surface in the figure the excess pore water pressure δu is normalized by the initial vertical effective stress σ v at the corresponding location as anticipated a positive excess pore water pressure is developed in the fine grained soil during each episode of cycling this is followed by a dissipation of excess pore water pressure during each subsequent reconsolidation process for clarity the excess pore water pressure response during each episode of cycling was extracted and replotted with number of cycles as shown in fig 10 b as illustrated at any given loading cycle in each episode the total excess pore water pressure is composed of a recoverable component δu r and an irrecoverable component δu ir the magnitude of δu ir is associated with the level of plastic strain developed in the soil during the 1st episode of cycling the magnitude of δu ir significantly accumulates but at a decreasing rate with number of cycles this is accompanied by plastic straining and softened the soil around the pile as implied from the accumulation of irrecoverable lateral pile displacement and degradation of lateral pile stiffness see fig 9 after each episode of reconsolidation the accumulation rate of the excess pore water pressure during the subsequent episode of loading with the same cyclic amplitude is smaller than that induced by the preceding episode of lateral cycling quantitatively the cumulative δu ir due to the 3rd episode of cycling is 67 smaller than that induced by the 1st episode of cycling this suggests the state of the soil around the pile becomes denser after each reconsolidation which has led to smaller irrecoverable cumulative pile displacement and less degradation of lateral pile stiffness see fig 9 3 5 cumulative lateral pile displacement during episodic cycling and reconsolidation fig 11 a and fig 11 b show the developments of the normalized cumulative peak displacement y p n y p 1 and the residual displacement y r n y r 1 of the 6 m diameter monopile respectively the terms y p 1 and y p n denote the cumulative peak displacement at the 1st and n th cycles in each loading episode while the terms y r 1 and y r n denote the cumulative residual displacement at the 1st and n th cycles in each loading episode respectively for a given amplitude of cyclic loading much smaller cumulative peak and residual pile displacements are induced in the 3rd loading episode compared to those in the 1st this is because the lateral stiffness of the pile has increased which will be quantified in the following section as a result of reconsolidation during the loading episodes this suggests that the most pronounced cumulative lateral displacement of a monopile developed during the 1st storm event in its lifetime given that the loading amplitudes in the subsequent storm events are similar the displacement accumulation of the pile depends on the accumulation of strain in the soil chong and santamarina 2016 summarized the different functions used to quantify the evolution of permanent strains of soils experiencing cyclic loadings more details of the function are also given in chong 2017 a simple yet powerful numerical approach was developed by chong 2017 to simulate offshore foundations that are subjected to repetitive loads through incorporating a polynomial type strain accumulation function such a polynomial type function was also used in this study to fit and establish the relationship between the normalized cumulative displacement y p n y p 1 and y r n y r 1 and the number of cycles n 4 y n y 1 1 b 1 a n 1 a 1 c n 1 where a b and c are three fitting parameters the y n y 1 value increases with b value but decreases as a increases with this equation c 0 characterizes a shakedown response whereas c 0 features a ratcheting response the above equation was adopted in this study for fitting the measured cumulative displacement as shown in fig 11 a and b it can be seen that the trends of the cumulative peak and residual displacements induced by all cyclic amplitudes are well captured by the polynomial type function the fitting parameters a b and c of the monopiles with d 4 m and d 6 m are summarized in table 4 as can be seen all the values of c are equal to 0 which indicate a shakedown response of all the cumulative displacements during the 1st cycling episode the values of a for both the cumulative peak and residual displacements are approximately 0 85 being irrespective of the cyclic amplitude and pile diameter the values of b for the cumulative peak and residual displacements are approximately 0 06 and 0 16 respectively after the 1st intervening episode of reconsolidation the values of a increase while the values of b decrease both of which suggest less pile displacement accumulation in addition during the subsequent episodic cycling and reconsolidation the variations in both a and b values are negligible signifying the shakedown response of the pile the observed long term displacements of the large diameter monopiles d 4 and 6 m have offered valuable data to verify the existing theoretical or numerical models chong 2017 chong and pasten 2018 chong et al 2019 further parametric studies based on these models will in turn lead to a better understanding of long term response of monopiles 3 6 evolution of unloading stiffness during episodic cycling and reconsolidation fig 12 a and fig 12 b show the evaluation of the unloading and reloading stiffness of the two monopiles d 4 and 6 m during three successive loading episodes at a typical cyclic amplitude of 65 f u respectively the conventional definition of unloading and reloading stiffness of a laterally loaded pile i e secant stiffness between the reversal points of the unloading and reloading process on the pile load displacement curve leblanc et al 2010 wang et al 2018 achmus et al 2019 respectively is adopted in this study for the ease of comparison as presented during each episode of cycling of the piles the unloading and reloading stiffness degrades with number of cycles but at a decreasing rate after after each intervening period of reconsolidation however both the unloading and reloading stiffness are fully recovered and exceed the initial value during the preceding episode showing a similar trend for the monopile with d 6 m the initial unloading and reloading stiffness in the 3rd cycling episode are 1 50 and 1 47 times of those in the 1st loading episode respectively meanwhile the percentage reduction of the unloading and reloading stiffness due to 100 cycles of loading in the 3rd cycling episode becomes only 33 and 21 of that in the 1st loading episode similarly after two episodes of reconsolidation the unloading and reloading stiffness of the pile with d 4 m also exceeds the initial value during the first episode which are 1 38 and 1 34 times of those in the 1st loading episode respectively fig 13 a illustrates the evolution of the normalized unloading stiffness k n k 1 of the two monopiles d 4 and 6 with the increase with number of cycles at the loading amplitudes of 45 and 65 f u the terms k n and k 1 denote the unloading stiffness at the n th and 1st cycles of each episode of cycling this figure further suggests that for all the diameters and cycling amplitudes considered herein the most significant stiffness degradation occurs during the 1st loading episode obviously based on fig 13 a it is not possible to generalize the various trends in stiffness degradation exhibited by piles with different diameters under varying amplitudes of cycling by fitting with a single equation an attempt was therefore made to link the normalized stiffness degradation k n k 1 to the normalized cumulative residual displacement y r n y r 1 of each pile in each loading episode as shown in fig 13 b the results of the two monopiles d 4 and 6 m are all shown in the figure as observed all the data pertaining to the stiffness degradation broadly merge into a single trend which can be described by a single linear equation see fig 13 b irrespective of the number of loading episodes loading amplitude and pile diameter this is probably owing to the reason that the residual displacement of a pile reflects the level of plastic strain developed in the soil around the pile which determines the degradation in soil stiffness the unified trend shown in fig 13 b suggests that the degradation in lateral pile stiffness in any storm season can be approximated based on the measured cumulative residual displacement in that season with there being no need to explicitly consider the history of reconsolidation it is worth noting that the linear equation from fig 13 b are deduced from only the two tests on piles with two diameters in the same soil subjected to the cyclic loading with the same characteristic i e multi stage one way cycling with the same cyclic amplitude it has been well recognized that the stiffness degradation rate of a soil under cycling depends on many factors including soil plasticity or plastic index andersen 2015 and loading characteristic e g one way or two way cycling he et al 2017 therefore the extrapolation of the linear equation in fig 13 b to other scenarios should be treated with caution fig 14 shows the gain in the stiffness of the monopiles with d 4 and 6 m due to the intervening reconsolidation after the cycling episodes at different loading amplitudes 25 45 and 65 f u the figure also includes the results of the relevant centrifuge test zhang et al 2011 which simulated a fixed head small diameter short rigid pile in soft clay that was subjected to episodes of severe cycling translational cyclic displacement of 0 5d with a period of reconsolidation between successive loading episodes in the figure k ep n 1 and k ep 1 1 refer to the unloading lateral stiffness during the 1st cyclic of the n th and 1st loading episodes respectively despite the degradation in the stiffnesses of the two monopiles induced during each cycling episode see fig 13 a they fully recover after the reconsolidation and exceed the initial stiffness see fig 14 this implies that the effect of stiffness recovery due to reconsolidation plays a more predominate role by combating the damaging effects of cyclic loading the percentage stiffness gain increases with an increase in pile diameter and is up to 38 and 50 for the piles with d of 4 and 6 m respectively given the small difference in terms of percentage stiffness gain 12 and the lack of repeating tests it remains unclear if such difference was due to the influence of pile diameter or the variability in the data further tests covering a broad range of pile diameters will be carried out to investigate and quantify the effect of pile diameter on the level of stiffness gain due to reconsolidation unlike the observed full compensation of stiffness k ep n 1 k ep 1 1 1 by reconsolidation in the centrifuge tests reported herein the reconsolidation in zhang et al 2011 s tests had only led to a partial recovery of stiffness k ep n 1 k ep 1 1 1 after four episodes of cycling and reconsolidation the lateral pile stiffness was still 20 lower than its initial stiffness this is likely attribute to the specific experimental condition modelled in zhang et al 2011 s study in their study the cycling episode was likely to full remold the soil around the pile as a result of the large cyclic displacement imposed i e with a constant cyclic displacement equal of 0 5 d which is much larger than that in this study in other words the severe damaging effect of the large amplitude remolding in zhang et al 2011 s tests is more dominating than the reconsolidation effect due to the subsequent reconsolidation 3 7 peak and locked in bending moments fig 15 shows the typical profiles of the peak bending moment m p of the 6 m diameter pile which is induced in the last cycle i e the 100th cycle of each cycling episode at a loading amplitude of 65 f u the corresponding bending moment profiles at zero lateral load m l namely residual moment which was also defined as locked in bending moment by kirkwood and haigh 2014 are also included for comparison the locked in bending moment is linked to the residual deformation of the pile as a consequence of the plastic strain developed in the soil around the pile the values of both peak and locked in bending moments decrease when the number of loading episodes increases due to the stiffer response of the soil around the pile which results from reconsolidation in other words reconsolidation has played a beneficial role in reducing the peak load accommodate by the monopile it can be readily deduced from fig 15 that the difference between m l max and m p max at the 100th cycle during the 1st loading episode is 580 mnm this has been increased to 605 mnm at the 100th cycle during the 3rd loading episode as a result of the two intervening episodes of reconsolidation this suggests an increasing amplitude of cyclic bending stress and consequently an intensified level of fatigue damage following the episodes of reconsolidation in addition to the absolute values of m l and m p it is also critical to assess the ratio between maximum locked in bending moment and peak bending moment i e m l max m p max because the m l max m p max is associated with variation of cyclic bending stress and thus the fatigue damage accumulated in the monopile to generalize an equation for predicting the m l max m p max an attempt was made to plot the value of m l max m p max against normalized peak displacement y p d and cumulative residual displacement y r d in each episode of cycling of the two monopiles d 4 and 6 m subjected to various loading amplitudes i e 25 45 and 65 f u as shown in fig 16 a and fig 16 b respectively as shown in fig 16 a the normalized locked in moment m l max m p max does not appear to exhibit a unique trend with cumulative peak displacement conversely all the results of m l max m p max are converged to a single trend of linear correlation with the normalized residual displacement irrespective of the episodes of reconsolidation cyclic amplitude and pile diameter see fig 16 b similar observations were made from he et al 2017 s field experiments on laterally loaded piles in soft clay subjected to repeated loading without considering the effect of reconsolidation these experimental evidences suggest that the normalized locked in bending moment is intrinsically associated with the normalized residual displacement of pile which reflects the average level of plastic strain developed in the soil around the pile the m l max m p max could be therefore approximated solely based on the measured residual lateral displacement at the pile head 3 8 cyclic p y curves considering episodic cycling and reconsolidation based on the measured bending moment the soil reaction force p and the lateral pile deflection y can be deduced a 6th order polynomial is used to fit each bending moment profile which is found to yield the best fitting in this study and elsewhere zhu et al 2017 he et al 2017 the values of p and y are then respectively deduced by double derivation and double integration of the fitted bending moment profile i e p d 2 m d z 2 and y m e i d z 2 fig 17 a and fig 17 b show the deduced cyclic p y curves of the 6 m diameter monopile at two typical depths i e 2d and 4d below the ground surface as expected the cyclic p y curves at deeper depth exhibit higher soil resistance and stiffness at either depth the 1st episode of cycling without occurrence of reconsolidation has led to the degradation of the lateral soil resistance and accumulation of lateral pile displacement with increasing number of cycles similar observations were also made by jeanjean 2009 truong 2017 and liao et al 2018 after each intervening period of reconsolidation the resulted cyclic p y curves exhibit higher values of soil resistance and stiffness in conjunction with smaller rates in degradation of soil resistance and accumulation of lateral pile displacement a comparison between fig 17 a and b reveals that the effect of reconsolidation is more pronounced at shallower depth this is because the soil at shallower depth should have experienced a larger amplitude of cyclic loading relative to the strength at the corresponding depth causing higher level of soil densification and therefore strength and stiffness recovery during the subsequent reconsolidation 4 implications for structural safety of a monopile supporting an owt evolution of natural frequency the variations of lateral pile soil stiffness as measured in this experimental study have offered the opportunity to assess the evolution of natural frequency of an owt founded on a monopile in soft clay a simens 6 mw turbine arany et al 2016 in conjunction with the monopile with d 6 m as studied in the centrifuge test reported herein were adopted for the natural frequency analysis some key parameters of the simens 6 mw turbine are shown in fig 18 a to avoid any resonance and ultimately increased fatigue damage the initial natural frequency f n of the turbine structure should lie outside the so called 1p and 3p bands 1p is defined as the 1st order natural frequency of the turbine rotor it is worth noting that 1p is not a single frequency but a range of frequency associated with the lowest and the highest rotational speed of the rotor 3p is related to the dynamic load triggered when either of the three blades of a wind turbine passes the tower of the turbine structure once each of the blades passes the tower it obscures the shielded area of tower by the presence of the passing blade from the action of wind load resulting a dynamic load having frequency equal to three times the rotor frequency 3p for three bladed wind turbines arany et al 2016 according to the angular velocity of the turbine the 1p and 3p band of the wind turbine are 0 083 0 183 hz and 0 250 0 550 hz respectively following the routine practice the natural frequency of the simens 6 mw turbine was calculated using the simplified structural model as shown in fig 18 a following the routine practice for calculating the natural frequency of a wind turbine structure lombardi 2010 bhattacharya et al 2010 yang et al 2018 the soil that governs the dynamics of the turbine is simplified by two springs on the mudline i e transverse spring k l and rotational spring k r as suggested by lombardi 2010 the values of k l and k r can be respectively determined from the stiffness of the horizontal load displacement f y curve and moment rotation m θ curve on the mudline at a very small lateral pile displacement i e y d 1000 these values were deduced from the measured centrifuge test results at the 1st loading cycle of each cycling episode of the 6 m diameter monopile the numerical analysis was performed by building a beam spring model in the finite element program abaqus as shown in fig 18 b the tower was simulated by three dimensional beam elements b31 it was assumed to be linear elastic with typical properties of elastic modulus of 210 gpa poisson s ratio of 0 3 and density of 7850 kg m3 for steel the rotor and nacelle were modelled as a point mass placed at the top of the tower as routinely practiced for the springs on the mudline as shown in fig 18 a the spring 1 element in abaqus was adopted this type of spring element has six degrees of freedom as discussed only two degrees of freedom were considered in this study with adoption of k l and k r values deduced from the tests as the input parameters the dynamic analysis step in abaqus i e frequency was set to obtain the frequency of the owt the optimum mesh size of the beam i e δl was determined through trial and error it was found that when δl is no larger than 0 5 m a further decease of element length had resulted in a negligible change in the calculated frequency the δl value of 0 5 m was therefore adopted in this study fig 18 c shows the typical computed 1st frequency mode shape of the owt after two episodes of cycling and reconsolidation f 65 f u fig 19 shows the computed evolution of natural frequency of the owt it can be seen that the natural frequency of the owt structure increases with number of cycling episode due to a stiffer lateral pile response following each reconsolidation the level of increase in natural frequency becomes more pronounced at a higher cyclic amplitude which could have generated more excess pore water pressures around the pile and thus higher stiffness recovery after reconsolidation see fig 14 it is worth noting that the natural frequency of the owt structure after the 3rd cycling episode with a loading amplitude of 65 f u has unfavorably approached the 3p frequency limit to quantify the effect of episodic cycling and reconsolidation on the likelihood of resonance of the owt structure a factor of safety fs resonance is defined as follows 5 f s r e s o n a n c e f 3 p lb f 1 p ub f f 1 p ub where f is the natural frequency of the owt structure f 1p ub and f 3p lb are the upper bound of the 1p band and lower bound of the 3p band of the owt structure respectively when f exceeds f 3p lb fs resonance becomes smaller than the unity indicating the occurrence of resonance and vice versa according to this definition the initial factor of safety against resonance of the monopile with d 6 m supporting a simens 6 mw turbine is 3 2 as shown in fig 19 after three episodes of constant amplitude cycling with intervening periods of reconsolidation fs resonance decreases to 2 3 1 7 and 1 4 when the cyclic amplitude is 25 45 and 65 f u respectively this implies that the seasonal storm loadings with an intervening period of reconsolidation which often occurs in offshore areas of china may gradually increase the potential of resonance ignorance of such effect could have led to a non conservative structural design for the owt 5 summary and conclusions this study presents a series of centrifuge model tests to investigate the effects of episodic cycling and reconsolidation on the lateral cyclic responses of large diameter monopiles d 4 and 6 m in soft clay the physical investigation has led to the following conclusions 1 the unloading stiffness of a laterally loaded pile degrades during each cycling episode nevertheless it fully recovers during the subsequent intervening period of reconsolidation and exceeds its initial lateral stiffness the effect of reconsolidation on the recovery of lateral pile stiffness becomes more pronounced for piles subjected to higher cycling amplitudes the unloading stiffnesses of the monopiles with d 4 and 6 m increased to 138 and 150 of the initial value after two episodes of cycling and reconsolidation 2 after each episode of reconsolidation subsequent cycling episode results in a much smaller degradation in the lateral pile stiffness compared to that in the preceding episode for the same cycling amplitude the normalized stiffness degradations k n k 1 in all the cycling episodes however exhibit a unique linear relationship with the normalized cumulative residual displacement y r n y r 1 of the pile 3 in line with the evolutional trend of the lateral pile stiffness the cumulative lateral displacement cumulative peak displacement y p n and cumulative residual displacement y r n bending moment peak moment m p and locked in moment m l of the monopiles all increase with number of cycles in each cycling episode but reduce in the subsequent cycling episode owing to the stiffness gained during the intervening period of reconsolidation the ratio of m l max m p max which links the variation of cyclic bending stress and the fatigue damage in the pile shows a unique linear relationship with the residual pile displacement irrespective of the occurrence of reconsolidation cycling amplitude and pile diameter 4 after intervening periods of reconsolidation the resulted p y curves exhibit higher values of soil resistance and the soil resistance gain increases with pile diameter but decreases with soil depth 5 after three episodes of cycling and reconsolidation the natural frequency of a siemens 6 mw turbine on a 6 m diameter monopile would have increased from 0 206 to 0 232 hz which approaches the 3p frequency limit 0 25 hz ignorance of the reconsolidation effect on natural frequency can lead to a non conservative structural design for owt it should be noted that above conclusions were drawn based on centrifuge tests considering only two pile diameters d 4 and 6 m and may be specific to the particular test conditions and soil type adopted any extrapolation of the
