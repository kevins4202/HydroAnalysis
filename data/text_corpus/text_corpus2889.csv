14445,an electrochemical cell was used to remove sulfides from synthetic petroleum produced water ppw the cell was run for over 2 months in continuous mode sulfides were converted to sulfur at anode with an average conversion rate of 65 due to the use of a cation exchange membrane to separate cathodic and anodic chambers along with sulfide removal conductivity and tds reduction also took place conductivity and tds reduced by 49 27 and 44 79 respectively on anode and was followed by caustic generation at cathode thus in this communication treatment of ppw along with sulfur and caustic generation is being proposed keywords petroleum produced water ppw electrochemical cell ec wastewater treatment caustic soda 1 introduction souring of petroleum crude oil and corrosion of pipelines are two major issues for the crude oil industry both of which are caused due to the sulfides present in petroleum produced water ppw or oilfield produced water this also prevents the oil companies from emplacing the generated ppw back into the reservoir for maintaining reservoir pressure the oil companies use fresh water for pressure maintenance and discharge the ppw into the environment thus incurring a huge cost to the industry 1 moreover the volume of water to oil ratio more commonly known as the water cut increases over the life of a conventional oil or gas well and can go up to 98 of the extracted fluids during the later stages of crude oil production 2 conserving water becomes even more important in cases where oil companies are located in regions of water scarcity another important concern for treatment of ppw is its high tds and conductivity especially if ppw has to be discharged into the environment traditionally for ppw treatment various physical biological chemical and or membrane based technologies have been used the physical technologies usually have high retention time and space requirements for chemical treatments secondary pollution due to chemicals is a major concern furthermore ppw has low organic content which coupled with high conductivity creates an impediment for the conventional biological treatment processes thus to tackle the complex nature and large volume of ppw newer technologies need to be developed and explored 3 electrochemical treatment of wastewaters has been explored and used for many years these systems can also be used remove reduce sulfide content from wastewaters by subjecting them to a specific applied voltage pikaar et al 4 electrochemically treated sulfide in domestic wastewater using different mixed metal electrodes they achieved more than 75 sulfide reduction pikaar et al 5 also used electrochemical system for long term treatment of sewage for sulfate reduction recently selvaraj et al 6 treated sulfides in pond water using electrochemical system at 20 ma cm2 an electrochemical pilot scale plant was also reported by ma and wang 7 to treat petroleum produced water however they used a very high voltage 15 v and focused on cod suspended solids corrosion rate and bacterial count reduction petroleum based brine was also treated by another group using ti iro2 ta2o5 and bdd electrodes under galvantostatic conditions 8 hastie et al 9 also reported treatment of geothermal brines in packed bed reactors to treat sulfides however they converted the sulfides to organosulfates rather than sulfur through this communication we propose to use electrochemical systems for sulfide and tds reduction furthermore the high conductivity of ppw is also due to high nacl concentration which can be converted to caustic soda naoh caustic soda is a versatile chemical and has many uses in various industries in the crude oil industry itself it is used along with drilling fluids to maintain their ph and viscosity petroleum refining etc thus through the electrochemical approach a chemical of in house use is being generated along with reduced tds and sulfide content moreover to the authors best knowledge this is the first attempt to treat ppw in a long term carbon electrode based electrochemical system 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation a dual chambered electrochemical cell ec with a

the reactor influent flow rate which was maintained at 21 43 h for anode electrochemical cell was maintained at room temperature and the wastewater treatment parameters were evaluated continuously the

mol n is the number of electrons involved i e 2 electrons for the oxidation of 1 mol sulfide to sulfur c is the amount of sulfide added g and m is the molar weight of sulfide i e 32 g mol hence by

electrochemical measurements were done by using anode as working electrode cathode as the counter electrode against ag agcl 3 m nacl reference electrode the amount of electrical energy stored in a

order to guarantee that the differences in the intensity variability are not caused by the instrumental variability but just from the sample morphology the apparatus was equipped with energy dispersion spectrometry eds which was used for detection of different elements eds generates specific energy spectra of elements on the basis of their interaction with x rays thus eds integrated was used to confirm the presence of sulfur particles on anode surface 3 results and discussion in this study syn ppw was electrochemically treated at 0 5 v vs ag agcl in a continuous mode of operation the treatment efficacy was evaluated in terms of sulfide and tds removal from this waste stream also concomitant polysulfide and naoh production were estimated which would add value to the treatment process 3 1 sulfide oxidation in continuous mode of operation the synthetic ppw fed to the anode contains an initial sulfide concentration of 0 649 mg l which was oxidized at anode and converted to different forms of sulfur under the applied potential of 0 5 v vs ag agcl the experiment was carried out for about more than two months during which about 98 sulphide conversion was observed sulfide present in the syn ppw was oxidised at the anode with the application of 0 5 v vs ag agcl which was deposited on the electrode surface the ec was run continuously for more than two months during which almost 98 was converted to different forms of sulfur including sulfate 649 mg l sulfite 1 027 mg l thiosulfate 0 066 mg l and polysulfides 423 254 mg l thiosulfates might have formed due to oxidation of sulfide during sample collection and preservation 15 thus only sulfide concentration had decreased while the concentration of other sulfur oxyanions did not change on an average 65 of sulfides were converted to polysulfides which is depicted in fig 1 thus the average ce for sulfide to sulfur conversion would be 0 652 a gradual decrease in sulfide conversion is also depicted in fig 1 which might be due to deactivation of electrode because of sulfur deposition during direct sulfide oxidation sulfide is oxidized at the electrode surface to sulfur s thiosulfate s2o3 2 sulfite so3 2 or sulfate so4 2 depending on the anode material used and anode potential applied at very high potentials sulfate can be further oxidized to persulfate s2o8 2 which is a strong oxidant direct oxidation of sulfide can take place at low potentials 16 which allows for the selective oxidation of sulfide from a liquid without any parasitic side reactions taking place oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur is preferred from an economical point of view as it requires the least number of electrons and thus energy input i e 2 electron oxidation compared to for example an 8 electron oxidation for oxidation to sulfate in addition elemental sulfur is a solid which would allow for its easier separation and recovery from the liquid phase moreover particularly for graphite carbon electrodes much higher anode potentials are required for the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate compared to the other more conductive electrode materials like platinum also sulfate formation in wastewater always creates a risk for re reduction to sulfide by micro organisms downstream 3 thus the following reaction is expected to take place at anode 15 anodic reaction h2s hs s s 2e 2h h e 0 271 v h2s hs 1 m ph 7 eqn 4 however as intermediary towards sulfur recovery polysulfide is preferred over sulfide also the electrochemical removal of sulfide is assisted by the chemical dissolution of sulfur by sulfide to polysulfide at basic ph concentrated polysulfide solutions can be converted to solid harvestable elemental sulfur by simply adjusting the solution ph to 5 at which solid sulfur particles precipitate out 15 5 hs n 1 8 s8 s2 n h n 1 3 2 electrochemical analyses chronoamperometry was used to measure the working electrode s current at fixed potential 0 5 v vs ag agcl with time the chronoamperometric analysis recorded a current of approximately 30 ma which started to gradually decrease after the 40th day to 23 ma since this cell was run in a continuous mode a constant supply of charged species was ensured mainly in form of sulfide ions the progressive decrease in current can be attributed to the sulfur deposition and subsequent electrode deactivation sulfur has high electrical resistivity of 1017 ฯ cm and thus the formation and accumulation of sulfur on the electrode surface affects its behaviour which is illustrated by the current transients in fig 2 apart from chronoamperometry cv is another important electrochemical analysis during which working electrode potential is changed in a cyclic way and the resulting current is measured as a function of time during the operation of ec in continuous mode cv were recorded every 5th day from 0 6 to 1 4 v with a scan rate of 0 5 mv s fig 2 strong reduction current 52 59 ma was observed during the initial phase of experiment at anode which later decreased to 21 58 ma this indicates the increased oxidative behaviour of anode with time leading to sulfide oxidation also as reported by rozan and co workers 17 peaks for hs sulfide and sx 2 polysulfide were observed around 0 66 v during voltammetric analysis fig 3 moreover since cv generates a curve between current and voltage with respect to time the absolute integral area under a cv curve is a measure of charge stored at the electrode solution interface 10 as shown in fig 3 the capacitance or the charge holding ability of the cell decreased with time which also indicates the reduced activity of electrode the maximum capacitance was 19 726 m f while the minimum was 10 371 m f fig 3 3 3 caustic recovery from ppw ppw has high tds and conductivity which causes a major impediment in its surface discharge 3 nacl is a key component towards the high tds and conductivity of ppw the high conductivity of ppw is a major impediment for its surface discharge and many treatment technologies the electrochemical approach used in this study uses the high conductivity for its benefit by directing it towards caustic soda production since a cation exchange membrane is being used to separate the anode and cathode chambers sodium ions can travel across the membrane and combine with the hydroxyl ions to form sodium hydroxide or caustic soda 18 cathodic reaction 6 h2o e h2 g oh e 0 82 v 7 na oh naoh the initial ph of the catholyte was 7 0 which increased to 12 1 with concomitant increase in conductivity from 13 82 ms cm to 30 8 ms cm interestingly the catholyte reached its maximum ph in around 10 days after which a slight decrease in ph and conductivity was observed after which fresh catholyte was supplied and the ph again increased this cyclic variation in ph conductivity and tds is also reflected in fig 4 it was observed that the reduction in conductivity and tds of anolyte diminished with time which could be due to passivation of the electrodes and or membrane fouling pikaar et al 5 had also observed similar results during electrochemical sulfide removal from sewage over a period of 122 days as determined from ic analysis the maximum na concentration also increased on the cathode side to 168 mg l along with an increase in ph which confirms the formation of naoh on the cathode 19 this corresponds to approximately 0 3 g l of caustic soda the initial value of conductivity and tds were 75 9 ms cm and 46 01 g l respectively as the conductivity and tds increased on cathode side they decreased by 49 27 and 44 79 respectively on anode thus post treatment syn ppw had decreased conductivity and tds the results showed that it is feasible to produce caustic from ppw along with its treatment to the authors best knowledge this is the first time that caustic is directly generated from ppw potentially leading to a reagent free method for sulfide abatement 3 4 scanning electron microscopy and spectroscopy though sem is a non quantitative technique it helps to visualize the surface of a particular substance at microscopic levels when the electrode material was analysed under sem some particles were seen deposited on the surface fig 5 the magnification used during sem was 5000 to further validate the other results obtained particles were seen on the electrode surface which were confirmed to be of sulfur using eds analysis fig 5 the eds analysis showed a dominant sulfur peak besides carbon sodium and chlorine peaks since the electrode material was carbon based that could have been detected in eds moreover high nacl content in the syn ppw could have led to deposition of some sodium chloride crystals on the electrode surface 4 conclusion and future remarks in this study we investigated the electrochemical treatment of chloride laden brine i e ppw by directly oxidising the sulfides to sulfur polysulfide the electrochemical cell was run continuously for over 2 months using cheap carbon based electrodes ppw is sulfide rich brine and through this study the authors have tried to treat a feed containing very high sulfide content 0 649 g l which hasn t been reported previously even with a high sulfide

at the component level a condition based technique semi markov or a failure based technique non homogeneous poisson process is proposed based on the type and amount of available data while at the

sector provides essential services to the public including the production and supply of drinking water and collection and treatment of wastewater to do this the water sector relies on treatment plants and infrastructure networks located in urban and rural areas these assets have generally a long life often over 50 years and the majority of the spent utilities relates to these assets 1 in many countries water infrastructures are aging and their condition is deteriorating 2 although drinking and surface water quality is improving in many countries leakage infrastructure failure and the associated cost are still high 3 during the first decade of the 21st century many customers for instance in australia and england have been affected by insufficient supply capacity and reliability and increasing water bills 4 5 large sums of money are involved in the management of water systems 2 water sector decision makers have to decide how to spend this money efficiently so as to maintain the services at the required level both in the short and long terms water treatment plants wtps form an essential part of the drinking water and wastewater systems and can be characterised with three features i they are complex systems consisting of a multitude of components ii their components experience deterioration that is their performance decreases due to ageing iii wtps are repairable systems i e given some components failure they can keep operating without a complete system shutdown and replacement asset management is seen as one of the promising methods for the management of complex and asset intensive companies asset management is about managing the lifecycle of physical assets 6 9 with the aim of providing present and future required service levels in the most cost effective way 7 it provides a coherent set of tools and methods for operation maintenance and investment activities for the assets 10 an important objective of asset management is providing and optimising maintenance strategies the effectiveness of maintenance strategies can be evaluated by means of asset performance indicators well known indicators are reliability availability and maintainability reliability is defined as the probability of an asset not failing in a predefined period of time reliability provides a measure of the frequency of failures and does not take the downtime into account maintainability of an asset can be defined as its ability to be retained in or restored to a specified condition given the use of prescribed procedures and resources availability is the probability of an asset being in a functional state as a result of previous failures and repairs in fact availability accounts for both reliability and maintainability and therefore is a more informative index for evaluating wtps as it is not the continuous operation of wtps as an indication of reliability or their ease of maintenance as an indication of maintainability but their overall operational time as an indication of availability that matters availability can be expressed in different forms such as mission availability average availability and instantaneous availability the instantaneous availability is a time variant variable and due to its ability to account for deterioration of assets is considered in the current research conversely average availability cannot properly deal with deteriorating assets as it provides an average value furthermore wtps are continuous production systems and therefore mission availability does not apply maintenance strategies can be divided into corrective maintenance preventive maintenance and improving maintenance 11 recently there has been a trend from corrective maintenance to preventive maintenance 12 13 which itself can further be distinguished into scheduled maintenance and predictive maintenance scheduled maintenance is a well known type of maintenance based on operation or calendar time while predictive maintenance is undertaken based on the current state and the estimated remaining lifetime of an asset in order to ensure that wtps deliver the service levels required by the society the facility managers will have to provide and continuously optimise maintenance strategies based on a proper assessment of their effect on the wtp s long term availability to this end methodologies would be required for assessing the instantaneous availability of complex systems with repairable and deteriorating components 2 literature review the literature does not provide many studies that describe methodologies for availability assessment of wtps however numerous studies concern methodologies for comparable systems the consulted studies are discussed and evaluated through four criteria is the methodology able to model repairable components is the methodology able to model deteriorating components is the methodology able to model complex system configurations is the methodology able to model the instantaneous availability regarding the foregoing criteria some works incorporate complexity in their methodology but do not consider instantaneous availability or repairable and deteriorating components 14 15 other works present methodologies for repairable systems but do not consider the instantaneous availability deterioration or complexity of the system 16 20 those which consider deterioration however do not deal with complexity repairability or instantaneous availability 11 table 1 provides an overview of all the discussed literature and how they relate to the afore mentioned four criteria as can be seen from table 1 only one of the consulted studies covers all the four criteria cai et al 35 obtained the reliability and availability of subsea blowout preventers based on a dynamic bayesian network approach however their method only deals with moderate complexity i e series and parallel structures and not high complexity e g k out of n redundancy and bridge structures as often seen in wtps this study is therefore aimed at proposing a methodology that can handle all the aforementioned four criteria section 3 describes the techniques used to develop the methodology and how they are combined section 4 presents the application of the methodology to a wtp section 5 is devoted to the discussion of the methodology and the results while section 6 provides the conclusions 3 methodology in this study a two level hierarchical model is proposed to combine several modelling techniques the two main advantages of a hierarchical modelling approach are i it reduces the model complexity and ii it enables the identification of critical components or subsystems 21 first modelling at system level is dealt with in section 3 1 using reliability block diagram rbd section 3 2 provides a flowchart for selecting the most optimal model at component level while section 3 3 demonstrate the application of the selected methodologies to the components the structure of the methodology is given in fig 1 3 1 system availability modelling in order to compute the system availability based on the components availability combinatorial models can be used reliability block diagram rbd is one of the most widely used combinatorial models 22 with an rbd the system availability a t can be calculated as a function of the components availability a i t this can be expressed as 1 a t ฯ a 1 t a 2 t a n t where the structure function ฯ depends on the system configuration 23 for independent components the structure function of an rbd can be obtained by deriving the minimal path sets 23 27 fig 2 shows the rbd of a system consisting of three components in parallel followed by three components in series by using the minimal path sets the following system availability function can be obtained a t a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 3 a 2 a 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 a 6 3 2 model selection at component level two different models can be used a condition based model smp model and a failure based model nhpp model for each component the asset manager must decide which model to apply it should be noted that there is a distinction between the model selection for current use and the model selection for optimal use the former is purely based on the data that is currently available whereas the latter is related to the type of data that should be recorded in the future aiming at optimal availability modelling the flowchart in fig 3 presents the model selection for optimal use first to determine if the nhpp model could be used the question is whether sufficient failure events could be recorded in the case of components of high reliability which do not frequently fail sufficient failure data cannot be recorded and the answer would be no if the components experience failure the question arises here is whether the failures have been recorded and if so whether they are sufficient according to rigdon and basu 28 at least five failure events have to be recorded in order to use the nhpp model if less than five failures events are recorded more events should be recorded until there are sufficient data for using the nhpp model however one should take into account the time it would take to record sufficient failure events if it is not reasonable to wait long enough to have sufficient events recorded the nhpp model should not be chosen second to determine if the smp model can be applied the asset manager must find out if sufficient condition data could be recorded for components for which condition monitoring is not possible at all either continuous or periodic the smp model cannot be applied if the condition can be monitored for the concerned component the next question is whether sufficient condition data can be collected within reasonable time if not the smp model is not the optimal choice the methodology depicted in fig 3 facilitates the choice between two different techniques for modelling component availability over time if both techniques can be applied to a component model selection should be based on economic considerations on the other hand if neither of the models can be applied the component average availability as the ratio of the total downtime to a defined period of time can be used as input data to the rbd to calculate the system availability for example consider a pump which has failed five times over the last ten years and the average downtime as a result of failure has been estimated as two days this would result in an average availability of 0 997 for the pump clearly this does not provide any information regarding deterioration and maintenance but assures all components are included in the rbd 3 3 component availability modelling the modelling approach at the component level is illustrated in fig 4 where two different techniques are proposed the semi markov process smp and the non homogeneous poisson process nhpp smp results in a condition based model while nhpp results in a failure based model for both models the uptimes and downtimes of components are generated via inverse transform sampling its where one uptime and one downtime form a cycle the distribution of the uptimes depends on whether smp or nhpp is selected while the downtimes are assumed to be lognormal for both models finally the availability is modelled over time using monte carlo simulation 3 3 1 semi markov process the conventional markov process is characterised by exponentially distributed holding times meaning the transition probabilities are constant in time and independent of how long the component has been in a certain state this limitation can be relaxed via smp in which the holding times are described by non exponential distributions 29 30 for many real life situations this is a more realistic way of modelling deterioration and therefore the smp has been more adapted for availability modelling 29 31 35 however smp as all types of markov models is not well equipped for modelling complex systems the number of states grows exponentially with the size of the model leading to the notorious state space explosion problem 36 nevertheless smp can deal with deterioration and repairability of system components and thus still applicable to the availability modelling of components within a complex system in smp the uptimes are often described by weibull distribution 32 37 41 this is a well known assumption in the field of reliability engineering as it can fit a wide range of distributions by varying its parameters 29 the probability density function pdf of a two parameter weibull distribution is given by 2 f t ฮฒ ฮธ t ฮธ ฮฒ 1 exp t ฮธ ฮฒ t 0 where ฮฒ shape parameter ฮธ scale parameter and t time given a dataset the parameters can be estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation mle method 42 43 3 3 2 non homogeneous poisson process nhpp is known for its ability to model repairable systems 44 45 specifically it can deal with repairable systems which deteriorate over time different types of nhpp exist among which the power law process plp is very popular 44 with the same failure rate intensity function of weibull distribution 3 ฮป t ฮฒ ฮธ t ฮธ ฮฒ 1 t 0 when ฮฒ 1 plp resembles a deteriorating system where the times between failures become stochastically smaller when ฮฒ 1 plp resembles a system subject to random failure and plp changes to a homogenous poisson process whereas for ฮฒ 1 the times between failures become stochastically larger and plp resembles an improving system plp has been used to model the failure patterns of a variety of deteriorating systems such as power systems 46 machineries 18 49 51 and water mains 47 although plp can model repairable and deteriorating components it cannot be used to aggregate the failure of different components and is thus not suitable for failure assessment of systems besides when modelling failures plp does not consider downtimes and thus cannot model instantaneous availability this latter drawback could be alleviated by including the downtimes via lognormal distribution in order to find out whether a component is deteriorating a trend test such as the laplace trend test or the mil hdbk 189 test should be applied to the component s failure data 48 if the data do not show a trend a homogeneous poisson process hpp should be applied instead of a nhpp or plp furthermore to find out if multiple components deteriorate in a similar fashion a likelihood ratio test may be employed rigdon and basu 45 provide such tests for both the hpp and the plp 3 3 3 distribution of downtimes the inclusion of downtimes is required for computations regarding availability with the smp model this is realised through involving downtimes for specific states that correspond to non availability with the nhpp model this could be achieved through cycles of alternating up and downtimes for the downtimes the lognormal distribution is used which is a commonly chosen distribution for repairs 24 27 the pdf of the lognormal distribution is given by 4 f t 1 2 ฯ ฯ 2 t exp ln t ฮผ 2 2 ฯ 2 t 0 ฮผ ฯ 0 where ฮผ scale parameter ฯ shape parameter and t time the parameters can be estimated using the mle method 48 3 3 4 inverse transform sampling one iteration within the monte carlo simulation consists of consecutive cycles of up and downtimes simulation of the individual up and downtimes is done via inverse transform sampling its the general approach in its is to use the distribution function of a random variable take its inverse cumulative density function cdf and generate random numbers according to this inverse cdf by using the uniform distribution 49 let f x be any invertible cdf of continuous random variable x take f x u where u is a random generated number from the continuous uniform distribution u 0 1 then x f 1 u applying its the availability can be modelled for one iteration for both the smp and the nhpp models 3 3 5 monte carlo simulation with the simulation of one iteration only the instantaneous availability according to that single iteration can be modelled therefore monte carlo simulation is applied to combine the results of many single iterations a discrete time space is used and for each point in time the average of the availability amounts over n iterations is computed the availability of the i t h iteration at time t is given by a i t which is a binary measure depending on whether the iteration at t belongs to an uptime a i t 1 or a downtime a i t 0 the result approximates the stochastic availability of a component which is defined as the probability of the component being available at t 50 51 5 a t p a t 1 i 1 n a i t n 4 application of the methodology the application of the methodology which was developed in the previous section is demonstrated through a water facility in the netherlands the facility s main drinking water treatment plant is called leiduin since complete and unambiguous data is not available within the managing company data for the smp and nhpp techniques has been elicited using experts 4 1 system description the focus in this case study is on a sub system consisting of three consecutive process steps rapid sand filtration ozonation and softening fig 5 pumps and valves that are relevant to the availability of the water treatment plant as a whole are included in the case study as well the interest of leiduin s asset managers lies in the development of the availability over a time period of 30 years due to constraints in the pre treatment process the concerned sub system of leiduin has a maximum production capacity of 2400 m3 h in the present study the term availability for both the system and its components is specified as the probability that the system or component is up and able to meet the maximum production capacity consequently every component is either in an available state or unavailable state 4 1 1 rapid sand filtration the first treatment step of the considered system is the rapid sand filtration consisting of six filters these filters take out suspended particles in the water these filters have to be periodically backwashed in order to unclog each filter has a maximum capacity of 600 m3 h resulting in a total maximum capacity of 3600 m3 h since the subsystem s overall production capacity is constrained to 2400 m3 h the rapid sand filtration needs at least 4 out of 6 installed filters to be working in order to meet the maximum production capacity from the sand filters the water flows through pipelines to the ozonation step 4 1 2 pipelines pipelines connecting the different treatment steps are part of the system as well however discussions with the site personnel uncovered that no failures are known for the pipelines on site and therefore they are assumed to have an availability of 1 and will not be addressed in the subsequent sections 4 1 3 ozonation the next treatment step is the ozonation which is a disinfection step to kill off bacteria viruses and pesticides the treatment takes place in a multi chambered cellar where the water is brought into contact with the ozone leiduin has two ozone streets ozone street 1 and 2 these streets consist of an ozone generator a cooling system a multi chambered cellar and an ozone dispensing system each of the ozone streets can handle 2800 m3 h and thus able to meet the maximum production capacity alone 4 1 4 pumps after the ozonation the water is pumped to the softening process ozone street 1 is connected to pumps 1 and 2 while ozone street 2 is connected to pumps 3 and 4 both pumping units have a parallel configuration in order to provide redundancy each pump has a capacity of 2500 m3 h which is sufficient to meet the maximum production capacity 4 1 5 valve valves are used to direct flows of water through the pipeline system in the present sub system one important valve is present the valve is located between the ozone streets and the pumps the valve makes it possible to bypass the water flow from ozone street 1 to pumps 3 and 4 and from ozone street 2 to pumps 1 and 2 the capacity of the valve is 3600 m3 h in either direction 4 1 6 softening reactors water is then pumped to the softening reactors in the softening reactors the water comes into contact with sodium hydroxide letting calcium precipitate on sand grains when the grains increase in size they sink to the bottom and are subsequently drained from the softening reactor there are four softening reactors in total each with a maximum production capacity of 800 m3 h in order to meet the maximum production capacity of the sub system 2400 m3 h at least 3 of the 4 softening reactors need to be operating at full capacity after this softening process step the water flows towards the next treatment step the carbon filtration which is not included in this case study 4 2 selection of appropriate techniques at component level after the identification of the sub system s components the next step is selecting the appropriate technique smp nhpp or neither for assessing each component s availability using the flowchart in fig 3 the rapid sand filters are taken as an example for applying the flowchart it is assumed that for the rapid sand filters sufficient failure events have been recorded over the past years this proposes both smp and nhpp as potential techniques besides according to the plant operators and asset managers it is practically not possible to determine the condition of the filters this rules out smp as an option as such the nhpp model could be used to model the availability of the rapid sand filters following the same procedure appropriate techniques for the other components can be identified as in table 2 4 3 availability assessment of components 4 3 1 availability of rapid sand filtration mil hdbk 189 test and laplace test are applied to the data of the rapid sand filters these suggest there is no trend in the data of any of the filters appendix a indicating that the rapid sand filters can be modelled by an hpp which is similar to an nhpp with ฮฒ 1 in order to find out if the data from all the filters can be pooled together a likelihood ratio test can be performed this test measures the equality of the filters based on the failure data the outcome of the test at a significance level of ฮฑ 0 05 does not reject the equality of the filters meaning the data from all filters can be pooled since the filters are modelled via hpp only the parameter ฮธ has to be estimated ฮฒ 1 the repair time data of all the filters is assumed to identically follow a lognormal distribution the parameters of both the hpp model uptimes and the lognormal distribution downtimes are calculated using the mle approach as in table 3 these parameters of the lognormal distribution are used for the nhpp model the availability of a rapid sand filter has been depicted in fig 6 at the beginning the availability of the sand filter is equal to 1 0 initial condition but soon descends to a steady amount of about 0 987 this steady availability is consistent with the hpp and its random failure behaviour 4 3 2 availability of ozonation unit four discrete upstates are assumed for the ozone streets state 1 corresponds to the same as new and state 4 refers to the last deterioration state before failure the condition of both the ozone streets can be monitored continuously when an ozone street is monitored to be in state 4 maintenance is performed immediately however the condition improvement due to maintenance decreases over time the first three repair actions for an ozone street return its condition back to state 2 the 4th 5th and 6th repairs result in state 3 then the 7th repair action is a perfect repair renewal so afterwards the ozone street is assumed to be the same as new this procedure is repeated thereafter so the next repair can be seen as the first repair of a new cycle one downstate state 5 is assumed to describe all repair actions the parameters for the holding time distributions can be estimated using mle as presented in table 4 fig 7 shows the availability of one of the ozone streets modelled with the smp model it should be noted that the distribution parameters of the holding time of state 4 cannot be estimated when an ozone street enters state 4 a repair action is performed immediately so the holding times are cut off in the smp model the holding time for state 4 is always equal to one day not influencing the model outcome 4 3 3 availability of pumps similar to the ozone streets four discrete upstates are assumed and the condition can be monitored continuously when a pump is monitored to be in state 4 maintenance is performed the influence of which decreases over time the first five repair actions for a pump return its condition to state 2 this type of imperfect repair is described by a downstate as state 5 the 6th repair action is a perfect repair renewal bringing the pump back to state 1 same as new the equivalent downstate is referred to as state 6 the parameters for the holding time distributions can be estimated using mle as listed in table 5 fig 8 shows the availability of a single pump for the same reasons as for the ozonation unit the holding time distribution for state 4 of the pumps cannot be estimated 4 3 4 availability of softening reactors the trend tests suggest that there is a trend in the failure data of the softening reactors appendix a in order to find out if the data from all reactors can be pooled together a likelihood ratio test is performed the likelihood ratio test fails to reject the equality of the failure data of the softening reactors it is yet unknown if the trend in the data is signalling a deteriorating system or an improving system therefore the parameters of the nhpp model have to be estimated via mle the parameter ฮฒ confirms that the data follows a deteriorating trend since the 95 confidence interval of ฮฒ is greater than 1 0 table 6 the availability of a softening reactor has been displayed in fig 9 the availability behaviour is consistent with a deteriorating nhpp where due to its minimal repair the uptimes are stochastically decreasing with time leading to an ever decreasing availability 4 4 availability assessment of the system based on the system description in section 4 1 the system can be modelled using a rbd as shown in fig 10 based on the availability of its components the system availability can be computed by deriving the minimal path sets for the different types of configurations in the rbd the system availability fig 11 clearly shows a deteriorating behaviour where the availability declines over time 5 discussion from an asset manager s point of view the aim is to optimise the system configuration and maintenance strategy in order to satisfy the availability demands in the most cost efficient way this challenge has caused a shift from preventive and corrective maintenance towards predictive condition based maintenance to evaluate changes to the system configuration or maintenance strategies it is important to gain insights about the system availability over time decreased by asset deterioration and increased via maintenance actions the proposed methodology has been developed with the aim of assisting asset managers of wtps in this regard an important feature of the methodology is that it is data driven the smp model is based on condition data so it is important to know if and how the condition of assets can be determined for some assets it is possible to monitor the condition continuously which would be the ideal situation whereas for other assets the condition can only be determined through periodic inspections aiming for uniform condition monitoring a standard such as the dutch nen 2767 standard 52 could serve as a guideline to asset managers the nhpp model on the other hand is driven by failure data it must be well defined when an asset has failed and the recording of failures needs to be accurate and uniform in case of data scarcity it is possible to use expert judgement as input for the modelling at component level many models for expert judgement elicitation exist in the literature cooke and goossens 53 discuss two models for critical infrastructures likewise the information regarding the performed maintenance actions must be well registered information on the type of active maintenance strategy the influence of a maintenance action on the asset condition and the time it takes to perform the maintenance action are of significant importance for accurate availability modelling without a proper definition and collection of condition data failure data and maintenance actions adoption of the methodology by asset managers and other users might prove difficult subsequently the proposed methodology can be used as a demonstration of the usefulness and importance of collecting data in producing tangible insights into temporal availability of assets and asset systems the present study can further be improved by relaxing some of the simplifying assumptions made in the development of the methodology first it is assumed that components deteriorate and or fail independently which is inevitable if the system is to be modelled using rbd technique this assumption seems to be simplistic since in real life systems there would be dependencies between components due to common cause failures or load sharing in parallel sub systems a solution could be the application of dynamic bayesian belief networks 17 50 54 55 to account for conditional dependencies which can be pursued in future works second it should be noted that this study focusses on availability modelling which is a first step in the optimisation process of maintenance strategies and system configurations the next step would be the conducting a cost benefit analysis in order to ensure an affordable high availability in this regard the semi markov decision process smdp as an extension of the smp model could be used to find optimal maintenance strategies 33 56 57 and life cycle costing lcc techniques could be applied for discounting future revenue and expenses of maintenance strategies in the nhpp model 58 third with the smp model multiple condition states can be included where each condition state is corresponding to a value for the instantaneous availability of the concerned component in the proposed methodology this instantaneous availability is assumed to be a binary variable either 1 or 0 therefore an extension to the smp model could be the inclusion of intermediate values for the instantaneous availability this would allow the modelling of partly available or degraded components as a result of deterioration for example within a wtp this could be relevant for different types of filters experiencing degrees of clogging and thus not working with 100 efficiency fourth inclusion of other types of models at the component level could relax some assumptions for the nhpp model the application of imperfect repair models such as virtual age process vap models are recommended to be investigated 59 61 they relax the assumption of minimal repair for the nhpp model or perfect repair for the hpp model vap models such as the arithmetic reduction of intensity ari and the arithmetic reduction of age ara introduced by doyen and gaudoin 59 fit well with the power law process used in the nhpp model one should keep in mind however that with the generalisation to imperfect repair models demands on data become more challenging as in addition to failures and repair times the effect of repairs on the asset has to be estimated too 6 conclusions in order to ensure water availability to society asset managers of wtps are in need for tools to assess long term availability complex configurations and repairable and deteriorating assets are inherent characteristics of these plants however methodologies capable of modelling the instantaneous availability and simultaneously addressing repairability and deterioration of wtp are lacking therefore the current research presents a two level model for assessing the instantaneous availability of wtps i choosing between a condition based technique smp and a failure based technique nhpp at the component level and ii application of a rbd to calculate the availability at the system level the proposed methodology is exemplified by a case study of a dutch wtp where data has been elicited from experts assessing the availability of the components and the system it was shown that the wtp was presenting a deteriorating behaviour over a 30 year period this research has relied on the simplifying assumption of independent deterioration and failure of components therefore the performance of the developed methodology can further be improved by applying more sophisticated techniques than rbd so that conditional dependencies can be accounted for appendix a trend test statistics from the nhpp models the trend tests work as follows for the laplace test there is no trend if the test statistic falls within the interval bounds corresponding to the chosen significance level of the standard normal distribution thus a significance level of ฮฑ 0 05 means that the interval bounds are about 1 96 and 1 96 for the mil hdbk 189 test if the test statistic falls within the interval bounds for a chosen significance level there is no trend in the data the interval bounds of this test are data specific and are included within tables a1 and a2 
14446,water treatment plants wtps are characterised as complex configurations of repairable and deteriorating components previous studies have mainly focused on the average or steady state availability of such systems while ignoring inherent characteristics like degradation the current research proposes a two level hierarchical model for long term availability analysis of wtps to do so at the component level a condition based technique semi markov or a failure based technique non homogeneous poisson process is proposed based on the type and amount of available data while at the system level a reliability block diagram can be used to combine the component level availabilities the application of the methodology has been demonstrated on a real case study in the netherlands

sector provides essential services to the public including the production and supply of drinking water and collection and treatment of wastewater to do this the water sector relies on treatment plants and infrastructure networks located in urban and rural areas these assets have generally a long life often over 50 years and the majority of the spent utilities relates to these assets 1 in many countries water infrastructures are aging and their condition is deteriorating 2 although drinking and surface water quality is improving in many countries leakage infrastructure failure and the associated cost are still high 3 during the first decade of the 21st century many customers for instance in australia and england have been affected by insufficient supply capacity and reliability and increasing water bills 4 5 large sums of money are involved in the management of water systems 2 water sector decision makers have to decide how to spend this money efficiently so as to maintain the services at the required level both in the short and long terms water treatment plants wtps form an essential part of the drinking water and wastewater systems and can be characterised with three features i they are complex systems consisting of a multitude of components ii their components experience deterioration that is their performance decreases due to ageing iii wtps are repairable systems i e given some components failure they can keep operating without a complete system shutdown and replacement asset management is seen as one of the promising methods for the management of complex and asset intensive companies asset management is about managing the lifecycle of physical assets 6 9 with the aim of providing present and future required service levels in the most cost effective way 7 it provides a coherent set of tools and methods for operation maintenance and investment activities for the assets 10 an important objective of asset management is providing and optimising maintenance strategies the effectiveness of maintenance strategies can be evaluated by means of asset performance indicators well known indicators are reliability availability and maintainability reliability is defined as the probability of an asset not failing in a predefined period of time reliability provides a measure of the frequency of failures and does not take the downtime into account maintainability of an asset can be defined as its ability to be retained in or restored to a specified condition given the use of prescribed procedures and resources availability is the probability of an asset being in a functional state as a result of previous failures and repairs in fact availability accounts for both reliability and maintainability and therefore is a more informative index for evaluating wtps as it is not the continuous operation of wtps as an indication of reliability or their ease of maintenance as an indication of maintainability but their overall operational time as an indication of availability that matters availability can be expressed in different forms such as mission availability average availability and instantaneous availability the instantaneous availability is a time variant variable and due to its ability to account for deterioration of assets is considered in the current research conversely average availability cannot properly deal with deteriorating assets as it provides an average value furthermore wtps are continuous production systems and therefore mission availability does not apply maintenance strategies can be divided into corrective maintenance preventive maintenance and improving maintenance 11 recently there has been a trend from corrective maintenance to preventive maintenance 12 13 which itself can further be distinguished into scheduled maintenance and predictive maintenance scheduled maintenance is a well known type of maintenance based on operation or calendar time while predictive maintenance is undertaken based on the current state and the estimated remaining lifetime of an asset in order to ensure that wtps deliver the service levels required by the society the facility managers will have to provide and continuously optimise maintenance strategies based on a proper assessment of their effect on the wtp s long term availability to this end methodologies would be required for assessing the instantaneous availability of complex systems with repairable and deteriorating components 2 literature review the literature does not provide many studies that describe methodologies for availability assessment of wtps however numerous studies concern methodologies for comparable systems the consulted studies are discussed and evaluated through four criteria is the methodology able to model repairable components is the methodology able to model deteriorating components is the methodology able to model complex system configurations is the methodology able to model the instantaneous availability regarding the foregoing criteria some works incorporate complexity in their methodology but do not consider instantaneous availability or repairable and deteriorating components 14 15 other works present methodologies for repairable systems but do not consider the instantaneous availability deterioration or complexity of the system 16 20 those which consider deterioration however do not deal with complexity repairability or instantaneous availability 11 table 1 provides an overview of all the discussed literature and how they relate to the afore mentioned four criteria as can be seen from table 1 only one of the consulted studies covers all the four criteria cai et al 35 obtained the reliability and availability of subsea blowout preventers based on a dynamic bayesian network approach however their method only deals with moderate complexity i e series and parallel structures and not high complexity e g k out of n redundancy and bridge structures as often seen in wtps this study is therefore aimed at proposing a methodology that can handle all the aforementioned four criteria section 3 describes the techniques used to develop the methodology and how they are combined section 4 presents the application of the methodology to a wtp section 5 is devoted to the discussion of the methodology and the results while section 6 provides the conclusions 3 methodology in this study a two level hierarchical model is proposed to combine several modelling techniques the two main advantages of a hierarchical modelling approach are i it reduces the model complexity and ii it enables the identification of critical components or subsystems 21 first modelling at system level is dealt with in section 3 1 using reliability block diagram rbd section 3 2 provides a flowchart for selecting the most optimal model at component level while section 3 3 demonstrate the application of the selected methodologies to the components the structure of the methodology is given in fig 1 3 1 system availability modelling in order to compute the system availability based on the components availability combinatorial models can be used reliability

smp model and a failure based model nhpp model for each component the asset manager must decide which model to apply it should be noted that there is a distinction between the model selection for current use and the model selection for optimal use the former is purely based on the data that is currently available whereas the latter is related to the type of data that should be recorded in the future aiming at optimal availability modelling the flowchart in fig 3 presents the model selection for optimal use first to determine if the nhpp model could be used the question is whether sufficient failure events could be recorded in the case of components of high reliability which do not frequently fail sufficient failure data cannot be recorded and the answer would be no if the components experience failure the question arises here is whether the failures have been recorded and if so whether they are sufficient according to rigdon and basu 28 at least five failure events have to be recorded in order to use the nhpp model if less than five failures events are recorded more events should be recorded until there are sufficient data for using the nhpp model however one should take into account the time it would take to record sufficient failure events if it is not reasonable to wait long enough to have sufficient events recorded the nhpp model should not be chosen second to determine if the smp model can be applied the asset manager must find out if sufficient condition data could be recorded for components for which condition monitoring is not possible at all either continuous or periodic the smp model cannot be applied if the condition can be monitored for the concerned component the next question is whether sufficient condition data can be collected within reasonable time if not the smp model is not the optimal choice the methodology depicted in fig 3 facilitates the choice between two different techniques for modelling component availability over time if both techniques can be applied to a component model selection should be based on economic considerations on the other hand if neither of the models can be applied the component average availability as the ratio of the total downtime to a defined period of time can be used as input data to the rbd to calculate the system availability for example consider a pump which has failed five times over the last ten years and the average downtime as a result of failure has been estimated as two days this would result in an average availability of 0 997 for the pump clearly this does not provide any information regarding deterioration and maintenance but assures all components are included in the rbd 3 3 component availability modelling the modelling approach at the component level is illustrated in fig 4 where two different techniques are proposed the semi markov process smp and the non homogeneous poisson process nhpp smp results in a condition based model while nhpp results in a failure based model for both models the uptimes and downtimes of components are generated via inverse transform sampling its where one uptime and one downtime form a cycle the distribution of the uptimes depends on whether smp or nhpp is selected while the downtimes are assumed to be lognormal for both models finally the availability is modelled over time using monte carlo simulation 3 3 1 semi markov process the conventional markov process is characterised by exponentially distributed holding times meaning the transition probabilities are constant in time and independent of how long the component has been in a certain state this limitation can be relaxed via smp in which the holding times are described by non exponential distributions 29 30 for many real life situations this is a more realistic way of modelling deterioration and therefore the smp has been more adapted for availability modelling 29 31 35 however smp as all types of markov models is not well equipped for modelling complex systems the number of states grows exponentially with the size of the model leading to the notorious state space explosion problem 36 nevertheless smp can deal with deterioration and repairability of system components and thus still applicable to the availability modelling of components within a complex system in smp the uptimes are often described by weibull distribution 32 37 41 this is a well known assumption in the field of reliability engineering as it can fit a wide range of distributions by varying its parameters 29 the probability density function pdf of a two parameter weibull distribution is given by 2 f t ฮฒ ฮธ t ฮธ ฮฒ 1 exp t ฮธ ฮฒ t 0 where ฮฒ shape parameter ฮธ scale parameter and t time given a dataset the parameters can be estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation mle method 42 43 3 3 2 non homogeneous poisson process nhpp is known for its ability to model repairable systems 44 45 specifically it can deal with repairable systems which deteriorate over time different types of nhpp exist among which the power law process plp is very popular 44 with the same failure rate intensity function of weibull distribution 3 ฮป t ฮฒ ฮธ t ฮธ ฮฒ 1 t 0 when ฮฒ 1 plp resembles a deteriorating system where the times between failures become stochastically smaller when ฮฒ 1 plp resembles a system subject to random failure and plp changes to a homogenous poisson process whereas for ฮฒ 1 the times between failures become stochastically larger and plp resembles an improving system plp has been used to model the failure patterns of a variety of deteriorating systems such as power systems 46 machineries 18 49 51 and water mains 47 although plp can model repairable and deteriorating components it cannot be used to aggregate the failure of different components and is thus not suitable for failure assessment of systems besides when modelling failures plp does not consider downtimes and thus cannot model instantaneous availability this latter drawback could be alleviated by including the downtimes via lognormal distribution in order to find out whether a component is deteriorating a trend test such as the laplace trend test or the mil hdbk 189 test should be applied to the component s failure data 48 if the data do not show a trend a homogeneous poisson process hpp should be applied instead of a nhpp or plp furthermore to find out if multiple components deteriorate in a similar fashion a likelihood ratio test may be employed rigdon and basu 45 provide such tests for both the hpp and the plp 3 3 3 distribution of downtimes the inclusion of downtimes is required for computations regarding availability with the smp model this is realised through involving downtimes for specific states that correspond to non availability with the nhpp model this could be achieved through cycles of alternating up and downtimes for the downtimes the lognormal distribution is used which is a commonly chosen distribution for repairs 24 27 the pdf of the lognormal distribution is given by 4 f t 1 2 ฯ ฯ 2 t exp ln t ฮผ 2 2 ฯ 2 t 0 ฮผ ฯ 0 where ฮผ scale parameter ฯ shape parameter and t time the parameters can be estimated using the mle method 48 3 3 4 inverse transform sampling one iteration within the monte carlo simulation consists of consecutive cycles of up and downtimes simulation of the individual up and downtimes is done via inverse transform sampling its the general approach in its is to use the distribution function of a random variable take its inverse cumulative density function cdf and generate random numbers according to this inverse cdf by using the uniform distribution 49 let f x be any invertible cdf of continuous random variable x take f x u where u is a random generated number from the continuous uniform distribution u 0 1 then x f 1 u applying its the availability can be modelled for one iteration for both the smp and the nhpp models 3 3 5 monte carlo simulation with the simulation of one iteration only the instantaneous availability according to that single iteration can be modelled therefore monte carlo simulation is applied to combine the results of many single iterations a discrete time space is used and for each point in time the average of the availability amounts over n iterations is computed the availability of the i t h iteration at time t is given by a i t which is a binary measure depending on whether the iteration at t belongs to an uptime a i t 1 or a downtime a i t 0 the result approximates the stochastic availability of a component which is defined as the probability of the component being available at t 50 51 5 a t p a t 1 i 1 n a i t n 4 application of the methodology the application of the methodology which was developed in the previous section is demonstrated through a water facility in the netherlands the facility s main drinking water treatment plant is called leiduin since complete and unambiguous data is not available within the managing company data for the smp and nhpp techniques has been elicited using experts 4 1 system description the focus in this case study is on a sub system consisting of three consecutive process steps rapid sand filtration ozonation and softening fig 5 pumps and valves that are relevant to the availability of the water treatment plant as a whole are included in the case study as well the interest of leiduin s asset managers lies in the development of the availability over a time period of 30 years due to constraints in the pre treatment process the concerned sub system of leiduin has a maximum production capacity of 2400 m3 h in the present study the term availability for both the system and its components is specified as the probability that the system or component is up and able to meet the maximum production capacity consequently every component is either in an available state or unavailable state 4 1 1 rapid sand filtration the first treatment step of the considered system is the rapid sand filtration consisting of six filters these filters take out suspended particles in the water these filters have to be periodically backwashed in order to unclog each filter has a maximum capacity of 600 m3 h resulting in a total maximum capacity of 3600 m3 h since the subsystem s overall production capacity is constrained to 2400 m3 h the rapid sand filtration needs at least 4 out of 6 installed filters to be working in order to meet the maximum production capacity from the sand filters the water flows through pipelines to the ozonation step 4 1 2 pipelines pipelines connecting the different treatment steps are part of the system as well however discussions with the site personnel uncovered that no failures are known for the pipelines on site and therefore they are assumed to have an availability of 1 and will not be addressed in the subsequent sections 4 1 3 ozonation the next treatment step is the ozonation which is a disinfection step to kill off bacteria viruses and pesticides the treatment takes place in a multi chambered cellar where the water is brought into contact with the ozone leiduin has two ozone streets ozone street 1 and 2 these streets consist of an ozone generator a cooling system a multi chambered cellar and an ozone dispensing system each of the ozone streets can handle 2800 m3 h and thus able to meet the maximum production capacity alone 4 1 4 pumps after the ozonation the water is pumped to the softening process ozone street 1 is connected to pumps 1 and 2 while ozone street 2 is connected to pumps 3 and 4 both pumping units have a parallel configuration in order to provide redundancy each pump has a capacity of 2500 m3 h which is sufficient to meet the maximum production capacity 4 1 5 valve valves are used to direct flows of water through the pipeline system in the present sub system one important valve is present the valve is located between the ozone streets and the pumps the valve makes it possible to bypass the water flow from ozone street 1 to pumps 3 and 4 and from ozone street 2 to pumps 1 and 2 the capacity of the valve is 3600 m3 h in either direction 4 1 6 softening reactors water is then pumped to the softening reactors in the softening reactors the water comes into contact with sodium hydroxide letting calcium precipitate on sand grains when the grains increase in size they sink to the bottom and are subsequently drained from the softening reactor there are four softening reactors in total each with a maximum production capacity of 800 m3 h in order to meet the maximum production capacity of the sub system 2400 m3 h at least 3 of the 4 softening reactors need to be operating at full capacity after this softening process step the water flows towards the next treatment step the carbon filtration which is not included in this case study 4 2 selection of appropriate techniques at component level after the identification of the sub system s components the next step is selecting the appropriate technique smp nhpp or neither for assessing each component s availability using the flowchart in fig 3 the rapid sand filters are taken as an example for applying the flowchart it is assumed that for the rapid sand filters sufficient failure events have been recorded over the past years this proposes both smp and nhpp as potential techniques besides according to the plant operators and asset managers it is practically not possible to determine the condition of the filters this rules out smp as an option as such the nhpp model could be used to model the availability of the rapid sand filters following the same procedure appropriate techniques for the other components can be identified as in table 2 4 3 availability assessment of components 4 3 1 availability of rapid sand filtration mil hdbk 189 test and laplace test are applied to the data of the rapid sand filters these suggest there is no trend in the data of any of the filters appendix a indicating that the rapid sand filters can be modelled by an hpp which is similar to an nhpp with ฮฒ 1 in order to find out if the data from all the filters can be pooled together a likelihood ratio test can be performed this test measures the equality of the filters based on the failure data the outcome of the test at a significance level of ฮฑ 0 05 does not reject the equality of the filters meaning the data from all filters can be pooled since the filters are modelled via hpp only the parameter ฮธ has to be estimated ฮฒ 1 the repair time data of all the filters is assumed to identically follow a lognormal distribution the parameters of both the hpp model uptimes and the lognormal distribution downtimes are calculated using the mle approach as in table 3 these parameters of the lognormal distribution are used for the nhpp model the availability of a rapid sand filter has been depicted in fig 6 at the beginning the availability of the sand filter is equal to 1 0 initial condition but soon descends to a steady amount of about 0 987 this steady availability is consistent with the hpp and its random failure behaviour 4 3 2 availability of ozonation unit four discrete upstates are assumed for the ozone streets state 1 corresponds to the same as new and state 4 refers to the last deterioration state before failure the condition of both the ozone streets can be monitored continuously when an ozone street is monitored to be in state 4 maintenance is performed immediately however the condition improvement due to maintenance decreases over time the first three repair actions for an ozone street return its condition back to state 2 the 4th 5th and 6th repairs result in state 3 then the 7th repair action is a perfect repair renewal so afterwards the ozone street is assumed to be the same as new this procedure is repeated thereafter so the next repair can be seen as the first repair of a new cycle one downstate state 5 is assumed to describe all repair actions the parameters for the holding time distributions can be estimated using mle as presented in table 4 fig 7 shows the availability of one of the ozone streets modelled with the smp model it should be noted that the distribution parameters of the holding time of state 4 cannot be estimated when an ozone street enters state 4 a repair action is performed immediately so the holding times are cut off in the smp model the holding time for state 4 is always equal to one day not influencing the model outcome 4 3 3 availability of pumps similar to the ozone streets four discrete upstates are assumed and the condition can be monitored continuously when a pump is monitored to be in state 4 maintenance is performed the influence of which decreases over time the first five repair actions for a pump return its condition to state 2 this type of imperfect repair is described by a downstate as state 5 the 6th repair action is a perfect repair renewal bringing the pump back to state 1 same as new the equivalent downstate is referred to as state 6 the parameters for the holding time distributions can be estimated using mle as listed in table 5 fig 8 shows the availability of a single pump for the same reasons as for the ozonation unit the holding time distribution for state 4 of the pumps cannot be estimated 4 3 4 availability of softening reactors the trend tests suggest that there is a trend in the failure data of the softening reactors appendix a in order to find out if the data from all reactors can be pooled together a likelihood ratio test is performed the likelihood ratio test fails to reject the equality of the failure data of the softening reactors it is yet unknown if the trend in the data is signalling a deteriorating system or an improving system therefore the parameters of the nhpp model have to be estimated via mle the parameter ฮฒ confirms that the data follows a deteriorating trend since the 95 confidence interval of ฮฒ is greater than 1 0 table 6 the availability of a softening reactor has been displayed in fig 9 the availability behaviour is consistent with a deteriorating nhpp where due to its minimal repair the uptimes are stochastically decreasing with time leading to an ever decreasing availability 4 4 availability assessment of the system based on the system description in section 4 1 the system can be modelled using a rbd as shown in fig 10 based on the availability of its components the system availability can be computed by deriving the minimal path sets for the different types of configurations in the rbd the system availability fig 11 clearly shows a deteriorating behaviour where the availability declines over time 5 discussion from an asset manager s point of view the aim is to optimise the system configuration and maintenance strategy in order to satisfy the availability demands in the most cost efficient way this challenge has caused a shift from preventive and corrective maintenance towards predictive condition based maintenance to evaluate changes to the system configuration or maintenance strategies it is important to gain insights about the system availability over time decreased by asset deterioration and increased via maintenance actions the proposed methodology has been developed with the aim of assisting asset managers of wtps in this regard an important feature of the methodology is that it is data driven the smp model is based on condition data so it is important to know if and how the condition of assets can be determined for some assets it is possible to monitor the condition continuously which would be the ideal situation whereas for other assets the condition can only be determined through periodic inspections aiming for uniform condition monitoring a standard such as the dutch nen 2767 standard 52 could serve as a guideline to asset managers the nhpp model on the other hand is driven by failure data it must be well defined when an asset has failed and the recording of failures needs to be accurate and uniform in case of data scarcity it is possible to use expert judgement as input for the modelling at component level many models for expert judgement elicitation exist in the literature cooke and goossens 53 discuss two models for critical infrastructures likewise the information regarding the performed maintenance actions must be well registered information on the type of active maintenance strategy the influence of a maintenance action on the asset condition and the time it takes to perform the maintenance action are of significant importance for accurate availability modelling without a proper definition and collection of condition data failure data and maintenance actions adoption of the methodology by asset managers and other users might prove difficult subsequently the proposed methodology can be used as a demonstration of the usefulness and importance of collecting data in producing tangible insights into temporal availability of assets and asset systems the present study can further be improved by relaxing some of the simplifying assumptions made in the development of the methodology first it is assumed that components deteriorate and or fail independently which is inevitable if the system is to be modelled using rbd technique this assumption seems to be simplistic since in real life systems there would be dependencies between components due to common cause failures or load sharing in parallel sub systems a solution could be the application of dynamic bayesian belief networks 17 50 54 55 to account for conditional dependencies which can be pursued in future works second it should be noted that this study focusses on availability modelling which is a first step in the optimisation process of maintenance strategies and system configurations the next step would be the conducting a cost benefit analysis in order to ensure an affordable high availability in this regard the semi markov decision process smdp as an extension of the smp model could be used to find optimal maintenance strategies 33 56 57 and life cycle costing lcc techniques could be applied for discounting future revenue and expenses of maintenance strategies in the nhpp model 58 third with the smp model multiple condition states can be included where each condition state is corresponding to a value for the instantaneous availability of the concerned component in the proposed methodology this instantaneous availability is assumed to be a binary variable either 1 or 0 therefore an extension to the smp model could be the inclusion of intermediate values for the instantaneous availability this would allow the modelling of partly available or degraded components as a result of deterioration for example within a wtp this could be relevant for different types of filters experiencing degrees of clogging and thus not working with 100 efficiency fourth inclusion of other types of models at the component level could relax some assumptions for the nhpp model the application of imperfect repair models such as virtual age process vap models are recommended to be investigated 59 61 they relax the assumption of minimal repair for the nhpp model or perfect repair for the hpp model vap models such as the arithmetic reduction of intensity ari and the arithmetic reduction of age ara introduced by doyen and gaudoin 59 fit well with the power law process used in the nhpp model one should keep in mind however that with the generalisation to imperfect repair models demands on data become more challenging as in addition to failures and repair times the effect of repairs on the asset has to be estimated too 6 conclusions in order to ensure water availability to society asset managers of wtps are in need for tools to assess long term availability complex configurations and repairable and deteriorating assets are inherent characteristics of these plants however methodologies capable of modelling the instantaneous availability and simultaneously addressing repairability and deterioration of wtp are lacking therefore the current research presents a two level model for assessing the instantaneous availability of wtps i choosing between a condition based technique smp and a failure based technique nhpp at the component level and ii application of a rbd to calculate the availability at the system level the proposed methodology is exemplified by a case study of a dutch wtp where data has been elicited from experts assessing the availability of the components and the system it was shown that the wtp was presenting a deteriorating behaviour over a 30 year period this research has relied on the simplifying assumption of independent deterioration and failure of components therefore the performance of the developed methodology can further be improved by applying more sophisticated techniques than rbd so that conditional dependencies can be accounted for appendix a trend test statistics from the nhpp models the trend tests work as follows for the laplace test there is no trend if the test statistic falls within the interval bounds corresponding to the chosen significance level of the standard normal distribution thus a significance level of ฮฑ 0 05 means that the interval bounds are about 1 96 and 1 96 for the mil hdbk 189 test if the test statistic falls within the interval bounds for a chosen significance level there is no trend in the data the interval bounds of this test are data specific and are included within tables a1 and a2 
14447,in oil and gas industry produced water is considered as the largest waste stream which contains relatively higher concentration of hydrocarbons heavy metals and other pollutants due to the increase in industrial activities the generation of produced water has increased all over the world and its treatment for reuse is now important from environmental perspective treatment of produced water can be done through various methods including physical membrane filtration adsorption etc chemical precipitation oxidation and biological activated sludge biological aerated filters and others methods this paper aims to highlight characteristics of produced water in detail and physical chemical and biological techniques used for its treatment in addition reuse of produced water for different purposes has been discussed at the end few case studies from different countries related to the treatment and reuse of their produced waters have been included keywords produced water characterization environmental toxicology treatment 1 introduction in oil and gas industry the produced water is a term used for the water associated with oil during the extraction process it is one of the largest streams of wastewater generated in these industries estimated to be 70 billion barrels per annum in the world in 2009 out of which 21 billion barrels is produced by us alone 1 produced water results from two processes in the oil and gas industry first during extraction this gives a mixture of water and oil the source of which is usually seawater surrounding the oil well second the water injected into the oilfield to bring the deep oil to the surface also ultimately becomes part of produced water or wastewater based on the origin produced water can be classified as produced water from natural gas oilfield or coal bed methane 2 naturally occurring rocks in subsurface formations are usually permeated with water oil gas or a combination of these fluids it is believed that prior to the petroleum invasion and trapping rocks were completely saturated with water in most oil bearing formations this water could be either flowing from above below or within the hydrocarbon zone or could flow from the injected fluids and additives coming from the production activities before the production process of the reservoir starts and the fluids brought to the surface the produced water is known as formation water or connate water thus any water present in the hydrocarbon reservoir and produced with crude oil or natural gas and brought to the surface is known as produced water furthermore produced water removed through the production of coal bed methane cbm have almost the same properties as the produced water from crude oil or conventional gas production with some differences in its composition 3 moreover extraction of oil and gas from offshore and onshore wells result in produced water generation regardless if the fuel is extracted from conventional or unconventional sources including cbm tight sands and gas shale 4 most of the volume of waste stream in oil and gas production operations on offshore platforms is produced water and it represents 80 of the residuals and wastes produced through the production of natural gas furthermore as the age of the well increases and the decline of oil and gas production results the amount of produced water generation increases 5 volume of produced water could reach 98 in nearly depleted fields with only 2 of fossil fuel production 6 during extraction of oil the water to oil ratio is around 3 1 7 even though the ratio has increased the production of produced water at global level is still as much as 39 5 mm3 day 1 due to the ageing of wells it is also expected that the water to oil ratio will be averaging 12 v v for crude oil resources by 2025 1 6 7 thus the market growth for the management and reuse of produced water is expected to grow further in this review paper the produced water volumes across different countries its characteristics in general and physical chemical and biological techniques used for its treatment are discussed in detail in addition reuse of produced water after treatment for different purposes is highlighted at the end different case studies related to produced water treatment and reuse has been included the aim behind this review paper is to stress and promote the treatment and reuse of produced water in order to reduce the reliance on limited freshwater resources 2 produced water volumes produced water from oil or natural gas production does not have specific and constant volume table 1 as it depends on location and the technology used for extraction 8 in 2003 it was reported that about 667 million metric tons of produced water were discharged to the offshore in the world out of which 21 1 million tons were discharged to us gulf of mexico offshore water and between 358 and 419 million tons were discharged to the north sea of the europe offshore waters 9 10 additionally in 2007 256 000 m3 day of produced water were produced during the production process of oil and natural gas in us federal offshore waters in which 234 000 m3 day was discharged to the ocean after treatment and the rest was reinjected 8 moreover according to the international association of oil and gas producers iogp in 2014 0 6 tons of produced water was discharged and 1 2 tons of hydrocarbon produced were reinjected and 92 of the produced water was generated from offshores operations the volume of produced water from a specific reservoir does not remain constant initially the water production is very less but it increases with the age of the reservoir 11 since the volume of produced water being produced is very high in most of the countries table 1 therefore the management of this kind of wastewater is now a need 2 1 characteristics of produced water produced water is not a single product it has a simple to complex composition that is variable and it is considered as a mixture of dissolved and particulate organic and inorganic chemicals chemical and physical properties of produced water vary considerably which depends on several factors including geographic location of the field age and depth of the geological formation hydrocarbon bearing formation geochemistry extraction method type of the produced hydrocarbon as well as its chemical composition in the reservoir the toxicity of produced water discharged from gas platforms is 10 times higher than the toxicity of the oil wells discharge however the volumes from oil production are much higher than gas production 26 specific studies for each region should be done as its characteristics varies from region to region and such studies will also help in investigating the environmental risks of its discharge the main components found in produced water are categorized and summarized in table 2 along with their concentrations from the literature generally the major constituents that are present in produced water include salt content measured as salinity total dissolved solids tds or electrical conductivity oil and grease o g polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex phenols organic acids natural organic and inorganic compounds that cause hardness and scaling e g calcium magnesium sulfates and barium and chemical additives such as biocides and corrosion inhibitors that are used during drilling fracturing and operating process of the well 27 2 1 1 conductivity salinity and total dissolved solids tds the conductivity of produced water can vary widely as it was found that the conductivity of produced water from natural gas ranged from 4200 to 180 000 ฮผs cm 47 in another research the conductivity was found to be in a range of 136 000 586 000 ฮผs cm 55 the salinity of produced water ranges from few parts per thousand to 300 saturated brine which is much higher than the salt concentration of seawater which is in the range of 32 36 and that is why produced water is generally denser than seawater higher salinity results due to the presence of dissolved chloride and sodium mainly as the concentrations of calcium magnesium and potassium are usually lower 29 according to a study done by guerra et al 34 tds was in the range of 370 1940 mg l due to the increased concentrations of both sodium and bicarbonate recently tds concentration over time for produced water was investigated 56 results showed that the quality of produced water changes over time which affects the management and reuse of produced water variations in the concentration of tds occurs due to several reasons including the location of the well in the well field geological variations between basins and the resource of the produced water furthermore the concentration of tds varies between the conventional and unconventional wells since it was found that the concentration of tds was 50 000 mg l in cbm wells while it was as high as 400 000 mg l in the conventional wells 34 table 2 2 1 2 inorganic ions chloride and sodium are considered as the most abundant salt ions found in produced water while phosphate has the lowest concentration in produced water from both conventional and unconventional wells sodium is considered as the dominant cation with 81 in conventional wells and more that 90 in unconventional wells 34 however the anions makeup in conventional and unconventional wells is not the same the conventional wells are almost completely chloride anions representing 97 of the total anions while 66 and 32 of the unconventional wells contain bicarbonate and chloride anions respectively 34 furthermore sodium chloride magnesium sulfate bromide potassium iodide and bicarbonate are found abundantly in produced water with high salinity table 2 the presence of sulfate and sulfide ions in produced water can leads to insoluble sulfate and sulfide at high concentrations in produced water moreover the presence of bacteria in the anoxic produced water cause the reduction of sulfate and in turn leads to the presence of sulfides polysulfide and hydrogen sulfide in the produced water 32 however the concentration of these anions and cations varies from location and their ranges are presented in table 2 2 1 3 metals produced water may contain certain metals like fe cr ba ni zn and others however differences in the type concentration and chemical content of the metals are influenced by the geological age and features injected water volume and chemical composition 57 commonly mercury zinc barium manganese and iron are found in produced water at higher concentration than the seawater concentration 58 for instance hibernia produced water have high concentrations of barium iron and manganese as compared to seawater in addition it was also reported that the barium sodium iron magnesium potassium and strontium in produced water from natural gas production field are present at higher concentrations 49 2 1 4 total suspended solids tss total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn total suspended solids tss in produced water may include the floating or drifting materials found in the water such as silt sediment sand algae and plankton it has been noted that tss concentration in produced water is in the range of 14 800 mg l 47 and 8 5484 mg l 54 moreover another study conducted by tibbettes 28 for oilfield produced water found that the tss concentration was in the range of 1 2 1000 mg l table 2 furthermore rosenblum et al 56 investigated the time variation of levels of tss in produced water and found that there was almost 59 reduction in the concentration of tss within first 4 days followed by no more significant variation noted for next few days however further 40 decrease was observed in the concentration of tss in the period of 55th day of monitoring till 80th day according to a study conducted by ogp 59 the range of toc found in produced water is from 0 to 1500 mg l table 2 various naturally occurring water have toc concentration between less than 0 1 mg l and to greater than 11 000 mg l 32 according to ayers and parker 51 the mean concentration value of toc found in produced water from hibernia platforms is 300 mg l while it was in the range of 67 to 620 mg l in produced water from louisiana rigs 60 similarly toc in the range of 0 1500 mg l has been reported for produced water samples collected from various sources 29 kim et al 33 conducted a study on produced water samples which were collected over a 200 day time period from two wells and used toc concentration as a macro indicator for the quality of the produced water and found that the concentration of toc from both wells before 30 days was fluctuating significantly but after this period of time it was stabilized at 2000 mg l total nitrogen is the cumulative sum of all the nitrogen compounds in the water including ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and organically bonded nitrogen 34 according to unitar 34 total nitrogen by total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn is the total organic nitrogen compounds and ammonia with excluding nitrate nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen according to veil et al 60 the presence of nitrogen and other nutrients lead to the formation of hypoxic zones according to metcalf et al 35 it is more difficult to remove the non biodegradable part of the organic nitrogen than the biodegradable part which is easier to treat and less harmful for the environment furthermore separation of particulate is easier than the soluble part therefore the removal of tkn before the injection of the water back to the environment is crucial according to veil et al 60 and bierman et al 61 who investigated the presence of no3 no2 nh3 nh4 in produced water from fifty platforms of either gas oil or mixed production wells found that the highest mean concentration of no3 2 71 mg l was found in produced water from mostly gas wells while the highest concentration of nh3 and nh4 was found in produced water from mostly oil wells 92 mg l on the other hand same concentration of 0 05 mg l was measured for no2 in produced water from all tested wells 2 1 5 chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod5 according to studies done by fillo et al 47 and johnson et al 49 the estimated cod concentration in produced water was between 2600 mg l and 120 000 mg l a research conducted in east china where onshore produced water samples were collected from treatment plant at various sampling points showed that the concentration of cod mg l at each sampling point was 285 5 76 1 for the influent 108 9 29 2 for effluent 195 2 32 9 for eos effluent of oil separation tank 109 5 58 4 for ebo effluent of bio contact oxidation tank and 190 7 53 8 for ef effluent of flotation tank therefore it was found that these concentrations are higher than the acceptable limit set by the environmental protection agency of china i e 150 mg l 62 moreover according to a research conducted by zhao et al 63 the concentration of cod was 280 mg l in produced water from oil fields in canada similarly shakrollahzadeh et al 64 found that cod level of produced water extracted from gas stream in an iranian gas refinery was 270 mg l on the contrary gomes et al 65 obtained high range of 27 000 to 35 000 mg l for produced water samples collected from oil fields in usa another research in which the physico chemical characteristics of produced water collected from two oil facilities in nigeria were tested noted that the cod does not vary much among the two locations as it was found to be 3 91 1 32 mg l for both locations 66 which was less than the permissible limit of 125 0 mg l 33 the bod of 75 2870 mg l has been reported for produced water from natural gas field 47 reduced inorganic elements such as fe and mn used fluids for well drilling and additive chemicals can results in higher bod concentrations in produced water obtained directly from the well according to adewumi et al 67 high volumes of organic materials in drilling fluids can lead to the high bod values in produced water furthermore dissolved oxygen can severely deplete in water bodies receiving produced water with high bod content thus substantial oxidation of this water should be ensured to prevent the discharge of waste water with high bod into natural waters 2 1 6 oil and grease o g according to a study conducted by fillo et al 47 the concentration of o g in natural gas produced water was in the range of 6 60 mg l similar range has also been reported by johnson et al 49 and usepa 54 they found the concentration of 2 3 60 and 2 3 38 8 mg l of o g in produced water moreover another study was conducted on western united states produced water and the concentration of o g was found to be 40 mg l to as high as 2000 mg l 68 2 1 7 organic acids main organic acids that are found in produced water are monocarboxylic acids and dicarboxylic acids cooh of both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons having low molecular weight such as formic acid hexanoic acid butanoic acid acetic acid propanoic acid and pentanoic acid 69 71 however the most abundant organic acids in produced water are formatic acid and acetic acid 72 previously it has been reported that the concentration of formic acid was from not detectable levels to 68 mg l acetic acid from 8 to as high as 5735 mg l and propionic acid up to 4400 mg l in produced water samples collected from mexico gulf off the texas and louisiana coast and in the santa maria basin off the california coast 72 2 1 8 benzene toluene ethyl benzene and xylene btex btex are volatile aromatic compounds that are naturally present in oil and gas products including natural gas gasoline and diesel fuel thus they easily escape to the atmosphere during the water treatment process 48 benzene is abundantly found in produced water table 2 however increasing the alkylation lead to the decrease in the concentration of benzene 39 furthermore according to a study carried out by dorea et al 39 the concentration of btex present in produced water collected from oil field in gulf of mexico the concentration of benzene was found to be highest i e 0 44 2 80 mg l followed by toluene xylene and ethyl benzene these results are in consistent with the results of neff 32 in which benzene was present at highest concentration i e 0 084 2 30 mg l in produced water followed by toluene ethyl benzene and xylene similarly dorea et al 39 investigated the characteristics of permian basin produced water and they found that highest concentration was for benzene with 1 5 778 51 mg l followed by ethyl benzene xylenes and toluene 2 1 9 phenols phenols or phenolics are part of aromatic organic compounds that include one or more hydroxyl group attached to an aromatic hydrocarbon group various levels of phenols are present in produced water from oil and gas operating wells however gas condensate production was found to have the highest concentration of phenols 73 the comparison of the concentration of phenol in produced water from oil and gas field revealed that gas field produced water has higher concentrations of phenol than oil field produced water moreover neff 32 and johnsen et al 37 carried out a study to investigate the concentration of phenol in produced water collected from the louisiana gulf coast and norwegian region of the north sea found that the concentration range of phenols in produced water was in the range of 2 1 4 5 mg l and 0 36 16 8 mg l respectively 2 1 10 production chemicals treating chemicals production chemicals are usually added to the oil or gas field for the management of the operational problems such as to facilitate oil gas and water separation process prevention of pipeline corrosion and methane hydrate formation in the gas production system the required chemicals for the production process are unique and vary along with the various production systems and they can be categorized into 3 broad groups i e gas processing chemicals simulation and work over chemicals and production treating chemicals such as scale corrosion hydration inhibitors biocides water treating chemicals like flocculants and anti foams emulsion breakers reverse emulsion breakers and coagulants which are used in hydrocarbons recovery and pumping these production chemicals are soluble in oil eliminating the need for the mechanism of disposal the chemicals such as corrosion inhibitor and biocides are negatively affecting the environment their use has been reduced as they were found at very low concentration in produced water 37 74 3 produced water treatment since produced water contains several different contaminants with varying concentrations therefore numerous treatment technologies have been proposed for produced water treatment the wide variety of produced water treatment methods have been reported previously 29 75 78 the treatment system usually requires a series of individual unit processes for contaminants removal that might not be removed through a single process treatment of produced water can help in facilitating additional options for water management including its reuse for agricultural and industrial purposes according to arthur 27 the treatment of produced water should be able to remove dispersed and free oil and grease soluble organics suspended solids and dissolved gases naturally occurring radioactive materials salts and microorganisms as a result it is challenging to choose the type of treatment system suitable to remove most of the contaminants from produced water generally the cheapest method is the most preferable one and the cost of the produced water treatment mainly depends on influent quality electricity price plant s capacity as well as the intended quality of the effluent 79 furthermore treatment of offshore produced water is more challenging due to the absence of adequate space or weight capacity for the equipment used for the treatment process as they should be designed for operation in remote and harsh environments in general produced water treatment process has three main stages i e pre treatment main treatment step and final polishing treatment step the pre treatment step is done to remove large oil droplets coarse particles and gas bubbles to reduce dispersed contaminants the main treatment step involves primary treatment in which small oil droplets and particles removal will be achieved and will be done by using skim tanks plate pack interceptors and api separator the secondary treatment will involve removal of much smaller oil droplets and particles using gas flotation hydro cyclones and centrifuges the polishing step is usually employed to remove ultra small droplets and particles dispersed hydrocarbons 10 mg l using techniques like dual media filters cartridge filters and membranes the optional step tertiary treatment is sometimes used to remove dissolved matter gases and dispersed hydrocarbons 5 mg l according to fakhru l razi et al 29 combination of physical chemical and biological treatment processes should be used for the achievement of the different treatment goals fig 1 shows the removal efficiency of several treatment techniques for different pollutants it is evident from fig 1 that most of the techniques such as adsorption membrane filtration and chemical precipitation widely studied in the literature possesses higher removal efficiencies of above 90 for various produced water constituents and therefore the cost of treatment and the intended purpose of treatment reuse or discharge with associated standards can affect the choice of suitable technique in the following subsections physical chemical and biological techniques for produced water treatment are individually discussed in detail 3 1 physical treatment process 3 1 1 filtration filtration is relatively simple technique used in water and wastewater treatment process which is based on the use of porous filter media to allow only the water but not the impurities to pass through it there are various porous materials that can be used as filter media such as sand crushed stone and activated carbon however the widely used material is sand due to its availability low cost and efficiency 94 as proposed by adewumi et al 67 removing metals by sand filtration process should be done after the pretreatment stage which consists of three steps 1 adjustment of the ph for oxidation reduction initiation 2 increasing the oxygen concentration for the reaction through the aeration unit and 3 adequate retention time for the settlement of precipitated solids in the solid separation unit after these steps the fine solids that were not removed during pre treatment stages will be removed by sand filtration in the slow sand filtration treatment system the pretreated water is passed in a downward direction through a filter which is made up of a layer of sand and specific features to control the water flow and the water filtration rate ranges between 0 1 and 0 4 m3 m2 h 94 filter beds are mainly composed of fine grains with 0 15 0 35 mm diameter range and 1 m depth before starting the filtration process as the filtration proceeds the higher part of the treatment system will contain the colloidal and suspended particles coming from the untreated water and as these particles build up they will clog the system and reduce its efficiency therefore it is necessary to scrap off the top layer of the sand which is full of impurities to remove the clogging materials moreover the filtration process is a combination of various processes including mechanical straining chemical and biological activity adsorption and sedimentation for overall removal of impurities 94 95 the removal of various ions from water through sand filtration was investigated by wathugala et al 96 and it was noted that sand filtration results in higher percentage removal of cod and nitrogen and the filtered water was free from ammonia and phosphorus a new engineered sand filtration technique was developed by cha et al 97 in which it was combined with ozonation technique to treat the produced water the technique helped to reduce the cod from 320 mg l to 102 mg l and oil content to 20 mg l similarly sand filtration was used to remove oil and grease from produced water and 95 8 removal was obtained 98 furthermore membrane filtration technique can also be used for the treatment of produced water table 3 shows the comparison between various type of membranes used for the treatment of produced water 2 recently it was demonstrated that the ceramic microfiltration membranes were able to sustain permeability of 1400 l m2 h bar when real produced water from arabian oilfield was used as feed water through the application of back flushing during cleaning in place cip between cycles of filtration 99 the research done by chen et al 100 on the treatment of produced water obtained from oil field using ceramic crossflow microfiltration membrane showed that the tss level was 1 mg l and o g value was 5 mg l another research was conducted by mueller et al 101 on the removal of oil from synthetic produced water by ceramic membranes and results showed that 99 3 99 9 removal of oil could be achieved using this technique moreover according to a case study conducted by the new logic research in usa the treatment of produced water using combination of nf and ro membrane resulted in removal of most of the pollutants from produced water as shown in table 4 direct contact membrane distillation dcmd technique has also been used recently for the treatment of produced water it was noted that nanoporous hydrophobic hollow fiber membranes fabricated during the research was able to remove greater than 99 5 of tds from feed water even after continual operation for 100 hours the treated water was found to be suitable for industrial reuse the combination of microfiltration and membrane distillation has also been evaluated for treatment of produced water and minerals recovery and it was found that the combined technique can recover various salts such as sodium calcium magnesium and barium from produced water 102 membrane filtration technique has also been used in conjunction with adsorption to treat produced water the double staged treatment system comprising carbon bentonite adsorbent and nano hybrid membrane helped to reduce tds 72 turbidity 6 and salinity 90 the use of adsorbent at a pretreatment stage helped to stabilize membrane flux reduce membrane fouling and prolong the membrane lifetime 5 the selection of suitable pre treatment technique can also help to improve the performance of nf and ro as previously demonstrated by ozgun et al 31 it was noted that the application of membrane bioreactors mbrs as a pre treatment helped to reduce 83 cod from produced water and therefore it was optimum treatment technique in combination with ro in terms of cod and conductivity reduction whereas microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes were able to remove less than 25 of the cod and therefore were not as effective as mbr in terms of pre treatment techniques 31 3 1 2 electrodialysis electrodialysis ed and electrodialysis reversal edr are both separation processes that are driven by electrochemical charge and are used for the treatment of brackish water seawater desalination and wastewater reclamation as well as being tested for the treatment of produced water at laboratory scale 105 salts in produced water could be removed by electrodialysis in which it utilizes a stack of alternating anion and cation selective membranes that are separated by spacer sheets 106 electrical current is applied to the cell after passing the water through membranes stack which lead to the migration of anions and cations into opposite directions alternating cells of diluted and concentrated solutions are produced between the membranes as the migrating ions intersects the selectively permeable membrane this process requires less energy than reverse osmosis as it operates under lower pressure and it can reduce the concentration of salt to 200 mg l this treatment method is usually used for produced water with low tds concentrations 107 on the other hand the drawbacks of this technology include its limited ability to remove non ionic constituents such as organic molecules occurrence of membrane fouling relatively high cost periodic disposal of concentrate and highly skilled labor requirement 105 moreover this process could remove salts from produced water but other constituents such as oil heavy metals and other pollutants present in produced water may not be removed the main advantages of this technology include withstanding harsh conditions has membrane lifetime that is estimated to be in the range of 4 5 years no need for special infrastructure and considered as an excellent treatment process to be applied for produced water 2 3 1 3 flotation in this method fine gas bubbles are utilized for the separation of suspended particles that cannot be removed by sedimentation this process is done by injecting gas into the water to be treated then both suspended particulates and oil droplets will attach to the air bubbles and then they will rise to the surface leading to the formation of foam that is removed by skimming this process can be done using air nitrogen or other types of inert gases the technique can be used for the removal of volatile organics oil and grease from produced water 108 dissolved gas flotation dgf and induced gas flotation igf are two subdivisions of the gas flotation technology and the difference between them is in the method used for the generation of the gas bubbles and the resultant bubble size the efficiency of the process mainly depends on the contaminants to be removed density differences of liquids temperature and the size of the oil droplet flotation process does not work ideally with high temperature feed streams however it works well under cold temperature and can be used for the treatment of produced water with high and low toc concentrations as well as water with oil grease and particulates with less than 7 solids 34 particles with 25 ฮผm size can be removed by dissolved air flotation process and when using coagulation as pretreatment step contaminants with size of 3 5 ฮผm can be removed as well as reported by fakhru l razi et al 29 there are multiple advantages and disadvantages of gas flotation process the advantages includes i coalescence increase the process efficiency ii ease of operation iii has no moving parts iv it is durable and robust while the disadvantages are i large amount of airis generated ii skim volume iii 4 5 min retention time the percentage oil removal of up to 93 has been obtained using flotation process 109 moreover beyer et al 89 used induced air flotation technique as a pre treatment for oilfield produced water having tds of 20 000 mg l and it was found that the cod and toc level decreased to 595 mg l and 115 mg l respectively thus using these techniques oil content vocs suspended solids etc can be removed from produced water without using any additional chemicals in addition coagulants can be used sometimes to increase the efficiency of treatment nevertheless the main drawback remains the disposal of sludge at the end of treatment which increases the cost of treatment 110 3 1 4 adsorption adsorption is considered as one of the best treatment techniques for achieving better water quality as it can reduce the concentration of the contaminant to very low levels 111 according to spellman 112 nearly 100 produced water recovery and 85 removal of heavy metals can be accomplished through adsorption process however the main disadvantage of using the adsorption method is the cost of the installation and maintenance of the system but this drawback can be solved by using more economical adsorption media such as activated carbon that can make the adsorption process more competitive another disadvantage of adsorption process is the requirement of waste disposal for the produced waste and spent media through the regeneration process of media furthermore different organic and inorganic compounds can be retained by various adsorbent materials several adsorbents have been proven to remove manganese iron toc btex oil and heavy metals 80 from produced water activated carbon have been used widely for a long time as an effective adsorbent to remove various pollutants from contaminated water using ac as an adsorbent is preferable for water decontamination process rather than other techniques because it is less expensive relatively simple and efficient producing reasonably cheap and excellent adsorbent from ac is done through different treatment methods that helps to develop internal pore structure and large surface area 113 activated carbon has various unique characteristics including high grade of surface reactivity high adsorption ability extended surface area and microporous structure 114 in addition activated carbon has several functional groups that are accountable for the diversity of physiochemical and catalytic characteristic 115 using ac contaminants that can be removed include cadmium mercury natural organic matter btex compounds and synthetic organic chemicals such as benzo a pyrene dioxin radionuclides di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate and hexachlorobenzene 34 there are various materials that can be used for preparing ac such as fossil fuel wood or some agricultural wastes using different preparation processes of physical or chemical nature 116 physical activation method is not widely used as it has been reported to give specific surface area less than 1500 m2 g only 117 on the other hand in the chemical activation method chemical activation agents such as koh naoh and h2so4 are used for the impregnation of the used precursors for ac preparation followed by carbonization process koh is the most preferred chemical activation agent as it results in formation of k2co3 after the interaction between char and koh leading to prevention of excessive burning of the sample giving higher yield and well developed internal porosity another advantage of using koh is that it is considered as more environment friendly chemical than other activators 118 several different parameters influence the quality of the prepared ac including the impregnation ratio ir activation time and activation temperature 117 ac has around 650 m2 g to 1000 m2 g adsorption surface area which is considered as an extremely large amount of adsorption surface area activated carbon removal efficiency can range from 70 to 85 but the presence of suspended particles within the produced water can decrease the removal efficiency 29 regeneration of activated carbon is necessary after few batches of treatment to regain the pollutant removal efficiency as it dramatically decreases with time 119 various chemicals such as acids bases redox agents and organic solvents are used during the regeneration process of activated carbon leading to the increase in cost of the treatment process 120 furthermore regeneration can be done onsite in case the ac plant is large enough however it is usually done off site because onsite regeneration is only effective in the case of having 910 kg day carbon exhaustion rate moreover there are certain factors that determine the reactivation frequency including concentration contaminant type water usage rate and carbon type used 109 okiel et al 121 investigated the efficiency of using bentonite deposited carbon dc and powdered activated carbon pac for oil removal from produced water the results showed that increasing the weight and contact time of the adsorbent lead to an increase in the percentage removal of oil which highlighted the importance of contact time in adsorption technique according to al ghouti et al 122 who used activated carbon ac on reducing organosulfur compounds ors from diesel non aqueous medium found that there are excellent adsorption capabilities of granular bead form of ac norit pk 1 3 holland the research illustrates that ac particle size affects the elimination efficiency of ors in which the adsorption mainly occurs on the external surface area moreover it was proved that ac has the ability to remove btex and free hydrocarbons participating in the total petroleum hydrocarbons tph there are various parameters that influence the absorber effectiveness which are ph temperature salinity and low concentration of heavy metals and dissolved organic chemicals in addition doyle et al 123 developed a new system composed of a modified polymer bentonite or organoclay and bed column packed with ac to eliminate hydrocarbons resulting in the reduction of tph and btex to non detectable limits but the need to regenerate the absorbent material repeatedly is the main disadvantage of this system another research was carried out by luukkonen et al 124 in which 4 commercial acs were utilized to investigate the toc elimination from makeup water of power plant where continuous flow bench scale ac filters at steam boiler desalination plant were used to carry out the experiment results showed that all the tested acs had similar removal efficiency of 42 45 of toc and 58 68 of dissolved organic carbon after operation for 30 days removal efficiencies of toc were steady throughout the experiment ranging between 41 6 and 44 8 for all the used acs and the residues of toc after ac filtration were between 126 ppb and 260 ppb since deionized water nutrient content are too low for allowing any biological activity it is assumed that the removal of toc is primarily due to adsorption furthermore halim et al 125 did a comparison study demonstrating the ac adsorption ability of cod and found that ac has higher removal capacity than other adsorbents such as composite and zeolites and the adsorption capacities of cod were 37 88 mg g 22 99 mg g and 2 35 mg g respectively fig 2 summarizes the efficiency of various adsorbents for oil and organic pollutants removal from produced water it is evident from the fig 2 that the adsorbents like exfoliated graphite and the ones obtained from organic source eggshell and banana peel achieved 100 removal of oil and organic pollutants modification of the adsorbent s surface enhances their elimination efficiency and adsorption selectivity of specific toxic materials modification of activated carbon can be done with hydrophilic groups that include cations anions and zwitterions leading to structured molecular assemblies that depends on the group nature the research group of nadeem et al 131 used sodium dodecyl sulfate sds as a negative charged surfactant and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ctab as a positively charged surfactant for cadmium removal from aqueous solution it was found that sds ac had the highest percentage removal of cd 98 among all other adsorbents as well as having better surface area and greater porosity therefore such modified adsorbents can be used for target removal of certain pollutants from produced water ac has also been used as a pre treatment technique for produced water treatment it was noted that the use of ac pac and granular activated carbon gac with microfiltration as pre treatment technique increased the reduction in cod from 10 to 30 and 48 respectively furthermore it also helped to improve the performance of final treatment step with nf and ro techniques in conclusion the gac with microfiltration followed by ro was suggested as a best technique for optimum removal of heavy metals and reduction in conductivity 132 nevertheless the overall cost of the treatment technique including different pre treatment methods needs to be taken into consideration to determine best technique for treatment of produced water 3 2 chemical treatment process 3 2 1 precipitation precipitation is considered as one of the conventional chemical treatment processes of produced water 133 through this process up to 97 removal of suspended and colloidal particles can be accomplished 134 flocculants and coagulants which are mainly comprised of inorganic metals such as iron magnesium and aluminum polymers are usually used in the chemical treatment process and they were found to be effective in removing contaminants 85 other studies removed particulate metals phosphorous and carbonaceous compounds by applying flocculants like ferric chloride fecl3 and anionic polymer in ballasted flocculation unit however these flocculants were found to be less efficient for the removal of hydrophilic compounds and nitrogen 135 moreover zhou et al 85 reported that the addition of coagulation chemicals can remove almost 97 of suspended solids and oil from produced water 3 2 2 chemical oxidation this technology is usually used for the removal of cod bod odor color organics and some inorganics from produced water according to igunnu and chen 2 it is not possible for free electrons to be present in solution therefore this treatment process depends on the reactions of oxidation and reduction as they occur together in the produced water according to huang 136 strong oxidants and catalysts can be used for decomposing the organic impurities present in the produced water generally multiple pollutants can be broken down by using several oxidants like chlorine ozone peroxide and oxygen furthermore there are various parameters that affect the oxidation rate of this technology including dose of the chemical used oxidant s type quality of the raw water and contact time between water and used oxidant 2 the main advantages of this treatment process are minimal requirement of equipment does not generate any waste does not need any pre treatment process and can achieve almost 100 water recovery rate however the main drawbacks are it has high chemical cost maintenance and calibration of the chemical pump is required regularly and production of byproducts through the process that are not easily removed 2 moreover igunnu and chen 2 mentioned that a final treatment process is required for particulate matter removal after the oxidation process advanced oxidation processes aop is considered as a recent development in water treatment field which is an effective solution for quickly oxidizing the organic pollutants through the addition of oxidants or mixture of oxidants 136 this process utilizes ozone iron and hydrogen peroxide as chemical oxidizers furthermore hydroxyl radicals like zinc oxide titanium dioxide and iron oxide are also introduced in this treatment process 137 3 2 3 electrochemical technologies although this process has been used widely in the treatment of various wastewater types it is rarely used for the treatment of produced water however this technique is being suggested as the future produced water treatment technology the advantages of these technologies over other treatment technologies is that it is low cost green technology and it does not utilize any additional chemicals nor generate secondary waste furthermore it can remove organic materials efficiently can produce and save energy and help to recover valuable materials from produced water without negatively affecting the environment this can be achieved through harmonizing various electrochemical techniques such as water electrolysis fuel cell electrodeposition and photo electrochemistry that includes photo electrolysis photo catalysis and photo electrocatalysis into one electrochemical process 2 photo electrolysis is a chemical process that uses light for breaking down large molecules into smaller ones as reported by fujishima and honda 138 removal of organics from produced water could be achieved through the use of tio2 electrodes for the photocatalytic decomposition of water and adams et al 139 reported that semiconductor photocatalysis can decrease the content of hydrocarbons present in produced water effectively in 10 min by 90 furthermore li et al 140 conducted a study on synthetic produced water that mimics the original produced water with its constituents to investigate the removal efficiency of cod by photo electrocatalysis and found that it has higher removal efficiencies than electrochemical oxidation and photocatalysis another study carried by ma and wang 88 on the removal of organics from produced water obtained from oilfield by setting up a catalytic electrochemical pilot scale plant in which they used iron as a cathode material double anodes with graphite and active metal in addition to noble metal having large surface as a catalyst results showed a reduction on the level of cod and bod by more than 90 in 6 min furthermore in 3 min they observed that the suspended solids reduced by 99 content of ca2 by 22 98 reduction in the rate of corrosion and 99 decrease in the presence of sulfate reducing bacteria and iron bacteria moreover fuel cell is one of the most important electrochemical technologies that converts energy into electricity and produces heat and water as by products this technology plays crucial role in the future of the treating produced water however successful research on reducing the cost of this technology as well as improving the efficiency and increasing its life span are important factors for the application of the fuel cell technology on the treatment of produced water in the future 141 in addition there are various established treatment technologies of produced water that can remove heavy metals but they cannot recover the metals removed from produced water however electrodeposition is a technology that is usually used for the recovery of metals it has been utilized for the recovery of cu from synthetic produced water and results showed the excellent ability of electrodeposition to recover metals that would be lost during the removal process from produced water 142 3 3 biological treatment process biological treatment process is considered as one of the least expensive processes for removal of pollutants in which either aerobic or anaerobic conditions are maintained 143 furthermore algae fungi and bacteria with 0 2 10 ฮผm size are generally present in produced water and they can be utilized for produced water treatment as these microorganisms will use the pollutants as nutrient source for growth purposes 144 several different processes and technologies like sequencing batch reactors and biological aerated filters can be used for biological treatment of produced water 29 this process is mostly effective in feed water with cod 400 mg l bod 50 mg l oil level 60 mg l 34 and concentration of chloride 6600 mg l 145 according to research carried out by li et al 146 on the removal of cod with concentration of 2600 mg l from produced water and removal efficiency of 90 can be achieved by utilizing the immobilized basillus sp under aerobic conditions furthermore microbial community of methanosarcina rhodopseudomonas and clostridia were used for removal of cod from produced water under anaerobic conditions and achieved removal efficiency of 65 kose et al 147 tested the operational stability of membrane bioreactors mbrs for the treatment of real produced water despite of variation in the influent quality and solids retention times srt it was found that mbr provides stable quality of treated water with 80 85 removal of cod and 99 removal of hydrocarbons moreover spiral microbial electrochemical cell smxc as fuel cell was developed to improve the treatment of produced water by naraghi et al 148 in which consortia of halophile and halotolerant anaerobic microbial community were used to remove organic compounds from feed water with 200 000 mg l salinity and they achieved 90 removal of organics in addition stoll et al 149 biodegrade organics present in produced water by using microbial capacitive desalination cell mcdc and they successfully removed 6 4 mgtoc h in biological reactor as well as biodegradation of 36 mgtds g carbon of electrode h however one of the major disadvantages of biological treatment is the generation of huge quantity of biological sludge which requires further treatment and relatively lower efficiency and more contact time another drawback is the stationary infrastructure of the common biological processes which needs long assembly and operation time 150 3 3 1 activated sludge activated sludge is one of the commonly used aerobic treatment process of wastewaters in which it can adsorb and occlude soluble and insoluble materials 29 furthermore it has been reported that using the solids retention time srt of about 20 days the removal of total petroleum hydrocarbons tph of 98 99 can be achieved through activated sludge treatment 151 similarly another research group used the mixture 45 and 35 v v of produced water and sewage and treated it using sbr sequence batch reactor and acclimated sewage sludge the results showed that the cod removal was in a range between 30 and 50 152 in addition they also noted that the salinity does not seem to affect the treatment efficiency however due to the recalcitrant feature of produced water the efficiency of biological treatment is generally low 152 according to fakhru l razi et al 29 this treatment process can remove trace and suspended solids in addition to the removal of metals moreover activated sludge is considered as cheap clean and simple treatment technology but it requires oxygen large filter dimensions and it produces sludge as waste after the treatment process is over it normally requires post treatment for the separation of precipitated solids biomass and dissolved gases 3 3 2 biological aerated filters baf baf system is consisting of media that is permeable and have diameter of 4 in that prohibit pore spaces clog when sloughing happens this class of biological technologies works under aerobic conditions to remove organics from polluted water and assist the biochemical oxidation process furthermore for the complete usage of the filter bed upstream and downstream sedimentation are required 2 baf treatment process was used for the removal of various pollutants from produced water and is considered most effective with produced water containing 6600 mg l chloride 153 it was found that baf can achieve removal efficiencies of 70 80 60 95 and 85 for nitrogen oil cod bod and ss respectively 153 moreover since the generated waste is removed in the form of solid baf has nearly 100 water recovery therefore there is a requirement for solid disposal of the sludge accumulated in the sedimentation basins that accounts for almost 40 of the total cost of this treatment process which is considered as the main drawback of this technology on the other hand there are various advantages such as it does not require post treatment can easily be adapted for wide range of water quantity and quality requires little maintenance does not require use of any chemicals and it is expected to have long life cycle furthermore according to mohan et al 154 salinity and c n ratio could hugely affect wastewater treatment process as denitrification and accumulation of nitrate will increase with the increase in the c n ratio but decrease with increase in salinity thus maintaining specific salinity levels is very important which can be done by proper wastewater homogenization with the batch reactor at the inlet similarly nitrogen removal from the municipal wastewater in the biological aerated filtration baf system is highly affected by the c n ratio 155 156 nitrogen removal efficiency could be affected by the hydraulic retention time in which the removal efficiency increased to 95 96 when different hydraulic retention time was used 156 the baf system was proven the best technique for nitrogen removal from wastewater in which the denitrification performance under total cod and tkn ratio of 3 6 gave the best results 155 156 in addition removal efficiency of cod ammonium and tn reached 83 7 93 1 and 84 6 respectively when the cod n ratio was 5 and a dramatic reduction in the system s performance occurred when the cod n ratio decreased 155 on the other hand raceway pond and photobioreactors are usually used in processes that are based on the use of microalgae 157 operational systems and microorganisms inoculation affect the removal efficiency of pollutants from produced water 158 3 3 3 innovative microbial capacitive desalination cell mcdc treatment process microbial desalination cell mdc is a recent and new technology that was developed from the traditional technology of microbial fuel cell mfc process that generates an electrical current ensure desalination of water and treats wastewater the development method of mdc from mfc was achieved through the construction of a reactor by installing a desalination chamber in between the cathode and the anode chambers 159 furthermore mcdc is derived from the mdc design with the integration of capacitive deionization cdi into the design of the mdc in which it prevents the transport of salts into the anode and the cathode because it uses porous electrodes that sorb ions electrically 160 the advantage of mcdc over the traditional mdc is that it can overcome the ph changes and imbalance by utilizing two cation exchange membranes cem instead of one as used in mdc allowing the protons to transfer freely across the system which in turn prevents the significant changes in ph stoll et al 149 conducted a study on the use of mcdc for the removal of salts organics from shale gas produced water and the efficiency of the desalination of mcdc was estimated based on the removal of ions in the cathode anode and desalination chambers this study was conducted to proof the demonstrated concept that the biodegradable organic matter constituents of the shale gas produced water are sufficient for running the mcdc generating an electrical potential for desalination of 0 25 0 28 v the dissolved organic carbon doc and aromatic compounds were removed from the anode chamber through biodegradation and sorption in addition a consistent potential was successfully generated by the microbial community throughout the experiment moreover salt was removed effectively from the desalination chamber through electro sorption with removal percentage ranging between 64 and 70 with sorption capacity 5 18 times greater than the conventional cdi which utilize activated carbon as electrodes 161 furthermore mcdc have salt removal rate that is 1 1 12 times higher than the traditional mdc system due to the additional sorption capacities with the advantage of keeping salts out of the cathode and anode chambers by preventing its transportation and accumulation 162 the sequential operation of mcdc is required for the removal of salts and organics so it can meet the quality standards for the reuse of produced water 149 in addition mcdc can also be used as pretreatment for the partial degradation of organics and to desalinate water in order to reduce membrane fouling and scaling however this treatment technology requires more research for better understanding of the long term negative effects of highly saline produced water and its contaminants on membranes assemblies of the electrodes microbial communities and the overall performance which in turn will assist in optimizing the reactor for the desalination and treatment of produced water as well as in power generation it is also crucial to determine the factors affecting the regeneration process of mcdc in which optimizing the regeneration before implementing mcdc on a large scale is a must 149 shrestha et al 163 compared the mcdc performance with microbial fuel cell mfc and found that mfc achieved higher reduction of cod 88 than mcdc 76 however mcdc was able to remove two times more dissolved solids than mfcs it was also noted that both techniques suffered from impedance due to fouling during the later operational stages 3 3 4 microalgae based treatment process currently eco technology is a new approach that has been introduced for the treatment processes of produced water in which higher removal rate of pollutants from produced water can be reached 164 therefore the use of microalgae based treatment as a sustainable solution for the treatment process is defined by these eco technology approaches generally bio remediation of produced water effluents can be done through using the microalgae due to their ability in utilizing certain pollutants as nutrient source 165 according to a study done by takacova et al 166 that btex can be utilized as a sole carbon source by specific microalgal species such as parachlorella kessler in another study water soluble fraction wsf gasoline was used to investigate its toxicity and it gives an important foundation for the effect of btex on the growth of microalgae 167 168 however 50 growth inhibition on cultures of microalgae is caused by increasing the concentration of btex with more contact time 169 heavier hydrocarbons have higher toxicity on microalgae growth 170 furthermore produced water generally contains sufficient concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus which sometimes act as growth limiting factors for microalgae 29 furthermore there are various trace elements other than nitrogen and phosphorus that are important for microalgal growth and they are also present in produced water thus growing microalgae in produced water has the potential to be used as efficient treatment process in which the microalgae biomass production is increased during treatment process furthermore cultivated microalgae biomass can be used as alternative feedstock for generation of energy 171 the microalgae strains used in different water treatments for pollutants bioremediation includes monoraphidium sp chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp 88 165 172 4 reuse of produced water since the demand and production of oil and gas is continuing to increase globally the environmental footprints associated with this production are increasing such as produced water furthermore as the scarcity of freshwater supply is increasing produced water can be a crucial source of water after suitable treatment there has been an increased attention on reclaiming reusing and recycling of water that is usually wasted to meet the communities needs of freshwater source 173 different standards for reuse of treated water have been provided based on intended purpose the us epa provides standards for reuse of treated water as drinking water 54 in addition standards for reuse in irrigation and for livestock has been provided by us department of agriculture natural resources conservation service 174 table 5 shows standards for water reuse based on different purposes as expected the standards for drinking water are more stringent and therefore more extensive treatment of produced water is needed there are several alternatives for utilization of produced water such as drinking water irrigation livestock watering habitat and wildlife watering fire control and industrial uses such as dust control oil field uses and power generation based on the characteristics of produced water discussed previously treatment of the produced water is required to meet the quality standards before re using it the treatment level or degree required depends on the application that it will be reused in for example minimal treatment regime is required for using produced water in oil and gas and industries as well as dust control on the other hand higher treatment level is required for uses such as drinking water and agriculture 176 furthermore cost efficiency is an important factor that determines the treatment regime and reuse option for example it was calculated that the produced water treatment with traditional techniques such as hydrocylcone gravity separation and media filters will yield treated water suitable for re injection at the cost of 0 509 m3 of water however for recycling of produced water advanced desalination technique like mechanical vapor compression mvc with other suitable technique will yield recyclable water at the cost of 3 808 m3 of water 177 4 1 livestock watering water quality consumed by livestock usually have lower standards than the quality of water for human consumption as the contaminant tolerance of livestock is better than humans however contaminants present in the water used by animals should be under certain limit to avoid negatively affecting their health 3 for instance water with 1000 mg l of tds can be used as a water source for livestock however it can affect the health of livestock by causing diarrhea if the value exceeds 7000 mg l 109 this idea was applied in some projects of cbm in which they established watering stations for livestock to utilize produce water as drinking water 3 4 2 habitat and wildlife watering produced water can be used after semi intensive treatment and ensuring its harmless nature to create artificial reservoir for providing drinking water source for wildlife as well as offering habitat for waterfowl and fishes these impoundments can collect and retain produced water in large volumes as they have large area of several acres 178 4 3 irrigation after the treatment of produced water and removal of all pollutants if the quality of treated water is meeting with certain standards and having low enough tds we can consider produced water as a valuable resource for irrigation of crops 178 reuse of produced water for irrigation especially in dry lands has been recommended and reviewed 179 due to high content of salts tds 35 472 000 mg l na 3 435 000 mg l its reuse for irrigation remains a challenge 179 the main challenges include sodicity salinity specific ion toxicity and alkalinity which are magnified because of the lower produced water quality therefore it is very crucial to consider the crop type when using produced water for irrigation 78 a research was done by sirivedhin et al 178 to treat the synthetic solutions with variable tds concentrations to mimic produced water using electrodialysis technique results showed that all 3 samples with low tds concentration meet the standards of both livestock watering and drinking water however they had higher sar values than the standard values for irrigation use but this problem can be solved by the addition of ca2 and or mg2 to these waters in small amounts in order to decrease their sar value and make them usable for irrigation on the other hand water samples with high tds concentrations did not meet the standards for reuse highlighted in table 5 therefore it can be concluded that electrodialysis under the experiment operating conditions is an inadequate process for reclaiming produced water to be used in these applications 4 4 algae production there are limited number of studies that reported the growth rate of algae productivity or biomass yield and lipid production by algal strains grown in produced water as nutrient medium however to date godfrey 180 conducted the most comprehensive study for using produced water as a medium to grow microalgae for the aim of producing lipid for biofuel conversion total of 8 microalgae strains were grown successfully in produced water and all produced neutral lipids amphora coffeiformis optimized its growth and lipid production with 150 mg l sodium nitrate and without the addition of phosphate while 300 mg l of sodium nitrate were added to optimize the growth and high lipid productivities of chaetoceros gracilis and chlorella sp moreover pretreatment of produced water for the removal of hydrocarbon through filtration by activated carbon centrifugation or settling can increase the growth and lipid productivity results also showed that there is a remarkably higher biodiesel productivity of strains grown on produced water as the lipid content reached 63 and 63 8 mg biodiesel l day thus it was concluded that replacement of growth media with produced water supplemented only with essential nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients is more environmentally and economically logical because similar lipid and biomass productivities can be achieved with lower cost without the requirement of freshwater 5 case studies produced water treatment and reuse 5 1 reuse of produced water for microalgae production qatar the produced water from one of the natural gas field in qatar was collected by the research team of al ghouti et al unpublished data and was used to investigate the removal of heavy metals using microalgae the produced water samples collected were first filtered using 0 45 ฮผm millipore filter to remove most of the suspended solids and other major pollutants table 6 the filtered water was then used to grow various species of microalgae to investigate their capabilities to remove heavy metals table 6 shows the ability of species to remove various metals from produced water as shown in table 7 100 removal efficiency of al zn and fe from produced water was achieved through microalgae while k had the lowest removal efficiency of 11 27 181 according to cai et al 182 toxicity of the produced water could increase with the increase in the concentration of these elements according to the results obtained in this research dictyosphaerium sp can recover more elements since it had better growth than other species our findings agreed with previous researches 183 184 which shows that dictyosphaerium sp has the ability to grow within metal rich water in this research among 14 metals were found to be present in the collected produced water almost half of them are considered as micronutrients such as k that plays an important role in various enzymatic reactions 185 along with k fe and cu have crucial role in the photosynthetic electron transport system 186 while zn is utilized by the microalgae through the transcription process of dna and uptake of phosphorus 187 on the other hand monteiro et al 188 mentioned that certain metals such as cd and cr could negatively affect the cell division and decrease the photosynthetic ability if present at high concentration according to millach et al 189 intensity of chlorophyll a in scenedesmus sp could significantly decrease if cr is available in concentration higher than 0 75 ppb unlike scenedesmus sp some species were found to tolerate higher concentrations of cr such as dictyosphaerium sp that can tolerate up to 13 17 mg l and chlorella pyrenoidosa that can tolerate up to 2 mg l 190 191 furthermore high biomass yield of scenedesmus sp dictyosphaerium sp and chlorella sp was observed in this study which can be attributed to the low cr concentration present in the tested produced water this case study shows that the produced water after minimal treatment can be used for microalgae production although microalgae can help to remove certain metals from the produced water nevertheless the effect of various constituents of produced water on the growth of microalgae needs to be investigated 5 2 reuse of produced water for internal reuse in gas industry china china possess the largest shale gas resources in the world with sichuan basin being the largest shale gas play 56 the volume of produced water generated from each well is approximately 20 000 m3 49 which is even higher than the volume generated in the us 192 however the tds values in this produced water 193 194 has been found to be lower than the shale plays in the us 76 195 196 due to the better quality of produced water and its higher volumes the feasibility to reuse this water within the industry was studied 197 the reuse of produced water within the industry such as for fracturing operations has been gaining more attention 198 because it can reduce both the volume of wastewater as well as consumption of freshwater resources hence the integrated treatment technique comprising coagulation followed by uf and nf was investigated for its suitability to meet the standards of reuse in this case study 197 two different types of coagulants i e aluminum sulfate octadecahydrate and ferric chloride hexahydrate were used the coagulated water was then pumped to the uf system the uf membrane used was of molecular weight cut off mwco 100 kda and was operated at a constant flux of 50 l m2 h with back washing for 5 min after every one hour the uf filtered water was then further treated with nf membrane at different pressures of 100 200 300 and 400 psi the nf system was operated at the water recovery of 50 70 and 85 thus the integrated coagulation uf nf treatment system reduced the turbidity by 99 9 cod by 94 2 and alkalinity by 94 1 the cations such as calcium magnesium barium and strontium were removed by 72 83 as shown in fig 3 when compared with the standards for reuse table 8 it was found that all the parameters of treated water obtained through integrated treatment system are much lower and therefore it can be reused within the industry 5 3 reuse of produced water for irrigation of biofuel crops usa the volume of produced water is among the highest in usa in the world it has been estimated that around 90 of the produced water is being injected back to the wells 200 201 however this practice of produced water re injection is being linked with the seismic activities and frequent earthquakes in texas as the area contains relatively larger number of injection wells 202 203 the growth rate of biofuel production is projected to increase 204 which is also water intensive process therefore the use of produced water for irrigation in the region can help to reduce the consumption of freshwater resources however the presence of hydrocarbons organic matters and high salt concentrations are the major parameters that need to be considered for reuse of produced water in irrigation thus in this case study the effect of produced water on biofuel crops was studied 205 the switchgrass and rapeseed were chosen as they can tolerate broad range of salinity ph and temperature conditions 206 207 the produced water from central processing facility in the denver julesburg basin was used that serves more than 500 wells and contains higher toc and tds concentrations both higher than 20 000 mg l the effect of salinity and organic matter concentrations were studied at highest and lowest concentrations to cover both worst and best case scenarios the produced water was treated with different techniques to achieve different quality of water as a control good quality reservoir water tds 310 mg l toc 3 3 mg l was used for irrigation designated as irrigation water a the best quality of treated water was obtained through treatment with coagulation and ultrafiltration followed by adsorption through granular activated carbon the effluent water was then diluted using tap water to obtain the tds of 400 mg l and toc of 3 mg l irrigation water b similarly the dilution was done to obtain another two qualities of water with both having tds of 3500 mg l but with different toc concentrations i e 65 100 mg l low toc and 215 235 mg l high designated as irrigation water c and d respectively furthermore the produced water was pre treated using hydrogen peroxide oxidation followed by coagulation and ultrafiltration to obtain treated water with both relatively higher tds 15 000 20 000 and toc 1500 mg l concentrations irrigation water e the aim of choosing different water qualities was to determine water with minimal quality and treatment required to obtain suitable biomass growth using produced water as expected the plant growth and subsequently biomass yield decreased for both biofuel crops switchgrass and rapeseed with decrease in water quality due to higher salinity and organic matter concentrations fig 4 the difference between the plant growth and biomass yield obtained with irrigation water having highest toc and tds was statistically significant as compared to the irrigation water with lower concentrations the quality of water was found to be significantly correlated with the accumulation of salts in soil samples the salinity of the water was found to be very important characteristic for the growth of perennial energy crops the physiological characteristics of crops i e biomass production on ground and underground were significantly affected by the irrigation water of toc of nearly 232 mg l when compared with the one having low toc of around 38 mg l thus higher concentrations of organic matter were shown to affect the el electrolyte leakage value of the leaf which confirmed that the crops are sensitivity to toc levels in produced water hence both the salinity and the organic matter are important characteristics of produced water which needs to be considered for their reuse in irrigation of biofuel crops it was concluded from this case study that the produced water should be treated enough to reduce the toc to 3500 mg l and to lower content of organic matter in order to consider its reuse for irrigation it was also concluded that the extent of treatment to reduce toc and the organic matter content is optimum from feasibility scalability and cost point of view this holds true for the treatment of produced water as one step or two step treatment methods are not considered enough to meet the reuse standards 208 209 since the production of produced water in oil and gas industry is an inherent problem more research is needed to develop techniques to reduce the volume of its production jafari et al 210 studied the ways to reduce the water production in oil and gas wells it was concluded that using newly designed equipment adopting production rates lesser than the critical rates and plugging wells can help to control the volumes and impacts of produced water 6 conclusion considering the shortage of fresh water resources and environmental problems caused by oil and gas industry produced water treatment and reuse are generating immediate attention the detailed literature review showed that the characteristics of produced water widely differs from location to location therefore the treatment technique needs to be evaluated for a particular source of produced water the cost of treatment and aim of reuse can also affect the choice of treatment technology in literature numerous techniques and combination of different techniques were found to be used for produced water treatment however practical demonstration of reuse of produced water for purposes such as for irrigation or microalgae growth and others is seldom reported in order to meet the rising water demands and to reduce the environmental impacts of oil and gas industry it is dire requirement now to promote the reuse of produced water its reuse will not only reduce the environmental impacts of the industry but also reduce the stress on fresh water resources this is particularly important for water stress countries where population and economic growth is continuing to increase stress on limited water resources of the region conflict of interest on behalf of all authors the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest 1 j m dickhout j moreno p m biesheuvel l boels r g h lammertink w m de vos produced water treatment by

14447,in oil and gas industry produced water is considered as the largest waste stream which contains relatively higher concentration of hydrocarbons heavy metals and other pollutants due to the increase in industrial activities the generation of produced water has increased all over the world and its treatment for reuse is now important from environmental perspective treatment of produced water can be done through various methods including physical membrane filtration adsorption etc chemical precipitation oxidation and biological activated sludge biological aerated filters and others methods this paper aims to highlight characteristics of produced water in detail and physical chemical and biological techniques used for its treatment in addition reuse of produced water for different purposes has been discussed at the end few case studies from different countries related to the treatment and reuse of their produced waters have been included keywords produced water characterization environmental toxicology treatment 1 introduction in oil and gas industry the produced water is a term used for the water associated with oil during the extraction process it is one of the largest streams of wastewater generated in these industries estimated to be 70 billion barrels per annum in the world in 2009 out of which 21 billion barrels is produced by us alone 1 produced water results from two processes in the oil and gas industry first during extraction this gives a mixture of water and oil the source of which is usually seawater surrounding the oil well second the water injected into the oilfield to bring the deep oil to the surface also ultimately becomes part of produced water or wastewater based on the origin produced water can be classified as produced water from natural gas oilfield or coal bed methane 2 naturally occurring rocks in subsurface formations are usually permeated with water oil gas or a combination of these fluids it is believed that prior to the petroleum invasion and trapping rocks were completely saturated with water in most oil bearing formations this water could be either flowing from above below or within the hydrocarbon zone or could flow from the injected fluids and additives coming from the production activities before the production process of the reservoir starts and the fluids brought to the surface the produced water is known as formation water or connate water thus any water present in the hydrocarbon reservoir and produced with crude oil or natural gas and brought to the surface is known as produced water furthermore produced water removed through the production of coal bed methane cbm have almost the same properties as the produced water from crude oil or conventional gas production with some differences in its composition 3 moreover extraction of oil and gas from offshore and onshore wells result in produced water generation regardless if the fuel is extracted from conventional or unconventional sources including cbm tight sands and gas shale 4 most of the volume of waste stream in oil and gas production operations on offshore platforms is produced water and it represents 80 of the residuals and wastes produced through the production of natural gas furthermore as the age of the well increases and the decline of oil and gas production results the amount of produced water generation increases 5 volume of produced water could reach 98 in nearly depleted fields with only 2 of fossil fuel production 6 during extraction of oil the water to oil ratio is around 3 1 7 even though the ratio has increased the production of produced water at global level is still as much as 39 5 mm3 day 1 due to the ageing of wells it is also expected that the water to oil ratio will be averaging 12 v v for crude oil resources by 2025 1 6 7 thus the market growth for the management and reuse of produced water is expected to grow further in this review paper the produced water volumes across different countries its characteristics in general and physical chemical and biological techniques used for its treatment are discussed in detail in addition reuse of produced water after treatment for different purposes is highlighted at the end different case studies related to produced water treatment and reuse has been included the aim behind this review paper is to stress and promote the treatment and reuse of produced water in order to reduce the reliance on limited freshwater resources 2 produced water volumes produced water from oil or natural gas production does not have specific and constant volume table 1 as it depends on location and the technology used for extraction 8 in 2003 it was reported that about 667 million metric tons of produced water were discharged to the offshore in the world out of which 21 1 million tons were discharged to us gulf of mexico offshore water and between 358 and 419 million tons were discharged to the north sea of the europe offshore waters 9 10 additionally in 2007 256 000 m3 day of produced water were produced during the production process of oil and natural gas in us federal offshore waters in which 234 000 m3 day was discharged to the ocean after treatment and the rest was reinjected 8 moreover according to the international association of oil and gas producers iogp in 2014 0 6 tons of produced water was discharged and 1 2 tons of hydrocarbon produced were reinjected and 92 of the produced water was generated from offshores operations the volume of produced water from a specific reservoir does not remain constant initially the water production is very less but it increases with the age of the reservoir 11 since the volume of produced water being produced is very high in most of the countries table 1 therefore the management of this kind of wastewater is now a need 2 1 characteristics of produced water produced water is not a single product it has a simple to complex composition that is variable and it is considered as a mixture of dissolved and particulate organic and inorganic chemicals chemical and physical properties of produced water vary considerably which depends on several factors including geographic location of the field age and depth of the geological formation hydrocarbon bearing formation geochemistry extraction method type of the produced hydrocarbon as well as its chemical composition in the reservoir the toxicity of produced water discharged from gas platforms is 10 times higher than the toxicity of the oil wells discharge however the volumes from oil production are much higher than gas production 26 specific studies for each region should be done as its characteristics varies from region to region and such studies will also help in investigating the environmental risks of its discharge the main components found in produced water are categorized and summarized in table 2 along with their concentrations from the literature generally the major constituents that are present in produced water include salt content measured as salinity total dissolved solids tds or electrical conductivity oil and grease o g polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex phenols organic acids natural organic and inorganic compounds that cause hardness and scaling e g calcium magnesium sulfates and barium and chemical additives such as biocides and corrosion inhibitors that are used during drilling fracturing and operating process of the well 27 2 1 1 conductivity salinity and total dissolved solids tds the conductivity of produced water can vary widely as it was found that the conductivity of produced water from natural gas ranged from 4200 to 180 000 ฮผs cm 47 in another research the conductivity was found to be in a range of 136 000 586 000 ฮผs cm 55 the salinity of produced water ranges from few parts per thousand to 300 saturated brine which is much higher than the salt concentration of seawater which is in the range of 32 36 and that is why produced water is generally denser than seawater higher salinity results due to the presence of dissolved chloride and sodium mainly as the concentrations of calcium magnesium and potassium are usually lower 29 according to a study done by guerra et al 34 tds was in the range of 370 1940 mg l due to the increased concentrations of both sodium and bicarbonate recently tds concentration over time for produced water was investigated 56 results showed that the quality of produced water changes over time which affects the management and reuse of produced water variations in the concentration of tds occurs due to several reasons including the location of the well in the well field geological variations between basins and the resource of the produced water furthermore the concentration of tds varies between the conventional and unconventional wells since it was found that the concentration of tds was 50 000 mg l in cbm wells while it was as high as 400 000 mg l in the conventional wells 34 table 2 2 1 2 inorganic ions chloride and sodium are considered as the most abundant salt ions found in produced water while phosphate has the lowest concentration in produced water from both conventional and unconventional wells sodium is considered as the dominant cation with 81 in conventional wells and more that 90 in unconventional wells 34 however the anions makeup in conventional and unconventional wells is not the same the conventional wells are almost completely chloride anions representing 97 of the total anions while 66 and 32 of the unconventional wells contain bicarbonate and chloride anions respectively 34 furthermore sodium chloride magnesium sulfate bromide potassium iodide and bicarbonate are found abundantly in produced water with high salinity table 2 the presence of sulfate and sulfide ions in produced water can leads to insoluble sulfate and sulfide at high concentrations in produced water moreover the presence of bacteria in the anoxic produced water cause the reduction of sulfate and in turn leads to the presence of sulfides polysulfide and hydrogen sulfide in the produced water 32 however the concentration of these anions and cations varies from location and their ranges are presented in table 2 2 1 3 metals produced water may contain certain metals like fe cr ba ni zn and others however differences in the type concentration and chemical content of the metals are influenced by the geological age and features injected water volume and chemical composition 57 commonly mercury zinc barium manganese and iron are found in produced water at higher concentration than the seawater concentration 58 for instance hibernia produced water have high concentrations of barium iron and manganese as compared to seawater in addition it was also reported that the barium sodium iron magnesium potassium and strontium in produced water from natural gas production field are present at higher concentrations 49 2 1 4 total suspended solids tss total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn total suspended solids tss in produced water may include the floating or drifting materials found in the water such as silt sediment sand algae and plankton it has been noted that tss concentration in produced water is in the range of 14 800 mg l 47 and 8 5484 mg l 54 moreover another study conducted by tibbettes 28 for oilfield produced water found that the tss concentration was in the range of 1 2 1000 mg l table 2 furthermore rosenblum et al 56 investigated the time variation of levels of tss in produced water and found that there was almost 59 reduction in the concentration of tss within first 4 days followed by no more significant variation noted for next few days however further 40 decrease was observed in the concentration of tss in the period of 55th day of monitoring till 80th day according to a study conducted by ogp 59 the range of toc found in produced water is from 0 to 1500 mg l table 2 various naturally occurring water have toc concentration between less than 0 1 mg l and to greater than 11 000 mg l 32 according to ayers and parker 51 the mean concentration value of toc found in produced water from hibernia platforms is 300 mg l while it was in the range of 67 to 620 mg l in produced water from louisiana rigs 60 similarly toc in the range of 0 1500 mg l has been reported for produced water samples collected from various sources 29 kim et al 33 conducted a study on produced water samples which were collected over a 200 day time period from two wells and used toc concentration as a macro indicator for the quality of the produced water and found that the concentration of toc from both wells before 30 days was fluctuating significantly but after this period of time it was stabilized at 2000 mg l total nitrogen is the cumulative sum of all the nitrogen compounds in the water including ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and organically bonded nitrogen 34 according to unitar 34 total nitrogen by total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn is the total organic nitrogen compounds and ammonia with excluding nitrate nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen according to veil et al 60 the presence of nitrogen and other nutrients lead to the formation of hypoxic zones according to metcalf et al 35 it is more difficult to remove the non biodegradable part of the organic nitrogen than the biodegradable part which is easier to treat and less harmful for the environment furthermore separation of particulate is easier than the soluble part therefore the removal of tkn before the injection of the water back to the environment is crucial according to veil et al 60 and bierman et al 61 who investigated the presence of no3 no2 nh3 nh4 in produced water from fifty platforms of either gas oil or mixed production wells found that the highest mean concentration of no3 2 71 mg l was found in produced water from mostly gas wells while the highest concentration of nh3 and nh4 was found in produced water from mostly oil wells 92 mg l on the other hand same concentration of 0 05 mg l was measured for no2 in produced water from all tested wells 2 1 5 chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod5 according to studies done by fillo et al 47 and johnson et al 49 the estimated cod concentration in produced water was between 2600 mg l and 120 000 mg l a research conducted in east china where onshore produced water samples were collected from treatment plant at various sampling points showed that the concentration of cod mg l at each sampling point was 285 5 76 1 for the influent 108 9 29 2 for effluent 195 2 32 9 for eos effluent of oil separation tank 109 5 58 4 for ebo effluent of bio contact oxidation tank and 190 7 53 8 for ef effluent of flotation tank therefore it was found that these concentrations are higher than the acceptable limit set by the environmental protection agency of china i e 150 mg l 62 moreover according to a research conducted by zhao et al 63 the concentration of cod was 280 mg l in produced water from oil fields in canada similarly shakrollahzadeh et al 64 found that cod level of produced water extracted from gas stream in an iranian gas refinery was 270 mg l on the contrary gomes et al 65 obtained high range of 27 000 to 35 000 mg l for produced water samples collected from oil fields in usa another research in which the physico chemical characteristics of produced water collected from two oil facilities in nigeria were tested noted that the cod does not vary much among the two locations as it was found to be 3 91 1 32 mg l for both locations 66 which was less than the permissible limit of 125 0 mg l 33 the bod of 75 2870 mg l has been reported for produced water from natural gas field 47 reduced inorganic elements such as fe and mn used fluids for well drilling and additive chemicals can results in higher bod concentrations in produced water obtained directly from the well according to adewumi et al 67 high volumes of organic materials in drilling fluids can lead to the high bod values in produced water furthermore dissolved oxygen can severely deplete in water bodies receiving produced water with high bod content thus substantial oxidation of this water should be ensured to prevent the discharge of waste water with high bod into natural waters 2 1 6 oil and grease o g according to a study conducted by fillo et al 47 the concentration of o g in natural gas produced water was in the range of 6 60 mg l similar range has also been reported by johnson et al 49 and usepa 54 they found the concentration of 2 3 60 and 2 3 38 8 mg l of o g in produced water moreover another study was conducted on western united states produced water and the concentration of o g was found to be 40 mg l to as high as 2000 mg l 68 2 1 7 organic acids main organic acids that are found in produced water are monocarboxylic acids and dicarboxylic acids cooh of both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons having low molecular weight such as formic acid hexanoic acid butanoic acid acetic acid propanoic acid and pentanoic acid 69 71 however the most abundant organic acids in produced water are formatic acid and acetic acid 72 previously it has been reported that the concentration of formic acid was from not detectable levels to 68 mg l acetic acid from 8 to as high as 5735 mg l and propionic acid up to 4400 mg l in produced water samples collected from mexico gulf off the texas and louisiana coast and in the santa maria basin off the california coast 72 2 1 8 benzene toluene ethyl benzene and xylene btex btex are volatile aromatic compounds that are naturally present in oil and gas products including natural gas gasoline and diesel fuel thus they easily escape to the atmosphere during the water treatment process 48 benzene is abundantly found in produced water table 2 however increasing the alkylation lead to the decrease in the concentration of benzene 39 furthermore according to a study carried out by dorea et al 39 the concentration of btex present in produced water collected from oil field in gulf of mexico the concentration of benzene was found to be highest i e 0 44 2 80 mg l followed by toluene xylene and ethyl benzene these results are in consistent with the results of neff 32 in which benzene was present at highest concentration i e 0 084 2 30 mg l in produced water followed by toluene ethyl benzene and xylene similarly dorea et al 39 investigated the characteristics of permian basin produced water and they found that highest concentration was for benzene with 1 5 778 51 mg l followed by ethyl benzene xylenes and toluene 2 1 9 phenols phenols or phenolics are part of aromatic organic compounds that include one or more hydroxyl group attached to an aromatic hydrocarbon group various levels of phenols are present in produced water from oil and gas operating wells however gas condensate production was found to have the highest concentration of phenols 73 the comparison of the concentration of phenol in produced water from oil and gas field revealed that gas field produced water has higher concentrations of phenol than oil field produced water moreover neff 32 and johnsen et al 37 carried out a study to investigate the concentration of phenol in produced water collected from the louisiana gulf coast and norwegian region of the north sea found that the concentration range of phenols in produced water was in the range of 2 1 4 5 mg l and 0 36 16 8 mg l respectively 2 1 10 production chemicals treating chemicals production chemicals are usually added to the oil or gas field for the management of the operational problems such as to facilitate oil gas and water separation process prevention of pipeline corrosion and methane hydrate formation in the gas production system the required chemicals for the production process are unique and vary along with the various production systems and they can be categorized into 3 broad groups i e gas processing chemicals simulation and work over chemicals and production treating chemicals such as scale corrosion hydration inhibitors biocides water treating chemicals like flocculants and anti foams emulsion breakers reverse emulsion breakers and coagulants which are used in hydrocarbons recovery and pumping these production chemicals are soluble in oil eliminating the need for the mechanism of disposal the chemicals such as corrosion inhibitor and biocides are negatively affecting the environment their use has been reduced as they were found at very low concentration in produced water 37 74 3 produced water treatment since produced water contains several different contaminants with varying concentrations therefore numerous treatment technologies have been proposed for produced water treatment the wide variety of produced water treatment methods have been reported previously 29 75 78 the treatment system usually requires a series of individual unit processes for contaminants removal that might not be removed through a single process treatment of produced water can help in facilitating additional options for water management including its reuse for agricultural and industrial purposes according to arthur 27 the treatment of produced water should be able to remove dispersed and free oil and grease soluble organics suspended solids and dissolved gases naturally occurring radioactive materials salts and microorganisms as a result it is challenging to choose the type of treatment system suitable to remove most of the contaminants from produced water generally the cheapest method is the most preferable one and the cost of the produced water treatment mainly depends on influent quality electricity price plant s capacity as well as the intended quality of the effluent 79 furthermore treatment of offshore produced water is more challenging due to the absence of adequate space or weight capacity for the equipment used for the treatment process as they should be designed for operation in remote and harsh environments in general produced water treatment process has three main stages i e pre treatment main treatment step and final polishing treatment step the pre treatment step is done to remove large oil droplets coarse particles and gas bubbles to reduce dispersed contaminants the main treatment step involves primary treatment in which small oil droplets and particles removal will be achieved and will be done by using skim tanks plate pack interceptors and api separator the secondary treatment will involve removal of much smaller oil droplets and particles using gas flotation hydro cyclones and centrifuges the polishing step is usually employed to remove ultra small droplets and particles dispersed hydrocarbons 10 mg l using techniques like dual media filters cartridge filters and membranes the optional step tertiary treatment is sometimes used to remove dissolved matter gases and dispersed hydrocarbons 5 mg l according to fakhru l razi et al 29 combination of physical chemical and biological treatment processes should be used for the achievement of the different treatment goals fig 1 shows the removal efficiency of several treatment techniques for different pollutants it is evident from fig 1 that most of the techniques such as adsorption membrane filtration and chemical precipitation widely studied in the literature possesses higher removal efficiencies of above 90 for various produced water constituents and therefore the cost of treatment and the intended purpose of treatment reuse or discharge with associated standards can affect the choice of suitable technique in the following subsections physical chemical and biological techniques for produced water treatment are individually discussed in detail 3 1 physical treatment process 3 1 1 filtration filtration is relatively simple technique used in water and wastewater treatment process which is based on the use of porous filter media to allow only the water but not the impurities to pass through it there are various porous materials that can be used as filter media such as sand crushed stone and activated carbon however the widely used material is sand due to its availability low cost and efficiency 94 as proposed by adewumi et al 67 removing metals by sand filtration process should be done after the pretreatment stage which consists of three steps 1 adjustment of the ph for oxidation reduction initiation 2 increasing the oxygen concentration for the reaction through the aeration unit and 3 adequate retention time for the settlement of precipitated solids in the solid separation unit after these steps the fine solids that were not removed during pre treatment stages will be removed by sand filtration in the slow sand filtration treatment system the pretreated water is passed in a downward direction through a filter which is made up of a layer of sand and specific features to control the water flow and the water filtration rate ranges between 0 1 and 0 4 m3 m2 h 94 filter beds are mainly composed of fine grains with 0 15 0 35 mm diameter range and 1 m depth before starting the filtration process as the filtration proceeds the higher part of the treatment system will contain the colloidal and suspended particles coming from the untreated water and as these particles build up they will clog the system and reduce its efficiency therefore it is necessary to scrap off the top layer of the sand which is full of impurities to remove the clogging materials moreover the filtration process is a combination of various processes including mechanical straining chemical and biological activity adsorption and sedimentation for overall removal of impurities 94 95 the removal of various ions from water through sand filtration was investigated by wathugala et al 96 and it was noted that sand filtration results in higher percentage removal of cod and nitrogen and the filtered water was free from ammonia and phosphorus a new engineered sand filtration technique was developed by cha et al 97 in which it was combined with ozonation technique to treat the produced water the technique helped to reduce the cod from 320 mg l to 102 mg l and oil content to 20 mg l similarly sand filtration was used to remove oil and grease from produced water and 95 8 removal was obtained 98 furthermore membrane filtration technique can also be used for the treatment of produced water table 3 shows the comparison between various type of membranes used for the treatment of produced water 2 recently it was demonstrated that the ceramic microfiltration membranes were able to sustain permeability of 1400 l m2 h bar when real produced water from arabian oilfield was used as feed water through the application of back flushing during cleaning in place cip between cycles of filtration 99 the research done by chen et al 100 on the treatment of produced water obtained from oil field using ceramic crossflow microfiltration membrane showed that the tss level was 1 mg l and o g value was 5 mg l another research was conducted by mueller et al 101 on the removal of oil from synthetic produced water by ceramic membranes and results showed that 99 3 99 9 removal of oil could be achieved using this technique moreover according to a case study conducted by the new logic research in usa the treatment of produced water using combination of nf and ro membrane resulted in removal of most of the pollutants from produced water as shown in table 4 direct contact membrane distillation dcmd technique has also been used recently for the treatment of produced water it was noted that nanoporous hydrophobic hollow fiber membranes fabricated during the research was able to remove greater than 99 5 of tds from feed water even after continual operation for 100 hours the treated water was found to be suitable for industrial reuse the combination of microfiltration and membrane distillation has also been evaluated for treatment of produced water and minerals recovery and it was found that the combined technique can recover various salts such as sodium calcium magnesium and barium from produced water 102 membrane filtration technique has also been used in conjunction with adsorption to treat produced water the double staged treatment system comprising carbon bentonite adsorbent and nano hybrid membrane helped to reduce tds 72 turbidity 6 and salinity 90 the use of adsorbent at a pretreatment stage helped to stabilize membrane flux reduce membrane fouling and prolong the membrane lifetime 5 the selection of suitable pre treatment technique can also help to improve the performance of nf and ro as previously demonstrated by ozgun et al 31 it was noted that the application of membrane bioreactors mbrs as a pre treatment helped to reduce 83 cod from produced water and therefore it was optimum treatment technique in combination with ro in terms of cod and conductivity reduction whereas microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes were able to remove less than 25 of the cod and therefore were not as effective as mbr in terms of pre treatment techniques 31 3 1 2 electrodialysis electrodialysis ed and electrodialysis reversal edr are both separation processes that are driven by electrochemical charge and are used for the treatment of brackish water seawater desalination and wastewater reclamation as well as being tested for the treatment of produced water at laboratory scale 105 salts in produced water could be removed by electrodialysis in which it utilizes a stack of alternating anion and cation selective membranes that are separated by spacer sheets 106 electrical current is applied to the cell after passing the water through membranes stack which lead to the migration of anions and cations into opposite directions alternating cells of diluted and concentrated solutions are produced between the membranes as the migrating ions intersects the selectively permeable membrane this process requires less energy than reverse osmosis as it operates under lower pressure and it can reduce the concentration of salt to 200 mg l this treatment method is usually used for produced water with low tds concentrations 107 on the other hand the drawbacks of this technology include its limited ability to remove non ionic constituents such as organic molecules occurrence of membrane fouling relatively high cost periodic disposal of concentrate and highly skilled labor requirement 105 moreover this process could remove salts from produced water but other constituents such as oil heavy metals and other pollutants present in produced water may not be removed the main advantages of this technology include withstanding harsh conditions has membrane lifetime that is estimated to be in the range of 4 5 years no need for special infrastructure and considered as an excellent treatment process to be applied for produced water 2 3 1 3 flotation in this method fine gas bubbles are utilized for the separation of suspended particles that cannot be removed by sedimentation this process is done by injecting gas into the water to be treated then both suspended particulates and oil droplets will attach to the air bubbles and then they will rise to the surface leading to the formation of foam that is removed by skimming this process can be done using air nitrogen or other types of inert gases the technique can be used for the removal of volatile organics oil and grease from produced water 108 dissolved gas flotation dgf and induced gas flotation igf are two subdivisions of the gas flotation technology and the difference between them is in the method used for the generation of the gas bubbles and the resultant bubble size the efficiency of the process mainly depends on the contaminants to be removed density differences of liquids temperature and the size of the oil droplet flotation process does not work ideally with high temperature feed streams however it works well under cold temperature and can be used for the treatment of produced water with high and low toc concentrations as well as water with oil grease and particulates with less than 7 solids 34 particles with 25 ฮผm size can be removed by dissolved air flotation process and when using coagulation as pretreatment step contaminants with size of 3 5 ฮผm can be removed as well as reported by fakhru l razi et al 29 there are multiple advantages and disadvantages of gas flotation process the advantages includes i coalescence increase the process efficiency ii ease of operation iii has no moving parts iv it is durable and robust while the disadvantages are i large amount of airis generated ii skim volume iii 4 5 min retention time the percentage oil removal of up to 93 has been obtained using flotation process 109 moreover beyer et al 89 used induced air flotation technique as a pre treatment for oilfield produced water having tds of 20 000 mg l and it was found that the cod and toc level decreased to 595 mg l and 115 mg l respectively thus using these techniques oil content vocs suspended solids etc can be removed from produced water without using any additional chemicals in addition coagulants can be used sometimes to increase the efficiency of treatment nevertheless the main drawback remains the disposal of sludge at the end of treatment which increases the cost of treatment 110 3 1 4 adsorption adsorption is considered as one of the best treatment techniques for achieving better water quality as it can reduce the concentration of the contaminant to very low levels 111 according to spellman 112 nearly 100 produced water recovery and 85 removal of heavy metals can be accomplished through adsorption process however the main disadvantage of using the adsorption method is the cost of the installation and maintenance of the system but this drawback can be solved by using more economical adsorption media such as activated carbon that can make the adsorption process more competitive another disadvantage of adsorption process is the requirement of waste disposal for the produced waste and spent media through the regeneration process of media furthermore different organic and inorganic compounds can be retained by various adsorbent materials several adsorbents have been proven to remove manganese iron toc btex oil and heavy metals 80 from produced water activated carbon have been used widely for a long time as an effective adsorbent to remove various pollutants from contaminated water using ac as an adsorbent is preferable for water decontamination process rather than other techniques because it is less expensive relatively simple and efficient producing reasonably cheap and excellent adsorbent from ac is done through different treatment methods that helps to develop internal pore structure and large surface area 113 activated carbon has various unique characteristics including high grade of surface reactivity high adsorption ability extended surface area and microporous structure 114 in addition activated carbon has several functional groups that are accountable for the diversity of physiochemical and catalytic characteristic 115 using ac contaminants that can be removed include cadmium mercury natural organic matter btex compounds and synthetic organic chemicals such as benzo a pyrene dioxin radionuclides di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate and hexachlorobenzene 34 there are various materials that can be used for preparing ac such as fossil fuel wood or some agricultural wastes using different preparation processes of physical or chemical nature 116 physical activation method is not widely used as it has been reported to give specific surface area less than 1500 m2 g only 117 on the other hand in the chemical activation method chemical activation agents such as koh naoh and h2so4 are used for the impregnation of the used precursors for ac preparation followed by carbonization process koh is the most preferred chemical activation agent as it results in formation of k2co3 after the interaction between char and koh leading to prevention of excessive burning of the sample giving higher yield and well developed internal porosity another advantage of using koh is that it is considered as more environment friendly chemical than other activators 118 several different parameters influence the quality of the prepared ac including the impregnation ratio ir activation time and activation temperature 117 ac has around 650 m2 g to 1000 m2 g adsorption surface area which is considered as an extremely large amount of adsorption surface area activated carbon removal efficiency can range from 70 to 85 but the presence of suspended particles within the produced water can decrease the removal efficiency 29 regeneration of activated carbon is necessary after few batches of treatment to regain the pollutant removal efficiency as it dramatically decreases with time 119 various chemicals such as acids bases redox agents and organic solvents are used during the regeneration process of activated carbon leading to the increase in cost of the treatment process 120 furthermore regeneration can be done onsite in case the ac plant is large enough however it is usually done off site because onsite regeneration is only effective in the case of having 910 kg day carbon exhaustion rate moreover there are certain factors that determine the reactivation frequency including concentration contaminant type water usage rate and carbon type used 109 okiel et al 121 investigated the efficiency of using bentonite deposited carbon dc and powdered activated carbon pac for oil removal from produced water the results showed that increasing the weight and contact time of the adsorbent lead to an increase in the percentage removal of oil which highlighted the importance of contact time in adsorption technique according to al ghouti et al 122 who used activated carbon ac on reducing organosulfur compounds ors from diesel non aqueous medium found that there are excellent adsorption capabilities of granular bead form of ac norit pk 1 3 holland the research illustrates that ac particle size affects the elimination efficiency of ors in which the adsorption mainly occurs on the external surface area moreover it was proved that ac has the ability to remove btex and free hydrocarbons participating in the total petroleum hydrocarbons tph there are various parameters that influence the absorber effectiveness which are ph temperature salinity and low concentration of heavy metals and dissolved organic chemicals in addition doyle et al 123 developed a new system composed of a modified polymer bentonite or organoclay and bed column packed with ac to eliminate hydrocarbons resulting in the reduction of tph and btex to non detectable limits but the need to regenerate the absorbent material repeatedly is the main disadvantage of this system another research was carried out by luukkonen et al 124 in which 4 commercial acs were utilized to investigate the toc elimination from makeup water of power plant where continuous flow bench scale ac filters at steam boiler desalination plant were used to carry out the experiment results showed that all the tested acs had similar removal efficiency of 42 45 of toc and 58 68 of dissolved organic carbon after operation for 30 days removal efficiencies of toc were steady throughout the experiment ranging between 41 6 and 44 8 for all the used acs and the residues of toc after ac filtration were between 126 ppb and 260 ppb since deionized water nutrient content are too low for allowing any biological activity it is assumed that the removal of toc is primarily due to adsorption furthermore halim et al 125 did a comparison study demonstrating the ac adsorption ability of cod and found that ac has higher removal capacity than other adsorbents such as composite and zeolites and the adsorption capacities of cod were 37 88 mg g 22 99 mg g and 2 35 mg g respectively fig 2 summarizes the efficiency of various adsorbents for oil and organic pollutants removal from produced water it is evident from the fig 2 that the adsorbents like exfoliated graphite and the ones obtained from organic source eggshell and banana peel achieved 100 removal of oil and organic pollutants modification of the adsorbent s surface enhances their elimination efficiency and adsorption selectivity of specific toxic materials modification of activated carbon can be done with hydrophilic groups that include cations anions and zwitterions leading to structured molecular assemblies that depends on the group nature the research group of nadeem et al 131 used sodium dodecyl sulfate sds as a negative charged surfactant and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ctab as a positively charged surfactant for cadmium removal from aqueous solution it was found that sds ac had the highest percentage removal of cd 98 among all other adsorbents as well as having better surface area and greater porosity therefore such modified adsorbents can be used for target removal of certain pollutants from produced water ac has also been used as a pre treatment technique for produced water treatment it was noted that the use of ac pac and granular activated carbon gac with microfiltration as pre treatment technique increased the reduction in cod from 10 to 30 and 48 respectively furthermore it also helped to improve the performance of final treatment step with nf and ro techniques in conclusion the gac with microfiltration followed by ro was suggested as a best technique for optimum removal of heavy metals and reduction in conductivity 132 nevertheless the overall cost of the treatment technique including different pre treatment methods needs to be taken into consideration to determine best technique for treatment of produced water 3 2 chemical treatment process 3 2 1 precipitation precipitation is considered as one of the conventional chemical treatment processes of produced water 133 through this process up to 97 removal of suspended and colloidal particles can be accomplished 134 flocculants and coagulants which are mainly comprised of inorganic metals such as iron magnesium and aluminum polymers are usually used in the chemical treatment process and they were found to be effective in removing contaminants 85 other studies removed particulate metals phosphorous and carbonaceous compounds by applying flocculants like ferric chloride fecl3 and anionic polymer in ballasted flocculation unit however these flocculants were found to be less efficient for the removal of hydrophilic compounds and nitrogen 135 moreover zhou et al 85 reported that the addition of coagulation chemicals can remove almost 97 of suspended solids and oil from produced water 3 2 2 chemical oxidation this technology is usually used for the removal of cod bod odor color organics and some inorganics from produced water according to igunnu and chen 2 it is not possible for free electrons to be present in solution therefore this treatment process depends on the reactions of oxidation and reduction as they occur together in the produced water according to huang 136 strong oxidants and catalysts can be used for decomposing the organic impurities present in the produced water generally multiple pollutants can be broken down by using several oxidants like chlorine ozone peroxide and oxygen furthermore there are various parameters that affect the oxidation rate of this technology including dose of the chemical used oxidant s type quality of the raw water and contact time between water and used oxidant 2 the main advantages of this treatment process are minimal requirement of equipment does not generate any waste does not need any pre treatment process and can achieve almost 100 water recovery rate however the main drawbacks are it has high chemical cost maintenance and calibration of the chemical pump is required regularly and production of byproducts through the process that are not easily removed 2 moreover igunnu and chen 2 mentioned that a final treatment process is required for particulate matter removal after the oxidation process advanced oxidation processes aop is considered as a recent development in water treatment field which is an effective solution for quickly oxidizing the organic pollutants through the addition of oxidants or mixture of oxidants 136 this process utilizes ozone iron and hydrogen peroxide as chemical oxidizers furthermore hydroxyl radicals like zinc oxide titanium dioxide and iron oxide are also introduced in this treatment process 137 3 2 3 electrochemical technologies although this process has been used widely in the treatment of various wastewater types it is rarely used for the treatment of produced water however this technique is being suggested as the future produced water treatment technology the advantages of these technologies over other treatment technologies is that it is low cost green technology and it does not utilize any additional chemicals nor generate secondary waste furthermore it can remove organic materials efficiently can produce and save energy and help to recover valuable materials from produced water without negatively affecting the environment this can be achieved through harmonizing various electrochemical techniques such as water electrolysis fuel cell electrodeposition and photo electrochemistry that includes photo electrolysis photo catalysis and photo electrocatalysis into one electrochemical process 2 photo electrolysis is a chemical process that uses light for breaking down large molecules into smaller ones as reported by fujishima and honda 138 removal of organics from produced water could be achieved through the use of tio2 electrodes for the photocatalytic decomposition of water and adams et al 139 reported that semiconductor photocatalysis can decrease the content of hydrocarbons present in produced water effectively in 10 min by 90 furthermore li et al 140 conducted a study on synthetic produced water that mimics the original produced water with its constituents to investigate the removal efficiency of cod by photo electrocatalysis and found that it has higher removal efficiencies than electrochemical oxidation and photocatalysis another study carried by ma and wang 88 on the removal of organics from produced water obtained from oilfield by setting up a catalytic electrochemical pilot scale plant in which they used iron as a cathode material double anodes with graphite and active metal in addition to noble metal having large surface as a catalyst results showed a reduction on the level of cod and bod by more than 90 in 6 min furthermore in 3 min they observed that the suspended solids reduced by 99 content of ca2 by 22 98 reduction in the rate of corrosion and 99 decrease in the presence of sulfate reducing bacteria and iron bacteria moreover fuel cell is one of the most important electrochemical technologies that converts energy into electricity and produces heat and water as by products this technology plays crucial role in the future of the treating produced water however successful research on reducing the cost of this technology as well as improving the efficiency and increasing its life span are important factors for the application of the fuel cell technology on the treatment of produced water in the future 141 in addition there are various established treatment technologies of produced water that can remove heavy metals but they cannot recover the metals removed from produced water however electrodeposition is a technology that is usually used for the recovery of metals it has been utilized for the recovery of cu from synthetic produced water and results showed the excellent ability of electrodeposition to recover metals that would be lost during the removal process from produced water 142 3 3 biological treatment process biological treatment process is considered as one of the least expensive processes for removal of pollutants in which either aerobic or anaerobic conditions are maintained 143 furthermore algae fungi and bacteria with 0 2 10 ฮผm size are generally present in produced water and they can be utilized for produced water treatment as these microorganisms will use the pollutants as nutrient source for growth purposes 144 several different processes and technologies like sequencing batch reactors and biological aerated filters can be used for biological treatment of produced water 29 this process is mostly effective in feed water with cod 400 mg l bod 50 mg l oil level 60 mg l 34 and concentration of chloride 6600 mg l 145 according to research carried out by li et al 146 on the removal of cod with concentration of 2600 mg l from produced water and removal efficiency of 90 can be achieved by utilizing the immobilized basillus sp under aerobic conditions furthermore microbial community of methanosarcina rhodopseudomonas and clostridia were used for removal of cod from produced water under anaerobic conditions and achieved removal efficiency of 65 kose et al 147 tested the operational stability of membrane bioreactors mbrs for the treatment of real produced water despite of variation in the influent quality and solids retention times srt it was found that mbr provides stable quality of treated water with 80 85 removal of cod and 99 removal of hydrocarbons moreover spiral microbial electrochemical cell smxc as fuel cell was developed to improve the treatment of produced water by naraghi et al 148 in which consortia of halophile and halotolerant anaerobic microbial community were used to remove organic compounds from feed water with 200 000 mg l salinity and they achieved 90 removal of organics in addition stoll et al 149 biodegrade organics present in produced water by using microbial capacitive desalination cell mcdc and they successfully removed 6 4 mgtoc h in biological reactor as well as biodegradation of 36 mgtds g carbon of electrode h however one of the major disadvantages of biological treatment is the generation of huge quantity of biological sludge which requires further treatment and relatively lower efficiency and more contact time another drawback is the stationary infrastructure of the common biological processes which needs long assembly and operation time 150 3 3 1 activated sludge activated sludge is one of the commonly used aerobic treatment process of wastewaters in which it can adsorb and occlude soluble and insoluble materials 29 furthermore it has been reported that using the solids retention time srt of about 20 days the removal of total petroleum hydrocarbons tph of 98 99 can be achieved through activated sludge treatment 151 similarly another research group used the mixture 45 and 35 v v of produced water and sewage and treated it using sbr sequence batch reactor and acclimated sewage sludge the results showed that the cod removal was in a range between 30 and 50 152 in addition they also noted that the salinity does not seem to affect the treatment efficiency however due to the recalcitrant feature of produced water the efficiency of biological treatment is generally low 152 according to fakhru l razi et al 29 this treatment process can remove trace and suspended solids in addition to the removal of metals moreover activated sludge is considered as cheap clean and simple treatment technology but it requires oxygen large filter dimensions and it produces sludge as waste after the treatment process is over it normally requires post treatment for the separation of precipitated solids biomass and dissolved gases 3 3 2 biological aerated filters baf baf system is consisting of media that is permeable and have diameter of 4 in that prohibit pore spaces clog when sloughing happens this class of biological technologies works under aerobic conditions to remove organics from polluted water and assist the biochemical oxidation process furthermore for the complete usage of the filter bed upstream and downstream sedimentation are required 2 baf treatment process was used for the removal of various pollutants from produced water and is considered most effective with produced water containing 6600 mg l chloride 153 it was found that baf can achieve removal efficiencies of 70 80 60 95 and 85 for nitrogen oil cod bod and ss respectively 153 moreover since the generated waste is removed in the form of solid baf has nearly 100 water recovery therefore there is a requirement for solid disposal of the sludge accumulated in the sedimentation basins that accounts for almost 40 of the total cost of this treatment process which is considered as the main drawback of this technology on the other hand there are various advantages such as it does not require post treatment can easily be adapted for wide range of water quantity and quality requires little maintenance does not require use of any chemicals and it is expected to have long life cycle furthermore according to mohan et al 154 salinity and c n ratio could hugely affect wastewater treatment process as denitrification and accumulation of nitrate will increase with the increase in the c n ratio but decrease with increase in salinity thus maintaining specific salinity levels is very important which can be done by proper wastewater homogenization with the batch reactor at the inlet similarly nitrogen removal from the municipal wastewater in the biological aerated filtration baf system is highly affected by the c n ratio 155 156 nitrogen removal efficiency could be affected by the hydraulic retention time in which the removal efficiency increased to 95 96 when different hydraulic retention time was used 156 the baf system was proven the best technique for nitrogen removal from wastewater in which the denitrification performance under total cod and tkn ratio of 3 6 gave the best results 155 156 in addition removal efficiency of cod ammonium and tn reached 83 7 93 1 and 84 6 respectively when the cod n ratio was 5 and a dramatic reduction in the system s performance occurred when the cod n ratio decreased 155 on the other hand raceway pond and photobioreactors are usually used in processes that are based on the use of microalgae 157 operational systems and microorganisms inoculation affect the removal efficiency of pollutants from produced water 158 3 3 3 innovative microbial capacitive desalination cell mcdc treatment process microbial desalination cell mdc is a recent and new technology that was developed from the traditional technology of microbial fuel cell mfc process that generates an electrical current ensure desalination of water and treats wastewater the development method of mdc from mfc was achieved through the construction of a reactor by installing a desalination chamber in between the cathode and the anode chambers 159 furthermore mcdc is derived from the mdc design with the integration of capacitive deionization cdi into the design of the mdc in which it prevents the transport of salts into the anode and the cathode because it uses porous electrodes that sorb ions electrically 160 the advantage of mcdc over the traditional mdc is that it can overcome the ph changes and imbalance by utilizing two cation exchange membranes cem instead of one as used in mdc allowing the protons to transfer freely across the system which in turn prevents the significant changes in ph stoll et al 149 conducted a study on the use of mcdc for the removal of salts organics from shale gas produced water and the efficiency of the desalination of mcdc was estimated based on the removal of ions in the cathode anode and desalination chambers this study was conducted to proof the demonstrated concept that the biodegradable organic matter constituents of the shale gas produced water are sufficient for running the mcdc generating an electrical potential for desalination of 0 25 0 28 v the dissolved organic carbon doc and aromatic compounds were removed from the anode chamber through biodegradation and sorption in addition a consistent potential was successfully generated by the microbial community throughout the experiment moreover salt was removed effectively from the desalination chamber through electro sorption with removal percentage ranging between 64 and 70 with sorption capacity 5 18 times greater than the conventional cdi which utilize activated carbon as electrodes 161 furthermore mcdc have salt removal rate that is 1 1 12 times higher than the traditional mdc system due to the additional sorption capacities with the advantage of keeping salts out of the cathode and anode chambers by preventing its transportation and accumulation 162 the sequential operation of mcdc is required for the removal of salts and organics so it can meet the quality standards for the reuse of produced water 149 in addition mcdc can also be used as pretreatment for the partial degradation of organics and to desalinate water in order to reduce membrane fouling and scaling however this treatment technology requires more research for better understanding of the long term negative effects of highly saline produced water and its contaminants on membranes assemblies of the electrodes microbial communities and the overall performance which in turn will assist in optimizing the reactor for the desalination and treatment of produced water as well as in power generation it is also crucial to determine the factors affecting the regeneration process of mcdc in which optimizing the regeneration before implementing mcdc on a large scale is a must 149 shrestha et al 163 compared the mcdc performance with microbial fuel cell mfc and found that mfc achieved higher reduction of cod 88 than mcdc 76 however mcdc was able to remove two times more dissolved solids than mfcs it was also noted that both techniques suffered from impedance due to fouling during the later operational stages 3 3 4 microalgae based treatment process currently eco technology is a new approach that has been introduced for the treatment processes of produced water in which higher removal rate of pollutants from produced water can be reached 164 therefore the use of microalgae based treatment as a sustainable solution for the treatment process is defined by these eco technology approaches generally bio remediation of produced water effluents can be done through using the microalgae due to their ability in utilizing certain pollutants as nutrient source 165 according to a study done by takacova et al 166 that btex can be utilized as a sole carbon source by specific microalgal species such as parachlorella kessler in another study water soluble fraction wsf gasoline was used to investigate its toxicity and it gives an important foundation for the effect of btex on the growth of microalgae 167 168 however 50 growth inhibition on cultures of microalgae is caused by increasing the concentration of btex with more contact time 169 heavier hydrocarbons have higher toxicity on microalgae growth 170 furthermore produced water generally contains sufficient concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus which sometimes act as growth limiting factors for microalgae 29 furthermore there are various trace elements other than nitrogen and phosphorus that are important for microalgal growth and they are also present in produced water thus growing microalgae in produced water has the potential to be used as efficient treatment process in which the microalgae biomass production is increased during treatment process furthermore cultivated microalgae biomass can be used as alternative feedstock for generation of energy 171 the microalgae strains used in different water treatments for pollutants bioremediation includes monoraphidium sp chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp 88 165 172 4 reuse of produced water since the demand and production of oil and gas is continuing to increase globally the environmental footprints associated with this production are increasing such as produced water furthermore as the scarcity of freshwater supply is increasing produced water can be a crucial source of water after suitable treatment there has been an increased attention on reclaiming reusing and recycling of water that is usually wasted to meet the communities needs of freshwater source 173 different standards for reuse of treated water have been provided based on intended purpose the us epa provides standards for reuse of treated water as drinking water 54 in addition standards for reuse in irrigation and for livestock has been provided by us department of agriculture natural resources conservation service 174 table 5 shows standards for water reuse based on different purposes as expected the standards for drinking water are more stringent and therefore more extensive treatment of produced water is needed there are several alternatives for utilization of produced water such as drinking water irrigation livestock watering habitat and wildlife watering fire control and industrial uses such as dust control oil field uses and power generation based on the characteristics of produced water discussed previously treatment of the produced water is required to meet the quality standards before re using it the treatment level or degree required depends on the application that it will be reused in for example minimal treatment regime is required for using produced water in oil and gas and industries as well as dust control on the other hand higher treatment level is required for uses such as drinking water and agriculture 176 furthermore cost efficiency is an important factor that determines the treatment regime and reuse option for example it was calculated that the produced water treatment with traditional techniques such as hydrocylcone gravity separation and media filters will yield treated water suitable for re injection at the cost of 0 509 m3 of water however for recycling of produced water advanced desalination technique like mechanical vapor compression mvc with other suitable technique will yield recyclable water at the cost of 3 808 m3 of water 177 4 1 livestock watering water quality consumed by livestock usually have lower standards than the quality of water for human consumption as the contaminant tolerance of livestock is better than humans however contaminants present in the water used by animals should be under certain limit to avoid negatively affecting their health 3 for instance water with 1000 mg l of tds can be used as a water source for livestock however it can affect the health of livestock by causing diarrhea if the value exceeds 7000 mg l 109 this idea was applied in some projects of cbm in which they established watering stations for livestock to utilize produce water as drinking water 3 4 2 habitat and wildlife watering produced water can be used after semi intensive treatment and ensuring its harmless nature to create artificial reservoir for providing drinking water source for wildlife as well as offering habitat for waterfowl and fishes these impoundments can collect and retain produced water in large volumes as they have large area of several acres 178 4 3 irrigation after the treatment of produced water and removal of all pollutants if the quality of treated water is meeting with certain standards and having low enough tds we can consider produced water as a valuable resource for irrigation of crops 178 reuse of produced water for irrigation especially in dry lands has been recommended and reviewed 179 due to high content of salts tds 35 472 000 mg l na 3 435 000 mg l its reuse for irrigation remains a challenge 179 the main challenges include sodicity salinity specific ion toxicity and alkalinity which are magnified because of the lower produced water quality therefore it is very crucial to consider the crop type when using produced water for irrigation 78 a research was done by sirivedhin et al 178 to treat the synthetic solutions with variable tds concentrations to mimic produced water using electrodialysis technique results showed that all 3 samples with low tds concentration meet the standards of both livestock watering and drinking water however they had higher sar values than the standard values for irrigation use but this problem can be solved by the addition of ca2 and or mg2 to these waters in small amounts in order to decrease their sar value and make them usable for irrigation on the other hand water samples with high tds concentrations did not meet the standards for reuse highlighted in table 5 therefore it can be concluded that electrodialysis under the experiment operating conditions is an inadequate process for reclaiming produced water to be used in these applications 4 4 algae production there are limited number of studies that reported the growth rate of algae productivity or biomass yield and lipid production by algal strains grown in produced water as nutrient medium however to date godfrey 180 conducted the most comprehensive study for using produced water as a medium to grow microalgae for the aim of producing lipid for biofuel conversion total of 8 microalgae strains were grown successfully in produced water and all produced neutral lipids amphora coffeiformis optimized its growth and lipid production with 150 mg l sodium nitrate and without the addition of phosphate while 300 mg l of sodium nitrate were added to optimize the growth and high lipid productivities of chaetoceros gracilis and chlorella sp moreover pretreatment of produced water for the removal of hydrocarbon through filtration by activated carbon centrifugation or settling can increase the growth and lipid productivity results also showed that there is a remarkably higher biodiesel productivity of strains grown on produced water as the lipid content reached 63 and 63 8 mg biodiesel l day thus it was concluded that replacement of growth media with produced water supplemented only with essential nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients is more environmentally and economically logical because similar lipid and biomass productivities can be achieved with lower cost without the requirement of freshwater 5 case studies produced water treatment and reuse 5 1 reuse of produced water for microalgae production qatar the produced water from one of the natural gas field in qatar was collected by the research team of al ghouti et al unpublished data and was used to investigate the removal of heavy metals using microalgae the produced water samples collected were first filtered using 0 45 ฮผm millipore filter to remove most of the suspended solids and other major pollutants table 6 the filtered water was then used to grow various species of microalgae to investigate their capabilities to remove heavy metals table 6 shows the ability of species to remove various metals from produced water as shown in table 7 100 removal efficiency of al zn and fe from produced water was achieved through microalgae while k had the lowest removal efficiency of 11 27 181 according to cai et al 182 toxicity of the produced water could increase with the increase in the concentration of these elements according to the results obtained in this research dictyosphaerium sp can recover more elements since it had better growth than other species our findings agreed with previous researches 183 184 which shows that dictyosphaerium sp has the ability to grow within metal rich water in this research among 14 metals were found to be present in the collected produced water almost half of them are considered as micronutrients such as k that plays an important role in various enzymatic reactions 185 along with k fe and cu have crucial role in the photosynthetic electron transport system 186 while zn is utilized by the microalgae through the transcription process of dna and uptake of phosphorus 187 on the other hand monteiro et al 188 mentioned that certain metals such as cd and cr could negatively affect the cell division and decrease the photosynthetic ability if present at high concentration according to millach et al 189 intensity of chlorophyll a in scenedesmus sp could significantly decrease if cr is available in concentration higher than 0 75 ppb unlike scenedesmus sp some species were found to tolerate higher concentrations of cr such as dictyosphaerium sp that can tolerate up to 13 17 mg l and chlorella pyrenoidosa that can tolerate up to 2 mg l 190 191 furthermore high biomass yield of scenedesmus sp dictyosphaerium sp and chlorella sp was observed in this study which can be attributed to the low cr concentration present in the tested produced water this case study shows that the produced water after minimal treatment can be used for microalgae production although microalgae can help to remove certain metals from the produced water nevertheless the effect of various constituents of produced water on the growth of microalgae needs to be investigated 5 2 reuse of produced water for internal reuse in gas industry china china possess the largest shale gas resources in the world with sichuan basin being the largest shale gas play 56 the volume of produced water generated from each well is approximately 20 000 m3 49 which is even higher than the volume generated in the us 192 however the tds values in this produced water 193 194 has been found to be lower than the shale plays in the us 76 195 196 due to the better quality of produced water and its higher volumes the feasibility to reuse this water within the industry was studied 197 the reuse of produced water within the industry such as for fracturing operations has been gaining more attention 198 because it can reduce both the volume of wastewater as well as consumption of freshwater resources hence the integrated treatment technique comprising coagulation followed by uf and nf was investigated for its suitability to meet the standards of reuse in this case study 197 two different types of coagulants i e aluminum sulfate octadecahydrate and ferric chloride hexahydrate were used the coagulated water was then pumped to the uf system the uf membrane used was of molecular weight cut off mwco 100 kda and was operated at a constant flux of 50 l m2 h with back washing for 5 min after every one hour the uf filtered water was then further treated with nf membrane at different pressures of 100 200 300 and 400 psi the nf system was operated at the water recovery of 50 70 and 85 thus the integrated coagulation uf nf treatment system reduced the turbidity by 99 9 cod by 94 2 and alkalinity by 94 1 the cations such as calcium magnesium barium and strontium were removed by 72 83 as shown in fig 3 when compared with the standards for reuse table 8 it was found that all the parameters of treated water obtained through integrated treatment system are much lower and therefore it can be reused within the industry 5 3 reuse of produced water for irrigation of biofuel crops usa the volume of produced water is among the highest in usa in the world it has been estimated that around 90 of the produced water is being injected back to the wells 200 201 however this practice of produced water re injection is being linked with the seismic activities and frequent earthquakes in texas as the area contains relatively larger number of injection wells 202 203 the growth rate of biofuel production is projected to increase 204 which is also water intensive process therefore the use of produced water for irrigation in the region can help to reduce the consumption of freshwater resources however the presence of hydrocarbons organic matters and high salt concentrations are the major parameters that need to be considered for reuse of produced water in irrigation thus in this case study the effect of produced water on biofuel crops was studied 205 the switchgrass and rapeseed were chosen as they can tolerate broad range of salinity ph and temperature conditions 206 207 the produced water from central processing facility in the denver julesburg basin was used that serves more than 500 wells and contains higher toc and tds concentrations both higher than 20 000 mg l the effect of salinity and organic matter concentrations were studied at highest and lowest concentrations to cover both worst and best case scenarios the produced water was treated with different techniques to achieve different quality of water as a control good quality reservoir water tds 310 mg l toc 3 3 mg l was used for irrigation designated as irrigation water a the best quality of treated water was obtained through treatment with coagulation and ultrafiltration followed by adsorption through granular activated carbon the effluent water was then diluted using tap water to obtain the tds of 400 mg l and toc of 3 mg l irrigation water b similarly the dilution was done to obtain another two qualities of water with both having tds of 3500 mg l but with different toc concentrations i e 65 100 mg l low toc and 215 235 mg l high designated as irrigation water c and d respectively furthermore the produced water was pre treated using hydrogen peroxide oxidation followed by coagulation and ultrafiltration to obtain treated water with both relatively higher tds 15 000 20 000 and toc 1500 mg l concentrations irrigation water e the aim of choosing different water qualities was to determine water with minimal quality and treatment required to obtain suitable biomass growth using produced water as expected the plant growth and subsequently biomass yield decreased for both biofuel crops switchgrass and rapeseed with decrease in water quality due to higher salinity and organic matter concentrations fig 4 the difference between the plant growth and biomass yield obtained with irrigation water having highest toc and tds was statistically significant as compared to the irrigation water with lower concentrations the quality of water was found to be significantly correlated with the accumulation of salts in soil samples the salinity of the water was found to be very important characteristic for the growth of perennial energy crops the physiological characteristics of crops i e biomass production on ground and underground were significantly affected by the irrigation water of toc of nearly 232 mg l when compared with the one having low toc of around 38 mg l thus higher concentrations of organic matter were shown to affect the el electrolyte leakage value of the leaf which confirmed that the crops are sensitivity to toc levels in produced water hence both the salinity and the organic matter are important characteristics of produced water which needs to be considered for their reuse in irrigation of biofuel crops it was concluded from this case study that the produced water should be treated enough to reduce the toc to 3500 mg l and to lower content of organic matter in order to consider its reuse for irrigation it was also concluded that the extent of treatment to reduce toc and the organic matter content is optimum from feasibility scalability and cost point of view this holds true for the treatment of produced water as one step or two step treatment methods are not considered enough to meet the reuse standards 208 209 since the production of produced water in oil and gas industry is an inherent problem more research is needed to develop techniques to reduce the volume of its production jafari et al 210 studied the ways to reduce the water production in oil and gas wells it was concluded that using newly designed equipment adopting production rates lesser than the critical rates and plugging wells can help to control the volumes and impacts of produced water 6 conclusion considering the shortage of fresh water resources and environmental problems caused by oil and gas industry produced water treatment and reuse are generating immediate attention the detailed literature review showed that the characteristics of produced water widely differs from location to location therefore the treatment technique needs to be evaluated for a particular source of produced water the cost of treatment and aim of reuse can also affect the choice of treatment technology in literature numerous techniques and combination of different techniques were found to be used for produced water treatment however practical demonstration of reuse of produced water for purposes such as for irrigation or microalgae growth and others is seldom reported in order to meet the rising water demands and to reduce the environmental impacts of oil and gas industry it is dire requirement now to promote the reuse of produced water its reuse will not only reduce the environmental impacts of the industry but also reduce the stress on fresh water resources this is particularly important for water stress countries where population and economic growth is continuing to increase stress on limited water resources of the region conflict of interest on behalf of all authors the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest 1 j m dickhout j moreno p m biesheuvel l boels r g h lammertink w m de vos produced water treatment by

in bio racks made up of discarded non perforated plastic water bottles in which plug flow was induced through baffling the performance of cbrws and modified brws mbrws was evaluated for the removal of dissolved organics carbon and nitrogen from domestic wastewater cbrws and mbrws were operated in sequential continuous 1 5 h 4 24 h in multiples of 4 hrt and mbrws in continuous 4 12 and 24 h hrt mode the systems were operated at organic loading rate olr of 0 25 3 kg cod m3 d the removal efficiency of mbrws was more than cbrws by 4 9 4 13 and 3 16 for cod bod3 and tkn respectively dissolved oxygen level was also increased by 0 6 1 mg l in mbrws at all hrts the contribution of baffling used to induce plugflow conditions in mbrws was found to be more significant than the use of multispecies vegetation for the removal of dissolved organics the study demonstrated potential of mbrws to maintain better aerobic conditions and treat wastewater at lower hrts keywords bio rack wetland constructed wetland cod removal decentralized treatment multispecies vegetation plug flow 1 introduction the major concerns of domestic wastewater management in developing countries include lack of sewerage system inadequate treatment facilities and need of an appropriate sustainable treatment sewerage and sewage treatment in a typical centralized treatment system require large mechanized infrastructure resulting in higher initial and recurring cost alternatively on site treatment decentralized wastewater treatment is a better option for developing countries particularly for isolated residential commercial institutional establishment s a typical on site treatment treats wastewater close to the source and can perform effectively by protecting human health and environment 1 the peculiar advantages attributed to decentralized systems are that they can be installed without requiring a huge budget especially at isolated locations or that they save money otherwise required for a sewerage network 2 septic tank followed by soakage pit is the most common decentralized primary treatment system adopted in india leachate from septic systems has been identified as a major potential source of groundwater contamination with some household chemicals as well as pathogens 3 commonly used decentralized wastewater treatments are anaerobic filters aerobic anaerobic or facultative lagoons sequential batch reactor and constructed wetland cw 4 cws have been used for the treatment of domestic wastewater because of simple operation use of locally available material and low cost however cws have not gained much popularity due to large land area requirement clogging of beds and need for capital investment 5 the principal parameter which affects clogging is suspended solids which accumulate in cw leading to a reduction in hydraulic conductivity and short circuting of flow horizontal subsurface flow cw shows a certain degree of ponding near the inlet which indicates rapid clogging of the granular medium 6 ponding later affects the oxygen supply in the wetland possibly leading to anaerobic or anoxic conditions in the overall system 7 because of these series of effects clogging may potentially results in failure of the treatment performance of the subsurface wetlands 8 solving the clogging problem is really expensive because it may require improvement in pretreatment installation of new primary treatment or dosing system and in extreme case replacement of the matrix 9 domestic wastewater treatment under specific influent conditions and seriously stressed with total dissolved solids and copper was examined by valipour et al 10 through laboratory scale phytoremediation process model typha sp was used as wetland vegetation and the process showed more stability and improved performance when compared with conventional wetland systems valipour et al 11 augumented the shallow pond water hyacinth system by adding a bio hedge mesh type support matrix to augment the indigenous microbial population and reported improved biofilm formation reduced footprint energy savings and good quality of effluent valipour and ahn 12 reviewed key issues in cw viz the role of plants media materials microorganisms and oxygen transfer the basic configurations of cws have been modified with the hybrid arrangement provision of baffles use of multispecies vegetation recirculation and use of different supporting media the conventional bio rack wetland system cbrws is one of the latest configuration in wetland technologies that was developed by valipour et al 5 to overcome the drawbacks of cw cbrws is the grid arrangement of racks having perforations for liquid transport in which plants are placed in the absence of any other supporting media this is a robust biological practice that can be applied to an efficient and reliable elimination of pollutants even under unfavorable influent conditions stressed by high total dissolved solids and heavy metal 5 13 the reported studies on cbrws include 5 14 15 for domestic wastewater treatment and 16 17 for treatment of low polluted river water all these studies have demonstrated the potential use of cbrws in wastewater treatment however the basic cbrws module referred as conventional brws in this study developed by 5 was used in all these studies there are no efforts reported published to date on modification s to cbrws the flow condition in cbrws is similar to that of horizontal flow subsurface cw further mono species of wetland vegetation were used in cbrws multi species vegetation provides better distribution of root matrix and a habitat of more diverse microbial populations and consequently better removal rates 18 the main component of cbrws mbrws is bio rack for holding the vegetation and 62 8 of the total brws cost 5 is associated with bio rack in this context there is a scope to develop low cost brws and enhance the performance of cbrws by incorporating baffling and multispecies vegetation in the system brws incorporated with baffles and multi species is referred as modified brws mbrws in this study it is hypothesized that the use of baffling will induce upflow and downflow movement of wastewater thereby developing plug flow conditions within mbrws in the present study low cost cbrws and mbrws were developed and the performance of these brws systems was assessed to remove dissolved organics for different hydraulic loading rate hlr organic loading rate olr and possible enhancement in dissolved oxygen do 2 materials and methods 2 1 domestic wastewater domestic wastewater generated from 1000 residents in walchand college of engineering sangli maharashtra india was collected from disposal site and used as influent to cbrws and mbrws the sources contributing to this wastewater included food establishments mess and canteen greywater and septic tank effluent from residences and hostels the wastewater was pumped to settling tanks of brws during 9 a m 11 a m on the day s of system operation the characteristics of settled wastewater which was fed to brws were analyzed to check its suitability for biological treatment the characteristics are summarized in table 1 it can be seen that bod3 cod ratio of wastewater is in the range of 0 56 0 62 this indicates amenability of settled wastewater for biological treatment 2 2 experimental brws figs 1 and 2 show schematic sketch and photographic view of cbrws and mbrws provided with settling tank respectively the systems were developed and operated during october 2017 june 2018 the observed temperature during this period was noted to be 29 5 c 14 3 c october 17 february 18 and 37 5 c 22 7 c march 18 june 18 200 l settling tank with an average residence time of 2 h was provided for each brws as a pretreatment to remove coarser suspended solids cbrws and mbrws were made up of 0 60 m diameter and 170 l plastic tank planted with multispecies vegetation the locally available canna indica and typha angustata were chosen as these were well proven as wetland vegetation 19 23 15 surviving growing and multiplying in saturated conditions and capable of releasing the dissolved oxygen through roots canna indica and typha angustata were collected from a local wastewater stream acclimatization of vegetation was done through series of exposures from freshwater to sewage before initial plantation in each brws system an average void volume of 60 was observed in both these brws it was conceptualized that the roots of i canna indica will be 0 30 m deep and aerate upper portion of reactor and ii typha angustata will be 0 60 m deep and aerate bottom portion of the reactor in order to validate these three plants each of canna indica and typha angustata with the same initial depth of roots were separately vegetated in two 0 7 m deep bio racks and monitored for the growth of roots 2 2 1 cbrws conventional bio rack wetland system bio racks in cbrws were perforated throughout the surface to enable uniform flow across the cross section there were 43 bio racks in the system and each bio rack of 0 08 m diameter has an effective depth of 0 60 m the settled wastewater was fed into cbrws through inlet at the bottom and effluent was collected from outlet provided at the top the upward movement of wastewater from inlet to outlet was through the perforations in bio racks an average length l of wastewater flow through cbrws was 0 6 m and the corresponding width w available for flow was 0 60 m the flow condition maintained in cbrws was not plug flow as l w ratio was 1 0 the occupied surface area on inside of bio racks was 6 48 m2 with specific surface area of bio racks being 50 m2 m3 and 38 22 m2 m3 of effective volume and filled volume respectively initially 60 30 each of canna indica and typha angustata acclimatized plants were vegetated 2 2 2 mbrws modified bio rack wetland system mbrws consisted of four vertical layers of concentric bio racks as shown in fig 2 and other details of the system are given in table 2 bio racks in mbrws were not perforated throughout the surface the top bottom 5 cm was perforated to enable wastewater flow to enter exit from each layer of bio rack the direction of wastewater flow in mbrws is also indicated in fig 2 the settled wastewater was fed through an inlet provided at the top into first layer of bio rack and it flowed out of the mbrws by series of upward downward and upward movement through 2nd 3rd and 4th layers of bio rack respectively typically the total length l of wastewater flow through mbrws was 2 60 m and the corresponding width available for flow w was 0 10 m plug flow conditions were induced in mbrws as l w ratio is 26 24 the occupied surface area on inside of bio racks was 5 21 m2 with a specific surface area of bio racks 40 85 m2 m3 and 30 71 m2 m3 of effective volume and filled volume respectively 2 2 3 bio racks used in brws and cost analysis in both the systems cbrws and mbrws bio racks were made up of discarded plastic water bottles three of such bottles were joined to form one bio rack unit in all the reported literature bio racks used in brws were new plastic pvc pipes the use of discarded plastic water bottles reduced cost of the system significantly cost of 0 10 m diameter pvc pipe is rs 90 m and rs 54 rack of 0 60 m length cost of plastic bottle rs 3 bottle and rs 9 rack of 0 60 m length thus there is a reduction of bio rack cost by 83 33 further all racks were found to be intact and in good shape at the end of present study indicating that they are sturdy and suitable for adoption in brws the cost analysis is given in table 3 2 3 operation of brws and experimental procedure the development of an acclimatized and vegetated plant roots was monitored within separate bio racks used for the validation study initially 90 d were required for the proper development of roots simultaneously cbrws and mbrws were also vegetated with acclimatized plants performance evaluation study was conducted for desired operational conditions after proper development of roots then both systems were subjected to sequential continuous mode of operation for 90 d and mbrws was studied further for 60 d continuous mode of operation in sequential continuous mode of operation both systems were fed continuously for a period equal to hydraulic residence time hrt followed by an intermittent idle resting period of 2 h with no flow in continuous mode mbrws was fed with settled wastewater continuously for the required conditions of operation the operational conditions hrt and olr used in the study are given in table 4 and the timeline for these operational conditions is shown in fig 3 the stated conditions were maintained in respective brws for a week then the systems were monitored by sampling and analyzing influent and effluent quality of every cycle for applied condition the desired hrt was maintained by flow regulation through valve throttling experiments were conducted on both systems cbrws and mbrws to assess their performance for the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn also influent and effluent from these systems were analyzed for assessing change in do the composite sampling hourly samples of effluent was adopted for each operational condition the samples were analyzed for ph tss cod bod3 tkn and do following procedures of apha 25 bod sensor system hach was used to measure bod3 of samples do of effluent samples collected were measured with winkler s iodometric method by fixing do at site 3 results and discussion 3 1 cbrws and mbrws operated in sequential continuous operation 3 1 1 cod and bod3 removal and do enhancement figs 4 and 5 show average cod and bod3 removal for varied hrt respectively influent cod and bod3 were varied in the range 234 316 mg l and 131 177 mg l during the study period respectively it can be seen that performance of mbrws for cod and bod3 removal was improved by 4 9 and 4 13 respectively for all hrts when compared with cbrws the increase in removal efficiency is attributed to plug flow conditions induced within mbrws plug flow provides relatively good ideal flow conditions within mbrws and thereby increases effective hrt by minimizing short circuiting effect fountoulakis et al 26 reported that low hrt is expected to decrease the efficiency and higher hrt increases efficiency of contaminants removal further the length of wastewater flow following series of upflow and downflow movement within in mbrws from inlet to outlet was longer than that in cbrws this has resulted in more contact of dissolved organics with the root surface and thereby more exposure to aerobic conditions around the roots in mbrws the bacterial population forms a slimy layer on the surface of bio rack functioning like attached growth system and demonstrates a single system having advantages of attached growth system and phytoremediation process 5 this additional contact is not only with the roots but resulted in more contact with bio rack as well the higher bod3 removal rates at relatively lower optimum hrt 8 12 h were observed in mbrws hrt for effective removal is also observed to be 8 12 h in cbrws these results can be validated by referring to fig 6 wherein do measurements in mbrws are shown it can also be seen from the results that do is increasing with increase in hrt the amount of do present in mbrws is more than cbrws by an extent of 0 6 1 mg l the contribution by atmospheric aeration to do in brws is less since the dense plant cover reduces surface gas exchange 15 hence do contribution is significantly by release of oxygen from the roots thus racks of brws provide a habitat for aerobic microorganisms do in both systems was due to the presence of integrated root matrix of vegetation canna indica and typha angustata do of 1 5 mg l is desirable for sustaining aerobic activity in the system 27 results obtained also indicated that better aerobic conditions prevailed in mbrws when operated at hrt of 12 h and more 3 1 2 tkn removal fig 7 shows variation of average tkn and its removal with hrt the results show that the performance of mbrws is better than cbrws by 3 16 the performance of mbrws was observed to be better than cbrws for the same hrt due to the presence of higher do further increase in hrt lead to greater oxygenation rate in mbrws because of relatively ideal plug flow conditions inside which resulted in higher nitrification in lesser hrt than cbrws the mechanism for tkn removal processes is nitrification and nitrogen accumulation in the system 28 the oxygen leakage from roots creates oxidized conditions in the otherwise anoxic substrate and stimulates both aerobic decomposition of organic matter and growth of nitrifying bacteria ammonia is oxidized to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria in aerobic zones the oxygen required to sustain nitrification is provided by release of oxygen at roots do level was above 1 5 mg l for hrt of 12 h and above for mbrws plant uptake refers to a biological process that converts inorganic nitrogen to organic nitrogen which is then used for energy and cell growth 29 however the amount of nitrogen removed by plant uptake is not measured in this study the performance evaluation study for organic matter carbon and tkn removal shows that the contribution of baffling to induce the plug flow conditions in mbrws is more significant than the use of multispecies vegetation this is due to the fact that even though the specific surface area available for multispecies vegetation in cbrws is more than that of mbrws the removal efficiencies are lower in cbrws the distinguishing feature between cbrws and mbrws is flow condition within systems whereas the other operational conditions were same thus baffling plays a more dominant role than vegetation 3 2 removal of total suspended solids tss fig 8 shows tss removal in cbrws and mbrws and its variation with hrt it can be seen that the extent of removal is 50 90 in both systems there is insignificant change in tss removal beyond hrt of 8 h for both systems the mechanisms include filtration through root matrix settling chance contact and interception filtration and interception by vegetation seem to contribute significantly to tss removal this is due to the fact that settleable solids were removed in settling tank relatively finer tss forms a major constituent in influent to cbrws and mbrws both systems were regularly flushed drained to remove sludge 3 3 effect of hlr and olr on cod removal fig 9 shows the effect of hlr and olr on cod removal the results show that there is a decrease in cod removal efficiency when hlr increases the higher hlr can be applied in mbrws to achieve the same degree of cod removal when compared to cbrws similarly increase in olr has resulted in a reduction in cod removal efficiency olr of 0 53 kg cod m3 d has resulted in more than 60 cod removal in mbrws thus mbrws system reduces the area requirement hrt of 12 h which corresponds to hlr of 1 13 m d and olr of 0 445 kg cod m3 d was found to be adequate for maintaining do level of 1 5 mg l the effluent concentration corresponding to 12 h hrt for cod bod3 tkn and tss from mbrws was 100 10 mg l 62 10 mg l 23 6 5 mg l and 21 5 mg l respectively the effluent concentrations meet the requirements of land irrigation however an additional treatment is required for reducing bod3 below 30 mg l for the discharge of effluent in inland surface water 3 4 mbrws operated in continuous mode a study was conducted to assess the effect of sequential continuous and continuous modes of operation using mbrws for cod removal mbrws was continuously operated for 8 d for hrt of 4 12 and 24 h the results of study are shown in fig 10 there is an insignificant difference for cod removal between two operational modes 3 5 vegetation growth in brws the results of root growth for three plants each of canna indica and typha angustata which were vegetated for validation are shown in fig 11 it can be seen that root growth of typha angustata is higher than that of canna indica the roots did grow to 2 3rd of their maximum depth within three months 0 60 m deep rack was found to be adequate to accommodate major portion of root further cbrws and mbrws were also studied for the development of roots and new shoots within the bio racks at the end of the study fig 12 shows typically developed root matrix of canna indica and typha angustata within bio racks a well developed root matrix was observed in both brws however the roots in cbrws were observed to be longitudinally and laterally spread within and outside bio racks due to perforations which can be seen in fig 12 b the root matrix occupied an entire space within bio racks of both systems and thereby providing the larger surface area for growth of attached bacteria these results indicate that canna indica and typha angustata which were used for multispecies vegetation provided dense matrix it was observed that the vegetation growth in terms of number of new shoots was 128 and 148 in cbrws and mbrws respectively from an initial number of 60 shoots the harvesting of vegetation was not done during the study period 3 6 comparison of mbrws with other systems the comparative performance of mbrws with other systems cw bio rack is given in table 5 the results of present study differ with others due to different conditions such hrt hlr and olr the results of present study are significant as they are observed at high hlr and low hrt conditions 4 conclusions cbrws and mbrws were developed for treatment of domestic wastewater and study was conducted to assess cod bod3 and nitrogen tkn removal by varying hrt hlr and olr mbrws included multispecies vegetation and induced with plug flow pattern this has resulted in higher cod bod3 and tkn removal by 4 9 4 13 and 3 16 respectively as compared to cbrws there was a significant increase in do level in both brws for hrt of 8 h and above do concentration in the effluent of mbrws was higher than cbrws by 0 6 1 mg l cod removal was significantly affected by hlr and olr mbrws can be operated with higher olr and hlr as compared to cbrws to achieve same cod removal efficiency mbrws was found to enhance organic carbon and nitrogen matter removal for both sequential continuous and continuous operations acknowledgements the present study is a part of research project sanctioned by department of science and technology dst under water treatment initiative wti programme the authors sincerely acknowledge and thank dst for providing financial support to undertake this study

separately vegetated in two 0 7 m deep bio racks and monitored for the growth of roots 2 2 1 cbrws conventional bio rack wetland system bio racks in cbrws were perforated throughout the surface to

through inlet at the bottom and effluent was collected from outlet provided at the top the upward movement of wastewater from inlet to outlet was through the perforations in bio racks an average length l of wastewater flow through cbrws was 0 6 m and the corresponding width w available for flow was 0 60 m the flow condition maintained in cbrws was not plug flow as l w ratio was 1 0 the

varied hrt respectively influent cod and bod3 were varied in the range 234 316 mg l and 131 177 mg l during the study period respectively it can be seen that performance of mbrws for cod and bod3 removal was improved by 4 9 and 4 13 respectively for all hrts when compared with cbrws the increase in removal efficiency is attributed to plug flow conditions induced within mbrws plug flow provides relatively good ideal flow conditions within mbrws and thereby increases effective hrt by minimizing short circuiting effect fountoulakis et al 26 reported that low hrt is expected to decrease the

longer than that in cbrws this has resulted in more contact of dissolved organics with the root surface and thereby more exposure to aerobic conditions around the roots in mbrws the bacterial population forms a slimy layer on the surface of bio rack functioning like attached growth system and demonstrates a single system having advantages of attached growth system and phytoremediation process 5 this additional contact is not only with the roots but resulted in more contact with bio rack as well the higher bod3 removal rates at relatively lower optimum hrt 8 12 h were observed in mbrws hrt for effective removal is also observed to be 8 12 h in cbrws these results can be validated by referring to fig 6 wherein do measurements in mbrws are shown it can also be seen from the results that do is increasing with increase in hrt the amount of do present in mbrws is more than cbrws by an extent of 0 6 1 mg l the contribution by atmospheric aeration to do in brws is less since the dense plant cover reduces surface gas exchange 15 hence do contribution is significantly by release of oxygen from the roots thus racks of brws provide a habitat for aerobic microorganisms do in both systems was due to the presence of integrated root matrix of vegetation canna indica and typha angustata do of 1 5 mg l is desirable for sustaining aerobic activity in the system 27 results obtained also indicated that better aerobic conditions prevailed in mbrws when operated at hrt of 12 h and more 3 1 2 tkn removal fig 7 shows variation of average tkn and its removal with hrt the results show that the performance of mbrws is better than cbrws by 3 16 the performance of mbrws was observed to be better than cbrws for the same hrt due to the presence of higher do further increase in hrt lead to greater oxygenation rate in mbrws because of relatively ideal plug flow conditions inside which resulted in higher nitrification in lesser hrt than cbrws the mechanism for tkn removal processes is nitrification and nitrogen accumulation in the system 28 the oxygen leakage from roots creates oxidized conditions in the otherwise anoxic substrate and stimulates both aerobic decomposition of organic matter and growth of nitrifying bacteria ammonia is oxidized to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria in aerobic zones the oxygen required to sustain nitrification is provided by release of oxygen at roots do level was above 1 5 mg l for hrt of 12 h and above for mbrws plant uptake refers to a biological process that converts inorganic nitrogen to organic nitrogen which is then used for energy and cell growth 29 however the amount of nitrogen removed by plant uptake is not measured in this study the performance evaluation study for organic matter carbon and tkn removal shows that the contribution of baffling to induce the plug flow conditions in mbrws is more significant than the use of multispecies vegetation this is due to the fact that even though the specific surface area available for multispecies vegetation in cbrws is more than that of mbrws the removal efficiencies are lower in cbrws the distinguishing feature between cbrws and mbrws is flow condition within systems whereas the other operational conditions were same thus baffling plays a more dominant role than vegetation 3 2 removal of total suspended solids tss fig 8 shows tss removal in cbrws and mbrws and its variation with hrt it can be seen that the extent of removal is 50 90 in both systems there is insignificant change in tss removal beyond hrt of 8 h for both systems the mechanisms include filtration through root matrix settling chance contact and interception filtration and interception by vegetation seem to contribute significantly to tss removal this is due to the fact that settleable solids were removed in settling tank relatively finer tss forms a major constituent in influent to cbrws and mbrws both systems were regularly flushed drained to remove sludge 3 3 effect of hlr and olr on cod removal fig 9 shows the effect of hlr and olr on cod removal the results show that there is a decrease in cod removal efficiency when hlr increases the higher hlr can be applied in mbrws to achieve the same degree of cod removal when compared to cbrws similarly increase in olr has resulted in a reduction in cod removal efficiency olr of 0 53 kg cod m3 d has resulted in more than 60 cod removal in mbrws thus mbrws system reduces the area requirement hrt of 12 h which corresponds to hlr of 1 13 m d and olr of 0 445 kg cod m3 d was found to be adequate for maintaining do level of 1 5 mg l the effluent concentration corresponding to 12 h hrt for cod bod3 tkn and tss from mbrws was 100 10 mg l 62 10 mg l 23 6 5 mg l and 21 5 mg l respectively the effluent concentrations meet the requirements of land irrigation however an additional treatment is required for reducing bod3 below 30 mg l for the discharge of effluent in inland surface water 3 4 mbrws operated in continuous mode a study was conducted to assess the effect of sequential continuous and continuous modes of operation using mbrws for cod removal mbrws was continuously operated for 8 d for hrt of 4 12 and 24 h the results of study are shown in fig 10 there is an insignificant difference for cod removal between two operational modes 3 5 vegetation growth in brws the results of root growth for three plants each of canna indica and typha angustata which were vegetated for validation are shown in fig 11 it can be seen that root growth of typha angustata is higher than that of canna indica the roots did grow to 2 3rd of their maximum depth within three months 0 60 m deep rack was found to be adequate to accommodate major portion of root further cbrws and mbrws were also studied for the development of roots and new shoots within the bio racks at the end of the study fig 12 shows typically developed root matrix of canna indica and typha angustata within bio racks a well developed root matrix was observed in both brws however the roots in cbrws were observed to be longitudinally and laterally spread within and outside bio racks due to perforations which can be seen in fig 12 b the root matrix occupied an entire space within bio racks of both systems and thereby providing the larger surface area for growth of attached bacteria these results indicate that canna indica and typha angustata which were used for multispecies vegetation provided dense matrix it was observed that the vegetation growth in terms of number of new shoots was 128 and 148 in cbrws and mbrws respectively from an initial number of 60 shoots the harvesting of vegetation was not done during the study period 3 6 comparison of mbrws with other systems the comparative performance of mbrws with other systems cw bio rack is given in table 5 the results of present study differ with others due to different conditions such hrt hlr and olr the results of present study are significant as they are observed at high hlr and low hrt conditions 4 conclusions cbrws and mbrws were developed for treatment of domestic wastewater and study was conducted to assess cod bod3 and nitrogen tkn removal by varying hrt hlr and olr mbrws included multispecies vegetation and induced with plug flow pattern this has resulted in higher cod bod3 and tkn removal by 4 9 4 13 and 3 16 respectively as compared to cbrws there was a significant increase in do level in both brws for hrt of 8 h and above do concentration in the effluent of mbrws was higher than cbrws by 0 6 1 mg l cod removal was significantly affected by hlr and olr mbrws can be operated with higher olr and hlr as compared to cbrws to achieve same cod removal efficiency mbrws was found to enhance organic carbon and nitrogen matter removal for both sequential

14449,in this study two parallel aerobic mbrs were operated with different aeration diffusers coarse bubble aeration vs fine bubble aeration it was found that fine bubble aeration would cause serious foaming in the mbr system the specific filtration resistance sfr of non foaming sludge was similar to that of the sludge suspension in the foaming mbr but almost 2 3 times larger than that of the foaming sludge liquor from the top layer of the foaming mbr the intermediate pore blocking was the dominant fouling mechanism in batch filtration tests the filtration performance of the sludge mixtures was governed by the combined effect of several major factors there were more smaller flocs less soluble microbial products smp and less bound extracellular polymeric substances epss in the foaming sludge samples interfacial interaction calculation showed that the foaming sludge had a weaker adhesion ability comparison of foaming sludge and overflow foaming sludge revealed that the degree of foaming could affect the filtration behavior and physicochemical properties of the foaming sludge the findings regarding the combined effect of aeration bubble size on foaming and fouling gave some implications for foaming and fouling control since fine bubble aeration was detrimental for foaming control but beneficial for fouling mitigation the selection of the optimal aeration intensity and diffuser would be a potentially effective strategy for the membrane fouling and foaming control in the mbr system keywords foaming membrane bioreactor fine bubble aeration sludge properties filtration resistance 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr is a promising alternative for wastewater treatment and reclamation because of its excellent performance and distinctive advantages including higher effluent quality lower sludge production higher volumetric loading smaller footprint improved process flexibility etc over conventional activated sludge processes cas 1 3 although mbr is an advanced wastewater treatment system it is still not exempt from some operational problems such as membrane fouling and foaming 4 8 generally membrane fouling is considered as the primary obstacle for the widespread application of mbr because it will lead to the reduction of membrane permeability and the increase in operating cost the formation of membrane fouling is mainly attributed to the undesirable deposition and accumulation of organic inorganic and biological particles on the membrane surface four groups of factors including membrane materials feed characteristics operation conditions and sludge mixture characteristics are considered as the major influence factors for membrane fouling in mbrs 9 10 for a given mbr system in additional to the sludge characteristics i e viscosity extracellular polymeric substances epss and soluble microbial products smp and hydrodynamic conditions membrane fouling is also affected by operation conditions i e sludge retention time srt hydraulic retention time hrt and aeration 11 13 therefore numerous studies have been conducted to find effective and affordable strategies for membrane fouling control 14 16 nevertheless membrane fouling is still an open challenge for mbr technology and requires further studies 4 as compared with membrane fouling foaming is not a key problem for mbr operation and therefore very few studies were conducted to explore the foaming problem in mbrs however serious foaming can cause a reduction in mbr performance and loss of sludge solids in case of overflow therefore many efforts have been devoted to investigating the main causes of foaming in mbr systems in recent years some studies reported that the potential foam forming organisms such as filamentous bacteria are the main contributor to foaming in mbr process 17 18 this phenomenon is similar to that in the cas process 19 21 however the formation of foam in the absence of foam forming microorganisms has also been observed and epss were considered as the primary factor for foaming in this situation 4 5 22 these conflicting results indicated that the formation of foam in mbr system is more complex than that in the cas process and thus deserves further investigation in fact foam formation generally involves two factors the dispersion of gas in the liquid and the presence of potential foaming substances synthetic surfactants and hydrophobic compounds such as epss 23 generally fine bubble aeration condition and high concentration of hydrophobic substances can promote the formation of foam it has been reported that fine bubble gas mixing would cause a high level of foam accumulation 24 in addition it was also found that bound epss concentration was well correlating with the foaming formation in mbrs 4 5 25 it is worthwhile to note that aeration and bound epss also play a significant role in membrane fouling 26 28 the smaller bubble aeration was reported to be better for fouling control than the larger bubble aeration even though it can generate stronger shear stress on the membrane surface 10 29 moreover a higher epss concentration was usually considered to cause more severe membrane fouling 30 31 bearing in mind what discussed above it can be speculated that a potential correlation may exist between fouling and foaming however most of the current studies regarding the foaming problem in mbrs focus only on the role of epss 4 5 25 however there is a lack of investigation on the role of aeration in foaming the effect of aeration related foaming on sludge properties and the correlation between aeration related foaming and fouling therefore this study compared the characteristics of the foaming and non foaming sludge related to aeration and then developed new insights on the potential relationship between the aeration related foaming and fouling such a study would help us understand the effect of aeration bubble size on foaming formation the property differences between foaming and non foaming sludge and provide new insights into the selection of optimum aeration conditions for foaming and fouling control 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and sample collection the foaming and non foaming sludge samples were collected from two parallel and identical aerobic mbrs koch hollow fiber mbr systems usa operated at a mining site in ontario canada for on site domestic wastewater treatment fig 1 shows the schematic of the two identical mbr apparatus and the positions of the four sampling points according to the sampling position the four sludge samples were named as mbr1 bulk sludge sludge suspension from the foaming mbr mbr2 bulk sludge sludge suspension from the normal mbr of overflow foaming sludge and fs foaming sludge from foaming layer in the foaming mbr respectively the total bioreactor volume and treatment capacity for each mbr system is approximately 100 m3 and 150 m3 wastewater day respectively koch hollow fiber membranes were selected by the company these two reactors were operated with the same feed and operation conditions however the aeration comb in mbr2 was broken and therefore the bubbles in mbr2 were coarse while in mbr1 were fine that is only the air bubbles were different in these two reactors considering the proprietary nature of the commercial mbr plants other detailed design and operating conditions of the two identical mbr plants cannot be reported all sludge samples were stored at 4 c immediately after shipped in a cooler to lakehead university 2 2 evaluation of specific filtration resistance the specific filtration resistance sfr of the four sludge suspensions was determined by the dead end batch filtration tests with a stirred cell model 8200 amicon the membrane

nitrogen and the production of permeate was recorded by using a digital balance prior to the tests the membrane was compacted with 30 kpa pressure for 20 min until the flux of the deionized di water

blocking models according to the blocking mechanism the fouling can be classified into complete blocking eq 2 internal pore blocking eq 3 intermediate blocking eq 4 and cake formation eq 5 33 34 2 l n

respectively by plotting the filtration flux to filtration time the fitness of the above four models to the filtration data can be assessed and then the major cause of membrane fouling during filtration process can be evaluated in this study the adequacy of the above four models was judged in terms of the value of regression coefficient r2 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 eps extraction and measurement the extraction of loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps was based on a modified heat extraction method adopted by yang and li 35 50 ml of sludge mixture was taken and centrifuged iec multirf thermo iec needham heights ma usa at 18 700 g for 5 min at 4 c the sludge pellets were resuspended to their original volume in 0 05 nacl w v warm solution at 50 c and then immediately mixed by an analog vortex mixer fisher scientific usa for 1 min the sludge suspension was centrifuged at 18 700 g for 10 min at 4 c and the supernatant obtained was regarded as lb eps of the sludge mass the sludge pellets were then resuspended again by using 0 05 nacl w v solution the sludge mixture was heated in a water bath for 30 min at 60 c and then centrifuged at 18 700 g for 15 min at 4 c the supernatant collected was regarded as tb eps both the lb eps and tb eps were normalized as the sum of protein pn and carbohydrates ch which were measured colorimetrically by using the anthrone reagent and folin reagent method respectively bovine serum albumin bsa and glucose were used as the protein and carbohydrate standard respectively 2 4 2 smp measurement smp soluble microbial products sample was harvested from sludge mixture by centrifugation iec multirf thermo iec needham heights ma usa at 18 700 g for 20 min at 4 c and a successive filtration through a 0 45 ฮผm membrane the total smp was determined as the sum of the concentrations of pn and ch determinations of pn and ch of smp were the same as described above 2 4 3 particle size distribution psd a malvern mastersizer 2000 instrument worcestershire uk with a detection range of 0 02 2000 ฮผm was applied to measure the particle size distribution psd of the sludge suspension samples the scattered light is detected by a multi element detector which converts the signal to a size distribution based on volume each sample was measured in triplicate 2 4 4 optical microscope observation the microstructure of the sludge samples was observed by an optical microscope olympus ch 2 japan all of the sludge samples were dropped on the slides and then dispersed by a cover slide thereafter the prepared samples were placed on the stage of the microscope and at least 10 images were randomly taken by a digital camera connected with the microscope for each sample 2 4 5 contact angle measurement the contact angles of the virgin membrane the same as the membrane used for sfr measurement and sludge samples were measured by using an optical tensiometer theta lite biolin scientific finland in this study ultrapure water glycerol and diiodomethane were selected as the probe liquids for the contact angle measurement 2 4 6 zeta potential measurement zeta potential of the four sludge samples was measured via a zetapals zeta potential analyzer brookhevan usa using phase analysis light scattering 0 01 mol l nacl solution was applied to provide the background electrolyte the zeta potential of the membrane surface was measured by a zeta 90 plus particle size analyzer brookhaven instruments uk 2 4 7 statistical analysis all the results of assays were expressed as mean standard deviation statistical analysis was carried out using the spss 17 0 software an analysis of variance anova was used to test the differences between the sludge properties and fouling rate and p 0 05 was considered to be significant 2 5 xdlvo approach the particle substrate interfacial interactions in aqueous media are generally quantitatively described by the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek

was broken the effluent quality of the two mbrs was similar the concentration of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand bod in the effluents was mostly less than 2 mg l corresponding to over 95 removal rate the only problem encountered was the foaming in mbr1 which led to the overflow and loss of activated sludge due to the proprietary nature of the commercial mbr plants the detailed information about membrane fouling was not provided therefore the dead end batch filtration tests were conducted by a stirred cell to assess the fouling behaviors of the four sludge samples fig 2 shows the sfrs of foaming and non foaming sludges from four sampling points of the mbrs ranging from the highest filtration resistance the sfrs of the four samples were mbr2 bulk sludge mbr1 bulk sludge of fs the sfr of mbr2 bulk sludge was 7 02 1013 m kg which was only slightly higher than that of mbr1 bulk sludge 6 70 1013 m kg however the sfrs of mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge were almost 2 and 3 times greater than that of the of 3 34 1013 m kg and fs 2 13 1013 m kg respectively it should be noted that the sludge samples of mbr1 bulk sludge of and fs were all originating from the problematic reactor mbr1 the similar sfr between mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge indicated that the mixed liquor from both foaming and non foaming mbrs had little effect on the filtration behaviors of the sludge suspension under the foaming layer anova p 0 05 it is reasonable considering most of the problematic sludge with a high foaming capacity were accumulated on the top layer of the bioreactor the discrepancy in sfr between of and fs revealed that different degrees of foaming had some influences on the filtration performance of the sludge samples anova p 0 05 moreover the pronounced difference between sludge suspension mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge and foamed sludge of and fs indicated foaming had apparent effect on the filtration resistance of the sludge anova p 0 05 the different filtration behaviors suggested that their physicochemical properties were different because fouling behavior of sludge was directly controlled by sludge characteristics 10 therefore other characteristics of the foaming and non foaming sludge including particle blocking particle size distribution psd microscopic morphology filamentous bacteria smp and bound eps content contact angle and zeta potential were recorded and discussed as follows 3 2 fouling assessment fig 3 shows the fitting results of different pore blocking models for the four sludge samples it can be seen that all the four samples were basically fitting well for the four models r2 0 8016 that means the decline in the permeate flux were caused simultaneously by the four fouling mechanisms these results should be reasonable because the particle size of the sludge as well as the colloids was generally distributed in a wide range in the mbr system the adequacy of the fitted model was further judged according to the value of regression coefficient r2 it can be seen from fig 3 that the intermediate blocking model rather than cake formation model exhibited the highest values of r2 for all the four samples indicating the solute molecules with the similar dimension to the membrane pore size played the predominant role in membrane fouling during the experimental period this result should be reasonable because there was no apparent cake layer observed on the membrane surface during the short filtration process 3 3 particle size distribution microscopic morphology and filamentous bacteria analysis fig 4 presents the psd of the four sludge samples as shown in fig 4 the psd of the four sludge liquors was slightly different generally speaking of had the smallest mean size while mbr2 bulk sludge had the largest mean size mbr2 bulk sludge fs mbr1 bulk sludge of the dissimilarity in floc size was further demonstrated by the microscopic observation for the sludge liquors as shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the mbr2 bulk sludge particles were present as large flocs while the particles of mbr1 bulk sludge and of existed in a smaller size and more dispersed state with flower like morphology these results indicated that foaming sludge was more difficult to bond together as compared with non foaming sludge this may be caused by the fine bubble aeration in mbr1 because sludge flocs would be easier broken and better dispersed in a better aeration condition 10 in addition as shown in fig 5 there was no apparent filament observed in all the four samples indicating filamentous bacteria were not the main cause for the foam formation in mbr1 it should be noted that as a sample originated from the problematic reactor mbr1 fs possessed larger floc size than that of the mbr1 bulk sludge and of which might be due to the lower aeration effect and higher concentration of sludge particles accumulated on the top of the reactor it is well accepted that smaller flocs could be easier attached to the membrane surface leading to a denser sludge structure and hence induce a higher sfr 38 40 however in this study the mbr2 bulk sludge sample with the largest psd had highest sfr this result is reasonable considering the complexity of membrane fouling and its multiple influencing factors 10 41 it suggested that except for pds other properties of the foaming and non foaming sludge should also be significantly different 3 4 comparison of smp the comparison of smp content of the four samples is displayed in fig 6 the smp contents of the four samples were ranged in the order of mbr2 bulk sludge mbr1 bulk sludge of fs apparently the concentration of proteins carbohydrates and total smp in mbr2 bulk sludge was notably higher than that in mbr1 bulk sludge of and fs one way anova analysis further demonstrated that there were significant differences in smp compositions between sludge samples from the foaming reactor mbr1 mbr1 bulk sludge of and fs and the non foaming reactor mbr2 mbr2 bulk sludge p 0 05 it suggested that aeration related foaming had distinctive impact on the content of smp in the sludge suspension in addition among all the samples the concentration of proteins was much higher than that of carbohydrates in this study the pn ch ratio of mbr1 bulk sludge mbr2 bulk sludge of and fs was 5 28 3 20 8 12 and 8 23 respectively it has been reported that smp played a significant role in membrane fouling 42 46 in general a higher content of smp will lead to a higher filtration resistance 47 48 in this study the total smp concentration in mbr2 bulk sludge was 1 97 4 73 and 7 06 times higher than that of mbr1 bulk sludge of and fs respectively while the sfr of mbr2 bulk sludge fig 2 was only 1 05 2 10 and 3 30 times higher than that of mbr1 bulk sludge of and fs respectively as smps generally exist in a broad spectrum of molecular weights mw and the high mw smps are commonly considered as the major cause of membrane fouling 49 50 these incongruous results might be caused by the differences in mw that is a portion of the smps in the sludge suspensions were ineffective and not responsible to the filtration resistance in addition although non foaming sludge has larger psd than that of the foaming sludge figs 4 and 5 it has the best fit for the internal pore blocking model with the highest value of r2 0 9285 fig 3 considering that smp is a main foulant affecting the filterability of activated sludge this result should be due to the higher smps in mbr2 bulk sludge therefore the higher smps content in mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge can be a reasonable explanation for the higher sfr in fig 2 3 5 bound eps analysis fig 7 compares the lb eps and tb eps content of mbr1 bulk sludge mbr2 bulk sludge of and fs furthermore single factor analysis of variance anova spss 17 at a significant level of p 0 05 was applied to detect whether differences between the four samples were significant as shown in fig 7a the total lb eps content of mbr2 bulk sludge was 9 03 mg g mlss which was 1 37 3 24 and 1 46 times higher than that of mbr1 bulk sludge 6 61 mg g mlss of 2 79 mg g mlss and fs 6 17 mg g mlss respectively according to the anova analysis results the total lb eps content of mbr2 bulk sludge was significantly different from that of other three samples p 0 05 this means aeration related foaming had significant effect on the lb eps contents which is similar to that of smp from fig 7b it can be seen that similar to lb eps the total tb eps in mbr2 bulk sludge was significantly higher than that of mbr1 bulk sludge of and fs p 0 05 the total tb eps in mbr2 bulk sludge was 76 66 mg g mlss which was 2 30 3 56 and 1 55 times higher than that of mbr1 bulk sludge 33 31 mg g mlss of 21 51 mg g mlss and fs 49 61 mg g mlss respectively the protein content in both lb eps and tb eps was much higher than that of carbohydrates which was consistent with the results obtained by previous studies 51 53 moreover the mbr1 bulk sludge had higher lb eps but lower tb eps content than fs indicating that lb eps had more significant correlations with membrane fouling than tb eps similar results have also been reported in the literature 35 54 56 the tb eps might play a role as a binder for the sludge flocs and the higher tb eps would lead to the formation of larger and more stable sludge flocs it is generally believed that increasing the total eps content would induce an increase in membrane fouling rate 57 58 nevertheless lee et al 47 reported that the quantity of total eps had no significant effect on membrane fouling resistance these contradictory results in the literature suggest that the effect of eps on membrane fouling is complex and highly dependent on the changes of the dominant factors in this study the non foaming sludge possesses the highest sfr fig 2 and the best fit for the cake formation model with the highest value of r2 0 9449 fig 3 which might be due to the highest eps content in mbr2 bulk sludge sample together the current investigation with the results obtained in the literature it can be concluded that aeration related foaming had notable impact on the concentration of bound eps and the higher sfr of mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge in fig 2 could be at least partially explained by the higher concentration of lb eps in the samples 3 6 thermodynamic interactions analysis table 1 lists the contact angle and zeta potential of the virgin membrane and sludge flocs according to these data the thermodynamic interaction energies between sludge floc and membrane surface were calculated and the results are shown in fig 8 both the lw and ab interactions in all the samples were attractive while the el interaction was repulsive all the profiles of the total interaction energy exhibited an energy barrier suggesting that the sludge flocs from the four sampling points should possess sufficient energy to overcome the barrier before they adhere onto the membrane surface the energy barrier of mbr1 bulk sludge mbr2 bulk sludge of and fs was 2246 kt 3276 kt 2935 kt and 2664 kt respectively generally the adhesion of sludge flocs on membrane surface is not only affected by the energy barrier but also controlled by the interaction strength between the flocs and membrane 39 in the current study the total interaction energy of mbr1 bulk sludge mbr2 bulk sludge of and fs at the minimal distance was 115 070 kt 103 582 kt 19 682 kt and 82979 respectively the higher attractive interaction energy of mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge at minimal distance suggested that the sludge flocs of mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge had stronger adhesion ability than of and fs which is corresponding to the value of sfr shown in fig 1 it should be noted that mbr1 bulk sludge had the lowest energy barrier and strongest attractive interaction energy at contact which meant that the sludge flocs of mbr1 bulk sludge could get to the membrane surface most easily but were most difficult to be detached by the hydrodynamic shear force after they attached on the membrane surface however the sfr of mbr1 bulk sludge was still slightly lower than mbr2 bulk sludge as shown in fig 1 similar phenomenon also was found between of and fs these results further demonstrated that the filtration behavior of the sludge mixture was simultaneously controlled by multiple factors 3 7 combined effect of aeration diffuser on the properties of foaming sludge and its implication for membrane fouling control the experiment results indicated that the effect of bubble size with the similar aeration intensity on foaming and fouling was definitely different in this study it is apparent that fine bubble aeration caused serious foaming but relatively lower membrane fouling in fact the fouling difference between foaming and non foaming sludge was resulted from the variation of sludge properties caused by the different aeration bubbles in the two mbrs in this study foaming sludge from mbr1 had smaller particle size and lower smp and eps content however it is generally believed that smaller sludge flocs will lead to more severe membrane fouling while lower smp and eps have opposite effect this meant that the effect of bubble size on the properties of foaming and non foaming sludge was complicated and the final effect on the fouling behavior mainly depended on the strength of each influencing factor for the comparison of mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge comparison of sludge suspension from foaming and non foaming mbr characterization of the sludge suspensions showed that the foaming sludge suspension mbr1 bulk sludge had smaller floc size and stronger attractive interaction energy at minimal distance than the bulk sludge sample of mbr2 nevertheless the content of both smp and bound eps in mbr1 bulk sludge was much lower than that of mbr2 bulk sludge it is extensively accepted that smaller floc size and stronger adhesion ability would cause higher filtration resistance 38 39 59 on the contrary lower content of smp and bound eps are favorable to the filterability improvement of the sludge suspension 10 32 therefore the similar sfr of mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge fig 1 is expected to be explained by the similar effect strength from the antagonism factors as for the comparison between mbr2 bulk sludge and fs comparison of non foaming and foaming sludge although the particle size of mbr2 bulk sludge was larger than that of fs the concentration of smp and bound eps as well as the attractive energy at contact distance for mbr2 bulk sludge sample were also much larger than that of fs that is the influencing strength of fouling beneficial factors for mbr2 bulk sludge was much stronger than fs as compared with mbr1 bulk sludge which was corresponding to the larger srf value of mbr2 bulk sludge non foaming as displayed in fig 1 for the comparison of mbr1 bulk sludge and fs comparison of sludge suspension and foaming sludge on the top in the foaming mbr it is apparent that mbr1 bulk sludge possessed higher sfr than fs which was mainly attributed to the higher content of smp and stronger adhesion capacity the smaller psd of mbr1 bulk sludge than fs might be caused by the lower concentration of tb eps as there were less tb eps mbr1 bulk sludge had less resistance to the deflocculation force from the aeration moreover the similar value of lb eps in both samples revealed that the effect of lb eps on sfr was insignificant the difference in physicochemical properties of mbr1 bulk sludge and fs further demonstrated that foaming had apparent impact on sludge characters although they were originating from the same mbr in the case of of and fs comparison of foaming sludges with different degrees of foaming of had fewer bound eps and lower adhesion capacity but higher sfr than fs which was mainly due to the stronger impact from the psd and smp it should be pointed out that the of sludge was originated from fs but the content of smp in of was higher than that of fs this may be mainly due to the lysis of sludge cells after they overflowed from the reactor in brief different degrees of foaming also had some effect on sludge properties and then affect the fouling behavior of sludge suspensions the findings regarding the combined effect of bubble size with the similar aeration intensity on foaming and fouling also gave some implications for foaming and membrane fouling control in mbr system aeration and eps are two factors not only playing a significant role in membrane fouling but also affecting the foaming formation so far many efforts have been made to explore the correlation between foaming and eps it was reported the foam formation was positively correlated to the eps concentration 5 25 which means serious foaming and fouling phenomenon might simultaneously occur however cosenza et al 4 found that fouling rate decreased when foaming occurred and they ascribed this result to the trapping of bound eps by the floating scum in this study the coexistence of serious foaming and low fouling was also observed however this phenomenon should be ascribed to the fine bubble aeration in mbr1 because the eps content in the of and fs samples were lower than that in the mbr1 bulk sludge fig 7 according to this study fine bubble aeration would facilitate to mitigate membrane fouling but promote foaming formation as an advanced wastewater treatment technology mbr system applies membrane modules instead of secondary settling tanks for solid liquid separation therefore the impact of foaming on the treatment performance in such a system will not be as serious as in the cas system as a result a relatively fine aeration diffuser will be preferred in order to effectively control the formation of membrane fouling for a given mbr system an optimal aeration intensity and bubble size should be implemented as an effective strategy to control both foaming and membrane fouling 4 conclusions in this study two identical aerobic mbrs were operated under same feed and operation conditions but different aeration diffusers coarse bubble aeration vs fine bubble aeration the results showed that fine bubble aeration caused serious foaming problem aeration related foaming had a great impact on the sludge properties as well as the filtration behaviors comparison of the sludge properties revealed that the fouling behavior of the sludge was governed by a combined effect of several major influencing factors such as particle size eps smps an optimal bubble size aeration should be provided to maximize oxygen transfer and reduce fouling and foaming acknowledgments the authors gratefully

14449,in this study two parallel aerobic mbrs were operated with different aeration diffusers coarse bubble aeration vs fine bubble aeration it was found that fine bubble aeration would cause serious foaming in the mbr system the specific filtration resistance sfr of non foaming sludge was similar to that of the sludge suspension in the foaming mbr but almost 2 3 times larger than that of the foaming sludge liquor from the top layer of the foaming mbr the intermediate pore blocking was the dominant fouling mechanism in batch filtration tests the filtration performance of the sludge mixtures was governed by the combined effect of several major factors there were more smaller flocs less soluble microbial products smp and less bound extracellular polymeric substances epss in the foaming sludge samples interfacial interaction calculation showed that the foaming sludge had a weaker adhesion ability comparison of foaming sludge and overflow foaming sludge revealed that the degree of foaming could affect the filtration behavior and physicochemical properties of the foaming sludge the findings regarding the combined effect of aeration bubble size on foaming and fouling gave some implications for foaming and fouling control since fine bubble aeration was detrimental for foaming control but beneficial for fouling mitigation the selection of the optimal aeration intensity and diffuser would be a potentially effective strategy for the membrane fouling and foaming control in the mbr system keywords foaming membrane bioreactor fine bubble aeration sludge properties filtration resistance 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr is a promising alternative for wastewater treatment and reclamation because of its excellent performance and distinctive advantages including higher effluent quality lower sludge production higher volumetric loading smaller footprint improved process flexibility etc over conventional activated sludge processes cas 1 3 although mbr is an advanced wastewater treatment system it is still not exempt from some operational problems such as membrane fouling and foaming 4 8 generally membrane fouling is considered as the primary obstacle for the widespread application of mbr because it will lead to the reduction of membrane permeability and the increase in operating cost the formation of membrane fouling is mainly attributed to the undesirable deposition and accumulation of organic inorganic and biological particles on the membrane surface four groups of factors including membrane materials feed characteristics operation conditions and sludge mixture characteristics are considered as the major influence factors for membrane fouling in mbrs 9 10 for a given mbr system in additional to the sludge characteristics i e viscosity extracellular polymeric substances epss and soluble microbial products smp and hydrodynamic conditions membrane fouling is also affected by operation conditions i e sludge retention time srt hydraulic retention time hrt and aeration 11 13 therefore numerous studies have been conducted to find effective and affordable strategies for membrane fouling control 14 16 nevertheless membrane fouling is still an open challenge for mbr technology and requires further studies 4 as compared with membrane fouling foaming is not a key problem for mbr operation and therefore very few studies were conducted to explore the foaming problem in mbrs however serious foaming can cause a reduction in mbr performance and loss of sludge solids in case of overflow therefore many efforts have been devoted to investigating the main causes of foaming in mbr systems in recent years some studies reported that the potential foam forming organisms such as filamentous bacteria are the main contributor to foaming in mbr process 17 18 this phenomenon is similar to that in the cas process 19 21 however the formation of foam in the absence of foam forming microorganisms has also been observed and epss were considered as the primary factor for foaming in this situation 4 5 22 these conflicting results indicated that the formation of foam in mbr system is more complex than that in the cas process and thus deserves further investigation in fact foam formation generally involves two factors the dispersion of gas in the liquid and the presence of potential foaming substances synthetic surfactants and hydrophobic compounds such as epss 23 generally fine bubble aeration condition and high concentration of hydrophobic substances can promote the formation of foam it has been reported that fine bubble gas mixing would cause a high level of foam accumulation 24 in addition it was also found that bound epss concentration was well correlating with the foaming formation in mbrs 4 5 25 it is worthwhile to note that aeration and bound epss also play a significant role in membrane fouling 26 28 the smaller bubble aeration was reported to be better for fouling control than the larger bubble aeration even though it can generate stronger shear stress on the membrane surface 10 29 moreover a higher epss concentration was usually considered to cause more severe membrane fouling 30 31 bearing in mind what discussed above it can be speculated that a potential correlation may exist between fouling and foaming however most of the current studies regarding the foaming problem in mbrs focus only on the role of epss 4 5 25 however there is a lack of investigation on the role of aeration in foaming the effect of aeration related foaming on sludge properties and the correlation between aeration related foaming and fouling therefore this study compared the characteristics of the foaming and non foaming sludge related to aeration and then developed new insights on the potential relationship between the aeration related foaming and fouling such a study would help us understand the effect of aeration bubble size on foaming formation the property differences between foaming and non foaming sludge and provide new insights into the selection of optimum aeration conditions for foaming and fouling control 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and sample collection the foaming and non foaming sludge samples were collected from two parallel and identical aerobic mbrs koch hollow fiber mbr systems usa operated at a mining site in ontario canada for on site domestic wastewater treatment fig 1 shows the schematic of the two identical mbr apparatus and the positions of the four sampling points according to the sampling position the four sludge samples were named as mbr1 bulk sludge sludge suspension from the foaming mbr mbr2 bulk sludge sludge suspension from the normal mbr of overflow foaming sludge and fs foaming sludge from foaming layer in the foaming mbr respectively the total bioreactor volume and treatment capacity for each mbr system is approximately 100 m3 and 150 m3 wastewater day respectively koch hollow fiber membranes were selected by the company these two reactors were operated with the same feed and operation conditions however the aeration comb in mbr2 was broken and therefore the bubbles in mbr2 were coarse while in mbr1 were fine that is only the air bubbles were different in these two reactors considering the proprietary nature of the commercial mbr plants other detailed design and operating conditions of the two identical mbr plants cannot be reported all sludge samples were stored at 4 c immediately after shipped in a cooler to lakehead university 2 2 evaluation of specific filtration resistance the specific filtration resistance sfr of the four sludge suspensions was determined by the dead end batch filtration tests with a stirred cell model 8200 amicon the membrane

blocking models according to the blocking mechanism the fouling can be classified into complete blocking eq 2 internal pore blocking eq 3 intermediate blocking eq 4 and cake formation eq 5 33 34 2 l n

respectively by plotting the filtration flux to filtration time the fitness of the above four models to the filtration data can be assessed and then the major cause of membrane fouling during filtration process can be evaluated in this study the adequacy of the above four models was judged in terms of the value of regression coefficient r2 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 eps extraction and measurement the extraction of loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps was based on a modified heat extraction method adopted by yang and li 35 50 ml of sludge mixture was taken and centrifuged iec multirf thermo iec needham heights ma usa at 18 700 g for 5 min at 4 c the sludge pellets were resuspended to their original volume in 0 05 nacl w v warm solution at 50 c and then immediately mixed by an analog vortex mixer fisher scientific usa for 1 min the sludge suspension was centrifuged at 18 700 g for 10 min at 4 c and the supernatant obtained was regarded as lb eps of

min at 4 c the supernatant collected was regarded as tb eps both the lb eps and tb eps were normalized as the sum of protein pn and carbohydrates ch which were measured colorimetrically by using the anthrone reagent and folin reagent method respectively bovine serum albumin bsa and glucose were used as the protein and carbohydrate standard respectively 2 4 2 smp measurement smp soluble microbial

mastersizer 2000 instrument worcestershire uk with a detection range of 0 02 2000 ฮผm was applied to measure the particle size distribution psd of the sludge suspension samples the scattered light is detected by a multi element detector which converts the signal to a size distribution based on volume each sample was measured in triplicate 2 4 4 optical microscope observation the microstructure of the sludge samples was observed by an optical microscope olympus ch 2 japan all of the sludge samples were dropped on the slides and then dispersed by a cover slide thereafter the prepared samples were placed on the stage of the microscope and at least 10 images were randomly taken by a digital camera connected with the microscope for each sample 2 4 5 contact angle measurement the contact angles of the virgin membrane the same as the membrane used for sfr measurement and sludge samples were measured by using an optical tensiometer theta lite biolin scientific finland in this study ultrapure water glycerol and diiodomethane were selected as the probe liquids for the contact angle measurement 2 4 6 zeta potential measurement zeta potential of the four sludge samples was measured

statistical analysis was carried out using the spss 17 0 software an analysis of variance anova was used to test the differences between the sludge properties and fouling rate and p 0 05 was considered to be significant 2 5 xdlvo approach the particle substrate interfacial interactions in aqueous media are generally quantitatively described by the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek

was broken the effluent quality of the two mbrs was similar the concentration of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand bod in the effluents was mostly less than 2 mg l corresponding to over 95 removal rate the only problem encountered was the foaming in mbr1 which led to the overflow and loss of activated sludge due to the proprietary nature of the commercial mbr plants the detailed information about membrane fouling was not provided therefore the dead end batch filtration tests were conducted by a stirred cell to assess the fouling behaviors of the four sludge samples fig 2 shows the sfrs of foaming and non foaming sludges from four sampling points of the mbrs ranging from the highest filtration resistance the sfrs of the four samples were mbr2 bulk sludge mbr1 bulk sludge of fs the sfr of mbr2 bulk sludge was 7 02 1013 m kg which was only slightly higher than that of mbr1 bulk sludge 6 70 1013 m kg however the sfrs of mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge were almost 2 and 3 times greater than that of the of 3 34 1013 m kg and fs 2 13 1013 m kg respectively it should be noted that the sludge samples of mbr1 bulk sludge of and fs were all originating from the problematic reactor mbr1 the similar sfr between mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge indicated that the mixed liquor from both foaming and non foaming mbrs had little effect on the filtration behaviors of the sludge suspension under the foaming layer anova p 0 05 it is reasonable considering most of the problematic sludge with a high foaming capacity were accumulated on the top layer of the bioreactor the discrepancy in sfr between of and fs revealed that different degrees of foaming had some influences on the filtration performance of the sludge samples anova p 0 05 moreover the pronounced difference between sludge suspension mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge and foamed sludge of and fs indicated foaming had apparent effect on the filtration resistance of the sludge anova p 0 05 the different filtration behaviors suggested that their physicochemical properties were different because fouling behavior of sludge was directly controlled by sludge characteristics 10 therefore other characteristics of the foaming and non foaming sludge including particle blocking particle size distribution psd microscopic morphology filamentous bacteria smp and bound eps content contact angle and zeta potential were recorded and discussed as follows 3 2 fouling assessment fig 3 shows the fitting results of different pore blocking models for the four sludge samples it can be seen that all the four samples were basically fitting well for the four models r2 0 8016 that means the decline in the permeate flux were caused simultaneously by the four fouling mechanisms these results should be reasonable because the particle size of the sludge as well as the colloids was generally distributed in a wide range in the mbr system the adequacy of the fitted model was further judged according to the value of regression coefficient r2 it can be seen from fig 3 that the intermediate blocking model rather than cake formation model exhibited the highest values of r2 for all the four samples indicating the solute molecules with the similar dimension to the membrane pore size played the predominant role in membrane fouling during the experimental period this result should be reasonable because there was no apparent cake layer observed on the membrane surface during the short filtration process 3 3 particle size distribution microscopic morphology and filamentous bacteria analysis fig 4 presents the psd of the four sludge samples as shown in fig 4 the psd of the four sludge liquors was slightly different generally speaking of had the smallest mean size while mbr2 bulk sludge had the largest mean size mbr2 bulk sludge fs mbr1 bulk sludge of the dissimilarity in floc size was further demonstrated by the microscopic observation for the sludge liquors as shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the mbr2 bulk sludge particles were present as large flocs while the particles of mbr1 bulk sludge and of existed in a smaller size and more dispersed state with flower like morphology these results indicated that foaming sludge was more difficult to bond together as compared with non foaming sludge this may be caused by the fine bubble aeration in mbr1 because sludge flocs would be easier broken and better dispersed in a better aeration condition 10 in addition as shown in fig 5 there was no apparent filament observed in all the four samples indicating filamentous bacteria were not the main cause for the foam formation in mbr1 it should be noted that as a sample originated from the problematic reactor mbr1 fs possessed larger floc size than that of the mbr1 bulk sludge and of which might be due to the lower aeration effect and higher concentration of sludge particles accumulated on the top of the reactor it is well accepted that smaller flocs could be easier attached to the membrane surface leading to a denser sludge structure and hence induce a higher sfr 38 40 however in this study the mbr2 bulk sludge sample with the largest psd had highest sfr this result is reasonable considering the complexity of membrane fouling and its multiple influencing factors 10 41 it suggested that except for pds other properties of the foaming and non foaming sludge should also be significantly different 3 4 comparison of smp the comparison of smp content of the four samples is displayed in fig 6 the smp contents of the four samples were ranged in the order of mbr2 bulk sludge mbr1 bulk sludge of fs apparently the concentration of proteins carbohydrates and total smp in mbr2 bulk sludge was notably higher than that in mbr1 bulk sludge of and fs one way anova analysis further demonstrated that there were significant differences in smp compositions between sludge samples from the foaming reactor mbr1 mbr1 bulk sludge of and fs and the non foaming reactor mbr2 mbr2 bulk sludge p 0 05 it suggested that aeration related foaming had distinctive impact on the content of smp in the sludge suspension in addition among all the samples the concentration of proteins was much higher than that of carbohydrates in this study the pn ch ratio of mbr1 bulk sludge mbr2 bulk sludge of and fs was 5 28 3 20 8 12 and 8 23 respectively it has been reported that smp played a significant role in membrane fouling 42 46 in general a higher content of smp will lead to a higher filtration resistance 47 48 in this study the total smp concentration in mbr2 bulk sludge was 1 97 4 73 and 7 06 times higher than that of mbr1 bulk sludge of and fs respectively while the sfr of mbr2 bulk sludge fig 2 was only 1 05 2 10 and 3 30 times higher than that of mbr1 bulk sludge of and fs respectively as smps generally exist in a broad spectrum of molecular weights mw and the high mw smps are commonly considered as the major cause of membrane fouling 49 50 these incongruous results might be caused by the differences in mw that is a portion of the smps in the sludge suspensions were ineffective and not responsible to the filtration resistance in addition although non foaming sludge has larger psd than that of the foaming sludge figs 4 and 5 it has the best fit for the internal pore blocking model with the highest value of r2 0 9285 fig 3 considering that smp is a main foulant affecting the filterability of activated sludge this result should be due to the higher smps in mbr2 bulk sludge therefore the higher smps content in mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge can be a reasonable explanation for the higher sfr in fig 2 3 5 bound eps analysis fig 7 compares the lb eps and tb eps content of mbr1 bulk sludge mbr2 bulk sludge of and fs furthermore single factor analysis of variance anova spss 17 at a significant level of p 0 05 was applied to detect whether differences between the four samples were significant as shown in fig 7a the total lb eps content of mbr2 bulk sludge was 9 03 mg g mlss which was 1 37 3 24 and 1 46 times higher than that of mbr1 bulk sludge 6 61 mg g mlss of 2 79 mg g mlss and fs 6 17 mg g mlss respectively according to the anova analysis results the total lb eps content of mbr2 bulk sludge was significantly different from that of other three samples p 0 05 this means aeration related foaming had significant effect on the lb eps contents which is similar to that of smp from fig 7b it can be seen that similar to lb eps the total tb eps in mbr2 bulk sludge was significantly higher than that of mbr1 bulk sludge of and fs p 0 05 the total tb eps in mbr2 bulk sludge was 76 66 mg g mlss which was 2 30 3 56 and 1 55 times higher than that of mbr1 bulk sludge 33 31 mg g mlss of 21 51 mg g mlss and fs 49 61 mg g mlss respectively the protein content in both lb eps and tb eps was much higher than that of carbohydrates which was consistent with the results obtained by previous studies 51 53 moreover the mbr1 bulk sludge had higher lb eps but lower tb eps content than fs indicating that lb eps had more significant correlations with membrane fouling than tb eps similar results have also been reported in the literature 35 54 56 the tb eps might play a role as a binder for the sludge flocs and the higher tb eps would lead to the formation of larger and more stable sludge flocs it is generally believed that increasing the total eps content would induce an increase in membrane fouling rate 57 58 nevertheless lee et al 47 reported that the quantity of total eps had no significant effect on membrane fouling resistance these contradictory results in the literature suggest that the effect of eps on membrane fouling is complex and highly dependent on the changes of the dominant factors in this study the non foaming sludge possesses the highest sfr fig 2 and the best fit for the cake formation model with the highest value of r2 0 9449 fig 3 which might be due to the highest eps content in mbr2 bulk sludge sample together the current investigation with the results obtained in the literature it can be concluded that aeration related foaming had notable impact on the concentration of bound eps and the higher sfr of mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge in fig 2 could be at least partially explained by the higher concentration of lb eps in the samples 3 6 thermodynamic interactions analysis table 1 lists the contact angle and zeta potential of the virgin membrane and sludge flocs according to these data the thermodynamic interaction energies between sludge floc and membrane surface were calculated and the results are shown in fig 8 both the lw and ab interactions in all the samples were attractive while the el interaction was repulsive all the profiles of the total interaction energy exhibited an energy barrier suggesting that the sludge flocs from the four sampling points should possess sufficient energy to overcome the barrier before they adhere onto the membrane surface the energy barrier of mbr1 bulk sludge mbr2 bulk sludge of and fs was 2246 kt 3276 kt 2935 kt and 2664 kt respectively generally the adhesion of sludge flocs on membrane surface is not only affected by the energy barrier but also controlled by the interaction strength between the flocs and membrane 39 in the current study the total interaction energy of mbr1 bulk sludge mbr2 bulk sludge of and fs at the minimal distance was 115 070 kt 103 582 kt 19 682 kt and 82979 respectively the higher attractive interaction energy of mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge at minimal distance suggested that the sludge flocs of mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge had stronger adhesion ability than of and fs which is corresponding to the value of sfr shown in fig 1 it should be noted that mbr1 bulk sludge had the lowest energy barrier and strongest attractive interaction energy at contact which meant that the sludge flocs of mbr1 bulk sludge could get to the membrane surface most easily but were most difficult to be detached by the hydrodynamic shear force after they attached on the membrane surface however the sfr of mbr1 bulk sludge was still slightly lower than mbr2 bulk sludge as shown in fig 1 similar phenomenon also was found between of and fs these results further demonstrated that the filtration behavior of the sludge mixture was simultaneously controlled by multiple factors 3 7 combined effect of aeration diffuser on the properties of foaming sludge and its implication for membrane fouling control the experiment results indicated that the effect of bubble size with the similar aeration intensity on foaming and fouling was definitely different in this study it is apparent that fine bubble aeration caused serious foaming but relatively lower membrane fouling in fact the fouling difference between foaming and non foaming sludge was resulted from the variation of sludge properties caused by the different aeration bubbles in the two mbrs in this study foaming sludge from mbr1 had smaller particle size and lower smp and eps content however it is generally believed that smaller sludge flocs will lead to more severe membrane fouling while lower smp and eps have opposite effect this meant that the effect of bubble size on the properties of foaming and non foaming sludge was complicated and the final effect on the fouling behavior mainly depended on the strength of each influencing factor for the comparison of mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge comparison of sludge suspension from foaming and non foaming mbr characterization of the sludge suspensions showed that the foaming sludge suspension mbr1 bulk sludge had smaller floc size and stronger attractive interaction energy at minimal distance than the bulk sludge sample of mbr2 nevertheless the content of both smp and bound eps in mbr1 bulk sludge was much lower than that of mbr2 bulk sludge it is extensively accepted that smaller floc size and stronger adhesion ability would cause higher filtration resistance 38 39 59 on the contrary lower content of smp and bound eps are favorable to the filterability improvement of the sludge suspension 10 32 therefore the similar sfr of mbr1 bulk sludge and mbr2 bulk sludge fig 1 is expected to be explained by the similar effect strength from the antagonism factors as for the comparison between mbr2 bulk sludge and fs comparison of non foaming and foaming sludge although the particle size of mbr2 bulk sludge was larger than that of fs the concentration of smp and bound eps as well as the attractive energy at contact distance for mbr2 bulk sludge sample were also much larger than that of fs that is the influencing strength of fouling beneficial factors for mbr2 bulk sludge was much stronger than fs as compared with mbr1 bulk sludge which was corresponding to the larger srf value of mbr2 bulk sludge non foaming as displayed in fig 1 for the comparison of mbr1 bulk sludge and fs comparison of sludge suspension and foaming sludge on the top in the foaming mbr it is apparent that mbr1 bulk sludge possessed higher sfr than fs which was mainly attributed to the higher content of smp and stronger adhesion capacity the smaller psd of mbr1 bulk sludge than fs might be caused by the lower concentration of tb eps as there were less tb eps mbr1 bulk sludge had less resistance to the deflocculation force from the aeration moreover the similar value of lb eps in both samples revealed that the effect of lb eps on sfr was insignificant the difference in physicochemical properties of mbr1 bulk sludge and fs further demonstrated that foaming had apparent impact on sludge characters although they were originating from the same mbr in the case of of and fs comparison of foaming sludges with different degrees of foaming of had fewer bound eps and lower adhesion capacity but higher sfr than fs which was mainly due to the stronger impact from the psd and smp it should be pointed out that the of sludge was originated from fs but the content of smp in of was higher than that of fs this may be mainly due to the lysis of sludge cells after they overflowed from the reactor in brief different degrees of foaming also had some effect on sludge properties and then affect the fouling behavior of sludge suspensions the findings regarding the combined effect of bubble size with the similar aeration intensity on foaming and fouling also gave some implications for foaming and membrane fouling control in mbr system aeration and eps are two factors not only playing a significant role in membrane fouling but also affecting the foaming formation so far many efforts have been made to explore the correlation between foaming and eps it was reported the foam formation was positively correlated to the eps concentration 5 25 which means serious foaming and fouling phenomenon might simultaneously occur however cosenza et al 4 found that fouling rate decreased when foaming occurred and they ascribed this result to the trapping of bound eps by the floating scum in this study the coexistence of serious foaming and low fouling was also observed however this phenomenon should be ascribed to the fine bubble aeration in mbr1 because the eps content in the of and fs samples were lower than that in the mbr1 bulk sludge fig 7 according to this study fine bubble aeration would facilitate to mitigate membrane fouling but promote foaming formation as an advanced wastewater treatment technology mbr system applies membrane modules instead of secondary settling tanks for solid liquid separation therefore the impact of foaming on the treatment performance in such a system will not be as serious as in the cas system as a result a relatively fine aeration diffuser will be preferred in order to effectively control the formation of membrane fouling for a given mbr system an optimal aeration intensity and bubble size should be implemented as an effective strategy to control both foaming and membrane fouling 4 conclusions in this study two identical aerobic mbrs were operated under same feed and operation conditions but different aeration diffusers coarse bubble aeration vs fine bubble aeration the results showed that fine bubble aeration caused serious foaming problem aeration related foaming had a great impact on the sludge properties as well as the filtration behaviors comparison of the sludge properties revealed that the fouling behavior of the sludge was governed by a combined effect of several major influencing factors such as particle size eps smps an optimal bubble size aeration should be provided to maximize oxygen transfer and reduce fouling and foaming acknowledgments the authors gratefully
