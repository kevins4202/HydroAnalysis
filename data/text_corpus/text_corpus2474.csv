12370,the dynamic removal of as iii and as v ions by biofilm of bacillus arsenicus mtcc 4380 supported on sawdust mnfe2o4 composite was studied in a fixed bed bio column reactor ft ir analysis exhibited that functional groups involved in metal ions binding were hydroxyl amide and carboxyl groups experiments were performed to investigate the effects of various parameters on the breakthrough and saturation time the breakthrough and saturation time both increased with the increase in the bed height similar effects were found when both flow rate and initial arsenic concentration were increased the breakthrough curve for the bed height showed that a longer bed column extended the life span of the column with a maximum capacity of 87 573 and 88 990mg g for the as iii and as v column respectively the controlled rate step shifted from external to internal mass transfer limitations as the flow rate was increased column data acquired at various conditions were explained using adams bohart wolborska yoon nelson thomas modified dose response and clark models all models were found to be suitable to describe the whole or a definite part of the dynamic behaviour of the column with regard to the bed height flow rate and initial arsenic concentration except adams bohart and wolborska models on comparison of r 2 χ2 and rmse values both thomas and clark models were found to have a better fit than other models and these two models can be used to predict the biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v ions in fixed bed bio column reactor it is also clarified that the present method is found to be much more efficient than that of biosorption alone the whole study reveals that the biofilm tried is very capable to remove as iii and as v ions from industrial wastewater

introduction arsenic is a relatively scarce but ubiquitous element in earth s crust water pollution caused by arsenic is of great public concern due to its high toxicity to animals humans as well as plants instigating both chronic and acute adverse effects it is therefore of interest in processes related to water decontamination azcue and nriagu 1994 hughes 2002 sharma and sohn 2009 it is mobilized through natural processes such as volcanic emissions biological activity and weathering reactions etc smedley and kinniburgh 2002 biswas et al 2008 as well as through a variety of anthropogenic activities such as non ferrous smelting gold mining petroleum refining combustion of fossil fuel and the use of arsenical herbicides and pesticides etc biswas et al 2008 huang and fu 1984 haron et al 1999 mondal et al 2006 the oxidation state of arsenic shows a vital role because it fixes the properties of the related species i e the toxicity mobility in aquatic environment and the sorption behaviour in natural water arsenic exists mainly in inorganic forms as arsenite as iii and arsenate as v fergusson 1990 both as iii and as v are very toxic pollutants and are mutagenic to living organisms ng et al 2003 because of the severe impacts of arsenic on people s health the maximum contaminant level mcl of arsenic in drinking water has been revised from 50μg l to 10μg l by the world health organization who in 1993 who 1993 and the european commission in 2003 european commission directive 1998 due to pressures from public judgment and many environmental regulations legislated there has been a severe environmental challenge for the metallurgical industries especially for copper smelters copper smelting wastewater may contain highly elevated concentrations of potentially toxic oxyanion arsenic as iii and as v basha et al 2008 the presence of heavy metal ions like lead copper zinc iron cadmium bismuth nickel and chromium table 1 restrict the solubility of arsenic due to the formation of sparingly soluble metal arsenates poses a serious threat towards man and the flora and fauna of our ecosystem contaminating the natural water tables ground and surface water in the vicinity owing to its toxicity it should be removed or recovered from wastewater before discarding it should be removed from the arsenic containing residue while arsenic is not recovered and then it is stabilized in the form of a solid compound prior to disposal leist et al 2000 in fact the disposal of arsenic has been performed by the formation of calcium arsenites and arsenates sulphides and ferric arsenate due to their low solubility addition of lime to the solution has precipitated arsenic forming a calcium arsenate compound however the stability of this compound has been enquired since calcium arsenates decomposes to calcium carbonate under the effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide and finally releases arsenic oxide in the solution nishimura and robins 1998 owing to this it has been identified that there has not been significant and novel developments the formation of more stable forms has been under investigation for a long term stability however presently industries are implementing the ferric arsenate precipitation robins 1987 however in this process the difficulties raised are the formation of high amount of sludge basha et al 2008 so there is an immediate requirement to identify economical and easily operated techniques to meet the regulation several methods were described for the removal of arsenic including coagulation lime softening precipitation ion exchange ultrafiltration reverse osmosis membrane separation and adsorption etc robins 1987 who 1996 qiu and zheng 2007 however these techniques have their individual severe difficulties such as the probability of chemical spillage high price of treatment chemicals and the huge production of sludge leading to disposal problems zakaria et al 2007 this leads to the investigation of more safer and inexpensive alternatives to perform the as iii and as v remediation process such as biological processes many researchers have tested the possibility of exploring bacterial processes for the treatment of as iii and as v containing industrial wastewaters using either a pure culture or a bacterial consortium elliot et al 1998 brunet et al 2002 katsoyiannis et al 2002 suresh et al 2004 suttigarn and wang 2005 hossain and anantharaman 2006 mateos et al 2006 giri et al 2013 among various arsenic removal approaches the bio removal process using immobilized whole bacterial cells has gained more research interest in current years mondal et al 2006 arsenic resisting bacteria such as r picketti l ocracia g ferrigunea d desulfuricansm and t ynys1 etc were used for removing arsenic in bio column reactor elliot et al 1998 brunet et al 2002 katsoyiannis et al 2002 jong and pany 2003 mondal et al 2008a commercial use of these microbial biomasses as biosorbent however has been restricted by various problems linked with physical properties of these materials such as poor mechanical strength and rigidity small particle size with low density and solid liquid separation these difficulties can be resolved by immobilization of microbial cells using synthetic or natural adsorbent or biosorbent in industrial or technical operations immobilized microbial cell systems can also offer additional advantages over freely suspended cells these contain higher biomass concentration reuse of the biomass ease of regeneration minimal clogging in continuous flow systems easier solid liquid separation and resistance to chemical environments gadd 1991 aksu and gönen 2004 definitely the use of immobilized biomass has several serious problems immobilization unfavourably disturbs the mass transfer kinetics of pollutant uptake and enhances the cost of biomass pre treatment while biomass is immobilized a number of binding sites easily available to contaminant in solution is significantly decreased since larger number of sites will lie within the adsorbent thus a good support material used for immobilization should be chemically inert rigid inexpensive should bind cells firmly should have a loose structure to overcome diffusion restrictions and most significantly should have high loading capacity aksu et al 2002 texier et al 2002 the attachment of bacteria to a solid surface forming a biofilm can be depicted by a process including two steps first microorganisms come adjacent enough to the surface to be weakly held by electrostatic forces at this time the cells can be easily detached from the surface and second the attached microorganisms are difficult to detach from the surface because the bacteria creates exopolysaccharides which finally form the biofilm matrix which is firmly adherent to the substrate parkar et al 2001 the mechanisms of interactions between metal ions and biofilms are well described by le cloirec et al 2003 and can be recommenced as follows bulk diffusion diffusion of the metal ions existing in solution to the external surface of the biofilm external mass transfer occurring of mass transfer via the layer of high concentration around the biofilm rapid metal ion interactions with surface of solid and specially with the bacterial wall these interactions can be bioaccumulation enzyme production biosorption on the bacterial surface extracellular precipitation by metabolites produced by bacteria oxidation and or reduction and extracellular complexation sluggish surface diffusion diffusion into the biofilm prior to the interaction reaction with bacteria and finally interaction with bacteria existing inside the biofilm in a bio column reactor bio layer is formed on the solid support inside the reactor and it performs as a bio filtration unit jong and pany 2003 this bio filtration technique can be practiced to treat polluted groundwater if the bacteria is indigenous to the groundwater and can be verified to be an inexpensive selection to treat arsenic contaminated industrial wastewater also mondal et al 2008a reported the findings on the treatment of arsenic contaminated synthetic industrial wastewater in a bio column reactor in their study ralstonia eutropha mtcc 2487 was immobilized on the granular activated carbon gac bed in the column reactor in this paper the investigation focuses on the continuous flow system as the batch study performed in the previous work only delivered basic information regarding the removal process from the commercial point of view the batch system only delivers the efficient use for a short optimum period at a single time and needs a huge quantity of adsorbent for the treatment of a huge volume of wastewater however for the column system the application is practical and commercial as the operation is carried out continuously and the process is manageable dorado et al 2014 a novel technique for an efficient metal ion removal mediated by immobilized bacterial cells is designed this metal ion removal system is called simultaneous biosorption and bioaccumulation sbb system in this system both non living biomass and living microbial cells are used simultaneously in the present study sawdust mnfe2o4 sd mnfe2o4 or msd composite was selected as the column support material for bacterial attachment since sawdust is a natural source for lignin and cellulose and several hydroxyl rich compounds like tannins or other phenolic compounds which is recognized for its bacterial attachment property low cost and stability zakaria et al 2007 sidiras et al 2011 in the present work a composite of sd mnfe2o4 was synthesized in order to hybridize high adsorption capacity of mnfe2o4 with biosorptivity of sawdust the aim of this study was divided into two parts first part of the study was to determine the ability of bacillus arsenic mtcc 4380 immobilized on the surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite for removing as iii and as v ions by varying bed height flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration the second part of the study was to identify a suitable model for the kinetics and mass transfer of arsenic removal in fixed bed bio column reactor the column biosorption models applied in this paper were adams bohart wolborska yoon nelson thomas modified dose response and clark models the mechanism of sbb was investigated through fourier transform infrared ft ir and scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy fe sem 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of microorganism and growth medium the microorganism used was the arsenic resistant bacteria b arsenicus mtcc 4380 microbial type culture collection and gene bank mtcc chandigarh india culture media was made as per the recommendations of microbial type cell culture mtcc composition of growth medium and cultivation conditions are shown in table 2 2 2 acclimatization the acclimatization of b arsenicus mtcc 4380 in arsenic either as iii or as v environment was carried out as follows mondal et al 2008b the revived culture was initially grown in mtcc prescribed growth medium in a 250ml round bottom flask tightly closed with cotton plug as follows b arsenicus mtcc 4380 was cultivated in 250ml flask containing 100ml of the growth media with as iii and as v the cultures were acclimatized to as iii and as v individually exposing the culture in a series of shake flasks the bacterial inoculum was made by transferring a loop full of bacterial culture from the nutrient agar tubes to the flask containing sterilized growth media incubated at 30 c for 24h with adequate agitation 120rpm in an incubator cum orbital shaker then the acclimatization of b arsenicus mtcc 4380 in arsenic environment was carried out as follows after 24h the synthetic medium in the flask had turned milky specifying significant bacterial growth in the flask appropriate amount of arsenic either as iii or as v was added into the flask having 100ml sterilized growth media to acquire a concentration of 50mg l of arsenic firstly growth of b arsenicus mtcc 4380 was inhibited and the growth started after 2h after 24h of incubation at 30 c 5ml of the arsenic resistant bacterial inoculum was periodically added in a series of 250ml flasks containing 100ml of arsenic containing sterilized growth media either as iii or as v

v concentration 2000mg l was also inoculated with 5ml of the last culture either as iii or as v concentration 1800mg l to ensure that the bacteria was already adapted to both as iii or as v for inoculum a further sub culturing was performed and all the inoculum transfers were done in exponential phase od value 1 at 600nm 2 3 experimental setup the experiments related to the removal of arsenic either as iii or as v were performed in a bio column reactor made of ss pipe the experimental setup was consisted with bio column reactor feed tank mixing chamber fitted with stirrer and peristaltic pump model rh p 100 l 100 india fig 1 internal diameter and working height of the column reactor were 8cm and 100cm respectively total empty working volume of column was 5 01 0 002l to collect the liquid samples along the height of the reactor a total of four equal distance ports 1 25cm diameter excluding inlet and out let of 15 25cm were equipped with the column the top and bottom portions were fastened with the main column by two flange joints supported on ss screen mesh no 16 bss width aperture 0 05 mm ss screen were also placed at the bottom of the column to prevent loss of biosorbent during the filtration process in a typical experiment the upward flow of the influent with the fixed flow rate from the bottom of the column was maintained by peristaltic pump flow rate was verified at the outlet of the column at 2h of regular intervals for preventing and minimizing the fluctuations of the flow rate if happened within the column bed 2 4 design of sab system 2 4 1 carrier preparation sawdust sd was washed to clean the adhering dirt rinsed thoroughly with double distilled water and finally heated in an air oven at 105 c for 4h 25g of dried sd was added into 500ml conical flask containing 250ml of 0 5m hcl solution thereafter was shaken for 4h at 120rpm at 25 c then the mixture was left overnight the mixture then was filtered to separate sd which was repeatedly washed with double distilled water to obtain neutral ph then the biosorbents were dried at 110 c for 3h for removing moisture cooled to room temperature and kept in plastic bags for further usage sd mnfe2o4 composites were prepared by chemical coprecipitation method with few modifications shao et al 2012 in this procedure a fixed quantity of acid treated sd was mixed into 200ml solution containing dissolved ferric iii chloride fecl3 0 05mol and manganese ii chloride mncl2 0 025mol at room temperature the quantity of acid treated sd was fixed for acquiring sd mnfe2o4 mass ratios of 2 1 the solution temperature was increased to 60 c under energetic magnetic stirring and after that 5mol l of naoh solution was added drop by drop to the above mixture till the ph of the solution attained 11 thereafter agitation was carried out for 1h then the suspension was heated in a water bath at 100 c for 4h after cooling the prepared composite was constantly washed with double distilled water to remove the contaminations e g na cl accompanied with the processes afterward as prepared composite was collected from the washed solution by filtering the mixture and then was oven dried at 110 c the reaction ionic equation bianfang et al 2007 is as follows 1 mn2 2fe3 8oh mn oh 2 2fe oh 3 mnfe2o4 4h2o 2 mnfe2o4 sd sd mnfe2o4 2 4 2 immobilization of microbial cells onto the biosorbent the biosorbent bed of sd mnfe2o4 composite particle size 1 18mm was packed in the column upto 100cm sd mnfe2o4 composite packed column was fully wetted by filling with double distilled water in the upward flow direction at an influent flow rate of 124 8ml h for 5h prior to starting of the experiments to make sure expulsions of the trapped air the whole experimental set up was placed inside an isothermal chamber made of wood and stuffed with glass wool the temperature of the chamber was fixed at 30 c after the expulsions of the trapped air from the bed of sd mnfe2o4 composite in the reactor it was firstly filled with pure growth media then 6l of influent inoculated with acclimatized b arsenicus mtcc 4380 bacteria containing solution of dry cell mass concentration of 0 125g l containing the preferred arsenic either as iii or as v concentration was pumped using a pre calibrated variable speed peristaltic pump at 124 8ml h from the mixing chamber to the bottom inlet of the bio column reactor then the column was kept intact for 48h for preconditioning the bacteria 1n hcl or naoh was used for adjusting the initial ph of the solution to the desired ph value 7 0 the liquid in the reactor was withdrawn after 48h of initial filling from the bottommost inlet of the bio column reactor total period of 48h was necessary to precondition and form the biofilm on the sd mnfe2o4 composite bed in the bio column reactor 2 5 characterization of the biosorbent infrared spectra of the unloaded and metal loaded sd mnfe2o4 composite attached with biofilm were obtained using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer nicholet 6700 coupled with omnic software version 6 2 the measurements of sem were carried out to observe the surface morphologies of the sd mnfe2o4 composite attached with biofilm before and after biosorption bioaccumulation process sem leo electron microscopy england the images were taken with an accelerator voltage 15kv and an emission current 100µa by the tungsten filament 2 6 cell viability in sd mnfe2o4 composite biosorbent to determine that bacteria survived the immobilization process experiments were conducted to estimate the growth in the biosorbent to determine that bacteria were definitely viable a small piece of the bacterial immobilized biosorbent was excised from the master biosorbent and placed on the surface of nutrient agar plates hyde et al 1991 the plates were placed into an incubator at a temperature of 30 c for 24h to estimate the growth of the bacteria the cut biosorbent would allow any viable bacteria to escape from the sd mnfe2o4 composite matrix and grow out on the solid medium the bacterial immobilized biosorbents were placed at 30 c because b arsenicus mtcc 4380 grows at this temperature after the growth of 48h the bacterial inoculum was prepared by transferring a loop full of bacterial culture from the nutrient agar tubes to the round bottom flask containing sterilized growth media incubated at 30 c for 24h with moderate agitation 120rpm in an incubator cum orbital shaker bacterial cell growth was established by observing a small amount of bacterial cells through scanning electron microscopy 2 7 fixed bed bio column experiment packed bed biosorption bioaccumulation studies were carried out to estimate the dynamic behaviour for as iii and as v removal by immobilized bacterial cells the columns were run till exhaustion of the biosorbent capacity the ph of the inlet metal solution was adjusted to ph 7 0 by dropwise addition of 1n hcl and 1n naoh solution using ph meter at 3h time intervals treated water samples were taken out from the outlet of column then the samples were centrifuged at 10 000rpm for 10min and analyzed for arsenic either as iii or as v the range of operating parameters is presented in table 3 duplicate experiments were carried out in non parallel manner different column parameters affecting biosorption bioaccumulation of arsenic either as iii or as v ions were investigated as follows 2 7 1 effect of bed height bed height was varied as 20 40 60 80 and 100cm with constant flow rate of 251 2ml h and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration of 2000mg

of initial concentration initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration was varied to 2000 3000 4000 and 5000mg l with constant bed height of 100cm and flow rate 251 2ml h 2 8 arsenic quantification the analyzation of total arsenic was conducted with a thermofisher scientific ice 3000 series aa graphite furnace atomic absorption gfaa spectrometer with zeeman background correction gf aas a 0 5nm slit width and a wavelength of 193 7nm were chosen an arsenic high intensity hollow cathode lamp was utilized for determining as 20µg l pyrolytic graphite coated tubes with forked pyrolytic platforms were utilized argon ar was utilized as a protective gas all through to determine the dissolved arsenic 8 0ml of a centrifuged sample was added to 1ml of 1 hno3 and 1 0ml of chemical matrix modifier 50g l of nickel nitrate solution in a flask the prepared sample injected was 20µl all measurements were conducted at least in duplicate and on the basis of integrated absorbance the procedure of detailed analysis for this fast and easy to operate method was defined by michon et al 2007 3 theoretical background 3 1 mathematical description of fixed bed column studies to determine the operation and dynamic response of a bio column reactor the shape of the breakthrough curve and the time for breakthrough appearance are very significant features the performance of a column is generally estimated with the theory of breakthrough curve breakthrough curves show a characteristic s shape but with variable position of breakpoint and degree of steepness for the highest adsorption processes in water and wastewater treatment the breakthrough curves exhibit the loading behaviour of metal to be removed from the solution in fixed bed and generally stated in terms of biosorbed metal concentration cad or normalized concentration defined as the ratio of effluent adsorbate concentration to inlet adsorbate concentration ce c0 as a function of time or effluent volume for a given bed height ajmal et al 2006 the effluent volume veff ml was estimated using eq 3 aksu and gönen 2004 aksu et al 2002 3 v eff q t total the total biosorbed metal ion qtotal

equilibrium adsorption was also determined from the column data to obtain the capacity of the biosorbent required to remove metal ion the equilibrium metal ion uptake qeq also known as the column maximum capacity was obtained using eq 8 aksu and gönen 2004 8 q eq q total x at the equilibrium the unadsorbed metal ion concentration in the continuous flow system was also evaluated using eq 9 lim and aris 2014 9 c e q m total q total v eff 1000 3 2 adsorption modelling for fixed bed column studies the prediction of the concentration time profile or breakthrough curve for the treatment of wastewater under given specific operating conditions is essential for successful design of a column adsorption process the maximum adsorption capacity of an adsorbent is also required in designing the column a fruitful design of a continuous adsorption separation unit needs primary design data which may be acquired by uncountable experiments with the purpose of determining the conditions for an optimum performance with the aim of decreasing time and cost through a number of experiments required for collecting the critical design information mathematical models are frequently applied for predicting the optimal conditions by which various statistical parameters may be extracted onyango et al 2009 it is inherently difficult for developing a model to precisely describe the dynamic behaviour of adsorption in a fixed bed system because in such systems the concentration profiles in the solid and liquid phases differ significantly in both space and time and thus the process does not operate at steady state modelling of data collecting from column experiments helps in scale up potential however parameters of these models recommend some vital information regarding column operation the fundamental equations for a fixed bed bio column are dependent on the mechanisms responsible for the process such as mass transfer from the liquid to the solid surface and diffusion and or reaction on the solid surface and include mass balances between the fluid and the solid and for the adsorbed adsorbate rate of the process etc the equations derived for modelling the system with theoretical accuracy are differential in nature and generally need complex numerical methods to solve them some solutions for very limiting cases have been stated however generally complete time dependent analytical solutions to differential equation based models of the proposed rate mechanisms are not available if the objective is to model the breakthrough behaviour of fixed bed bio column with a high degree of precision the application of simpler and more agreeable models that escape the requirement for numerical solution seems to be more appropriate and logical and could have instant practical aids owing to this several simple mathematical models like adams bohart wolborska yoon and nelson thomas modified dose response and clark models were developed to predict the dynamic behaviour of the bio column at different bed heights flow rates and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentrations and allow some kinetic coefficients to be evaluated however they do not include any mass transfer consideration and so are less difficult than other theoretical models the models are summarized as follows 3 2 1 adams bohart model in 1920 adams and bohart bohart and adams 1920 proposed the fundamental equation which defined the relationship between ce c0 and t in a continuous system for the adsorption of chlorine on charcoal though it was initially practiced to a gas solid system but later it is widely applied to define and measure other types of systems this model supposed that equilibrium was not instantaneous so the rate of the adsorption was proportional to both the fraction of adsorption capacity still remained on the adsorbent i e the residual capacity of the adsorbent and to the concentration of the adsorbate goel et al 2005 debnath et al 2010 this model provided the clear picture of the initial part of the breakthrough curve i e upto 50 bohart and adams 1920 qureshi et al 2011 however it is often used to model the breakthrough curves for metal sorption by non biological and biological materials the model initially proposed by bohart and adams 1920 was on the basis of surface reaction theory and was equivalent to the logistic curve hutchins 1973 van vliet and weber 1981 clark 1987a low et al 1999 walker and weatherley 2001 an s shaped curve given by eq 10 clark 1987a batzias and sidiras 2004 which was symmetrical around its midpoint at t

operational parameters kab and n0 of adams bohart model can be evaluated by fitting eq 11 to the experimental breakthrough curve by applying the non linear regression method the value of maximum adsorption capacity can be calculated from the model using eq 12 rocha et al 2015 as follows 12 q 0 n 0 zs x 3 2 2 wolborska model wolborska 1989 established a model which addressed the adsorption dynamics of p nitrophenol by activated carbon for low concentration range of breakthrough curves applying mass transfer phenomenon for the diffusion mechanism wolborska model was practiced to experimental breakthrough results for describing the initial part of the breakthrough curve singh et al 2012 the equation of wolborska model can be expressed through eq 13 as follows 13 c e c 0 exp β a c 0 t n 0 β a z u βa was also an effective coefficient which revealed the influence of both mass transfer in liquid phase and axial dispersion values defining the characteristic operational parameters βa and n0 of wolborska model can be evaluated by fitting eq 13 to the experimental breakthrough curve by applying the non linear regression method the value of maximum adsorption capacity can be calculated from the model using eq 14 rocha et al 2015 as follows 14 q 0 n 0 zs x the parameter βa can be defined by eq 15 hamdaoui 2006 as follows 15 β a u 2 d 1 4 β 0 d u 2 1 wolbraska observed that the negligible axial dispersion usually happened while the bed height was short or while flow rate of influent through the column was extremely high and βa β0 aksu and gönen 2004 wolborska 1989 singh et al 2012 hamdaoui 2006 the migration velocity of the steady state front satisfied the relation recognized as wicke s law singh et al 2012 can be estimated using eq 16 as follows 16 v u c 0 n 0 c 0 3 2 3 yoon and nelson model yoon and nelson 1984 established a comparatively simple model describing the adsorption and breakthrough of adsorbate vapours or gases on activated charcoal this model assumed that the rate of decrease in the probability of adsorption for each adsorbate molecule was proportional to the probability of adsorbate adsorption and the probability of adsorbate breakthrough on adsorbent aksu and gönen 2003 calero et al 2009 this model assumed the symmetrical nature of breakthrough curve and neglected the influence of axial dispersion aksu and gönen 2006 yoon and nelson model was not only less complex than other models but also needed no thorough information regarding the type of adsorbent the characteristics of adsorbate and the physical properties of adsorption bed it is applicable for a single component system singh et al 2012 yoon and nelson 1984 the equation of yoon and nelson model can be expressed through eq 17 as follows 17 c e c 0 1 1 exp k yn τ t physical column parameters were not necessary for this model equation it should be specified that the expression of yoon and nelson model was mathematically similar to the equation that signified thomas model the values of kyn and τ can be evaluated from a plot of ce c0 against t by fitting eq 17 using non linear regression analysis as the values of ce c0 are within 0 05 0 95 the adsorbent bed should be completely saturated at 2τ for a symmetrical shape of the breakthrough curve while the amount of adsorbate bound in the adsorbent was half that of the total adsorbate inflowing the adsorbent bed within the 2τ period and corresponded to the total capacity q0 qureshi et al 2011 lin and huang 2000 medvidović et al 2006 the value of maximum column capacity q0 can be calculated from the model eq 18 as follows 18 q 0 1 2 c 0 q x 2 τ c 0 q τ x 3 2 4 thomas model thomas 1944 recommended a model for the breakthrough curves acquired for chromatography columns the model assumed plug flow behaviour in the bed chen et al 2012 this model was established supposing langmuir kinetics of adsorption desorption and no axial dispersion it was derived with the adsorption such that the rate driving force obeyed second order reversible kinetics thomas 1944 theoretically it was appropriate to evaluate the adsorption process where external and internal diffusion resistances were very small aksu and gönen 2004 however various researchers then widely applied it for predicting the breakthrough curve of metal sorption by non biological and biological materials hamdaoui 2006 solution of thomas model also assumed a constant separation factor however it was valid for either unfavourable or favourable isotherms the main flaw of thomas solution was that its derivation was on the basis of second order reaction kinetics and it was considered that the adsorption was not typically limited by chemical reaction kinetics however it was frequently regulated by interphase mass transfer use of this model leaded to some error in adsorption processes where first order reaction kinetics was followed rao and viraraghavan 2002 this incongruity could give some error while this method was applied to model adsorption process in specific conditions aksu and gönen 2004 thomas 1944 rao and viraraghavan 2002 the equation of thomas model can be expressed through eq 19 as follows 19 c e c 0 1 1 exp k th q 0 x u k th c 0 t the values of kth and q0 can be evaluated from a plot of ce c0 against t by fitting eq 19 using non linear regression analysis as the values of ce c0 are within 0 05 0 95 3 2 5 modified dose response model yan et al 2001 suggested an empirical equation on the basis of mathematical issues rather than mechanistic fundamentals however the final form of modified dose response model was analogous to thomas and yoon nelson models modified dose response model reduced the error that resulted from the application of thomas model particularly with lower and higher breakthrough curve times song et al 2011 this model was generally applied in pharmacology for describing various types of processes and also for describing the biosorption in columns yan et al 2001 senthilkumar et al 2006 xu et al 2013a the equation of modified dose response model can be expressed through eq 20 as follows 20 c e c 0 1 1 1 ut b mdr a mdr the values of amdr and bmdr can be evaluated from a plot of ce c0 against t by fitting eq 20 using non linear regression analysis as the values of ce c0 are within 0 05 0 95 from the value of bmdr the value of q0 can be estimated using eq 21 yan et al 2001 as follows 21 q 0 c 0 b mdr x 3 2 6 clark model one of the limitations of the simple logistic function was that it needed symmetry however several breakthrough curves were not perfectly symmetrical because of the nature of the adsorption system under investigation clark 1987a 1987b defined a new simulation of breakthrough curves they established a substitute to the simple logistic function named the generalized logistic function which incorporated the parameter n of freundlich adsorption isotherm clark model was derived from a mass balance on a differential element in a fixed bed combined with freundlich isotherm for the liquid solid equilibrium aksu and gönen 2004 clark resolved this system and acquired a solution eq 22 as follows 22 c 0 n 1 1 c 0 n 1 c b n 1 1 exp r t b exp rt 1 n 1 c t or 23 c t c 0 1 1 a exp rt 1 n 1 with 24 a c 0 n 1 c b n 1 1 exp r t b and 25 r n 1 r and r k t u ν eq 23 was the generalized logistic function the values of a and r can be evaluated from a plot of ce c0 against t by fitting eq 23 using non linear regression analysis as the values of ce c0 are within 0 05 0 95 the equations sidiras et al 2011 used for estimating the parameter values after having performed non linear regression are as follows 26 k c r c i and 27 n 0 ulna z k c c o ulna zr the value of maximum adsorption capacity q0 mg g can be calculated from the model using eq 28 rocha et al 2015 as follows 28 q 0 n 0 zs x 3 3 error analysis the experimental data were fitted with all the six models as detailed above to determine the model kinetic parameters using non linear regression analysis in professional graphics software package originpro 8 5 1 version the model performance was evaluated through goodness of fit measure gofm values adjusted r square r 2 reduced chi square test χ2 and root mse as suggested by sreenivas et al 2014 the adjusted coefficient of determination r 2 which generally takes into account the number of variables and sample size in the model is deliberated superior to the coefficient of determination r2 since it revises the overestimation by r2 warrens 2008 while dealing with small samples specifically it is more exact than r2 the predictive indices were calculated by using the following equations 3 3 1 adjusted r square r 2 29 r 2 1 i 1 n q e model q e exp i 2 n p i 1 n q

capacity of metal ions on various biosorbents depends on the presence of several active functional groups on the surface of biosorbent the fourier transform infrared spectra ft ir study of fresh sd mnfe2o4 composite as well as as iii acclimatized b arsenicus mtcc 4380 immobilized on surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite at unloaded and metal loaded stage fig 2 a and fresh sd mnfe2o4 composite and as v acclimatized b arsenicus mtcc 4380 immobilized on surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite at unloaded and metal loaded stage fig 2 b at optimized batch experimental condition were observed to identify the functional groups responsible mainly for the process of biosorption bioaccumulation table 4 and table 5 specify the wavenumber for the many functional groups surface oh and nh groups were main active functional groups responsible for biosorption bioaccumulation as the wavenumber shifted from 3432 725cm 1 to 3426 977cm 1 as iii and from 3432 725cm 1 to 3422 016cm 1 as v which may be probably owing to the complexation of oh groups with as iii or as v ions pangnanelli et al 2000 ray et al 2005 sarı and tuzen 2009 tuzen et al 2009 allievi et al 2011 singha and das 2011 some researchers have also specified that after the adsorption arsenic on the fe ce and fe mn adsorbents the peak of hydroxyl groups reduced or vanished zhang et al 2005 2007 aliphatic c h stretching may be responsible for biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v on the immobilized bacterial cells as wavenumber shifted from 2929 612cm 1 to 2919 69cm 1 and from 2929 612cm 1 to 2919 69cm 1 respectively possibly owing to the complexation of c h stretching vibration of alkyl chains sarı and tuzen 2009 aldehyde c h stretching may be responsible for biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v on the immobilized bacterial cells wavenumber shifted from 2854 176cm 1 to 2857 674cm 1 and from 2854 176cm 1 to 2852 713cm 1 respectively tuzen et al 2009 table 4 and table 5 also display the responsibility of aliphatic acid c o stretching for as iii and as v biosorption bioaccumulation by shifting the wavenumber from 1735 647cm 1 to 1745 116cm 1 and from 1729 862cm 1 to 1735 647cm 1 respectively singha and das 2011 the next biosorption bioaccumulation peaks at 1640 93cm 1 shifted to 1629 58cm 1 for as iii and 1640 93cm 1 shifted to 1630 388cm 1 for as v perhaps because of the complexation of amide group n h stretching and c o stretching vibration with as iii and as v ions sarı and tuzen 2009 tuzen et al 2009 seki et al 2005 sarı et al 2011 wave number shifted from 1625 426cm 1 to 1615 504cm 1 as iii and from 1657 0543cm 1 to 1641 55cm 1 as v which gave the reactivity of unsaturated group like alkene for the biosorption bioaccumulation process table 4 and table 5 also exhibit the intense bands at 1470 388cm 1 which shifted to 1459 845cm 1 as iii and at 1527 442cm 1 shifted to 1517 727cm 1 as v indicated the responsibility of aromatic no2 group for the biosorption bioaccumulation process respectively another shift was found from 1449 922cm 1 to 1442 516cm 1 as iii and from 1442 516cm 1 to 1430 945cm 1 as v corresponding to the complexation of nitrogen with as iii and as v ions of the n h group kumari et al 2006 françois et al 2012 wavenumber shifted from 1366 822cm 1 to 1375 018cm 1 as iii and from 1375 018cm 1 to 1382 326cm 1 as v assigned the reactivity of carboxylate anion c o stretching for the biosorption bioaccumulation process baig et al 2010 wavenumber 1231 628cm 1 shifted to 1237 209cm 1 and 1240 024cm 1 shifted to 1237 829cm 1 assigned for so3 stretching for the biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v respectively the peaks at 1082 171cm 1 as iii and 1087 132cm 1 as v may be because of the c n stretching vibrations of amino groups which shifted to higher frequency and appeared at 1113 178cm 1 and 1114 671cm 1 respectively because of the interaction of nitrogen from the amino group with as iii and as v ions baciocchi et al 2005 giri et al 2011 wavenumber 1043 317cm 1 shifted to 1049 102cm 1 as iii and shifting from 1056 124cm 1 to 1052 959cm 1 as v indicated the si o stretching active for the biosorption bioaccumulation process the other weak biosorption bioaccumulation peak shifted from 885 581cm 1 to 901 085cm 1 as iii and from 885 581cm 1 to 900 608cm 1 corresponding to the o c o scissoring vibration of polysaccharide merroun et al 2005 pokhrel and viraraghavan 2007 the band at 590 12cm 1 figs 2 a and 603 62cm 1 fig 2 b could be attributed to the existence of fe o bond mccafferty 2010 ren et al 2012 but then it shifted to 603 62cm 1 after biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii figs 2 a and to 600 930cm 1 after biosorption bioaccumulation of as v fig 2 b respectively a typical peak at 566 978cm 1 figs 2 a and 559 38cm 1 fig 2 b could be assigned to mn o bond kohler et al 1997 parida et al 2004 and it had a different variability to 563 121cm 1 figs 2 a and 561 193cm 1 fig 2 b for biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v respectively the change in wavenumber of me o bonds after biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v indicated that both fe o and mn o bonds were responsible for both mnfe2o4 as iii and mnfe2o4 as v ren et al 2012 li et al 2010 presence of as iii and as v on the immobilized bacterial cells can be assured from the bands appeared at 797 519cm 1 figs 2 a and 828 527cm 1 fig 2 b respectively mondal et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 aryal et al 2010 it has to be cited here that a clear band was very hard to be got in the case of as iii compared with the distinctive band of as iii found at 797 519cm 1 and as v found at 828 527cm 1 this may be because of different mechanisms involved in as iii and as v biosorption bioaccumulation it should be distinguished that the as o band after biosorption bioaccumulation of arsenic was not clearly observed because of the broad overlapping peaks in this region li et al 2010 the results specified that the chemical interactions as ion exchange between the hydrogen atoms of carboxyl cooh hydroxyl oh and amide nh groups of the immobilized bacterial cells and the metal ions were mainly involved in the biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v by immobilized bacterial cells ionic radius of as iii is 0 72å and as v is 0 6å which are smaller ions so they can go into smaller pore and binding site of the surface of the immobilized bacterial cells and bind to various functional groups existing in the immobilized bacterial cells simultaneously 4 1 2 sem analysis the sem images of the prepared fresh sd mnfe2o4 composite fig 3 a and as iii acclimatized b arsenicus mtcc 4380 immobilized on surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite at stage of unloaded and loaded with as iii fig 3 b c and as v acclimatized b arsenicus mtcc 4380 immobilized on surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite at stage of unloaded and loaded with as v fig 3 d e were presented it can be realized from fig 3 a manganese ferrite mnfe2o4 particles with several diameters were randomly distributed onto the acid treated sd surface it is clear from fig 3 b and d that most of the active sites of sd mnfe2o4 composite were protected due to the formation of biofilm on it mondal et al 2008b a change in surface morphology from being smooth to rough and existence of pores specified the as iii and as v biosorption bioaccumulation on the surface and pores of sd mnfe2o4 composite providing it a rough texture the corresponding edx spectra of the unloaded and loaded immobilized bacterial cells was collected and shown in fig 3 a e the existence of iron manganese and oxygen on the unloaded composite surface and iron manganese and oxygen arsenic on the loaded immobilized bacterial cells were shown evidently this result again established the appearance of mnfe2o4 particles on the acid treated sd surface as well as biosorption bioaccumulation of arsenic on the surface of immobilized bacterial cells 4 2 column studies 4 2 1 parameters of the breakthrough curves the performance of the continuous fixed bed column system was expressed through the plot of the breakthrough curve which was the ratio of effluent metal concentration to the metal inlet concentration ce co against the flow time t the column data were applied into the mathematical theories of the column system to provide information on the influencing parameters the total removal percentage of columns as iii and as v were found to increase with the increase in biosorbent bed height table 6 at the equilibrium of the increased bed height the unadsorbed as iii and as v concentrations from the columns reduced from 949 087 to 673 142mg l and 970 146 to 651 661mg l respectively table 6 the change in the column parameters greatly affected the removal pattern 4 2 1 1 effect of bed height the contact time of treated water sample withdrawn at different heights along the bed of the bio column reactor varies though the flow rates of the influents keep same bed heights 1 5 referred to the height of sampling port p1 to p5 respectively i e 20 40 60 80 and 100cm fig 4 shows the influence of bed height on the as iii and as v removal from the treated water from fig 4 it was obvious that the normalized concentration of arsenic either as iii or as v of the treated water taken out from port p4 and p5 reduced to 0 013 and 0 0078 respectively within 3h however the normalized arsenic concentration of the samples collected from port p1 p2 and p3 after 3h were more than 0 0183 at the early phase the bacteria took more or less time for adjusting themselves in the continuous manner of process in the reactor the contact time decreased with the reduction in the bed height which caused the lower removal of as iii and as v as the bed height decreased the breakthrough for both metals occurred faster and the bed column exhausted rapider the length of the bed height strongly influenced the column breakthrough time and the biosorbent bed performance lim and aris 2014 the rise in metal uptake capacities with the increase in the bed height in the fixed bed column might be because of the improved surface area of the biosorbent which delivered more binding sites for the biosorption bioaccumulation baral et al 2008 the longer bed delayed the exhaustion time of the biosorbent which indicated that the bed was capable to operate for a longer period without changing the biosorbent while for the shorter bed the exhaustion reached faster therefore the performance dropped xu et al 2013b the breakthrough time also improved with the increase in bed height table 6 4 2 1 2 effect of flow rate flow rate is one of the significant characteristics in estimating the biosorbent for continuous treatment of metal containing wastewater on an industrial level zhao et al 1999 the effect of flow rate in the fixed bed column packed with b arsenicus mtcc 4380 immobilized on the surface of sd mnfe2o4 was examined changing the flow rate to 251 2 314 418 67 and 837 33ml h with bed height held constant at 100cm for both as iii and as v columns the ph and influent arsenic either as iii or as v concentration in the influent was 7 0 and 2000mg l respectively it was seen from fig 5 and table 6 that the removal efficiency was higher at lower flow rate for the lowest flow rate applied in the columns system 251 2ml h the breakthrough curves in the as iii and as v columns ce c0 were observed to have a gradual curve than 314 418 67 and 837 33ml h while for the highest flow rate 837 33ml h the breakthrough curve ce c0 of as iii and as v were found to increase drastically at the initial part of the operation fig 5 the speed of the influent remarkably affected the contact between the adsorbate and biosorbent this can be described by the fact that the residence of the adsorbate was more at lower flow rate and so the biosorbent got more time for binding with the metal effectively malkoc et al 2006b in other words arsenic solution either as iii or as v left the column before the equilibrium happened if the residence time of the adsorbate in the column was not high enough for the biosorption bioaccumulation equilibrium to be reached at a particular flow rate it was found that the biosorbent got easily saturated at higher flow rates hence the biosorption bioaccumulation was not complete and led to steep breakthrough results at the beginning of the operation xu et al 2013b vijayaraghavan et al 2004 the arsenic either as iii or as v uptake reduced with the increase in flow rate 4 2 1 3 effect of initial concentration in the biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v by b arsenicus mtcc 4380 immobilized on the surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite a change in inlet arsenic either as iii or as v concentration influenced the operating characteristics of the fixed bed column in order to establish the optimum performance of the continuous fixed bed system the initial concentrations of as iii and as v were varied to 2000 3000 4000 and 5000mg l at 251 2ml h flow rate and 100cm bed height fig 6 at the maximum arsenic concentration 5000mg l b arsenicus mtcc 4380 immobilized on the surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite bed saturated quickly leading to earlier breakthrough and exhaustion time the equilibrium uptake of as iii and as v ions were observed to rise with the increase in initial concentrations table 6 the unadsorbed metal concentrations at the equilibrium also showed increased values along with the higher initial concentrations table 6 maximum bed capacities for different initial as iii and as v concentration at 2000 3000 4000 and 5000mg l were 87 573 104 648 111 349 and 115 011mg g and 88 99 108 9 114 425 and 117 087mg g respectively this indicated that the bed was saturated faster when higher amounts of arsenic ions were introduced into the bio column reactor the driving force for the biosorption bioaccumulation was the concentration difference of arsenic either as iii or as v ions on the immobilized bacterial cells and that in the solution aksu and gönen 2004 so the high driving force because of high arsenic ion concentration resulted in improved column performance for the as iii and as v columns 2000 3000 4000 and 5000mg l initial concentrations experienced exhaustion after 1 breakthrough fig 6 higher the arsenic ion concentration higher is the adsorbent usage rate and so higher is the value of adsorbent exhaustion rate malkoc et al 2006a from the observation b arsenicus mtcc 4380 immobilized on the surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite was likely to be favourable for biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v however the column performances were initially fast for the higher loading of as iii and as v ions and remained constant at an equilibrium after the removal efficiency started to decrease malkoc et al 2006b galendar and younesi 2013 4 2 2 biosorption bioaccumulation modelling for breakthrough curve 4 2 2 1 adams bohart model adams bohart model was used for describing the initial part of the curve the concentration ce 0 5c0 i e upto 50 breakthrough goel et al 2005 xu et al 2013b this model predicted the column performance parameters maximum saturation concentration of the metals n0 and the adams bohart rate constant kab by including the bed height flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration of the column system presented in table 7 the results specified that they were not all suitable fits with correlation coefficients adjusted r square r 2 ranging from 0 82613 to 0 89117 as iii and from 0 81606 to 0 90939 as v and error values reduced chi square χ2 ranging from 0 01593 to 0 02798 as iii and from 0 01262 to 0 02798 as v and root mse rmse ranging from 0 12622 to 0 16726 as iii and from 0 11236 to 0 16726 as v table 7 the breakthrough curves predicted from adams bohart model were compared with the experimental points and exhibited in fig 7 a fig 8 a and fig 9 a it was clear from fig 7 a fig 8 a and fig 9 a and table 7 that there was a poor agreement between the experimental points and predicted values it signified that adams bohart model was unable to predict the initial process of the present system at all working conditions meanwhile the value of saturation concentration n0 decreased with the increase in bed height because more sites are available for biosorption bioaccumulation of arsenic either as iii or as v with the increase in bed height lim and aris 2014 the value of n0 also increased with the increase in flow rate and initial arsenic concentration for both as iii and as v ions when the flow rate was increased the volume of adsorbate entered into the column was higher and the bed was saturated earlier with a higher load of metals this condition was also applicable for increasing the initial inlet concentration the biosorbent bed in the column achieved comparative exhaustion as the metal ions loading was higher these findings showed that the biosorption bioaccumulation kinetic was contributed by the physical mass transfer of the column system lim and aris 2014 xu et al 2013b in addition the kinetic constant kab decreased with the increase in bed height and flow rate however it increased with the increase in initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration the kinetic constant kab increased with increasing the flow rate revealed that the overall system kinetics was dominated by external mass transfer in the initial part of bio column for biosorption bioaccumulation aksu and gönen 2004 karimi et al 2012 therefore under these conditions initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentrations need to be lower while the flow rate should be higher for better capacity of the column n0 and lower kinetic constant i e minimum resistance these results in terms of both the value of the parameters and the duplication of the experimental results using adams bohart model were analogous to those reported by other researcher investigating on distinct adsorbate adsorbent system masukume et al 2014 although adams bohart model delivered a simple and comprehensive approach for estimating the biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v its validity was restricted in the range of conditions used chen et al 2012 karimi et al 2012 4 2 2 2 wolborska model wolborska model was used to describe the initial part of the breakthrough curve the concentration ce 0 5c0 i e up to 50 breakthrough aksu and gönen 2004 this model predicted the column performance parameters maximum saturation concentration of the metals n0 and the kinetic coefficient of the external mass transfer βa by including the bed height flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration of the column system presented in table 8 the results specified that they were not all satisfactory fits with coefficient correlation adjusted r square r 2 ranging from 0 82613 to 0 89117 as iii and from 0 83139 to 0 9137 as v and error values reduced chi square χ2 ranging from 0 01593 to 0 29086 as iii and from 0 01468 to 0 02798 as v and root mse rmse ranging from 0 12622 to 0 16726 as iii and from 0 11236 to 0 16726 as v table 8 the breakthrough curves predicted from wolborska model were compared with the experimental points and presented in fig 7 b fig 8 b and fig 9 b it was clear from fig 7 b fig 8 b and fig 9 b and table 8 that there was a poor agreement between the experimental points and predicted values it specified that wolborska model was not applicable to predict the initial process of the present system at all operating conditions meanwhile the value of βa increased with the increase in flow rare for arsenic either as iii or as v biosorption bioaccumulation because an increased turbulence reduced the film boundary layer surrounding the immobilized bacterial cells aksu and gönen 2004 sağ and aktay 2001 singh et al 2009 furthermore maximum adsorption capacity n0 increased with increasing the flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration but decreased with increasing the bed height for both as iii or as v ions the migration velocity increased with increasing the flow rate these results in terms of both the value of the parameters and the replica of the experimental results through wolborska model were analogous to those described by other researcher studying on distinct adsorbate adsorbent system aksu and gönen 2004 singh et al 2012 deliyanni et al 2009 hamdaoui 2009 although wolbraska model provided a simple and comprehensive approach to run and evaluate adsorption column tests but its validity was restricted in the range of conditions used aksu and gönen 2004 4 2 2 3 yoon nelson model yoon nelson model was applied in the current work to predict the breakthrough activities this model is known to be a simple theoretical model because less column data is needed for the construction of the model values yahaya et al 2011 pilli et al 2012 the values of kyn and τ were achieved from the non linearized yoon nelson equation for predicting the rate constant and time required for 50 adsorbate breakthrough by including the bed height flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration of the column system presented in table 9 the results specified that they were all suitable fits with coefficient correlation adjusted r square r 2 ranging from 0 98668 to 0 99879 as iii and from 0 98591 to 0 99846 as v and error values reduced chi square χ2 ranging from 0 01593 to 0 29086 as iii and from 0 00023 to 0 00182 as v and root mse rmse ranging from 0 01384 to 0 04145 as iii and from 0 01518 to 0 04262 as v table 9 the breakthrough curves predicted from yoon nelson model were compared with the experimental points and presented in fig 7 c fig 8 c and fig 9 c it was clear from fig 7 c fig 8 c and fig 9 c and table 9 that there was a good agreement between the experimental points and predicted values it indicated that yoon nelson model was applicable for describing the behaviour of the biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v in fixed bed bio column at all conditions examined yoon nelson model rate constant kyn usually decreased with the increase in the bed height but increased with the increase in flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii and as v concentration the highest value of the rate constant at higher initial arsenic either as iii and as v concentration can be related to the increasing driving forces which controlled the mass transfer in the liquid phase calero et al 2009 aksu and gönen 2006 however τ representing the time required for 50 breakthrough was found to be considerably increased with increasing the bed height due to slower saturation of the column at higher bed height lakshmipathya and sarada 2015 nevertheless τ values was found to be significantly decreasing with increasing flow rate and initial influent arsenic either as iii and as v concentration this was because of the fact that saturation of the column was achieved more rapidly calero et al 2009 these results in terms of both the value of the parameters and the replica of the experimental results through yoon and nelson model were analogous to those achieved by other researchers investigating on different adsorbate adsorbent systems hamdaoui 2006 lakshmipathya and sarada 2015 long et al 2014 yoon nelson predicted that the 50 breakthrough for as iii and as v in the bed height of 100cm were at 46 59 and 47 155h respectively table 9 as iii and as v in the 100cm bed columns did not achieve 50 after 24h of operation with the prediction of this model the breakthrough time can be estimated in this case these results indicated that this model was preferable for the metals biosorption bioaccumulation in a longer bed column lim and aris 2014 4 2 2 4 thomas model thomas model was applied between the breakthrough time and the saturation time in the column calero et al 2009 this model predicted the column performance parameters thomas rate constant kth and maximum solid phase concentration q0 by including the bed height flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration of the column system presented in table 10 the results specified that they were all suitable fits with coefficient correlation adjusted r square r 2 ranging from 0 99141 to 0 99879 as iii and from 0 99308 to 0 99846 as v and error values error values reduced chi square χ2 ranging from 0 00019 to 0 00126 as iii and from 0 00023 to 0 00096 as v and root mse rmse ranging from 0 01384 to 0 03549 as iii and from 0 01518 to 0 03105 as v table 10 the breakthrough curves predicted from thomas model were compared with the experimental points and exhibited in fig 7 d fig 8 d and fig 9 d it was clear from fig 7 d fig 8 d and fig 9 d and table 10 that there was a suitable agreement between the experimental points and predicted values which proposes that thomas a model was applicable for the simulation of whole breakthrough curve at all operating conditions and external and internal diffusion are not the limiting steps the thomas rate constant kth increased with increasing the flow rate however it decreased with increasing the bed height and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration the decrease of kth with increasing the bed height was because of the increase in mass transport resistance with the increase in the bed height of columns furthermore the mass transport resistance was proportional to the axial dispersion and the thickness of the liquid film on the particle surface debnath et al 2010 medvidović et al 2006 the highest kth value at the lowest initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration indicated that the column biosorption bioaccumulation of the species was kinetically favourable at lower levels of contamination debnath et al 2010 the maximum solid phase concentration qth decreased with the increase in the bed height but it increased with the increase in the flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration the sensitivity of the thomas model constants with the variations of the liquid flow rates and the existence of a maximum qth values as the flow rate increased showed that the controlled rate step was shifted from external to internal mass transfer limitations and the model was competent to predict it kafshgari et al 2013 the maximum adsorption capacity qth value increased with the increase in arsenic either as iii or as v loading table 10 this condition can be attributed to the high driving force due to the high amount of metal ions perforated in the biosorbent bed olgun et al 2013 gong et al 2015 and also because of the reduction of liquid film thickness at the solid liquid interface with the increase in initial concentration of the adsorbates in solution debnath et al 2010 these results in terms of both the value of the parameters and the replica of the experimental results through thomas model were similar to those reported by other researcher studying on distinct adsorbate adsorbent lim and aris 2014 lakshmipathya and sarada 2015 long et al 2014 suksabye et al 2008 kofa et al 2015 as it was formerly clarified thomas model assumed langmuir adsorption and second order reversible reaction kinetics and was appropriate for adsorption processes where the external and internal diffusion processes were not the limiting step aksu and gönen 2004 vázquez et al 2009 4 2 2 5 modified dose response model modified dose response model was also applied for describing the column biosorption bioaccumulation results the values of model constants amdr and bmdr were obtained from the non linearized modified dose response equation by including the bed height flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration of the column system presented in table 11 the results specified that they were all reasonably well fits with coefficient correlation adjusted r square r 2 ranging from 0 98099 to 0 99661 as iii and from 0 97895 to 0 99768 as v and error values reduced chi square χ2 ranging from 0 00054 to 0 00265 as iii and from 0 00036 to 0 0521 as v and root mse rmse ranging from 0 02315 to 0 05151 as iii and from 0 00187 to 0 04844 as v table 11 the breakthrough curves predicted from modified dose response model were compared with the experimental points and presented in fig 7 e fig 8 e and fig 9 e it was clear from fig 7 e fig 8 e and fig 9 e and table 11 that there was a good agreement between the experimental points and predicted values it indicated that modified dose response model was applicable for describe the behaviour of the biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v in fixed bed bio column at all conditions examined analogous to thomas and yoon nelson models the parameters of modified dose response model also varied with changing experimental conditions hamdaoui 2006 the value of the arsenic either as iii or as v concentration in the solid phase qmdr was very analogous to the one acquired from thomas model modified dose response model reproduced the whole curve at all conditions examined with the exception of higher initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentrations these results in terms of both the value of the parameters and the replica of the experimental results through modified dose response model were similar to those stated by other researchers investigating on different adsorbate adsorbent systems hamdaoui 2006 calero et al 2009 lakshmipathya and sarada 2015 vijayaraghavan and prabu 2006 they specified that modified dose response model minimized the errors resulting from the application of other models particularly at lower and higher time periods of the breakthrough curve yan et al 2001 vaughan et al 2002 senthilkumar et al 2006 vijayaraghavan and prabu 2006 4 2 2 6 clark model clark model was also used for describing the column biosorption bioaccumulation data the values of model constants a and r were obtained from the non linearized clark equation by including the bed height flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration of the column system presented in table 12 the results showed that they were all suitable fits with coefficient correlation adjusted r square r 2 ranging from 0 99395 to 0 99872 as iii and from 0 99478 to 0 99884 as v and error values reduced chi square χ2 ranging from 0 00020 to 0 00089 as iii and from 0 00017 to 0 00067 as v and root mse rmse ranging from 0 0142 to 0 02978 as iii and from 0 01312 to 0 02594 as v table 12 the breakthrough curves predicted from clark model were compared with the experimental points and exhibited in fig 7 f fig 8 f and fig 9 f it was clear from fig 7 f fig 8 f and fig 9 f and table 12 that there was a good agreement between the experimental points and predicted values it signified that clark model was effective for the simulation of the whole breakthrough curve for both as iii and as v at all conditions examined with increasing the bed height values of a increased whereas values of r were opposite both values of a became smaller with increasing the flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration while values of r increased with increasing the flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration the simulated breakthrough curve at an initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration of 2000 mg l at a flow rate of 251 2ml h and for 100cm bed height was presented in fig 7 f fig 8 f and fig 9 f for this breakthrough curve the best fit equation eq 32 for as iii and eq 33 as v can be expressed as follows 32 c e c 0 1 515 1 7135 215 exp 0 176 t 0 66 33 c e c 0 1 523 1 7940 248 exp 0 176 t 0 657 these results in terms of both the value of the parameters and the replica of the experimental data through clark model were analogous to those described by other researchers studying on different adsorbate adsorbent systems aksu and gönen 2004 hamdaoui 2006 song et al 2011 4 2 3 comparison of models on the basis of the observation and correlation coefficient and error values acquired from the experimental data for the present study the strengths and weaknesses of the models applied to the present study were evaluated and summarized in table 13 overall six models were fitted well for the column data with the longest bed height as observed in fig 7 a f as the beds encountered very slow and gradual exhaustion basically the column behaviours can be predicted and assumed for further design implications and improvement works through the models applied in the current study the six models used in the present study were suitable for single component biosorption bioaccumulation all models were found to be acceptable to describe the whole or a definite part of the dynamic behaviour of the column regarding bed height flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration with except adams bohart and wolborska models the simulation of the whole breakthrough curve was effective with yoon and nelson thomas modified dose response and clark models thomas model provided information about the mass transfer between arsenic either as iii or as v solutions and the biosorbent immobilized bacterial cells which indicated the driving force under different parameters the experimental data for both as iii and as v columns were able to fit with the theoretical data obtained from yoon nelson and thomas models as the column experienced mass transfer resistance six models applied in the present study required different parameters for theoretical calculations out of six models yoon nelson needed the least parameters and theoretical data calculation the benefit of using yoon nelson model was that the mathematical application was very direct and it delivered the information of 50 column breakthrough which allowed the exhaustion period of the column to be predicted without a long duration for experimental time adams bohart and wolborska models are frequently applied for predicting the biosorption capacity of the biosorbent the data delivered from adams bohart and wolborska models can be used to provide information for a large scale effluent treatment system lim and aris 2014 however these models required extra parameters and calculation to obtain the modelling data the model frequently described the biosorption bioaccumulation that occurred by surface reaction the available sorption site and the initial part of the breakthrough dorado et al 2014 since the removal of as iii and as v ions by immobilized bacterial cells involves combination of biosorption ion exchange these models are not exactly appropriate to express the column behaviours in the present study the models applied fitted well for certain column parameters in the present study whereas some parameters were not well signified by the models because of the mass transfer resistance that occurred and also the combined removal mechanisms involved dorado et al 2014 compared to the values of maximum adsorption capacity predicted by yoon nelson model table 9 thomas model table 10 and modified dose response model table 11 at the same experimental conditions the value of maximum adsorption capacity predicted by modified dose response model was smaller than that predicted by yoon nelson thomas model the value of q0 predicted by yoon nelson model was almost similar than that predicted by thomas model both yoon nelson and thomas models were frequently overestimating the values of q0 and modified dose response model may be suitable for assessing the values of q0 yan et al 2001 however the value of q0 predicted by adams bohart model table 7 and wolborska models table 8 were significantly lower than yoon nelson thomas and modified dose response models so it can be concluded that both adams bohart model and wolborska model underestimated the values of q0 based on the of r 2 the highest value and reduced chi square χ2 and rmse the lowest value values listed in tables 7 12 at the same condition it can be concluded that both thomas and clark models can be applied for predicting the removal of as iii and as v ions by immobilized bacterial cells in fixed bed bio column reactor additionally at all conditions the predicted breakthrough curves from both clark and thomas model showed good agreement with the experimental curves fig 7 d and f fig 8 d and f and fig 9 d and f yoon nelson models also fitted well with the breakthrough curves modified dose response model were reasonable to fit the breakthrough curves however adams bohart and wolborska were not acceptable to fit the breakthrough curves various researchers investigated the metal removal by adsorption in column mode and observed that column kinetics could be described more effectively by clark model sidiras et al 2011 singh et al 2012 and also by thomas model masukume et al 2014 kofa et al 2015 vijayaraghavan and prabu 2006 setshedi et al 2014 lakshmipathya and sarada 2015 observed that based on the r2 values both thomas and yoon nelson models were found to have a better fit than adams bohart model and these two models were applied for predicting the removal of pb2 ions by watermelon rind in a fixed bed column so the present study about arsenic either as iii or as v removal in bio column biosorption biosorption had similar results 4 3 viability of bacteria after immobilization biosorbent containing 5 v v b arsenicus mtcc 4380 cells were placed on the nutrient agar plates and incubated at 30 c after 24h at this temperature bacterial cells were detected spreading away from the cut edge of the biosorbent and colony like growth small areas of butter textured growth was observed on the surface of the biosorbent the synthetic medium in the flask had turned milky also specifying significant bacterial growth in the flask this indicated that the bacterial cells survived the immobilization process scanning electron micrograph of the bacteria after 24h of growing in the liquid medium fig 10 are shown the nodules are not clearly visible in the sem the cells seem to be glued to each other it was because of more eps production which is one of the well known responses against stress 4 4 proposed mechanism of biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v ions with immobilized cells the mechanism of any biosorption bioaccumulation process is very significant part to know the characteristics of the material additionally to recognize the process which supports in designing an innovative biosorbent for upcoming uses surface sites are positively charged at lower ph of the medium and so attract negatively charged as iii and as v by an electrostatic interaction or columbic force mashitah et al 1999 hansen et al 2006 mnfe2o4 is mostly responsible to develop the charge on the surface of biosorbent while sd mnfe2o4 composite comes in contact with water the surfaces of both b arsenicus mtcc 4380 and sd mnfe2o4 composite fulfil the coordination shells with the present oh group with the materials under hydration giri et al 2013 with the alteration in ph these surface active oh groups may again bind or release h where the surface remains positive since the affinity of aso3 3 or h2aso3 and aso4 3 or h2aso4 anions with metal oxide is higher than that of hydroxide with metal oxide aso3 3 or h2aso3 and aso4 3 or h2aso4 can replace the hydroxide from the surface of the hydrolyzed metal oxides 34 meoh surf h3o aq meoh2 h2o where me denoted the surface of mnfe2o4 for biosorption on sd mnfe2o4 composite and surface of b arsenicus mtcc 4380 for bioaccumulation when ph 7 0 a negative charge had been developed on the surface of immobilized bacterial cells 35 meoh surf oh aq me o h2o a thus when ph 7 0 the overall mechanism of as iii or as v biosorption can be characterized in three different forms giri et al 2013 mandal et al 2011 i electrostatic interaction or columbic interaction between positively charged centre nitrogen oh and negatively charged as iii or as v in solution ii electrostatic attraction and complexation between positively charged surface hydroxyl group and h2aso3 and h2aso4 hu et al 2005 36 meoh2 h2aso3 meoh2 o3ash2 electrostatic attraction 37 meoh2 h2aso4 meoh2 o4ash2 electrostatic attraction and iii ion exchange reaction between positively charged metal centre and h2aso3 and h2aso4 38 meoh2 h2aso3 me oaso2h2 h2o ion exchange 39 meoh2 h2aso4 me oaso3h2 h2o ion exchange b again when the ph of the solution remains moderately in a neutral range ph 7 0 biosorption of as iii or as v on the neutral biosorbent surface can be defined by a ligand or ion exchange reaction mechanism which is characterized as follows giri et al 2013 mandal et al 2011 40 meoh h2aso3 me oaso2h2 oh ligand or ion exchange 41 meoh h2aso4 me oaso3h2 oh ligand or ion exchange c at ph above 7 0 the surface is hydroxylated and expressed as meo and the negatively charged surface can exchange aso3 3 or h2aso3 and aso4 3 or h2aso4 anions as follows hu et al 2005 42 meo aso3 3 h2o meoh aso3 3 oh 43 meo h2aso3 h2o meoh h2aso3 oh 44 meo aso4 3 h2o meoh aso4 3 oh 45 meo h2aso4 h2o meoh h2aso4 oh the modelling of the exact biosorption bioaccumulation of aso3 3 or h2aso3 and aso4 3 or h2aso4 on any material surface is dependent on a number of peripheral parameters for instance ph temperature initial as iii or as v concentration in addition to the density of surface functional groups present for coordination the biosorption process involves a solid phase a biological material and a liquid phase water containing a dissolved species to be sorbed a metal ion owing to higher affinity of the biological material sorbent for the metal ion sorbate the latter is attracted and bound with different mechanisms vijayaraghavan and yun 2008 different type of mechanisms involved in biosorption phenomenon on the biomass materials are microprecipitation electrostatic interaction chelation complexation ion exchange and physical adsorption by van der waals forces chemical adsorption and surface precipitation or their combinations veglio and beolchini 1997 schneider et al 2001 mosbah and sahmoune 2013 comte et al 2008 recognized that the deprotonated form of the reactive sites in cell wall mostly carboxylic phosphoric and amino groups is typically responsible for the binding of metal ions to eps it was also exhibited from ft ir studies an alternative sorption mechanism is the surface precipitation or condensation of metal hydroxides on the biosurfaces such precipitation is probable if there is an accumulation of the metal ions within the diffuse part of the electrical double layer the accumulation will occur if there is a net negative charge on the solid surface so though the concentration of the metal ion in solution may be much less than the solubility limit with respect to metal hydroxide and oxide solids the solubility limit near the solid surfaces is exceeded and precipitation on the solid surface occurs schneider et al 2001 4 5 advantage of simultaneous biosorption and bioaccumulation study the adherence of the bacterial cells to sd mnfe2o4 composite particles were found through sem studies fig 3 the cell wall structure of the microbes had numerous sites and complexity for the uptake of metal ions biosorption of as iii and as v by b arsenicus mtcc 4380 not only involved physical adsorption but also the complex formations at this point the complex involved was the metal ion with hydroxyl group of eps and the nitrogen of the chitin cell wall network and the hydrolysis of complex and precipitation of the hydrolysis product in the cell wall veglio and beolchini 1997 tsezos and volesky 1981 1982 immobilization of bacterial cells onto the surface of a non living carrier like sd mnfe2o4 composite through physical adsorption electrostatic forces or covalent bonding between the cell membrane and the carrier was a beneficial method the photomicrographs of the bacterial cells absorbed onto the surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite particles exposed that sd mnfe2o4 composite particles have many crevices which perform as a den for the microbial cells this defends the bacterial cells from direct exposure to high concentration of the poisonous metal due to which there is a rise in the metal uptake capacity of the bacterial cells mishra et al 2013 andrews and tien 1981 recommended that the formation of microbial monolayer on the surface of a solid carrier includes a complex mechanism for the removal of target element from the liquid medium this comprised the transport of substance like metal ions from liquid medium to the microbial monolayer surface leading to mass transfer biosorption of ions on the surface biochemical reaction inside the microbial monolayer film and simultaneous mass transfer and biosorption inside the biosorbent patil and paknikar 1999 thus the sbb process was found to be much more efficient than that of biosorption alone 5 conclusion in the present study continuous simultaneous biosorption and bioaccumulation operation in a fixed bed bio column was performed for the removal of as iii and as v by biofilm of b arsenicus mtcc 4380 supported on sd mnfe2o4 composite the paper exhibits that the immobilized bacterial cells could be used as an effective biosorbent for wastewater containing arsenic either as iii or as v ions the continuous laboratory scale studies recommended the following conclusions ftir analysis exhibited that the probable main functional groups involved in as iii and as v uptake on the immobilized bacterial cells were hydroxyl amide and carboxyl groups the mechanism of as iii and as v removal in as iii and as v column included ion exchange sem and edax confirmed the presence of as in immobilized bacterial cells after biosorption bioaccumulation the effect of various operational parameters such as bed heights flow rates and initial arsenic concentrations on the uptake of arsenic either as iii or as v by immobilized bacterial cells in the fixed bed bio column reactor were presented at 30 c temperature fixed bed bio column experiments exhibited that bed performance improved with the increase in the bed height and decrease in the flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration breakthrough curve was steeper at smaller bed height higher flow rate and higher initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration the breakthrough and saturation time increased with the increase in the bed height as more binding sites were available for a given bed height higher the flow rate was lower was the breakthrough and exhaustion times this flow rate dependency can be clarified by the statement that contact time was longer for lower flow rate and therefore the interaction between arsenic either as iii or as v ions and immobilized bacterial cells was also greater alternatively the breakthrough and saturation time decreased as initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration increased for the same flow rate and bed height since high amount of metal ions perforated in the biosorbent bed the breakthrough curve for the bed height specified that a longer bed column prolonged the life span of the bio column with a maximum capacity of 87 573 and 88 990mg g for the as iii and as v column respectively therefore suitable parameters are important for the operation of the bio column system so as to achieve optimum performance the column adsorption kinetic models were applied to the experimental data to further describe the biosorption bioaccumulation mechanism adams bohart wolborska yoon nelson thomas modified dose response and clark models were applied to experimental data acquired from dynamic studies conducted on fixed bed bio column for predicting the breakthrough curves and for estimating the column kinetic parameters the initial region of breakthrough curve was well described by both adams bohart and wolborska models while the full description of breakthrough could be accomplished by all other models at all experimental conditions thomas model showed a very good correlation for as iii and as v experimental data provided information about the mass transfer between the as iii and as v solutions and the immobilized bacterial cells which indicated the driving force under different parameters yoon nelson model also estimated the 50 breakthrough curve with minimal data required and provided the estimate breakthrough time for the column systems modified dose response model minimized the error that resulted from the application of other models particularly with lower and higher breakthrough curve times adams bohart and wolborska models permitted some mass transfer coefficients to be assessed the kinetic constant k the saturation concentration n0 the kinetic coefficient of the external mass transfer βa and the migration velocity v the generalized logistic functions of the breakthrough curves and the coefficient related to the mass transfer were acquired by applying clark model the models applied in the present study were summarized to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses for the current biosorbent and column design the column data were fitted well to yoon nelson and thomas modified dose response and clark models with the exception of that of bohart and adams and wolborska models and can be used in real time large scale industrial treatment processes it was found that both thomas and clark models fitted well to the breakthrough curves and can be applied in real time large scale industrial treatment processes so the application of the theoretical models in column study is vital to deliver further description of the column performance the column parameters exhibited the major effects in the column performance and optimum operation factors that contributed to the efficient removal of as iii and as v ions from the current study it was found that sbb process was found to be much more efficient than that of biosorption alone acknowledgements our thanks to indian institute

12370,the dynamic removal of as iii and as v ions by biofilm of bacillus arsenicus mtcc 4380 supported on sawdust mnfe2o4 composite was studied in a fixed bed bio column reactor ft ir analysis exhibited that functional groups involved in metal ions binding were hydroxyl amide and carboxyl groups experiments were performed to investigate the effects of various parameters on the breakthrough and saturation time the breakthrough and saturation time both increased with the increase in the bed height similar effects were found when both flow rate and initial arsenic concentration were increased the breakthrough curve for the bed height showed that a longer bed column extended the life span of the column with a maximum capacity of 87 573 and 88 990mg g for the as iii and as v column respectively the controlled rate step shifted from external to internal mass transfer limitations as the flow rate was increased column data acquired at various conditions were explained using adams bohart wolborska yoon nelson thomas modified dose response and clark models all models were found to be suitable to describe the whole or a definite part of the dynamic behaviour of the column with regard to the bed height flow rate and initial arsenic concentration except adams bohart and wolborska models on comparison of r 2 χ2 and rmse values both thomas and clark models were found to have a better fit than other models and these two models can be used to predict the biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v ions in fixed bed bio column reactor it is also clarified that the present method is found to be much more efficient than that of biosorption alone the whole study reveals that the biofilm tried is very capable to remove as iii and as v ions from industrial wastewater

introduction arsenic is a relatively scarce but ubiquitous element in earth s crust water pollution caused by arsenic is of great public concern due to its high toxicity to animals humans as well as plants instigating both chronic and acute adverse effects it is therefore of interest in processes related to water decontamination azcue and nriagu 1994 hughes 2002 sharma and sohn 2009 it is mobilized through natural processes such as volcanic emissions biological activity and weathering reactions etc smedley and kinniburgh 2002 biswas et al 2008 as well as through a variety of anthropogenic activities such as non ferrous smelting gold mining petroleum refining combustion of fossil fuel and the use of arsenical herbicides and pesticides etc biswas et al 2008 huang and fu 1984 haron et al 1999 mondal et al 2006 the oxidation state of arsenic shows a vital role because it fixes the properties of the related species i e the toxicity mobility in aquatic environment and the sorption behaviour in natural water arsenic exists mainly in inorganic forms as arsenite as iii and arsenate as v fergusson 1990 both as iii and as v are very toxic pollutants and are mutagenic to living organisms ng et al 2003 because of the severe impacts of arsenic on people s health the maximum contaminant level mcl of arsenic in drinking water has been revised from 50μg l to 10μg l by the world health organization who in 1993 who 1993 and the european commission in 2003 european commission directive 1998 due to pressures from public judgment and many environmental regulations legislated there has been a severe environmental challenge for the metallurgical industries especially for copper smelters copper smelting wastewater may contain highly elevated concentrations of potentially toxic oxyanion arsenic as iii and as v basha et al 2008 the presence of heavy metal ions like lead copper zinc iron cadmium bismuth nickel and chromium table 1 restrict the solubility of arsenic due to the formation of sparingly soluble metal arsenates poses a serious threat towards man and the flora and fauna of our ecosystem contaminating the natural water tables ground and surface water in the vicinity owing to its toxicity it should be removed or recovered from wastewater before discarding it should be removed from the arsenic containing residue while arsenic is not recovered and then it is stabilized in the form of a solid compound prior to disposal leist et al 2000 in fact the disposal of arsenic has been performed by the formation of calcium arsenites and arsenates sulphides and ferric arsenate due to their low solubility addition of lime to the solution has precipitated arsenic forming a calcium arsenate compound however the stability of this compound has been enquired since calcium arsenates decomposes to calcium carbonate under the effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide and finally releases arsenic oxide in the solution nishimura and robins 1998 owing to this it has been identified that there has not been significant and novel developments the formation of more stable forms has been under investigation for a long term stability however presently industries are implementing the ferric arsenate precipitation robins 1987 however in this process the difficulties raised are the formation of high amount of sludge basha et al 2008 so there is an immediate requirement to identify economical and easily operated techniques to meet the regulation several methods were described for the removal of arsenic including coagulation lime softening precipitation ion exchange ultrafiltration reverse osmosis membrane separation and adsorption etc robins 1987 who 1996 qiu and zheng 2007 however these techniques have their individual severe difficulties such as the probability of chemical spillage high price of treatment chemicals and the huge production of sludge leading to disposal problems zakaria et al 2007 this leads to the investigation of more safer and inexpensive alternatives to perform the as iii and as v remediation process such as biological processes many researchers have tested the possibility of exploring bacterial processes for the treatment of as iii and as v containing industrial wastewaters using either a pure culture or a bacterial consortium elliot et al 1998 brunet et al 2002 katsoyiannis et al 2002 suresh et al 2004 suttigarn and wang 2005 hossain and anantharaman 2006 mateos et al 2006 giri et al 2013 among various arsenic removal approaches the bio removal process using immobilized whole bacterial cells has gained more research interest in current years mondal et al 2006 arsenic resisting bacteria such as r picketti l ocracia g ferrigunea d desulfuricansm and t ynys1 etc were used for removing arsenic in bio column reactor elliot et al 1998 brunet et al 2002 katsoyiannis et al 2002 jong and pany 2003 mondal et al 2008a commercial use of these microbial biomasses as biosorbent however has been restricted by various problems linked with physical properties of these materials such as poor mechanical strength and rigidity small particle size with low density and solid liquid separation these difficulties can be resolved by immobilization of microbial cells using synthetic or natural adsorbent or biosorbent in industrial or technical operations immobilized microbial cell systems can also offer additional advantages over freely suspended cells these contain higher biomass concentration reuse of the biomass ease of regeneration minimal clogging in continuous flow systems easier solid liquid separation and resistance to chemical environments gadd 1991 aksu and gönen 2004 definitely the use of immobilized biomass has several serious problems immobilization unfavourably disturbs the mass transfer kinetics of pollutant uptake and enhances the cost of biomass pre treatment while biomass is immobilized a number of binding sites easily available to contaminant in solution is significantly decreased since larger number of sites will lie within the adsorbent thus a good support material used for immobilization should be chemically inert rigid inexpensive should bind cells firmly should have a loose structure to overcome diffusion restrictions and most significantly should have high loading capacity aksu et al 2002 texier et al 2002 the attachment of bacteria to a solid surface forming a biofilm can be depicted by a process including two steps first microorganisms come adjacent enough to the surface to be weakly held by electrostatic forces at this time the cells can be easily detached from the surface and second the attached microorganisms are difficult to detach from the surface because the bacteria creates exopolysaccharides which finally form the biofilm matrix which is firmly adherent to the substrate parkar et al 2001 the mechanisms of interactions between metal ions and biofilms are well described by le cloirec et al 2003 and can be recommenced as follows bulk diffusion diffusion of the metal ions existing in solution to the external surface of the biofilm external mass transfer occurring of mass transfer via the layer of high concentration around the biofilm rapid metal ion interactions with surface of solid and specially with the bacterial wall these interactions can be bioaccumulation enzyme production biosorption on the bacterial surface extracellular precipitation by metabolites produced by bacteria oxidation and or reduction and extracellular complexation sluggish surface diffusion diffusion into the biofilm prior to the interaction reaction with bacteria and finally interaction with bacteria existing inside the biofilm in a bio column reactor bio layer is formed on the solid support inside the reactor and it performs as a bio filtration unit jong and pany 2003 this bio filtration technique can be practiced to treat polluted groundwater if the bacteria is indigenous to the groundwater and can be verified to be an inexpensive selection to treat arsenic contaminated industrial wastewater also mondal et al 2008a reported the findings on the treatment of arsenic contaminated synthetic industrial wastewater in a bio column reactor in their study ralstonia eutropha mtcc 2487 was immobilized on the granular activated carbon gac bed in the column reactor in this paper the investigation focuses on the continuous flow system as the batch study performed in the previous work only delivered basic information regarding the removal process from the commercial point of view the batch system only delivers the efficient use for a short optimum period at a single time and needs a huge quantity of adsorbent for the treatment of a huge volume of wastewater however for the column system the application is practical and commercial as the operation is carried out continuously and the process is manageable dorado et al 2014 a novel technique for an efficient metal ion removal mediated by immobilized bacterial cells is designed this metal ion removal system is called simultaneous biosorption and bioaccumulation sbb system in this system both non living biomass and living microbial cells are used simultaneously in the present study sawdust mnfe2o4 sd mnfe2o4 or msd composite was selected as the column support material for bacterial attachment since sawdust is a natural source for lignin and cellulose and several hydroxyl rich compounds like tannins or other phenolic compounds which is recognized for its bacterial attachment property low cost and stability zakaria et al 2007 sidiras et al 2011 in the present work a composite of sd mnfe2o4 was synthesized in order to hybridize high adsorption capacity of mnfe2o4 with biosorptivity of sawdust the aim of this study was

biosorbent during the filtration process in a typical experiment the upward flow of the influent with the fixed flow rate from the bottom of the column was maintained by peristaltic pump flow rate was verified at the outlet of the column at 2h of regular intervals for preventing and minimizing the fluctuations of the flow rate if happened within the column bed 2 4 design of sab system 2 4 1 carrier preparation sawdust sd was washed to clean the adhering dirt rinsed thoroughly with double distilled water and finally heated in an air oven at 105 c for 4h 25g of dried sd was added into 500ml conical flask containing 250ml of 0 5m hcl solution thereafter was shaken for 4h at 120rpm at 25 c then the mixture was left overnight the mixture then was filtered to separate sd which was repeatedly washed with double distilled water to obtain neutral ph then the biosorbents were dried at 110 c for 3h for removing moisture cooled to room temperature and kept in plastic bags for further usage sd mnfe2o4 composites were prepared by chemical coprecipitation method with few modifications shao et al 2012 in this procedure a fixed quantity of acid treated sd was mixed into 200ml solution containing dissolved ferric iii chloride fecl3 0 05mol and manganese ii chloride mncl2 0 025mol at room temperature the quantity of acid treated sd was fixed for acquiring sd mnfe2o4 mass ratios of 2

biosorbent bed of sd mnfe2o4 composite particle size 1 18mm was packed in the column upto 100cm sd mnfe2o4 composite packed column was fully wetted by filling with double distilled water in the upward flow direction at an influent flow rate of 124 8ml h for 5h prior to starting of the experiments to make sure expulsions of the trapped air the whole experimental set up was placed inside an isothermal chamber made of wood and stuffed with glass wool the temperature of the chamber was fixed at 30 c after the expulsions of the trapped air from the bed of sd mnfe2o4 composite in the reactor it was firstly filled with pure growth media then 6l of influent inoculated with acclimatized b arsenicus mtcc 4380 bacteria containing solution of dry cell mass concentration of 0 125g l containing the preferred arsenic either as iii or as v concentration was pumped using a pre calibrated variable speed peristaltic pump at 124 8ml h from the mixing chamber to the bottom inlet of the bio column reactor then the column was kept intact for 48h for preconditioning the bacteria 1n hcl or naoh was used for adjusting the initial ph of the solution to the desired ph value 7 0 the liquid in the reactor was withdrawn after 48h of initial filling from the bottommost inlet of the bio column reactor total period of 48h was necessary to precondition and form the biofilm on the sd mnfe2o4 composite bed in the bio column reactor 2 5 characterization of the biosorbent infrared spectra of the unloaded and metal loaded sd mnfe2o4 composite attached with biofilm were obtained using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer nicholet 6700 coupled with omnic software version 6 2 the measurements of sem were carried out to observe the surface morphologies of the sd mnfe2o4 composite attached with biofilm before and after biosorption bioaccumulation process sem leo electron microscopy england the images were taken with an accelerator voltage 15kv and an emission current 100µa by the tungsten filament 2 6 cell viability in sd mnfe2o4 composite biosorbent to determine that bacteria survived the immobilization process experiments were conducted to estimate the growth in the biosorbent to determine that bacteria were definitely viable a small piece of the bacterial immobilized biosorbent was excised from the master biosorbent and placed on the surface of nutrient agar plates hyde et al 1991 the plates were placed into an incubator at a temperature of 30 c for 24h to estimate the growth of the bacteria the cut biosorbent would allow any viable bacteria to escape from the sd mnfe2o4 composite matrix and grow out on the solid medium the bacterial immobilized biosorbents were placed at 30 c because b arsenicus mtcc 4380 grows at this temperature after the growth of 48h the bacterial inoculum was prepared by transferring a loop full of bacterial culture from the nutrient agar tubes to the round bottom flask containing sterilized growth media incubated at 30 c for 24h with moderate agitation 120rpm in an incubator cum orbital shaker bacterial cell growth was established by observing a small amount of bacterial cells through scanning electron microscopy 2 7 fixed bed bio column experiment packed bed biosorption bioaccumulation studies were carried out to estimate the dynamic behaviour for as iii and as v removal by immobilized bacterial cells the columns were run till exhaustion of the biosorbent capacity the ph of the inlet metal solution was adjusted to ph 7 0 by dropwise addition of 1n hcl and 1n naoh solution using ph meter at 3h time intervals treated water samples were taken out from the outlet of column then the samples were centrifuged at 10 000rpm for 10min and analyzed for arsenic either as iii or as v the range of operating parameters is presented in table 3 duplicate experiments were carried out in non parallel manner different column parameters affecting biosorption bioaccumulation of arsenic either as iii or as v ions were

gf aas a 0 5nm slit width and a wavelength of 193 7nm were chosen an arsenic high intensity hollow cathode lamp was utilized for determining as 20µg l pyrolytic graphite coated tubes with forked pyrolytic platforms were utilized argon ar was utilized as a protective gas all through to determine the dissolved arsenic 8 0ml of a centrifuged sample was added to 1ml of 1 hno3 and 1 0ml of chemical matrix modifier 50g l of nickel nitrate solution in a flask the prepared sample injected was 20µl all measurements were conducted at least in duplicate and on the basis of integrated absorbance the procedure of detailed analysis for this fast and easy to operate method was defined by michon et al 2007 3 theoretical background 3 1 mathematical description of fixed bed column studies to determine the operation and dynamic response of a bio column reactor the shape of the breakthrough curve and the time for breakthrough appearance are very significant features the performance of a column is generally estimated with the theory of breakthrough curve breakthrough curves show a characteristic s shape but with variable position of breakpoint and degree of steepness for the highest adsorption processes in water and wastewater treatment the breakthrough curves exhibit the loading behaviour of metal to be removed from the solution in fixed bed and generally stated in terms of biosorbed metal concentration cad or normalized concentration defined as the ratio of effluent adsorbate concentration to inlet adsorbate concentration ce c0 as a function of time or effluent volume for a given bed height ajmal et al 2006 the effluent volume veff ml was estimated using eq 3 aksu and gönen 2004 aksu et al 2002 3 v eff q t total the total biosorbed metal ion qtotal

and aris 2014 9 c e q m total q total v eff 1000 3 2 adsorption modelling for fixed bed column studies the prediction of the concentration time profile or breakthrough curve for the treatment of wastewater under given specific operating conditions is essential for successful design of a column adsorption process the maximum adsorption capacity of an adsorbent is also required in designing the column a fruitful design of a continuous adsorption separation unit needs primary design data which may be acquired by uncountable experiments with the purpose of determining the conditions for an optimum performance with the aim of decreasing time and cost through a number of experiments required for collecting the critical design information mathematical models are frequently applied for predicting the optimal conditions by which various statistical parameters may be extracted onyango et al 2009 it is inherently difficult for developing a model to precisely describe the dynamic behaviour of adsorption in a fixed bed system because in such systems the concentration profiles in the solid and liquid phases differ significantly in both space and time and thus the process does not operate at steady state modelling of data collecting from column experiments helps in scale up potential however parameters of these models recommend some vital information regarding column operation the fundamental equations for a fixed bed bio column are dependent on the mechanisms responsible for the process such as mass transfer from the liquid to the solid surface and diffusion and or reaction on the solid surface and include mass balances between the fluid and the solid and for the adsorbed adsorbate rate of the process etc the equations derived for modelling the system with theoretical accuracy are differential in nature and generally need complex numerical methods to solve them some solutions for very limiting cases have been stated however generally complete time dependent analytical solutions to differential equation based models of the proposed rate mechanisms are not available if the objective is to model the breakthrough behaviour of fixed bed bio column with a high degree of precision the application of simpler and more agreeable models that escape the requirement for numerical solution seems to be more appropriate and logical and could have instant practical aids owing to this several simple mathematical models like adams bohart wolborska yoon and nelson thomas modified dose response and clark models were developed to predict the dynamic behaviour of the bio column at different bed heights flow rates and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentrations and allow some kinetic coefficients to be evaluated however they do not include any mass transfer consideration and so are less difficult than other theoretical models the models are summarized as follows 3 2 1 adams bohart model in 1920 adams and bohart bohart and adams 1920 proposed the fundamental equation which defined the relationship between ce c0 and t in a continuous system for the adsorption of chlorine on charcoal though it was initially practiced to a gas solid system but later it is widely applied to define and measure other types of systems this model supposed that equilibrium was not instantaneous so the rate of the adsorption was proportional to both the fraction of adsorption capacity still remained on the adsorbent i e the residual capacity of the adsorbent and to the concentration of the adsorbate goel et al 2005 debnath et al 2010 this model provided the clear picture of the initial part of the breakthrough curve i e upto 50 bohart and adams 1920 qureshi et al 2011 however it is often used to model the breakthrough curves for metal sorption by non biological and biological materials the model initially proposed by bohart and adams 1920 was on the basis of surface reaction theory and was equivalent to the logistic curve hutchins 1973 van vliet and weber 1981 clark 1987a low et al 1999 walker and weatherley 2001 an s shaped curve given by eq 10 clark 1987a batzias and sidiras 2004 which was symmetrical around its midpoint at t a b and ce c0 2 10 c e c 0 1 1 exp a bt the equation of adams bohart model can be expressed through eq 11 as follows 11 c e c 0 exp k ab c 0 t k ab n 0 z u values defining the characteristic

dynamics of p nitrophenol by activated carbon for low concentration range of breakthrough curves applying mass transfer phenomenon for the diffusion mechanism wolborska model was practiced to experimental breakthrough results for describing the initial part of the breakthrough curve singh et al 2012 the equation of wolborska model can be expressed through eq 13 as follows 13 c e c 0 exp β a c 0 t n 0 β a z u βa was also an effective coefficient which revealed the influence of both mass transfer in liquid phase and axial dispersion values defining the characteristic operational parameters βa and n0 of wolborska model can be evaluated by fitting eq 13 to the experimental breakthrough curve by applying the non linear regression method the value of maximum adsorption capacity

observed that the negligible axial dispersion usually happened while the bed height was short or while flow rate of influent through the column was extremely high and βa β0 aksu and gönen 2004 wolborska 1989 singh et al 2012 hamdaoui 2006 the migration velocity of the steady state front satisfied the relation recognized as wicke s law singh et al 2012 can be estimated using eq 16 as follows 16 v u c 0 n 0 c 0 3 2 3 yoon and nelson model yoon and nelson 1984 established a comparatively simple model describing the adsorption and breakthrough of adsorbate vapours or gases on activated charcoal this model assumed that the rate of decrease in the probability of adsorption for each adsorbate molecule was proportional to the probability of adsorbate adsorption and the probability of adsorbate breakthrough on adsorbent aksu and gönen 2003 calero et al 2009 this model assumed the symmetrical nature of breakthrough curve and neglected the influence of axial dispersion aksu and gönen 2006 yoon and nelson model was not only less complex than other models but also needed no thorough information regarding the type of adsorbent the characteristics of adsorbate and the physical properties of adsorption bed it is applicable for a single component system singh et al 2012 yoon and nelson 1984 the equation of yoon and nelson model can be expressed through eq 17 as follows 17 c e c 0 1 1 exp k yn τ t physical column parameters were not necessary for this model equation it should be specified that the expression of yoon and nelson model was mathematically similar to the equation that signified thomas model the values of kyn and τ can be evaluated from a plot of ce c0 against t by fitting eq 17 using non linear regression analysis as the values of ce c0 are within 0 05 0 95 the adsorbent bed should be completely saturated at 2τ for a symmetrical shape of the breakthrough curve while the amount of adsorbate bound in the adsorbent was half that of the total adsorbate inflowing the adsorbent bed within the 2τ period and corresponded to the total capacity q0 qureshi et al 2011 lin and huang 2000 medvidović et al 2006 the value of maximum column capacity q0 can be calculated from the model eq 18 as follows 18 q 0 1 2 c 0 q x 2 τ c 0 q τ x 3 2 4 thomas model thomas 1944 recommended a model for the breakthrough curves acquired for chromatography columns the model assumed plug flow behaviour in the bed chen et al 2012 this model was established supposing langmuir kinetics of adsorption desorption and no axial dispersion it was derived with the adsorption such that the rate driving force obeyed second order reversible kinetics thomas 1944 theoretically it was appropriate to evaluate the adsorption process where external and internal diffusion resistances were very small aksu and gönen 2004 however various researchers then widely applied it for predicting the breakthrough curve of metal sorption by non biological and biological materials hamdaoui 2006 solution of thomas model also assumed a constant separation factor however it was valid for either unfavourable or favourable isotherms the main flaw of thomas solution was that its derivation was on the basis of second order reaction kinetics and it was considered that the adsorption was not typically limited by chemical reaction kinetics however it was frequently regulated by interphase mass transfer use of this model leaded to some error in adsorption processes where first order reaction kinetics was followed rao and viraraghavan 2002 this incongruity could give some error while this method was applied to model adsorption process in specific conditions aksu and gönen 2004 thomas 1944 rao and viraraghavan 2002 the equation of thomas model can be expressed through eq 19 as follows 19 c e c 0 1 1 exp k th q 0 x u k th c 0 t the values of kth and q0 can be evaluated from a plot of ce c0 against t by fitting eq 19 using non linear regression analysis as the values of ce c0 are within 0 05 0 95 3 2 5 modified dose response model yan et al 2001 suggested an empirical equation on the basis of mathematical issues rather than mechanistic fundamentals however the final form of modified dose response model was analogous to thomas and yoon nelson models modified dose response model reduced the error that resulted from the application of thomas model particularly with lower and higher breakthrough curve times song et al 2011 this model was generally applied in pharmacology for describing various types of processes and also for describing the biosorption in columns yan et al 2001 senthilkumar et al 2006 xu et al 2013a the equation of modified dose response model can be expressed through eq 20 as follows 20 c e c 0 1 1 1 ut b mdr a mdr the values of amdr and bmdr can be evaluated from a plot of ce c0 against t by fitting eq 20 using non linear regression analysis as the values of ce c0 are within 0 05 0 95 from the value of bmdr the value of q0 can be estimated using eq 21 yan et al 2001 as follows 21 q 0 c 0 b mdr x 3 2 6 clark model one of the limitations of the simple logistic function was that it needed symmetry however several breakthrough curves were not perfectly symmetrical because of the nature of the adsorption system under investigation clark 1987a 1987b defined a new simulation of breakthrough curves they established a substitute to the simple logistic function named the generalized logistic function which incorporated the parameter n of freundlich adsorption isotherm clark model was derived from a mass balance on a differential element in a fixed bed combined with freundlich isotherm for the liquid solid equilibrium aksu and gönen 2004 clark resolved this system and acquired a solution eq 22 as follows 22 c 0 n 1 1 c 0 n 1 c b n 1 1 exp r t b exp rt 1 n 1 c t or 23 c t c 0 1 1 a exp rt 1 n 1 with 24 a c 0 n 1 c b n 1 1 exp r t b and 25 r n 1 r and r k t u ν eq 23 was the generalized logistic function the values of a and r can be evaluated from a plot of ce c0 against t by fitting eq 23 using non linear regression analysis as the values of ce c0 are within 0 05 0 95 the equations sidiras

capacity of metal ions on various biosorbents depends on the presence of several active functional groups on the surface of biosorbent the fourier transform infrared spectra ft ir study of fresh sd mnfe2o4 composite as well as as iii acclimatized b arsenicus mtcc 4380 immobilized on surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite at unloaded and metal loaded stage fig 2 a and fresh sd mnfe2o4 composite and as v acclimatized b arsenicus mtcc 4380 immobilized on surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite at unloaded and metal loaded stage fig 2 b at optimized batch experimental condition were observed to identify the functional groups responsible mainly for the process of biosorption bioaccumulation table 4 and table 5 specify the wavenumber for the many functional groups surface oh and nh groups were main active functional groups responsible for biosorption bioaccumulation as the wavenumber shifted from 3432 725cm 1 to 3426 977cm 1 as iii and from 3432 725cm 1 to 3422 016cm 1 as v which may be probably owing to the complexation of oh groups with as iii or as v ions pangnanelli et al 2000 ray et al 2005 sarı and tuzen 2009 tuzen et al 2009 allievi et al 2011 singha and das 2011 some researchers have also specified that after the adsorption arsenic on the fe ce and fe mn adsorbents the peak of hydroxyl groups reduced or vanished zhang et al 2005 2007 aliphatic c h stretching may be responsible for biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v on the immobilized bacterial cells as wavenumber shifted from 2929 612cm 1 to 2919 69cm 1 and from 2929 612cm 1 to 2919 69cm 1 respectively possibly owing to the complexation of c h stretching vibration of alkyl chains sarı and tuzen 2009 aldehyde c h stretching may be responsible for biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v on the immobilized bacterial cells wavenumber shifted from 2854 176cm 1 to 2857 674cm 1 and from 2854 176cm 1 to 2852 713cm 1 respectively tuzen et al 2009 table 4 and table 5 also display the responsibility of aliphatic acid c o stretching for as iii and as v biosorption bioaccumulation by shifting the wavenumber from 1735 647cm 1 to 1745 116cm 1 and from 1729 862cm 1 to 1735 647cm 1 respectively singha and das 2011 the next biosorption bioaccumulation peaks at 1640 93cm 1 shifted to 1629 58cm 1 for as iii and 1640 93cm 1 shifted to 1630 388cm 1 for as v perhaps because of the complexation of amide group n h stretching and c o stretching vibration with as iii and as v ions sarı and tuzen 2009 tuzen et al 2009 seki et al 2005 sarı et al 2011 wave number shifted from 1625 426cm 1 to 1615 504cm 1 as iii and from 1657 0543cm 1 to 1641 55cm 1 as v which gave the reactivity of unsaturated group like alkene for the biosorption bioaccumulation process table 4 and table 5 also exhibit the intense bands at 1470 388cm 1 which shifted to 1459 845cm 1 as iii and at 1527 442cm 1 shifted to 1517 727cm 1 as v indicated the responsibility of aromatic no2 group for the biosorption bioaccumulation process respectively another shift was found from 1449 922cm 1 to 1442 516cm 1 as iii and from 1442 516cm 1 to 1430 945cm 1 as v corresponding to the complexation of nitrogen with as iii and as v ions of the n h group kumari et al 2006 françois et al 2012 wavenumber shifted from 1366 822cm 1 to 1375 018cm 1 as iii and from 1375 018cm 1 to 1382 326cm 1 as v assigned the reactivity of carboxylate anion c o stretching for the biosorption bioaccumulation process baig et al 2010 wavenumber 1231 628cm 1 shifted to 1237 209cm 1 and 1240 024cm 1 shifted to 1237 829cm 1 assigned for so3 stretching for the biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v respectively the peaks at 1082 171cm 1 as iii and 1087 132cm 1 as v may be because of the c n stretching vibrations of amino groups which shifted to higher frequency and appeared at 1113 178cm 1 and 1114 671cm 1 respectively because of the interaction of nitrogen from the amino group with as iii and as v ions baciocchi et al 2005 giri et al 2011 wavenumber 1043 317cm 1 shifted to 1049 102cm 1 as iii and shifting from 1056 124cm 1 to 1052 959cm 1 as v indicated the si o stretching active for the biosorption bioaccumulation process the other weak biosorption bioaccumulation peak shifted from 885 581cm 1 to 901 085cm 1 as iii and from 885 581cm 1 to 900 608cm 1 corresponding to the o c o scissoring vibration of polysaccharide merroun et al 2005 pokhrel and viraraghavan 2007 the band at 590 12cm 1 figs 2 a and 603 62cm 1 fig 2 b could be attributed to the existence of fe o bond mccafferty 2010 ren et al 2012 but then it shifted to 603 62cm 1 after biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii figs 2 a and to 600 930cm 1 after biosorption bioaccumulation of as v fig 2 b respectively a typical peak at 566 978cm 1 figs 2 a and 559 38cm 1 fig 2 b could be assigned to mn o bond kohler et al 1997 parida et al 2004 and it had a different variability to 563 121cm 1 figs 2 a and 561 193cm 1 fig 2 b for biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v respectively the change in wavenumber of me o bonds after biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v indicated that both fe o and mn o bonds were responsible for both mnfe2o4 as iii and mnfe2o4 as v ren et al 2012 li et al 2010 presence of as iii and as v on the immobilized bacterial cells can be assured from the bands appeared at 797 519cm 1 figs 2 a and 828 527cm 1 fig 2 b respectively mondal et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 aryal et al 2010 it has to be cited here that a clear band was very hard to be got in the case of as iii compared with the distinctive band of as iii found at 797 519cm 1 and as v found at 828 527cm 1 this may be because of different mechanisms involved in as iii and as v biosorption bioaccumulation it should be distinguished that the as o band after biosorption bioaccumulation of arsenic was not clearly observed because of the broad overlapping peaks in this region li et al 2010 the results specified that the chemical interactions as ion exchange between the hydrogen atoms of carboxyl cooh hydroxyl oh and amide nh groups of the immobilized bacterial cells and the metal ions were mainly involved in the biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v by immobilized bacterial cells ionic radius of as iii is 0 72å and as v is 0 6å which are smaller ions so they can go into smaller pore and binding site of the surface of the immobilized bacterial cells and bind to various functional groups existing in the immobilized bacterial cells simultaneously 4 1 2 sem analysis the sem images of the prepared fresh sd mnfe2o4 composite fig 3 a and as iii acclimatized b arsenicus mtcc 4380 immobilized on surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite at stage of unloaded and loaded with as iii fig 3 b c and as v acclimatized b arsenicus mtcc 4380 immobilized on surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite at stage of unloaded and loaded with as v fig 3 d e were presented it can be realized from fig 3 a manganese ferrite mnfe2o4 particles with several diameters were randomly distributed onto the acid treated sd surface it is clear from fig 3 b and d that most of the active sites of sd mnfe2o4 composite were protected due to the formation of biofilm on it mondal et al 2008b a change in surface morphology from being smooth to rough and existence of pores specified the as iii and as v biosorption bioaccumulation on the surface and pores of sd mnfe2o4 composite providing it a rough texture the corresponding edx spectra of the unloaded and loaded immobilized bacterial cells was collected and shown in fig 3 a e the existence of iron manganese and oxygen on the unloaded composite surface and iron manganese and oxygen arsenic on the loaded immobilized bacterial cells were shown evidently this result again established the appearance of mnfe2o4 particles on the acid treated sd surface as well as biosorption bioaccumulation of arsenic on the surface of immobilized bacterial cells 4 2 column studies 4 2 1 parameters of the breakthrough curves the performance of the continuous fixed bed column system was expressed through the plot of the breakthrough curve which was the ratio of effluent metal concentration to the metal inlet concentration ce co against the flow time t the column data were applied into the mathematical theories of the column system to provide information on the influencing parameters the total removal percentage of columns as iii and as v were found to increase with the increase in biosorbent bed height table 6 at the equilibrium of the increased bed height the unadsorbed as iii and as v concentrations from the columns reduced from 949 087 to 673 142mg l and 970 146 to 651 661mg l respectively table 6 the change in the column parameters greatly affected the removal pattern 4 2 1 1 effect of bed height the contact time of treated water sample withdrawn at different heights along the bed of the bio column reactor varies though the flow rates of the influents keep same bed heights 1 5 referred to the height of sampling port p1 to p5 respectively i e 20 40 60 80 and 100cm fig 4 shows the influence of bed height on the as iii and as v removal from the treated water from fig 4 it was obvious that the normalized concentration of arsenic either as iii or as v of the treated water taken out from port p4 and p5 reduced to 0 013 and 0 0078 respectively within 3h however the normalized arsenic concentration of the samples collected from port p1 p2 and p3 after 3h were more than 0 0183 at the early phase the bacteria took more or less time for adjusting themselves in the continuous manner of process in the reactor the contact time decreased with the reduction in the bed height which caused the lower removal of as iii and as v as the bed height decreased the breakthrough for both metals occurred faster and the bed column exhausted rapider the length of the bed height strongly influenced the column breakthrough time and the biosorbent bed performance lim and aris 2014 the rise in metal uptake capacities with the increase in the bed height in the fixed bed column might be because of the improved surface area of the biosorbent which delivered more binding sites for the biosorption bioaccumulation baral et al 2008 the longer bed delayed the exhaustion time of the biosorbent which indicated that the bed was capable to operate for a longer period without changing the biosorbent while for the shorter bed the exhaustion reached faster therefore the performance dropped xu et al 2013b the breakthrough time also improved with the increase in bed height table 6 4 2 1 2 effect of flow rate flow rate is one of the significant characteristics in estimating the biosorbent for continuous treatment of metal containing wastewater on an industrial level zhao et al 1999 the effect of flow rate in the fixed bed column packed with b arsenicus mtcc 4380 immobilized on the surface of sd mnfe2o4 was examined changing the flow rate to 251 2 314 418 67 and 837 33ml h with bed height held constant at 100cm for both as iii and as v columns the ph and influent arsenic either as iii or as v concentration in the influent was 7 0 and 2000mg l respectively it was seen from fig 5 and table 6 that the removal efficiency was higher at lower flow rate for the lowest flow rate applied in the columns system 251 2ml h the breakthrough curves in the as iii and as v columns ce c0 were observed to have a gradual curve than 314 418 67 and 837 33ml h while for the highest flow rate 837 33ml h the breakthrough curve ce c0 of as iii and as v were found to increase drastically at the initial part of the operation fig 5 the speed of the influent remarkably affected the contact between the adsorbate and biosorbent this can be described by the fact that the residence of the adsorbate was more at lower flow rate and so the biosorbent got more time for binding with the metal effectively malkoc et al 2006b in other words arsenic solution either as iii or as v left the column before the equilibrium happened if the residence time of the adsorbate in the column was not high enough for the biosorption bioaccumulation equilibrium to be reached at a particular flow rate it was found that the biosorbent got easily saturated at higher flow rates hence the biosorption bioaccumulation was not complete and led to steep breakthrough results at the beginning of the operation xu et al 2013b vijayaraghavan et al 2004 the arsenic either as iii or as v uptake reduced with the increase in flow rate 4 2 1 3 effect of initial concentration in the biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v by b arsenicus mtcc 4380 immobilized on the surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite a change in inlet arsenic either as iii or as v concentration influenced the operating characteristics of the fixed bed column in order to establish the optimum performance of the continuous fixed bed system the initial concentrations of as iii and as v were varied to 2000 3000 4000 and 5000mg l at 251 2ml h flow rate and 100cm bed height fig 6 at the maximum arsenic concentration 5000mg l b arsenicus mtcc 4380 immobilized on the surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite bed saturated quickly leading to earlier breakthrough and exhaustion time the equilibrium uptake of as iii and as v ions were observed to rise with the increase in initial concentrations table 6 the unadsorbed metal concentrations at the equilibrium also showed increased values along with the higher initial concentrations table 6 maximum bed capacities for different initial as iii and as v concentration at 2000 3000 4000 and 5000mg l were 87 573 104 648 111 349 and 115 011mg g and 88 99 108 9 114 425 and 117 087mg g respectively this indicated that the bed was saturated faster when higher amounts of arsenic ions were introduced into the bio column reactor the driving force for the biosorption bioaccumulation was the concentration difference of arsenic either as iii or as v ions on the immobilized bacterial cells and that in the solution aksu and gönen 2004 so the high driving force because of high arsenic ion concentration resulted in improved column performance for the as iii and as v columns 2000 3000 4000 and 5000mg l initial concentrations experienced exhaustion after 1 breakthrough fig 6 higher the arsenic ion concentration higher is the adsorbent usage rate and so higher is the value of adsorbent exhaustion rate malkoc et al 2006a from the observation b arsenicus mtcc 4380 immobilized on the surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite was likely to be favourable for biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v however the column performances were initially fast for the higher loading of as iii and as v ions and remained constant at an equilibrium after the removal efficiency started to decrease malkoc et al 2006b galendar and younesi 2013 4 2 2 biosorption bioaccumulation modelling for breakthrough curve 4 2 2 1 adams bohart model adams bohart model was used for describing the initial part of the curve the concentration ce 0 5c0 i e upto 50 breakthrough goel et al 2005 xu et al 2013b this model predicted the column performance parameters maximum saturation concentration of the metals n0 and the adams bohart rate constant kab by including the bed height flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration of the column system presented in table 7 the results specified that they were not all suitable fits with correlation coefficients adjusted r square r 2 ranging from 0 82613 to 0 89117 as iii and from 0 81606 to 0 90939 as v and error values reduced chi square χ2 ranging from 0 01593 to 0 02798 as iii and from 0 01262 to 0 02798 as v and root mse rmse ranging from 0 12622 to 0 16726 as iii and from 0 11236 to 0 16726 as v table 7 the breakthrough curves predicted from adams bohart model were compared with the experimental points and exhibited in fig 7 a fig 8 a and fig 9 a it was clear from fig 7 a fig 8 a and fig 9 a and table 7 that there was a poor agreement between the experimental points and predicted values it signified that adams bohart model was unable to predict the initial process of the present system at all working conditions meanwhile the value of saturation concentration n0 decreased with the increase in bed height because more sites are available for biosorption bioaccumulation of arsenic either as iii or as v with the increase in bed height lim and aris 2014 the value of n0 also increased with the increase in flow rate and initial arsenic concentration for both as iii and as v ions when the flow rate was increased the volume of adsorbate entered into the column was higher and the bed was saturated earlier with a higher load of metals this condition was also applicable for increasing the initial inlet concentration the biosorbent bed in the column achieved comparative exhaustion as the metal ions loading was higher these findings showed that the biosorption bioaccumulation kinetic was contributed by the physical mass transfer of the column system lim and aris 2014 xu et al 2013b in addition the kinetic constant kab decreased with the increase in bed height and flow rate however it increased with the increase in initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration the kinetic constant kab increased with increasing the flow rate revealed that the overall system kinetics was dominated by external mass transfer in the initial part of bio column for biosorption bioaccumulation aksu and gönen 2004 karimi et al 2012 therefore under these conditions initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentrations need to be lower while the flow rate should be higher for better capacity of the column n0 and lower kinetic constant i e minimum resistance these results in terms of both the value of the parameters and the duplication of the experimental results using adams bohart model were analogous to those reported by other researcher investigating on distinct adsorbate adsorbent system masukume et al 2014 although adams bohart model delivered a simple and comprehensive approach for estimating the biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v its validity was restricted in the range of conditions used chen et al 2012 karimi et al 2012 4 2 2 2 wolborska model wolborska model was used to describe the initial part of the breakthrough curve the concentration ce 0 5c0 i e up to 50 breakthrough aksu and gönen 2004 this model predicted the column performance parameters maximum saturation concentration of the metals n0 and the kinetic coefficient of the external mass transfer βa by including the bed height flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration of the column system presented in table 8 the results specified that they were not all satisfactory fits with coefficient correlation adjusted r square r 2 ranging from 0 82613 to 0 89117 as iii and from 0 83139 to 0 9137 as v and error values reduced chi square χ2 ranging from 0 01593 to 0 29086 as iii and from 0 01468 to 0 02798 as v and root mse rmse ranging from 0 12622 to 0 16726 as iii and from 0 11236 to 0 16726 as v table 8 the breakthrough curves predicted from wolborska model were compared with the experimental points and presented in fig 7 b fig 8 b and fig 9 b it was clear from fig 7 b fig 8 b and fig 9 b and table 8 that there was a poor agreement between the experimental points and predicted values it specified that wolborska model was not applicable to predict the initial process of the present system at all operating conditions meanwhile the value of βa increased with the increase in flow rare for arsenic either as iii or as v biosorption bioaccumulation because an increased turbulence reduced the film boundary layer surrounding the immobilized bacterial cells aksu and gönen 2004 sağ and aktay 2001 singh et al 2009 furthermore maximum adsorption capacity n0 increased with increasing the flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration but decreased with increasing the bed height for both as iii or as v ions the migration velocity increased with increasing the flow rate these results in terms of both the value of the parameters and the replica of the experimental results through wolborska model were analogous to those described by other researcher studying on distinct adsorbate adsorbent system aksu and gönen 2004 singh et al 2012 deliyanni et al 2009 hamdaoui 2009 although wolbraska model provided a simple and comprehensive approach to run and evaluate adsorption column tests but its validity was restricted in the range of conditions used aksu and gönen 2004 4 2 2 3 yoon nelson model yoon nelson model was applied in the current work to predict the breakthrough activities this model is known to be a simple theoretical model because less column data is needed for the construction of the model values yahaya et al 2011 pilli et al 2012 the values of kyn and τ were achieved from the non linearized yoon nelson equation for predicting the rate constant and time required for 50 adsorbate breakthrough by including the bed height flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration of the column system presented in table 9 the results specified that they were all suitable fits with coefficient correlation adjusted r square r 2 ranging from 0 98668 to 0 99879 as iii and from 0 98591 to 0 99846 as v and error values reduced chi square χ2 ranging from 0 01593 to 0 29086 as iii and from 0 00023 to 0 00182 as v and root mse rmse ranging from 0 01384 to 0 04145 as iii and from 0 01518 to 0 04262 as v table 9 the breakthrough curves predicted from yoon nelson model were compared with the experimental points and presented in fig 7 c fig 8 c and fig 9 c it was clear from fig 7 c fig 8 c and fig 9 c and table 9 that there was a good agreement between the experimental points and predicted values it indicated that yoon nelson model was applicable for describing the behaviour of the biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v in fixed bed bio column at all conditions examined yoon nelson model rate constant kyn usually decreased with the increase in the bed height but increased with the increase in flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii and as v concentration the highest value of the rate constant at higher initial arsenic either as iii and as v concentration can be related to the increasing driving forces which controlled the mass transfer in the liquid phase calero et al 2009 aksu and gönen 2006 however τ representing the time required for 50 breakthrough was found to be considerably increased with increasing the bed height due to slower saturation of the column at higher bed height lakshmipathya and sarada 2015 nevertheless τ values was found to be significantly decreasing with increasing flow rate and initial influent arsenic either as iii and as v concentration this was because of the fact that saturation of the column was achieved more rapidly calero et al 2009 these results in terms of both the value of the parameters and the replica of the experimental results through yoon and nelson model were analogous to those achieved by other researchers investigating on different adsorbate adsorbent systems hamdaoui 2006 lakshmipathya and sarada 2015 long et al 2014 yoon nelson predicted that the 50 breakthrough for as iii and as v in the bed height of 100cm were at 46 59 and 47 155h respectively table 9 as iii and as v in the 100cm bed columns did not achieve 50 after 24h of operation with the prediction of this model the breakthrough time can be estimated in this case these results indicated that this model was preferable for the metals biosorption bioaccumulation in a longer bed column lim and aris 2014 4 2 2 4 thomas model thomas model was applied between the breakthrough time and the saturation time in the column calero et al 2009 this model predicted the column performance parameters thomas rate constant kth and maximum solid phase concentration q0 by including the bed height flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration of the column system presented in table 10 the results specified that they were all suitable fits with coefficient correlation adjusted r square r 2 ranging from 0 99141 to 0 99879 as iii and from 0 99308 to 0 99846 as v and error values error values reduced chi square χ2 ranging from 0 00019 to 0 00126 as iii and from 0 00023 to 0 00096 as v and root mse rmse ranging from 0 01384 to 0 03549 as iii and from 0 01518 to 0 03105 as v table 10 the breakthrough curves predicted from thomas model were compared with the experimental points and exhibited in fig 7 d fig 8 d and fig 9 d it was clear from fig 7 d fig 8 d and fig 9 d and table 10 that there was a suitable agreement between the experimental points and predicted values which proposes that thomas a model was applicable for the simulation of whole breakthrough curve at all operating conditions and external and internal diffusion are not the limiting steps the thomas rate constant kth increased with increasing the flow rate however it decreased with increasing the bed height and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration the decrease of kth with increasing the bed height was because of the increase in mass transport resistance with the increase in the bed height of columns furthermore the mass transport resistance was proportional to the axial dispersion and the thickness of the liquid film on the particle surface debnath et al 2010 medvidović et al 2006 the highest kth value at the lowest initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration indicated that the column biosorption bioaccumulation of the species was kinetically favourable at lower levels of contamination debnath et al 2010 the maximum solid phase concentration qth decreased with the increase in the bed height but it increased with the increase in the flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration the sensitivity of the thomas model constants with the variations of the liquid flow rates and the existence of a maximum qth values as the flow rate increased showed that the controlled rate step was shifted from external to internal mass transfer limitations and the model was competent to predict it kafshgari et al 2013 the maximum adsorption capacity qth value increased with the increase in arsenic either as iii or as v loading table 10 this condition can be attributed to the high driving force due to the high amount of metal ions perforated in the biosorbent bed olgun et al 2013 gong et al 2015 and also because of the reduction of liquid film thickness at the solid liquid interface with the increase in initial concentration of the adsorbates in solution debnath et al 2010 these results in terms of both the value of the parameters and the replica of the experimental results through thomas model were similar to those reported by other researcher studying on distinct adsorbate adsorbent lim and aris 2014 lakshmipathya and sarada 2015 long et al 2014 suksabye et al 2008 kofa et al 2015 as it was formerly clarified thomas model assumed langmuir adsorption and second order reversible reaction kinetics and was appropriate for adsorption processes where the external and internal diffusion processes were not the limiting step aksu and gönen 2004 vázquez et al 2009 4 2 2 5 modified dose response model modified dose response model was also applied for describing the column biosorption bioaccumulation results the values of model constants amdr and bmdr were obtained from the non linearized modified dose response equation by including the bed height flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration of the column system presented in table 11 the results specified that they were all reasonably well fits with coefficient correlation adjusted r square r 2 ranging from 0 98099 to 0 99661 as iii and from 0 97895 to 0 99768 as v and error values reduced chi square χ2 ranging from 0 00054 to 0 00265 as iii and from 0 00036 to 0 0521 as v and root mse rmse ranging from 0 02315 to 0 05151 as iii and from 0 00187 to 0 04844 as v table 11 the breakthrough curves predicted from modified dose response model were compared with the experimental points and presented in fig 7 e fig 8 e and fig 9 e it was clear from fig 7 e fig 8 e and fig 9 e and table 11 that there was a good agreement between the experimental points and predicted values it indicated that modified dose response model was applicable for describe the behaviour of the biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v in fixed bed bio column at all conditions examined analogous to thomas and yoon nelson models the parameters of modified dose response model also varied with changing experimental conditions hamdaoui 2006 the value of the arsenic either as iii or as v concentration in the solid phase qmdr was very analogous to the one acquired from thomas model modified dose response model reproduced the whole curve at all conditions examined with the exception of higher initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentrations these results in terms of both the value of the parameters and the replica of the experimental results through modified dose response model were similar to those stated by other researchers investigating on different adsorbate adsorbent systems hamdaoui 2006 calero et al 2009 lakshmipathya and sarada 2015 vijayaraghavan and prabu 2006 they specified that modified dose response model minimized the errors resulting from the application of other models particularly at lower and higher time periods of the breakthrough curve yan et al 2001 vaughan et al 2002 senthilkumar et al 2006 vijayaraghavan and prabu 2006 4 2 2 6 clark model clark model was also used for describing the column biosorption bioaccumulation data the values of model constants a and r were obtained from the non linearized clark equation by including the bed height flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration of the column system presented in table 12 the results showed that they were all suitable fits with coefficient correlation adjusted r square r 2 ranging from 0 99395 to 0 99872 as iii and from 0 99478 to 0 99884 as v and error values reduced chi square χ2 ranging from 0 00020 to 0 00089 as iii and from 0 00017 to 0 00067 as v and root mse rmse ranging from 0 0142 to 0 02978 as iii and from 0 01312 to 0 02594 as v table 12 the breakthrough curves predicted from clark model were compared with the experimental points and exhibited in fig 7 f fig 8 f and fig 9 f it was clear from fig 7 f fig 8 f and fig 9 f and table 12 that there was a good agreement between the experimental points and predicted values it signified that clark model was effective for the simulation of the whole breakthrough curve for both as iii and as v at all conditions examined with increasing the bed height values of a increased whereas values of r were opposite both values of a became smaller with increasing the flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration while values of r increased with increasing the flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration the simulated breakthrough curve at an initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration of 2000 mg l at a flow rate of 251 2ml h and for 100cm bed height was presented in fig 7 f fig 8 f and fig 9 f for this breakthrough curve the best fit equation eq 32 for as iii and eq 33 as v can be expressed as follows 32 c e c 0 1 515 1 7135 215 exp 0 176 t 0 66 33 c e c 0 1 523 1 7940 248 exp 0 176 t 0 657 these results in terms of both the value of the parameters and the replica of the experimental data through clark model were analogous to those described by other researchers studying on different adsorbate adsorbent systems aksu and gönen 2004 hamdaoui 2006 song et al 2011 4 2 3 comparison of models on the basis of the observation and correlation coefficient and error values acquired from the experimental data for the present study the strengths and weaknesses of the models applied to the present study were evaluated and summarized in table 13 overall six models were fitted well for the column data with the longest bed height as observed in fig 7 a f as the beds encountered very slow and gradual exhaustion basically the column behaviours can be predicted and assumed for further design implications and improvement works through the models applied in the current study the six models used in the present study were suitable for single component biosorption bioaccumulation all models were found to be acceptable to describe the whole or a definite part of the dynamic behaviour of the column regarding bed height flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration with except adams bohart and wolborska models the simulation of the whole breakthrough curve was effective with yoon and nelson thomas modified dose response and clark models thomas model provided information about the mass transfer between arsenic either as iii or as v solutions and the biosorbent immobilized bacterial cells which indicated the driving force under different parameters the experimental data for both as iii and as v columns were able to fit with the theoretical data obtained from yoon nelson and thomas models as the column experienced mass transfer resistance six models applied in the present study required different parameters for theoretical calculations out of six models yoon nelson needed the least parameters and theoretical data calculation the benefit of using yoon nelson model was that the mathematical application was very direct and it delivered the information of 50 column breakthrough which allowed the exhaustion period of the column to be predicted without a long duration for experimental time adams bohart and wolborska models are frequently applied for predicting the biosorption capacity of the biosorbent the data delivered from adams bohart and wolborska models can be used to provide information for a large scale effluent treatment system lim and aris 2014 however these models required extra parameters and calculation to obtain the modelling data the model frequently described the biosorption bioaccumulation that occurred by surface reaction the available sorption site and the initial part of the breakthrough dorado et al 2014 since the removal of as iii and as v ions by immobilized bacterial cells involves combination of biosorption ion exchange these models are not exactly appropriate to express the column behaviours in the present study the models applied fitted well for certain column parameters in the present study whereas some parameters were not well signified by the models because of the mass transfer resistance that occurred and also the combined removal mechanisms involved dorado et al 2014 compared to the values of maximum adsorption capacity predicted by yoon nelson model table 9 thomas model table 10 and modified dose response model table 11 at the same experimental conditions the value of maximum adsorption capacity predicted by modified dose response model was smaller than that predicted by yoon nelson thomas model the value of q0 predicted by yoon nelson model was almost similar than that predicted by thomas model both yoon nelson and thomas models were frequently overestimating the values of q0 and modified dose response model may be suitable for assessing the values of q0 yan et al 2001 however the value of q0 predicted by adams bohart model table 7 and wolborska models table 8 were significantly lower than yoon nelson thomas and modified dose response models so it can be concluded that both adams bohart model and wolborska model underestimated the values of q0 based on the of r 2 the highest value and reduced chi square χ2 and rmse the lowest value values listed in tables 7 12 at the same condition it can be concluded that both thomas and clark models can be applied for predicting the removal of as iii and as v ions by immobilized bacterial cells in fixed bed bio column reactor additionally at all conditions the predicted breakthrough curves from both clark and thomas model showed good agreement with the experimental curves fig 7 d and f fig 8 d and f and fig 9 d and f yoon nelson models also fitted well with the breakthrough curves modified dose response model were reasonable to fit the breakthrough curves however adams bohart and wolborska were not acceptable to fit the breakthrough curves various researchers investigated the metal removal by adsorption in column mode and observed that column kinetics could be described more effectively by clark model sidiras et al 2011 singh et al 2012 and also by thomas model masukume et al 2014 kofa et al 2015 vijayaraghavan and prabu 2006 setshedi et al 2014 lakshmipathya and sarada 2015 observed that based on the r2 values both thomas and yoon nelson models were found to have a better fit than adams bohart model and these two models were applied for predicting the removal of pb2 ions by watermelon rind in a fixed bed column so the present study about arsenic either as iii or as v removal in bio column biosorption biosorption had similar results 4 3 viability of bacteria after immobilization biosorbent containing 5 v v b arsenicus mtcc 4380 cells were placed on the nutrient agar plates and incubated at 30 c after 24h at this temperature bacterial cells were detected spreading away from the cut edge of the biosorbent and colony like growth small areas of butter textured growth was observed on the surface of the biosorbent the synthetic medium in the flask had turned milky also specifying significant bacterial growth in the flask this indicated that the bacterial cells survived the immobilization process scanning electron micrograph of the bacteria after 24h of growing in the liquid medium fig 10 are shown the nodules are not clearly visible in the sem the cells seem to be glued to each other it was because of more eps production which is one of the well known responses against stress 4 4 proposed mechanism of biosorption bioaccumulation of as iii and as v ions with immobilized cells the mechanism of any biosorption bioaccumulation process is very significant part to know the characteristics of the material additionally to recognize the process which supports in designing an innovative biosorbent for upcoming uses surface sites are positively charged at lower ph of the medium and so attract negatively charged as iii and as v by an electrostatic interaction or columbic force mashitah et al 1999 hansen et al 2006 mnfe2o4 is mostly responsible to develop the charge on the surface of biosorbent while sd mnfe2o4 composite comes in contact with water the surfaces of both b arsenicus mtcc 4380 and sd mnfe2o4 composite fulfil the coordination shells with the present oh group with the materials under hydration giri et al 2013 with the alteration in ph these surface active oh groups may again bind or release h where the surface remains positive since the affinity of aso3 3 or h2aso3 and aso4 3 or h2aso4 anions with metal oxide is higher than that of hydroxide with metal oxide aso3 3 or h2aso3 and aso4 3 or h2aso4 can replace the hydroxide from the surface of the hydrolyzed metal oxides 34 meoh surf h3o aq meoh2 h2o where me denoted the surface of mnfe2o4 for biosorption on sd mnfe2o4 composite and surface of b arsenicus mtcc 4380 for bioaccumulation when ph 7 0 a negative charge had been developed on the surface of immobilized bacterial cells 35 meoh surf oh aq me o h2o a thus when ph 7 0 the overall mechanism of as iii or as v biosorption can be characterized in three different forms giri et al 2013 mandal et al 2011 i electrostatic interaction or columbic interaction between positively charged centre nitrogen oh and negatively charged as iii or as v in solution ii electrostatic attraction and complexation between positively charged surface hydroxyl group and h2aso3 and h2aso4 hu et al 2005 36 meoh2 h2aso3 meoh2 o3ash2 electrostatic attraction 37 meoh2 h2aso4 meoh2 o4ash2 electrostatic attraction and iii ion exchange reaction between positively charged metal centre and h2aso3 and h2aso4 38 meoh2 h2aso3 me oaso2h2 h2o ion exchange 39 meoh2 h2aso4 me oaso3h2 h2o ion exchange b again when the ph of the solution remains moderately in a neutral range ph 7 0 biosorption of as iii or as v on the neutral biosorbent surface can be defined by a ligand or ion exchange reaction mechanism which is characterized as follows giri et al 2013 mandal et al 2011 40 meoh h2aso3 me oaso2h2 oh ligand or ion exchange 41 meoh h2aso4 me oaso3h2 oh ligand or ion exchange c at ph above 7 0 the surface is hydroxylated and expressed as meo and the negatively charged surface can exchange aso3 3 or h2aso3 and aso4 3 or h2aso4 anions as follows hu et al 2005 42 meo aso3 3 h2o meoh aso3 3 oh 43 meo h2aso3 h2o meoh h2aso3 oh 44 meo aso4 3 h2o meoh aso4 3 oh 45 meo h2aso4 h2o meoh h2aso4 oh the modelling of the exact biosorption bioaccumulation of aso3 3 or h2aso3 and aso4 3 or h2aso4 on any material surface is dependent on a number of peripheral parameters for instance ph temperature initial as iii or as v concentration in addition to the density of surface functional groups present for coordination the biosorption process involves a solid phase a biological material and a liquid phase water containing a dissolved species to be sorbed a metal ion owing to higher affinity of the biological material sorbent for the metal ion sorbate the latter is attracted and bound with different mechanisms vijayaraghavan and yun 2008 different type of mechanisms involved in biosorption phenomenon on the biomass materials are microprecipitation electrostatic interaction chelation complexation ion exchange and physical adsorption by van der waals forces chemical adsorption and surface precipitation or their combinations veglio and beolchini 1997 schneider et al 2001 mosbah and sahmoune 2013 comte et al 2008 recognized that the deprotonated form of the reactive sites in cell wall mostly carboxylic phosphoric and amino groups is typically responsible for the binding of metal ions to eps it was also exhibited from ft ir studies an alternative sorption mechanism is the surface precipitation or condensation of metal hydroxides on the biosurfaces such precipitation is probable if there is an accumulation of the metal ions within the diffuse part of the electrical double layer the accumulation will occur if there is a net negative charge on the solid surface so though the concentration of the metal ion in solution may be much less than the solubility limit with respect to metal hydroxide and oxide solids the solubility limit near the solid surfaces is exceeded and precipitation on the solid surface occurs schneider et al 2001 4 5 advantage of simultaneous biosorption and bioaccumulation study the adherence of the bacterial cells to sd mnfe2o4 composite particles were found through sem studies fig 3 the cell wall structure of the microbes had numerous sites and complexity for the uptake of metal ions biosorption of as iii and as v by b arsenicus mtcc 4380 not only involved physical adsorption but also the complex formations at this point the complex involved was the metal ion with hydroxyl group of eps and the nitrogen of the chitin cell wall network and the hydrolysis of complex and precipitation of the hydrolysis product in the cell wall veglio and beolchini 1997 tsezos and volesky 1981 1982 immobilization of bacterial cells onto the surface of a non living carrier like sd mnfe2o4 composite through physical adsorption electrostatic forces or covalent bonding between the cell membrane and the carrier was a beneficial method the photomicrographs of the bacterial cells absorbed onto the surface of sd mnfe2o4 composite particles exposed that sd mnfe2o4 composite particles have many crevices which perform as a den for the microbial cells this defends the bacterial cells from direct exposure to high concentration of the poisonous metal due to which there is a rise in the metal uptake capacity of the bacterial cells mishra et al 2013 andrews and tien 1981 recommended that the formation of microbial monolayer on the surface of a solid carrier includes a complex mechanism for the removal of target element from the liquid medium this comprised the transport of substance like metal ions from liquid medium to the microbial monolayer surface leading to mass transfer biosorption of ions on the surface biochemical reaction inside the microbial monolayer film and simultaneous mass transfer and biosorption inside the biosorbent patil and paknikar 1999 thus the sbb process was found to be much more efficient than that of biosorption alone 5 conclusion in the present study continuous simultaneous biosorption and bioaccumulation operation in a fixed bed bio column was performed for the removal of as iii and as v by biofilm of b arsenicus mtcc 4380 supported on sd mnfe2o4 composite the paper exhibits that the immobilized bacterial cells could be used as an effective biosorbent for wastewater containing arsenic either as iii or as v ions the continuous laboratory scale studies recommended the following conclusions ftir analysis exhibited that the probable main functional groups involved in as iii and as v uptake on the immobilized bacterial cells were hydroxyl amide and carboxyl groups the mechanism of as iii and as v removal in as iii and as v column included ion exchange sem and edax confirmed the presence of as in immobilized bacterial cells after biosorption bioaccumulation the effect of various operational parameters such as bed heights flow rates and initial arsenic concentrations on the uptake of arsenic either as iii or as v by immobilized bacterial cells in the fixed bed bio column reactor were presented at 30 c temperature fixed bed bio column experiments exhibited that bed performance improved with the increase in the bed height and decrease in the flow rate and initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration breakthrough curve was steeper at smaller bed height higher flow rate and higher initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration the breakthrough and saturation time increased with the increase in the bed height as more binding sites were available for a given bed height higher the flow rate was lower was the breakthrough and exhaustion times this flow rate dependency can be clarified by the statement that contact time was longer for lower flow rate and therefore the interaction between arsenic either as iii or as v ions and immobilized bacterial cells was also greater alternatively the breakthrough and saturation time decreased as initial arsenic either as iii or as v concentration increased for the same flow rate and bed height since high amount of metal ions perforated in the biosorbent bed the breakthrough curve for the bed height specified that a longer bed column prolonged the life span of the bio column with a maximum capacity of 87 573 and 88 990mg g for the as iii and as v column respectively therefore suitable parameters are important for the operation of the bio column system so as to achieve optimum performance the column adsorption kinetic models were applied to the experimental data to further describe the biosorption bioaccumulation mechanism adams bohart wolborska yoon nelson thomas modified dose response and clark models were applied to experimental data acquired from dynamic studies conducted on fixed bed bio column for predicting the breakthrough curves and for estimating the column kinetic parameters the initial region of breakthrough curve was well described by both adams bohart and wolborska models while the full description of breakthrough could be accomplished by all other models at all experimental conditions thomas model showed a very good correlation for as iii and as v experimental data provided information about the mass transfer between the as iii and as v solutions and the immobilized bacterial cells which indicated the driving force under different parameters yoon nelson model also estimated the 50 breakthrough curve with minimal data required and provided the estimate breakthrough time for the column systems modified dose response model minimized the error that resulted from the application of other models particularly with lower and higher breakthrough curve times adams bohart and wolborska models permitted some mass transfer coefficients to be assessed the kinetic constant k the saturation concentration n0 the kinetic coefficient of the external mass transfer βa and the migration velocity v the generalized logistic functions of the breakthrough curves and the coefficient related to the mass transfer were acquired by applying clark model the models applied in the present study were summarized to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses for the current biosorbent and column design the column data were fitted well to yoon nelson and thomas modified dose response and clark models with the exception of that of bohart and adams and wolborska models and can be used in real time large scale industrial treatment processes it was found that both thomas and clark models fitted well to the breakthrough curves and can be applied in real time large scale industrial treatment processes so the application of the theoretical models in column study is vital to deliver further description of the column performance the column parameters exhibited the major effects in the column performance and optimum operation factors that contributed to the efficient removal of as iii and as v ions from the current study it was found that sbb process was found to be much more efficient than that of biosorption alone acknowledgements our thanks to indian institute

introduction in a drinking water quality assessment the decision making based on water quality data is a crucial issue traditionally water resource professional communicates their decision on drinking water quality status by comparing the individual parameters with guideline values while this decision is too technical and detailed without providing a whole picture of drinking water quality cude 2001 to resolve this decision making problem horton 1965 made a pioneering attempt to describe the water quality as water quality index wqi which was further improved by the national sanitation foundation nsf usa using delphi technique ott 1978 wqi is a mathematical tool to integrate the complex water quality data into a numerical score that describes the overall water quality status thereafter considerable improvements have been made based on the principle of wqi using slightly modified concepts smith 1990 dojlido et al 1994 stambuk giljanvoic 1999 pesce and wunderlin 2000 nagels et al 2001 sargaonkar and deshpande 2003 kannel et al 2007 nasirian 2007 singh et al 2008 the basic differences among these indices are the way in which their sub index development and aggregation function are chosen these indices are aimed to reflect the overall condition of water in different environmental conditions based on this fact the suitability of water quality for drinking purpose is evaluated by drinking water quality indexing system 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area mayiladuthurai in delta district of nagapattinam is situated on the north bank of the cauvery river one of the major holy rivers of tamil nadu mayiladuthurai is one of the commercial centre and fast developing cities in tamil nadu most of the inhabitants of the study area depend on groundwater for drinking purposes and various domestic needs from the study area 20 sampling stations were selected for collecting water samples from ground water resources such as bore well and open well the study area lies between latitudes 11 6 35 of north and longitudes 79 39 0 of east the study area covered mayiladuthurai kuthalam and sirkazhi taluks from the coastal eastern district of nagapattinam tamil nadu the locations of the groundwater sampling stations are represented in fig 1 and its details are given in table 1 the sampling and analyses were performed from january 2008 to december 2009 on monthly intervals totally 480 water samples were collected and analyzed in the present study the physical characteristics were measured in the location of sampling itself using

heavy metals like cr cu fe mn zn pb were measured by atomic absorption spectrometric method 2 2 drinking water quality index dwqi drinking water quality index is a mathematical tool used to transform large quantities of water quality data into a single number and the obtained single number represents the overall drinking water quality status usually water quality indices are calculated in two steps the first step is raw analytical results for selected water quality parameters having different units of measurement are transformed into unit less sub index values the second step is the obtained sub indices are then aggregated using some type of aggregation function to produce a wqi value 2 3 parameter selection in a drinking water quality assessment priority should be given to those substances which are known to be of importance to health and potability and which are known to be of present in significant concentrations in the water source who 2006a based on this fact 17 parameters were selected to study the suitability of groundwater for drinking purpose in the present study here potability related parameters such as ph ec sodium chloride sulphate alkalinity total hardness calcium magnesium and iron and health related parameters such as fluoride nitrate manganese zinc chromium lead and copper were selected 2 4 development of sub index si sub index development is one of the most important step in the concept of wqi sub indices are value functions to transform the different units and dimensions of water quality parameters to common scale in sub index development each parameter is assigned with a rating value between 0 and 100 based on its desirable and acceptable limits of guideline values prescribed by bis 2003 cpcb 2003 and who 2006b table 2 the rating of sub index 100 meant that sample had within the desirable limit while the rating of sub index 50 meant that sample attained the maximum acceptable limit other ratings were falling in between near 0 100 based on regression statistics cude 2001 boyacioglu 2007 2 5 assignment of weightage to the parameters first the temporary weight wt was assigned to each water quality parameters on the basis of its importance in drinking water quality evaluation then weight factor w can be determined by dividing the individual temporary weight of each parameter by the sum of temporary weight gupta

of drinking water quality index dwqi aggregation is another important criteria in the concept of wqi to obtain a dwqi sub indices and weight factors of all parameters are aggregated using aggregation function the famous aggregation techniques in the wqi approach are multiplicative and additive aggregation functions besides many researchers also developed some other aggregation techniques which are minimum operators smith 1990 hybrid methods dojlido et al 1994 swamee and tyagi 2000 and mixed aggregation function liou et al 2004 in this study weighted additive aggregation and weighted multiplicative aggregation were applied to aggregate the index weighted additive arithmetic drinking water quality index dwqi a was computed as described in cude 2001 2 d w q i a i 1 n s i i w i i weighted multiplicative geometric drinking water quality index dwqi g was computed as described in cude 2001 3 d w q i g i 1 n s i i w i where sii sub index value of ith parameter wi weight factor of ith parameter n total number of parameters n 17 for these conventional dwqi weight factors of the parameters were determined using an eq 1 based on temporary weights wt and the number of parameters n used in that equation is 17 which includes all of the parameters in the present study table 3 2 7 classification of drinking water quality index scores the aggregation equations produce a number between 0 and 100 with 0 indicating worst water quality and 100 indicating excellent water qualities classification of drinking water quality index scores is given in table 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of the drinking water quality status in the study area the drinking water quality index was evaluated for ground water samples which were collected from 20 sampling stations from the study area in and around mayiladuthurai of nagapattinam district of tamil nadu india by conventional reputed wqi methodologies the results of the drinking water quality indices of the study area is given in table 5 and are graphically represented in fig 2 the obtained results revealed that arithmetic dwqi scores were higher than geometric dwqi geometric dwqi exhibited low scores in most of the samples of the study area these variations in between the dwqi indices are authenticated by analysis of variance anova results on the other hand the observation from fig 2 indicates that these indices had an identical trend of increasing or decreasing scores in most of the groundwater samples of the study area the trend of these indices obeyed with correlation results table 6 displays pearson correlation co efficient values which infer that these indices exhibited a strong positive relationship with each other r 0 94 the decisions of numbers 1 19 explain the comparison status of the conventional dwq indices the dwqi scores of sample numbers 1 19 were 80 13 10 99 and 69 74 4 13 with the arithmetic dwqi 61 01 27 67 and 33 51 6 81 with the geometric dwqi these results clearly declare that the arithmetic dwqi was giving a fair quality but the geometric dwqi was describing as marginal quality for sample no 1 and arithmetic dwqi was giving a marginal quality but the geometric dwqi was describing as very poor quality for sample no 19 from the experimental results of sample no 1 the values of fluoride chromium and lead are exceeded the maximum acceptable limit of guideline values throughout the study period and total hardness calcium and magnesium are occasionally exceeded the permissible limit of guideline value these results clearly stated that the health related parameters like fluoride lead and chromium were unfit for drinking purposes therefore the geometric dwqi described its quality as marginal threatened quality for sample no 1 while arithmetic dwqi didn t express the quality in original hence it decided as fair for sample no 1 from the experimental results of sample no 19 the values of fluoride chromium and lead are exceeded the maximum acceptable limit of guideline values throughout the study period and total hardness calcium and magnesium are occasionally exceeded the permissible limit of guideline value these results clearly stated that health related parameters like fluoride lead and chromium were unfit for drinking purposes and exceedance level beyond the maximum acceptable limit is much higher than sample no 1 hence the geometric dwqi described as very poor quality for sample no 19 while the arithmetic dwqi described the quality as marginal the variations in the decisions of arithmetic and geometric dwqi confirms the statements of ott 1978 swamee and tyagi 2000 gupta et al 2003 liou et al 2004 they stated that the problem of eclipsing might occurred when the additive form arithmetic dwqi is applied in the aggregation eclipsing is said to occur when extremely poor environmental quality for at least one pollutant arithmetic dwqi under estimate the pollution and does not reflect the original condition of water it denotes that arithmetic aggregation function nullify the lower quality of few parameters meanwhile arithmetic dwqi can only express the status of higher quality parameters hence the values of arithmetic dwqi are higher in side in the case of multiplicative geometric dwqi aggregation function smith 1990 pointed out that if more number of parameters used for wqi the lower sub index value will be sensitive in aggregation which means the over estimation of pollution overall geometric dwqi was clearly described the original groundwater quality status when compared to arithmetic dwqi in the study area and it is well suited aggregation method for the study area based on the correlation results both the dwq indices are negative relationship with major cations major anions and trace elements while the arithmetic dwqi correlation results showed higher values than geometric dwqi on the other hand in the present study area the highly impacted trace elements like lead and chromium are higher relationship with geometric dwqi the drinking water quality suitability decision of the geometric dwqi is presented in fig 3 as pie chart which clearly describe that 7 groundwater samples from the study area were good for drinking purpose groundwater samples from 6 of the study area were acceptable for drinking purpose in the absence of alternate water source the remaining 87 of water samples from the study area were unfit for drinking purpose 3 2 temporal variations of the drinking water quality suitability the temporal variations of the drinking water quality during study period in the study area are given in fig 4 a b geometric dwq indices were increased during pre monsoon season of 2008 and pre monsoon summer season of 2009 due to lesser contamination and lesser ionic contribution in the groundwater on the other hand increasing concentrations of health related parameters fluoride lead chromium are decreased the drinking water quality index scores during monsoon of 2009 the chromium lead values were higher for monsoon the anthropogenic activities domestic sewage and waste water run off may be the sources for the presence of chromium lead tirkey et al 2017 higher chromium values may also be due to infiltration through the soil of large amounts of chromium received from waste water released by silk industries 4 conclusion in the present study geometric dwq indexing system is more suitable for groundwater resources of the study area than arithmetic dwq indexing system due to eclipsing phenomena the arithmetic dwqi is under estimating the pollution and it does not reflect the original condition of water the results of the water quality status in the present study proved that the geometric dwqi is optimistic which also reflects the real condition of water quality the geometric dwqi clearly identified the type of water quality impairment which helps to initiate immediate water pollution control action a detailed evaluation of the indices also confirmed that the geometric dwq indexing system showed the real drinking water quality status in the study area

conventional dwq indices the dwqi scores of sample numbers 1 19 were 80 13 10 99 and 69 74 4 13 with the arithmetic dwqi 61 01 27 67 and 33 51 6 81 with the geometric dwqi these results clearly declare that the arithmetic dwqi was giving a fair quality but the geometric dwqi was describing as marginal quality for sample no 1 and arithmetic dwqi was giving a marginal quality but the geometric dwqi was describing as very poor quality for sample no 19 from the experimental results of sample no 1 the values of fluoride chromium and lead are exceeded the maximum acceptable limit of guideline values throughout the study period and total hardness calcium and magnesium are occasionally exceeded the permissible limit of guideline value these results clearly stated that the health related parameters like fluoride lead and chromium were unfit for drinking purposes therefore the geometric dwqi described its quality as marginal threatened quality for sample no 1 while arithmetic dwqi didn t express the quality in original hence it decided as fair for sample no 1 from the experimental results of sample no 19 the values of fluoride chromium and lead are exceeded the maximum acceptable limit of guideline values throughout the study period and total hardness calcium and magnesium are occasionally exceeded the permissible limit of guideline value these results clearly stated that health related parameters like fluoride lead and chromium were unfit for drinking purposes and exceedance level beyond the maximum acceptable limit is much higher than sample no 1 hence the geometric dwqi described as very poor quality for sample no 19 while the arithmetic dwqi described the quality as marginal the variations in the decisions of arithmetic and geometric dwqi confirms the statements of ott 1978 swamee and tyagi 2000 gupta et al 2003 liou et al 2004 they stated that the problem of eclipsing might occurred when the additive form arithmetic dwqi is applied in the aggregation eclipsing is said to occur when extremely poor environmental quality for at least one pollutant arithmetic dwqi under estimate the pollution and does not reflect the original condition of water it denotes that arithmetic aggregation function nullify the lower quality of few parameters meanwhile arithmetic dwqi can only express the status of higher quality parameters hence the values of arithmetic dwqi are higher in side in the case of multiplicative geometric dwqi aggregation function smith 1990 pointed out that if more number of parameters used for wqi the lower sub index value will be sensitive in aggregation which means the over estimation of pollution overall geometric dwqi was clearly described the original groundwater quality status when compared to arithmetic dwqi in the study area and it is well suited aggregation method for the study area based on the correlation results both the dwq indices are negative relationship with major cations major anions and trace elements while the arithmetic dwqi correlation results showed higher values than geometric dwqi on the other hand in the present study area the highly impacted trace elements like lead and chromium are higher relationship with geometric dwqi the drinking water quality suitability decision of the geometric dwqi is presented in fig 3 as pie chart which clearly describe that 7 groundwater samples from the study area were good for drinking purpose groundwater samples from 6 of the study area were acceptable for drinking purpose in the absence of alternate water source the remaining 87 of water samples from the study area were unfit for drinking purpose 3 2 temporal variations of the drinking water quality suitability the temporal variations of the drinking water quality during study period in the study area are given in fig 4 a b geometric dwq indices were increased during pre monsoon season of 2008 and pre monsoon summer season of 2009 due to lesser contamination and lesser ionic contribution in the groundwater on the other hand increasing concentrations of health related parameters fluoride lead chromium are decreased the drinking water quality index scores during monsoon of 2009 the chromium lead values were higher for monsoon the anthropogenic activities domestic sewage and waste water run off may be the sources for the presence of chromium lead tirkey et al 2017 higher chromium values may also be due to infiltration through the soil of large amounts of chromium received from waste water released by silk industries 4 conclusion in the present study geometric dwq indexing system is more suitable for groundwater resources of the study area than arithmetic dwq indexing system due to eclipsing phenomena the arithmetic dwqi is under estimating the pollution and it does not reflect the original condition of water the results of the water quality status in the present study proved that the geometric dwqi is optimistic which also reflects the real condition of water quality the geometric dwqi clearly identified the type of water quality impairment which helps to initiate immediate water pollution control action a detailed evaluation of the indices also confirmed that the geometric dwq indexing system showed the real drinking water quality status in the study area

they enabled developing weapons tools artistic artifacts etc as society evolved metals started being used for many different purposes because of our strong dependence on metal consumption and due to population growth metals conversion from their natural forms into artificial and more useful ones led to the emission of huge amounts of elements into different environments and it ultimately led to the contamination of vast areas by the aforementioned species baird and cann 2011 manahan 1997 reeve 2002 accordingly special attention should be given to the emission of heavy metals which consist of metals whose densities are five times greater than water density metal species are almost everywhere and are found in everyday objects in minerals and in living beings some of them are largely explored in metallurgy whereas others participate in several extremely important metabolic reactions because of their high applicability and wide distribution these elements are easily dispersed into the environment either due to natural phenomena or to anthropogenic activity heavy metals may reach the most remote regions on earth when they are converted into their mobile forms such as dissolved species or adsorbed into suspended particulates they can be re deposited as precipitates or permeate the soil to contaminate aquifers in these regions of the planet baird and cann 2011 manahan 1997 reeve 2002 tirkey et al 2017 when the groundwater of an aquifer is contaminated by metals and the water from this aquifer is used as drinking or crop watering water by some communities individuals in these communities are under great risk of being poisoned or even die diseases associated with metal poisoning can present several deleterious effects over human health and damage different tissues organs of living beings depending on the metal species poisoning by copper at lower doses for instance can cause from nausea vomiting headaches and diarrhea to gastrointestinal bleeding hematuria intravascular hemolysis renal failure oliguria methemoglobinemia hepatocellular toxicity liver failure and cirrhosis who 2004 the recommended safe maximum copper concentration intake limit in drinking

from copper which consists of an essential element and participates in some physiological processes cadmium does not play any known role in any biochemical reactions therefore its maximum concentration limit in drinking water 0 005mgl 1 is much lower than the copper limit hashim et al 2011 society makes use of several natural resources for water supply and groundwater stands out among them unfortunately anthropogenic pollution already reached invaluable resources and contaminated groundwater with a large variety of pollutants hashim et al 2011 providing clean water to population is of crucial importance we herein understand clean water as that whose contaminants are within the specified safe concentration limits of copper and cadmium hashim et al listed thirty five techniques in their review which were developed to remediate groundwater and encompassed biological chemical or physicochemical techniques hashim et al 2011 however some authors claim that there is no ideal technique to solve all groundwater contamination issues and that decision making processes focused on selecting the most adequate techniques are complex matters and should be based on thorough case studies nevertheless some techniques are noteworthy due to their versatility therefore they should receive special attention accordingly the use of permeable reactive barriers prbs has attracted special attention this technique consists in inserting a reactive barrier into the soil so that plumes of groundwater can permeate reactive cells where heavy metals can be immobilized or converted into their less harmful forms the prb versatility lies on the range of materials constituting its reactive cells which can be adsorbent biosorbent bacteria chemical substances or even a combination of them all hashim et al 2011 obiri nyarko et al 2014 the amendment of materials substances to the soil is another approach used to perform groundwater remediation it would either sequester or convert metal species into their less toxic forms hashim et al 2011 obiri nyarko et al 2014 once again adsorbents and biosorbents emerge as promising materials to be used as amendments in groundwater remediation activated carbon biochars agricultural wastes and cellulosic materials are among the most common adsorbent biosorbent materials mainly in the case of cellulosic materials and agricultural wastes such materials have not been duly investigated in studies focused on using it to perform groundwater metal remediation despite their high potential to be applied in prbs or to be used as amendment to the soil hashim et al 2011 obiri nyarko et al 2014 the main advantage of adsorbent materials often lies on their low cost non toxicity and high availability however in many cases they need to undergo chemical modification in order to have their adsorption capacity and stability enhanced dias et al 2007 hashim et al 2011 ahmad and haseeb 2015 these materials also undergo intense heating and pyrolysis under controlled atmospheres to be produced in case of activated carbon and biochars dias et al 2007 inyang et al 2016 it possibly generates nitrogen oxide pollution during the production process this process increases the costs and makes the process not so environmentally friendly when it comes to biosorbents resulting from agricultural wastes their cellulosic structure is plenty of organic groups responsible for performing the complexation and immobilization of metal ions jorgetto et al 2015 2014 hossain et al 2012 kurniawan et al 2011 martins et al 2013 reddy et al 2011 rao and khatoon 2016 rao and khan 2017 these biosorbents share the same advantages presented by other adsorbents they can be prepared through very simple and inexpensive methods and their production dodges the need of highly energy consuming processes such as pyrolysis and chemical organofunctionalization steps in order to generate a surface with high affinity for metals jamshaid et al 2017 jorgetto et al 2013a 2013b moreover they can be of invaluable use in the poorest communities seeking access to drinking water yet with regard to the use of agricultural wastes as adsorbents it is worth obtaining highly abundant waste of significant yield accordingly malpighia emerginata d c a k a malpighia punicifolia l malpighia glabra l could be a potential material for such purpose jamaican

world de assis et al 2008 engels and brinckmann 2014 mondin et al 2010 acerola is a perennial shrub approximately 6m tall which produces drupaceous small red fruits with highly acid pulp engels and brinckmann 2014 mondin et al 2010 it is a rustic plant that grows in tropical and subtropical regions it can produce fruits all year long when it is properly irrigated de assis et al 2008 acerola

are also used by the pharmaceutical industry to produce vitamin c and cosmetics de assis et al 2008 engels and brinckmann 2014 it is not surprising that acerola has become highly commercialized worldwide due to its many applications the european union the united states and japan are its main consumers de assis et al 2008 the large scale production of acerola based products therefore generates huge amounts of agricultural waste which mostly consist of seeds its production is common in developing countries to attend the global demand however it could become an alternative to remediate groundwater in these countries the aim of the present study was to assess the use of malpighia emerginata d c seeds to extract metals from aqueous medium and to assess its adsorption properties so that acerola could be a potential low cost adsorbent alternative to remediate contaminated groundwater 2 experiment 2 1 reagent and solvents copper and cadmium solutions were prepared in nitrate salts merck germany and dissolved in ultrapure water direct q millipore the standard solutions used in atomic absorption spectrometry aas were prepared after stepwise dilution of 1000mgl 1 stock solution specsol brazil hno3 carlo erba and naoh merck germany solutions were prepared in ultrapure water 2 2 equipment and conditions metal ions were set in flame atomic absorption spectrometer faas shimadzu model aa7000 equipped with hollow cathode lamps the monochromator was adjusted to 324 7 and 228 8nm which corresponded to the most sensitive resonance lines for copper and cadmium respectively the infrared spectra were recorded in nicolet nexus 670 spectrometer containing 1 w w biomass powder through the kbr tablet method samples were scanned 200 times at resolution 4cm 1 nitrogen and sulphur quantitative determination of the adsorbent was performed through elemental microanalysis conducted in the ea1110 chns o analyzer provided by ce instruments adsorption experiments were performed in batch mode and the mixtures were stirred in magnetic stirrer ph adjustment was performed in ph meter metrohm model 827ph lab high resolution 13c nmr experiments were performed at magnetic field 9 4t in varian unity inova spectrometer samples were spun up to 5khz at magic angle condition in 7mm silicon nitride rotors the 13c nmr spectra were obtained from single pulse experiments direct polarization using π 2 pulse duration 3 0μs recycle delay 80s and collecting 3000 signals the 1h 13c cross polarization experiments were conducted by applying π 2 pulse of 3 0μs on 1h contact time 1ms and recycle delay 5s to collect 24 000 signals high power proton decoupling was applied during the acquisition period in direct and cross polarization experiments a solid adamantane sample was used as secondary standard for 13c isotropic chemical shift and to calibrate the 1h 13c cross polarization conditions scanning electron micrographs of seed particles were obtained in fei quanta 200 microscope equipped with everhart thornley as secondary electron detector the sample was dispersed in isopropanol and the suspension was dropped into a glass laminula pasted into aluminium surface stub the sample was metalized with gold to thickness 30nm after it was left to dry surface area measurements were carried out in micromeritics asap 2010 apparatus micromeritics instrument corporation containing 1 8g of biomass 2 3 point of zero charge pzc experiment malpighia emarginata seed powder was assessed in order to set the point of zero charge phpzc the experiment was performed in 25mg adsorbent and in 50ml of 0 01moll 1 nacl solutions whose ph was adjusted from 1 to 12 by using diluted hcl and naoh solutions the suspension adsorbent and specific solution was kept under stirring for 24h and ph was measured before and after the stirring stage 2 4 adsorbent preparation fruits were collect at botucatu city são paulo state brazil near our laboratory the seeds were transferred to an air circulation oven after the pulp was removed they were kept in the oven for 48h at 80 c after the drying process the seeds were grinded in knife mill and the powder was fractionated the fractions presenting particle diameter between 63 and 106µm were separated and stored in desiccator before being used in adsorption experiments these fractions were chosen because smaller particles could lead to clogging events during column experiments 2 5 adsorption experiments several parameters related to the adsorption process were investigated under batch mode in order to help better understanding the metal surface interaction the first parameter concerned the influence from the ph solution on the adsorption process in which several solutions containing the metallic species under investigation were prepared in ph range from 1 to 6 kinetic experiments were performed under different contact times from 1 to 240min in order to set the time demanded by the system to reach equilibrium the metal ion concentration in these experiments was kept constant at 50 and 25mgl 1 for copper and cadmium respectively at solution volume 2 0ml and adsorbent mass 20mg the cu ii and cd ii solutions for the isotherm study at concentration range from 1 to 400mgl 1 was stirred in the aforementioned adsorbent mass elapsed determined stirring time the suspension was filtered under vacuum and the supernatant concentration was determined through faas biomass adsorption capacity was set through eq 1 1 n f n i n s m wherein n i is the amount of metal ions mmol in the initial solution n s is the amount of metal ions mmol in the collected supernatant and m is the used cassava husks powder mass 2 6 column adsorption experiments besides the batch adsorption experiments the preconcentration of metal species using packed column was also conducted the preconcentration system is composed of two peristaltic pumps which promote flow through the system tygon tubes of internal diameter 2 79mm a commutator device and a glass column packed with the adsorbent after packing the adsorbent was isolated inside the column by inserting a glass wool in both sides and then connected to a tygon tube important parameters such as sample flow rate eluent type and concentration and adsorbent mass were investigated 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization 3 1 1 the ftir analysis several techniques were employed in order to gather information regarding material composition and surface groups the fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy analysis was applied to identify some organic groups on the material surface possibly acting as metal binding sites the ftir spectrum of the grinded malpighia emarginata seeds is shown in fig 1 the broad and intense band located at region 3400cm 1 may be assigned to o h stretch vibration the two bands located at 2916 and 2841cm 1 can be attributed to the c h2 asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration respectively other bands related to cellulose found in the material composition are located at 1460 and 898cm 1 they can be attributed to c h bending vibration and to c o c stretching at β 1 4 glycosidic linkages respectively ciolacu et al 2011 the emergence of an absorption band located at 1730cm 1 is the evidence of acid group presence such as carboxylic these groups may be responsible for adsorbing the metal species infrared absorption bands from 1245 and 1373cm 1 may be attributed to the n h stretching vibration emitted by some aromatic compounds found in the material composition castro et al 2014 3 1 2 the 13c nmr analysis the nmr spectroscopy was employed to complete the results recorded through ftir and to identify groups that are able to complex metal species from aqueous samples the most prominent feature of the 1h 13c nmr spectrum of grinded malpighia emarginata seeds fig 2 is a broad resonance in the region from 88 to 60ppm such values are associated with the carbon bonded to the hydroxyl groups c oh which are found in large amounts in several biomass compounds this signal may be also related to the c o bonds happening in phenolic compounds recorded in biomass composition vendramini and trugo 2004 the existence of carboxylic and phenolic acids may be attested by peaks in the region 174 172ppm the resonances in region 152 9 143 9ppm may be assigned to the presence of n c s bonds thiazole groups resulting from the presence of some amino acids such as thiamine dembitsky et al 2011 silva et al 2015 the peaks observed from 129 2 to 131 7ppm may be attributed to the presence of unsaturated aliphatic compounds and to c c bonds of aromatic structures as well as to the peak located at resonance 56 7ppm which may be attributed to amide groups from peptide bonds c n ribeiro and souza 2007 3 1 3 sem edx and elemental analyses the adsorbent material was subjected to sem analysis in order to assess particle morphology fig 3 according to these images it is possible observing that the morphology is not homogeneous fact that was expected since the seeds were grinded in knife mill and fractionated despite the particle size particles recording diameter between 63 and 106µm were separated and used in the experiment fig 3 it is possible noticing that small particles were probably grouped because of the physical forces of attraction or of the sample preparation stage qualitative results from the elemental analysis performed through edx are shown in fig 3 results indicate the presence of oxygen nitrogen and sulphur atoms which may also be involved in the adsorption process the quantitative elemental microanalysis performed in ea1110 chns o analyzer indicated 47 34 carbon 4 21 hydrogen and 2 14 nitrogen thus corroborating the results recorded through ftir and 13c nmr 3 1 4 surface area and porosity measurements surface area and pore distribution size are properties of fundamental importance to the determination of material adsorption behavior accordingly malpighia emarginata seed powder was characterized through the bet method according to fig 4 the nitrogen adsorption isotherm is of type ii which is related to the physisorption of nitrogen molecules in nonporous or macroporous adsorbent the specific surface area of grinded malpighia emarginata seeds is 0 96 0 01m2 g 1 this value complies with other adsorbents and with materials mainly composed of cellulose jorgetto et al 2014 silva et al 2015 zvinowanda et al 2009 moreover this analysis also indicated that biosorbent seed particles are practically non porous as indicated by the pore distribution behavior graph fig 4 3 1 5 the phpzc determination the point of zero charge phpzc was investigated in order to identify the ph capable of neutralizing the material surface charge the phpzc can be found where the curve phfinal verses phinitial intersects the straight line corresponding to phinitial phfinal with regard to the present material the phpzc is located at ph 6 adsorption sites on the material surface are negatively charged when values are above ph 6 in case of values bellow ph 6 adsorption sites are positively charged and the metal adsorption process is not favorable 3 2 adsorption studies applied to acerola 3 2 1 the ph effect experiments were carried out by using ph ranging from 1 to 6 in order to investigate the influence of ph solution on the adsorption process the experiment made it possible correlating metal adsorption according to the ph of the solution with results recorded through phpzc determination fig 5 evidences that cu ii and cd ii adsorption capacity at ph 1 was lower than 0 01mmolg 1 adsorption sites on the material surface are protonated by h species under acidic conditions therefore the chelating groups are not available to coordinate metal species adsorption capacity increases as ph increases equilibrium was attained at ph 5 6 results of both metal species comply with the point of zero charge ph 6 and other related studies guiza 2017 hossain et al 2014 the adsorbent surface charge is zero and adsorption is favored in this ph region 3 2 2 kinetic studies the time required by the system adsorbent adsorbate to reach equilibrium is another important parameter that must be known in order to be applied to the adsorbent during the solid phase extraction process the adsorption kinetic of cu ii and cd ii was investigated in dynamic contact time interval from 1 to 240min fig 6 inset shows that equilibrium was attained within few minutes of contact time which implies fast kinetic in order to better understand the cu ii and cd ii adsorption process kinetic isotherm data were analyzed to assess the pseudo second order kinetic model ho and ofomaja 2006 whose adsorption capacity n ft mmolg 1 at a given contact time t is given through 2 t n f t 1 k n f 2 1 n f t wherein n f corresponds to the adsorption capacity at equilibrium mmolg 1 and k is the kinetic constant of pseudo second order mmolg 1 min 1 it was possible finding the straight line represented in fig 6 inset by plotting the values of t n ft versus t the determination coefficients r2 were 0 9978 and 0 9998 for cu ii and cd ii respectively this model also assumes that chemisorption is the mechanism responsible for removing the metallic species from the aqueous solutions based on such information it is possible inferring that the organic groups identified on the material surface are coordinating the metallic species through covalent bond 3 2 3 maximum adsorption capacity determination the adsorbent adsorption capacity was determined based on the equilibrium of adsorption isotherms better equilibrium data compliance was verified in the langmuir adsorption model which implies a adsorbate monolayer on the material surface and meets the prevalent kinetic model set for the present system adsorption data were calculated through the langmuir linearized model in order to find the respective maximum adsorption capacity values of the investigated cations which were represented through eq 3 3 c s n f 1 k t n fmax 1 n fmax c s wherein c s represents the supernatant concentration mmoll 1 n f is the adsorption capacity of the determined initial analyte concentration mmolg 1 k corresponds to the langmuir model s constant and n fmax is the calculated maximum adsorption experiment associated with monolayer formation mmol g 1 the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated for both species since the angular coefficient b was equal to 1 n fmax this calculation showed 0 103mmolg 1 cu ii and 0 098mmolg 1 cd ii the elevated linear correlation coefficient was found 0 989 and 0 993 for cu ii and cd ii respectively and the best fit straight line equations for both metals were y 6 3142x 9 7118 for cu ii and y 9 0991x 10 151 for cd ii d ii the isotherm data and their linearized forms are depicted in fig 7 data from other adsorbent types were compiled in table 1 in order to compare the performance of malpighia emarginata seeds used as adsorbent to remove cu ii and cd ii from the aqueous medium malpighia emarginata seeds present better adsorption capacity than other adsorbents these results are not relevant just because they are based on the achieved adsorption capacity but because they evidence the possibility of using a low cost material to remove toxic metals from water and to improve the access to drinking water 3 2 4 preconcentration experiments conducted through packed column materials showing the adsorption properties of metal species may be useful to set metal trace in water subjected to preconcentration procedures fig 8 presents results recorded during cu ii system optimization in aqueous medium the preconcentration system was optimized through the adoption of a univariate procedure in which a single parameter was changed while others remained constant aliquots of 50ml copper solution 0 01mgl 1 were used in the optimization procedure the solution flow rate was kept constant 1 0mlmin 1 when it was not specified the herein used eluent consisted of 1 0ml of hno3 solution 1 0moll 1 according to fig 8 it is possible noticing that the adsorbent mass did not exert influence on the preconcentration factor three adsorbent doses were tested and results showed that the 10 mg aliquot would be enough to assure a preconcentration factor of approximately 41 fold for the volume and concentration of the used solution sample accordingly in order to complete the optimization process 10mg of adsorbent mass was selected for further investigations experiments related to sample percolation flow rate were carried out under 1 0 and 2 0mlmin 1 no difference was observed between these flow rates and the faster flow was selected in order to reduce the analysis time some articles published in the literature used a mixture of hcl and thiourea as eluent to possibly improve the efficiency in removing metals from the adsorbent because thiourea molecules present lewis basis in their structure they may coordinate metals after desorption in order to prevent them from recombining with the solid phase results recorded during preconcentration system optimization showed that 1 0moll 1 of nitric acid solution was more efficient than the thiourea solution this is the reason why this solution was chosen to be the eluent in subsequent steps the eluent concentration was also investigated and the results evidenced that 1 0moll 1 of solution is enough to quantitatively remove metals from the column the eluent volume was not investigated since 1 0ml is the minimum volume to enable reliable determination through flame atomic absorption although higher volumes also enable reliable determination a low preconcentration factor would result from the dilution process the system was applied to cd ii preconcentration after optimization by using the same conditions adopted for cu ii results indicated that a 40 fold enrichment factor was achieved therefore the present material could be an important tool to trace metal determination through flame atomic absorption spectrometry 4 conclusions results indicate that the material surface presents chelating organic groups able to coordinate metal species in aqueous samples it was possible identifying organic groups possibly involved in coordination processes by applying the 13c nmr ftir and the elemental analysis although its adsorption capacity is similar to that of other related materials it may be an interesting alternative to remove metal species from water by using a low cost and green procedure besides its use to remove metals malpighia emarginata seeds can be also used to assist cu ii and cd ii trace determination through faas which presents lower cost in comparison to gfaas

of crucial importance we herein understand clean water as that whose contaminants are within the specified safe concentration limits of copper and cadmium hashim et al listed thirty five techniques in their review which were developed to remediate groundwater and encompassed biological chemical or physicochemical techniques hashim et al 2011 however some authors claim that there is no ideal technique to solve all groundwater contamination issues and that decision making processes focused on selecting the most adequate techniques are complex matters and should be based on thorough case studies nevertheless some techniques are noteworthy due to their versatility therefore they should receive special attention accordingly the use of permeable reactive barriers prbs has attracted special attention this technique consists in inserting a reactive barrier into the soil so that plumes of groundwater can permeate reactive cells where heavy metals can be immobilized or converted into their less harmful forms the prb versatility lies on the range of materials constituting its reactive cells which can be adsorbent biosorbent bacteria chemical substances or even a combination of them all hashim et al 2011 obiri nyarko et al 2014 the amendment of materials substances to the soil is another approach used to perform groundwater remediation it would either sequester or convert metal species into their less toxic forms hashim et al 2011 obiri nyarko et al 2014 once again adsorbents and biosorbents emerge as promising materials to be used as amendments in groundwater remediation activated carbon biochars agricultural wastes and cellulosic materials are among the most common adsorbent biosorbent materials mainly in the case of cellulosic materials and agricultural wastes such materials have not been duly investigated in studies focused on using it to perform groundwater metal remediation despite their high potential to be applied in prbs or to be used as amendment to the soil hashim et al 2011 obiri nyarko et al 2014 the main advantage of adsorbent materials often lies on their low cost non toxicity and high availability however in many cases they need to undergo chemical modification in order to have their adsorption capacity and stability enhanced dias et al 2007 hashim et al 2011 ahmad and haseeb 2015 these materials also undergo intense heating and pyrolysis under controlled atmospheres to be produced in case of activated carbon and biochars dias et al 2007 inyang et al 2016 it possibly generates nitrogen oxide pollution during the production process this process increases the costs and makes the process not so environmentally friendly when it comes to biosorbents resulting from agricultural wastes their cellulosic structure is plenty of organic groups responsible for performing the complexation and immobilization of metal ions jorgetto et al 2015 2014 hossain et al 2012 kurniawan et al 2011 martins et al 2013 reddy et al 2011 rao and khatoon 2016 rao and khan 2017 these biosorbents share the same advantages presented by other adsorbents they can be prepared through very simple and inexpensive methods and their production dodges the need of highly energy consuming processes such as pyrolysis and chemical organofunctionalization steps in order to generate a surface with high affinity for metals jamshaid et al 2017 jorgetto et al 2013a 2013b moreover they can be of invaluable use in the poorest communities seeking access to drinking water yet with regard to the use of agricultural wastes as adsorbents it is worth obtaining highly abundant waste of significant yield accordingly malpighia emerginata d c a k a malpighia punicifolia l malpighia glabra l could be a potential material for such purpose jamaican cherry or barbados cherry commonly known as acerola have its fruits and derivatives manufactured and traded and its market has been growing fast in recent years de assis et al 2008 the plant is natural to countries located in the southern north america central america and northern south america but was introduced in asia india and brazil which is nowadays the greatest acerola producer in the world de assis et al 2008 engels and brinckmann 2014 mondin et al 2010 acerola is a perennial shrub approximately 6m tall which produces drupaceous small red fruits with highly acid pulp engels and brinckmann 2014 mondin et al 2010 it is a rustic plant that grows in tropical and subtropical regions it can produce fruits all year long when it is properly irrigated de assis et al 2008 acerola fruits are mainly used in the food industry to produce juice ice cream liqueur soft drinks gum fruit conserve jelly yogurt flavor enhancers preservative antioxidants etc but their derivatives extracts are also used by the pharmaceutical industry to produce vitamin c and cosmetics de assis et al 2008 engels and brinckmann 2014 it is not surprising that acerola has become highly commercialized worldwide due to its many applications the european union the united states and japan are its main consumers de assis et al 2008 the large scale production of acerola based products therefore generates huge amounts of agricultural waste which mostly consist of seeds its production is common in developing countries to attend the global demand however it could become an alternative to remediate groundwater in these countries the aim of the present study was to assess the use of malpighia emerginata d c seeds to extract metals from aqueous medium and to assess its adsorption properties so that acerola could be a potential low cost adsorbent alternative to remediate contaminated groundwater 2 experiment 2 1 reagent and solvents copper and cadmium solutions were prepared in nitrate salts merck germany and dissolved in ultrapure water direct q millipore the standard solutions used in atomic absorption spectrometry aas were prepared after stepwise dilution of 1000mgl 1 stock solution specsol brazil hno3 carlo erba and naoh merck germany solutions were prepared in ultrapure water 2 2 equipment and conditions metal ions were set in flame atomic absorption spectrometer faas shimadzu model aa7000 equipped with hollow cathode lamps the monochromator was adjusted to 324 7 and 228 8nm which corresponded to the most sensitive resonance lines for copper and cadmium respectively the infrared spectra were recorded in nicolet nexus 670 spectrometer containing 1 w w biomass powder through the kbr tablet method samples were scanned 200 times at resolution 4cm 1 nitrogen and sulphur quantitative determination of the adsorbent was performed through elemental microanalysis conducted in the ea1110 chns o analyzer provided by ce instruments adsorption experiments were performed in batch mode and the mixtures were stirred in magnetic stirrer ph adjustment was performed in ph meter metrohm model 827ph lab high resolution 13c nmr experiments were performed at magnetic field 9 4t in varian unity inova spectrometer samples were spun up to 5khz at magic angle condition in 7mm silicon nitride rotors the 13c nmr spectra were obtained from single pulse experiments direct polarization using π 2 pulse duration 3 0μs recycle delay 80s and collecting 3000 signals the 1h 13c cross polarization experiments were conducted by applying π 2 pulse of 3 0μs on 1h contact time 1ms and recycle delay 5s to collect 24 000 signals high power proton decoupling was applied during the acquisition period in direct and cross polarization experiments a solid adamantane sample was used as secondary standard for 13c isotropic chemical shift and to calibrate the 1h 13c cross polarization conditions scanning electron micrographs of seed particles were obtained in fei quanta 200 microscope equipped with everhart thornley as secondary electron detector the sample was dispersed in isopropanol and the suspension was dropped into a glass laminula pasted into aluminium surface stub the sample was metalized with gold to thickness 30nm after it was left to dry surface area measurements were carried out in micromeritics asap 2010 apparatus micromeritics instrument corporation containing 1 8g of biomass 2 3 point of zero charge pzc experiment malpighia emarginata seed powder was assessed in order to set the point of zero charge phpzc the experiment was performed in 25mg adsorbent and in 50ml of 0 01moll 1 nacl solutions whose ph was adjusted from 1 to 12 by using diluted hcl and naoh solutions the suspension adsorbent and specific solution was kept under stirring for 24h and ph was measured before and after the stirring stage 2 4 adsorbent preparation fruits were collect at botucatu city são paulo state brazil near our laboratory the seeds were transferred to an air circulation oven after the pulp was removed they were kept in the oven for 48h at 80 c after the drying process the seeds were grinded in knife mill and the powder was fractionated the fractions presenting particle diameter between 63 and 106µm were separated and stored in desiccator before being used in adsorption experiments these fractions were chosen because smaller particles could lead to clogging events during column experiments 2 5 adsorption experiments several parameters related to the adsorption process were investigated under batch mode in order to help better understanding the metal surface interaction the first parameter concerned the influence from the ph solution on the adsorption process in which several solutions containing the metallic species under investigation were prepared in ph range from 1 to 6 kinetic experiments were performed under different contact times from 1 to 240min in order to set the time demanded by the system to reach equilibrium the metal ion concentration in these experiments was kept constant at 50 and 25mgl 1 for copper and cadmium respectively at solution volume 2 0ml and adsorbent mass 20mg the cu ii and cd ii solutions for the isotherm study at concentration range from 1 to 400mgl 1 was stirred in the aforementioned adsorbent mass elapsed determined stirring time the suspension was filtered under vacuum and the supernatant concentration was determined through faas biomass adsorption capacity was set through eq 1 1 n f n i n s m wherein n i is the amount of metal ions mmol in the initial solution n s is the amount of metal ions mmol in the collected supernatant and m is the used cassava husks powder mass 2 6 column adsorption experiments besides the batch adsorption experiments the preconcentration of metal species using packed column was also conducted the preconcentration system is composed of two peristaltic pumps which promote flow through the system tygon tubes of internal diameter 2 79mm a commutator device and a glass column packed with the adsorbent after packing the adsorbent was isolated inside the column by inserting a glass wool in both sides and then connected to a tygon tube important parameters such as sample flow rate eluent type and concentration and adsorbent mass were investigated 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization 3 1 1 the ftir analysis several techniques were employed in order to gather information regarding material composition and surface groups the fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy analysis was applied to identify some organic groups on the material surface possibly acting as metal binding sites the ftir spectrum of the grinded malpighia emarginata seeds is shown in fig 1 the broad and intense band located at region 3400cm 1 may be assigned to o h stretch vibration the two bands located at 2916 and 2841cm 1 can be attributed to the c h2 asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration respectively other bands related to cellulose found in the material composition are located at 1460 and 898cm 1 they can be attributed to c h bending vibration and to c o c stretching at β 1 4 glycosidic linkages respectively ciolacu et al 2011 the emergence of an absorption band located at 1730cm 1 is the evidence of acid group presence such as carboxylic these groups may be responsible for adsorbing the metal species infrared absorption bands from 1245 and 1373cm 1 may be attributed to the n h stretching vibration emitted by some aromatic compounds found in the material composition castro et al 2014 3 1 2 the 13c nmr analysis the nmr spectroscopy was employed to complete the results recorded through ftir and to identify groups that are able to complex metal species from aqueous samples the most prominent feature of the 1h 13c nmr spectrum of grinded malpighia emarginata seeds fig 2 is a broad resonance in the region from 88 to 60ppm such values are associated with the carbon bonded to the hydroxyl groups c oh which are found in large amounts in several biomass compounds this signal may be also related to the c o bonds happening in phenolic compounds recorded in biomass composition vendramini and trugo 2004 the existence of carboxylic and phenolic acids may be attested by peaks in the region 174 172ppm the resonances in region 152 9 143 9ppm may be assigned to the presence of n c s bonds thiazole groups resulting from the presence of some amino acids such as thiamine dembitsky et al 2011 silva et al 2015 the peaks observed from 129 2 to 131 7ppm may be attributed to the presence of unsaturated aliphatic compounds and to c c bonds of aromatic structures as well as to the peak located at resonance 56 7ppm which may be attributed to amide groups from peptide bonds c n ribeiro and souza 2007 3 1 3 sem edx and elemental analyses the adsorbent material was subjected to sem analysis in order to assess particle morphology fig 3 according to these images it is possible observing that the morphology is not homogeneous fact that was expected since the seeds were grinded in knife mill and fractionated despite the particle size particles recording diameter between 63 and 106µm were separated and used in the experiment fig 3 it is possible noticing that small particles were probably grouped because of the physical forces of attraction or of the sample preparation stage qualitative results from the elemental analysis performed through edx are shown in fig 3 results indicate the presence of oxygen nitrogen and sulphur atoms which may also be involved in the adsorption process the quantitative elemental microanalysis performed in ea1110 chns o analyzer indicated 47 34 carbon 4 21 hydrogen and 2 14 nitrogen thus corroborating the results recorded through ftir and 13c nmr 3 1 4 surface area and porosity measurements surface area and pore distribution size are properties of fundamental importance to the determination of material adsorption behavior accordingly malpighia emarginata seed powder was characterized through the bet method according to fig 4 the nitrogen adsorption isotherm is of type ii which is related to the physisorption of nitrogen molecules in nonporous or macroporous adsorbent the specific surface area of grinded malpighia emarginata seeds is 0 96 0 01m2 g 1 this value complies with other adsorbents and with materials mainly composed of cellulose jorgetto et al 2014 silva et al 2015 zvinowanda et al 2009 moreover this analysis also indicated that biosorbent seed particles are practically non porous as indicated by the pore distribution behavior graph fig 4 3 1 5 the phpzc determination the point of zero charge phpzc was investigated in order to identify the ph capable of neutralizing the material surface charge the phpzc can be found where the curve phfinal verses phinitial intersects the straight line corresponding to phinitial phfinal with regard to the present material the phpzc is located at ph 6 adsorption sites on the material surface are negatively charged when values are above ph 6 in case of values bellow ph 6 adsorption sites are positively charged and the metal adsorption process is not favorable 3 2 adsorption studies applied to acerola 3 2 1 the ph effect experiments were carried out by using ph ranging from 1 to 6 in order to investigate the influence of ph solution on the adsorption process the experiment made it possible correlating metal adsorption according to the ph of the solution with results recorded through phpzc determination fig 5 evidences that cu ii and cd ii adsorption capacity at ph 1 was lower than 0 01mmolg 1 adsorption sites on the material surface are protonated by h species under acidic conditions therefore the chelating groups are not available to coordinate metal species adsorption capacity increases as ph increases equilibrium was attained at ph 5 6 results of both metal species comply with the point of zero charge ph 6 and other related studies guiza 2017 hossain et al 2014 the adsorbent surface charge is zero and adsorption is favored in this ph region 3 2 2 kinetic studies the time required by the system adsorbent adsorbate to reach equilibrium is another important parameter that must be known in order to be applied to the adsorbent during the solid phase extraction process the adsorption kinetic of cu ii and cd ii was investigated in dynamic contact time interval from 1 to 240min fig 6 inset shows that equilibrium was attained within few minutes of contact time which implies fast kinetic in order to better understand the cu ii and cd ii adsorption process kinetic isotherm data were analyzed to assess the pseudo second order kinetic model ho and ofomaja 2006 whose adsorption capacity n ft mmolg 1 at a given contact time t is given through 2 t n f t 1 k n f 2 1 n f t wherein n f corresponds to the adsorption capacity at equilibrium mmolg 1 and k is the kinetic constant of pseudo second order mmolg 1 min 1 it was possible finding the straight line represented in fig 6 inset by plotting the values of t n ft versus t the determination coefficients r2 were 0 9978 and 0 9998 for cu ii and cd ii respectively this model also assumes that chemisorption is the mechanism responsible for removing the metallic species from the aqueous solutions based on such information it is possible inferring that the organic groups identified on the material surface are coordinating the metallic species through covalent bond 3 2 3 maximum adsorption capacity determination the adsorbent adsorption capacity was determined based on the equilibrium of adsorption isotherms better equilibrium data compliance was verified in the langmuir adsorption model which implies a adsorbate monolayer on the material surface and meets the prevalent kinetic model set for the present system adsorption data were calculated through the langmuir linearized model in order to find the respective maximum adsorption capacity values of the investigated cations which were represented through eq 3 3 c s n f 1 k t n fmax 1 n fmax c s wherein c s represents the supernatant concentration mmoll 1 n f is the adsorption capacity of the determined initial analyte concentration mmolg 1 k corresponds to the langmuir model s constant and n fmax is the calculated maximum adsorption experiment associated with monolayer formation mmol g 1 the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated for both species since the angular coefficient b was equal to 1 n fmax this calculation showed 0 103mmolg 1 cu ii and 0 098mmolg 1 cd ii the elevated linear correlation coefficient was found 0 989 and 0 993 for cu ii and cd ii respectively and the best fit straight line equations for both metals were y 6 3142x 9 7118 for cu ii and y 9 0991x 10 151 for cd ii d ii the isotherm data and their linearized forms are depicted in fig 7 data from other adsorbent types were compiled in table 1 in order to compare the performance of malpighia emarginata seeds used as adsorbent to remove cu ii and cd ii from the aqueous medium malpighia emarginata seeds present better adsorption capacity than other adsorbents these results are not relevant just because they are based on the achieved adsorption capacity but because they evidence the possibility of using a low cost material to remove toxic metals from water and to improve the access to drinking water 3 2 4 preconcentration experiments conducted through packed column materials showing the adsorption properties of metal species may be useful to set metal trace in water subjected to preconcentration procedures fig 8 presents results recorded during cu ii system optimization in aqueous medium the preconcentration system was optimized through the adoption of a univariate procedure in which a single parameter was changed while others remained constant aliquots of 50ml copper solution 0 01mgl 1 were used in the optimization procedure the solution flow rate was kept constant 1 0mlmin 1 when it was not specified the herein used eluent consisted of 1 0ml of hno3 solution 1 0moll 1 according to fig 8 it is possible noticing that the adsorbent mass did not exert influence on the preconcentration factor three adsorbent doses were tested and results showed that the 10 mg aliquot would be enough to assure a preconcentration factor of approximately 41 fold for the volume and concentration of the used solution sample accordingly in order to complete the optimization process 10mg of adsorbent mass was selected for further investigations experiments related to sample percolation flow rate were carried out under 1 0 and 2 0mlmin 1 no difference was observed between these flow rates and the faster flow was selected in order to reduce the analysis time some articles published in the literature used a mixture of hcl and thiourea as eluent to possibly improve the efficiency in removing metals from the adsorbent because thiourea molecules present lewis basis in their structure they may coordinate metals after desorption in order to prevent them from recombining with the solid phase results recorded during preconcentration system optimization showed that 1 0moll 1 of nitric acid solution was more efficient than the thiourea solution this is the reason why this solution was chosen to be the eluent in subsequent steps the eluent concentration was also investigated and the results evidenced that 1 0moll 1 of solution is enough to quantitatively remove metals from the column the eluent volume was not investigated since 1 0ml is the minimum volume to enable reliable determination through flame atomic absorption although higher volumes also enable reliable determination a low preconcentration factor would result from the dilution process the system was applied to cd ii preconcentration after optimization by using the same conditions adopted for cu ii results indicated that a 40 fold enrichment factor was achieved therefore the present material could be an important tool to trace metal determination through flame atomic absorption spectrometry 4 conclusions results indicate that the material surface presents chelating organic groups able to coordinate metal species in aqueous samples it was possible identifying organic groups possibly involved in coordination processes by applying the 13c nmr ftir and the elemental analysis although its adsorption capacity is similar to that of other related materials it may be an interesting alternative to remove metal species from water by using a low cost and green procedure besides its use to remove metals malpighia emarginata seeds can be also used to assist cu ii and cd ii trace determination through faas which presents lower cost in comparison to gfaas

12373,the kandivalasa river sub basin near cheepurupalli town of vizianagaram district andhra pradesh india was monitored for groundwater levels at 41 observation wells during 2013 2015 along with groundwater levels the daily rainfall data is also collected for these years a continuous decrease in groundwater levels was observed during the study period more particularly in the year 2015 which also had minimum rainfall groundwater depletion is observed mostly in the eastern and south western part of the basin where pumping wells are more groundwater balance studies have indicated that 11 3 mcm of groundwater can be utilized in the basin annually however the net annual groundwater draft has been found to be 16 6 mcm hence over abstraction of 5 66 mcm is the main cause for depletion of groundwater levels the water conservation and groundwater recharge measures have to be taken up at chinnanadipally and dummeda villages in the basin to have sustainable groundwater utilization in the basin graphical abstract fx1 keywords eastern ghats of india groundwater depletion recharge structures 1 introduction india is currently the world s largest consumer of groundwater withdrawing more than double the amount of groundwater drawn by the usa shah 2005 over the years increasing dependence on groundwater has created imbalance in the groundwater availability and long term withdrawal is exceeding long term recharge leading to the depletion of groundwater level since agriculture is the main occupation in the study area which is kandivalasa river sub basin krsb near cheepurupalli town of vizianagaram district andhra pradesh india the farmers are mainly dependent on groundwater for irrigation in non monsoon period november to may to meet the challenges of depleting groundwater levels and thereby drying up of bore wells in the non monsoon season the management and development of groundwater resources is essential in the study area hence it is very important to know about the extent of natural recharge occurring to the aquifer of the region moreover the groundwater recharge estimation is a key component in groundwater flow or transport models satish chandra and saksena 1975 athavale et al 1992 kumar and seethapathi 2002 have carried out groundwater balance studies and quantified groundwater resources in various hard rock regions of india naga rajani et al 2006 have used remote sensing and gis techniques for groundwater exploration and identification of artificial recharge sites in kurmapalli watershed in nalgonda and ranga reddy districts of telangana india rangarajan et al 2009 have estimated the natural recharge and its relation with aquifer parameters near tuticorin town tamilnadu india varalakshmi et al 2014 have studied the groundwater recharge studies by using gec 1997 guidelines in the osmansagar and himayathsagar catchment areas which are comprised of basaltic and granitic terrains respectively in the telangana state the study has concluded that the percent rainfall converting to the groundwater recharge is nearly 22 in the basin khadri and moharir 2015 have analyzed the seasonal groundwater fluctuations with reference to the rainfall received by the man river basin maharashra india the study also interpreted that the high level extraction of groundwater during non monsoon period for irrigation purpose is causing groundwater fluctuation in the study area the main objective in this study is to evaluate the existing groundwater resources and stage of development percentage of renewable groundwater utilized annually in the kandivalasa river sub basin by using groundwater estimation committee gec methodology gec 1997 for sustainable development of water resources it is imperative to make quantitative estimation of the available water resources these studies can be useful for overall development of the basin on sustainable basis 2 hydrogeology of the study area kandivalasa river sub basin krsb fig 1 near chipurupally town of vizianagaram district of andhra pradesh india is covered with a typical khondalitic suite of rocks and is situated between east longitudes 83 32 15 to 83 39 10 and north latitudes of 18 9 15 to 18 19 54 having an areal extent of 121km2 is selected for this study it forms a part of survey of india toposheet nos 65 n 11 and 65n 12 in general the area is covered by a thick soil cover 1 4m followed by weathered and fractured khondalitic formation underlain by basement of granite gneiss the area is highly disturbed due to folding faulting and fracturing with isolated hills covered by khondalitic rocks on the top and lateritic soils on the sides fig 2 occasionally quartz veins are seen exposed to surface often serving as guide to locate high yielding wells the topography of the area is undulating at all locations between hills there is a high slope in the foot hill region and a gentle slope towards the valley fig 3 frequently small plateaus are also observed the average annual rainfall is around 1000mm groundwater occurs under water table conditions in the weathered portion of the khondalite the fact that the raise of water level in the bore well after penetrating the fractured environment and drying up of nearby open wells due to pumpage of bore wells demonstrate that the weathered and fractured environment are hydraulically connected therefore the fractured environment is under semi confining conditions venkateswara rao and briz kishore 1991 3 methods the groundwater levels of the 41 observation wells covering entire kandivalasa river sub basin are monitored for both pre and post monsoon seasons of 2013 2014 and 2015 plate 1 the gps survey has been done at all the observation wells groundwater contour maps in the basin are also prepared by using surfer software oseji julius 2011 to know the direction of groundwater flow the daily rainfall data of five mandals an administrative unit within a district namely cheepurupally garividi nellimarla of vizianagaram district and ranastalam and laveru mandals of srikakulam district covering entire basin is also collected from andhra pradesh state economics and statistics department the monsoon rainfall is estimated for each mandal table 1 the seasonal changes of groundwater levels of all the individual wells are carefully observed from the year 2013 2015 the analysis of depletion of groundwater levels during this period has been carried out in the basin by using well census data and rainfall data nandargi et al 2014 of the basin the groundwater fluctuation map chyan deng et al 2007 is prepared for the year 2015 using surfer software in order to find out the causes for the groundwater depletion scenario in the basin the groundwater recharge the groundwater abstraction and the groundwater balance in the basin are estimated by using gec 1997 guidelines kumar 2012 the stage of the groundwater development is calculated sitender and rajeshwari 2015 and finally the groundwater recharge areas and pumping areas are identified with the help of groundwater flow maps singhal and gupta 2010 3 1 water table fluctuation method the study of groundwater level fluctuations helps to understand the depletion and recharging conditions of an aquifer physical based techniques like water table fluctuation method have traditionally and widely been used more than chemical based techniques for estimating groundwater recharge in semiarid regions healy and cook 2002 the groundwater recharge has been calculated by using water table fluctuation method wtf method as per methodology recommended by groundwater estimation committee gec 1997 the water table fluctuation method is based on distinct changes in seasonal pre and post monsoon groundwater levels among the physical methods the water table fluctuation method links the change in groundwater storage with resulting water table fluctuations through the storage parameter i e specific yield in unconfined aquifer the wtf method is based on the recharge effect i e the rise of the water table due to previous rainfall careful analysis of the records enables the exclusion of variations in the water table due to fluctuations in climate and anthropogenic activities pumping irrigation land use etc healy and cook 2002 the wtf method is based on the premise that the rise in groundwater levels in unconfined aquifers is due to recharging water arriving at the water table delin et al 2007 recharge is calculated in the wtf method using the formula gec 1997 groundwater recharge geographical area specific yield rise in the water table the wtf method is used in this study because frequent and accurate water level measurements are available in all the observation wells of the entire basin to estimate the groundwater level rise in the basin the pre monsoon and post monsoon groundwater levels at 41 locations covering entire basin were collected during the years 2013 2014 and 2015 the difference of depth to water levels between pre and post monsoon seasons is estimated and is contoured using surfer software the rise in the water table during the rainy season is used to estimate the recharge since pumping for irrigation during monsoon period is negligible the rise in water table is primarily due to the rainfall recharge areas between successive contours of groundwater level fluctuations are estimated by using the arc gis 9 3 software to apply the wtf method an estimation of the specific yield s y at the depth of water table fluctuation is required the specific yield s y values of different formations are adopted from the recommendations of the groundwater estimation committee gec 1997 based on local geology as per local geology of the study area the recommended specific yield value of 3 is adopted for calculating the groundwater recharge table 2 the total groundwater recharge with wtf method by applying the suitable specific yield to the basin is presented in the table 3 the obtained total groundwater recharge with water table fluctuation method table 3 is the recharge directly occurring from the precipitation tanks and water conservation structures such as check dams contour bunds and contour trenches 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater depletion scenario in the basin in all the seasons under observation static water levels are more than 10m below ground level b g l in north eastern part and below 5m of b g l in the west south and south eastern part of the basin fig 4 by using above mean sea level a m s l data the groundwater flow directions are modelled with surfer software the flow directions indicate that the groundwater flow is towards the main stream which is flowing from north to south direction hence the water levels are following the topography of the basin since agriculture is the main occupation in the study area the farmers are mainly dependent on groundwater for irrigation in non monsoon period according to the well census data collected from electricity department of each mandal administrative unit nearly 1800 bore wells are being pumped in the basin having an area of 121km2 this huge pumping is one of the reasons for groundwater depletion in the basin the average annual rainfall of the basin is 1131mm cgwb 2013 with percent of deviation varying from 7 to 21 of the normal rainfall during the study period due to the less average annual rainfall occurred in the basin during the years 2014 and 2015 when compared to the year 2013 table 1 on account of these consecutive diminished rainfall years the decline of groundwater levels in the post monsoon season has increased from 2013 to 2015 fig 5 it is also observed that the decline of groundwater levels and groundwater fluctuations are much higher in the year 2015 when compared to the other two years 22 bore wells in the year 2014 and 28 bore wells in the year 2015 out of 41 bore wells have got depleted water table with respect to post monsoon season of 2013 to show the spatial variation of groundwater depletion in the basin the contour maps fig 6 of groundwater levels in m below ground level are prepared it can be observed that the groundwater levels are mainly depleted in the eastern part of the basin where the pumping wells are more fig 6 the groundwater fluctuation contour map of 2015 fig 7 is also prepared to identify the groundwater depletion at the places in the eastern side of the basin namely karkam chinnanadipally and itakarlapalli villages and the boppadam village in south western side of the basin the groundwater fluctuations are more where the pumping wells are more than hundred fig 7 to identify the causes for the groundwater depletion and high groundwater fluctuations in some places in the basin it is necessary to quantify the natural recharge occurring to the water table and withdrawal or draft of groundwater from the basin according to the central ground water board cgwb report cgwb 2013 the stage of development of groundwater for the three mandals of the study area namely cheepurupalli and garividi of the vizianagaram district and ranastalam mandal of srikakulam district are 70 and 104 respectively i e 70 and 104 of renewable groundwater is utilized annually 4 2 estimation of annual utilizable groundwater resources the average annual groundwater recharge in the basin is the average of total groundwater recharge for the years 2013 2014 and 2015 table 3 estimated as per the methodology explained in the article 3 1 the average annual groundwater storage during the study period in the basin is 13 27 mcm according to gec norms the annual utilizable groundwater resources are 85 of average annual groundwater storage hence annual utilizable groundwater resources in the basin is 11 3 mcm 4 3 estimation of total groundwater abstraction and the groundwater balance the groundwater abstraction or draft is the quantity of groundwater withdrawn from the groundwater reservoirs annual groundwater draft is equally important to assess the status of the basin for taking up water conservation measures the estimation of groundwater draft requires well census data the details of bore wells in the study area were collected from the electricity department of each mandal the information of number of dug wells were collected from the field and the unit draft method is considered to estimate the total groundwater draft in the basin from gec report the groundwater draft is calculated and is presented in table 4 the total quantity withdrawn is termed as gross draft for working out groundwater balance 70 of gross extraction is taken which is known as net ground water draft the 30 is presumed to go as return seepage to groundwater regime gce 1997 the gross annual groundwater draft in the basin is worked out as 24 235 mcm while the net annual groundwater draft in the basin is 16 96 mcm the groundwater balance is the difference between the annual utilizable groundwater resources and the net annual groundwater draft groundwater balance in the study area is 5 66 mcm 11 3 16 96 mcm therefore from groundwater recharge and draft studies a negative groundwater balance has been observed in the study area and the deficit is 5 66 mcm is existing 4 4 estimation of stage of groundwater development intensive development of groundwater in certain areas can result in over exploitation leading to decline in the levels of groundwater and sea water intrusion in coastal areas the development of a groundwater system is considered to be safe when the rate of groundwater withdrawal does not exceed the rate of natural recharge as per the latest assessment of groundwater resources carried out by the central ground water board cgwb 2013 the assessment units are categorized as over exploited critical semi critical and safe based on the stage of ground water development hence the groundwater assessment unit is categorized into four different categories based on groundwater resource available and groundwater draft in the basin the various categories of groundwater development are presented in the table 5 the safe areas are representing the groundwater potential for development the semi critical areas need the cautious groundwater development in the critical and over exploited areas there should be intensive monitoring evaluation and future groundwater development with necessary water conservation measures the category of kandivalasa river sub basin is evaluated by following the methodology suggested by gec 1997 according to this methodology the stage of groundwater development is calculated as 150 indicating the over exploitation of the basin and needs water conservation measures 5 identification of recharge locations since the over exploited kandivalasa river sub basin needs more groundwater recharge than pumping identifying the recharge locations are at most important in the basin therefore an attempt is made towards the identification of recharge and pumping zones in the study area singhal and gupta 2010 explained the different features exhibited by water table contour maps as shown in fig 8 based on the contour maps from fig 8 and contour map of the basin fig 4 the locations where the groundwater recharge and groundwater pumping is occurring in the basin are identified the high elevated locations of chinnanadipalli village which is in the eastern side of the basin and dummeda village which is in the western side of the basin are identified as the groundwater recharge areas in the basin the artificial recharge structures and large number of water harvesting structures are to be constructed at these two villages however the experiments with the double ring infiltrometer for estimating the infiltration rates should be done to identify the infiltration capacity at these two villages the pumping areas are identified at itakarlapalli and velluru villages at these places preference must be given to use rainwater surface water and soil water instead of groundwater this means that water and soil conservation structures are to be constructed apart from adaptation of mulching techniques to conserve the soil water 6 conclusions in a khondalitic terrain of the eastern ghats of india the groundwater levels are declining at a rapid rate due to increasing groundwater abstraction and also due to less than normal rainfall in the years 2013 2014 and 2015 as a consequence the decline of groundwater levels in the post monsoon season has increased from 2013 to 2015 the groundwater depletion is much higher in the year 2015 when compared to the previous two years the groundwater levels are mainly depleted in the eastern part and south western part of the basin where the pumping wells are more from the groundwater recharge and draft studies a deficit of 5 66 mcm is observed the stage of groundwater development in the basin is calculated as 150 indicating that the basin is overexploited from the groundwater flow direction maps water conservation measures have to be taken up at chinnanadipally and dummeda villages in the basin the places where the high decline in water levels should practice artificial recharge in the study area in addition preference must be given to use rainwater surface water and soil water instead of groundwater this means that water and soil conservation

12373,the kandivalasa river sub basin near cheepurupalli town of vizianagaram district andhra pradesh india was monitored for groundwater levels at 41 observation wells during 2013 2015 along with groundwater levels the daily rainfall data is also collected for these years a continuous decrease in groundwater levels was observed during the study period more particularly in the year 2015 which also had minimum rainfall groundwater depletion is observed mostly in the eastern and south western part of the basin where pumping wells are more groundwater balance studies have indicated that 11 3 mcm of groundwater can be utilized in the basin annually however the net annual groundwater draft has been found to be 16 6 mcm hence over abstraction of 5 66 mcm is the main cause for depletion of groundwater levels the water conservation and groundwater recharge measures have to be taken up at chinnanadipally and dummeda villages in the basin to have sustainable groundwater utilization in the basin graphical abstract fx1 keywords eastern ghats of india groundwater depletion recharge structures 1 introduction india is currently the world s largest consumer of groundwater withdrawing more than double the amount of groundwater drawn by the usa shah 2005 over the years increasing dependence on groundwater has created imbalance in the groundwater availability and long term withdrawal is exceeding long term recharge leading to the depletion of groundwater level since agriculture is the main occupation in the study area which is kandivalasa river sub basin krsb near cheepurupalli town of vizianagaram district andhra pradesh india the farmers are mainly dependent on groundwater for irrigation in non monsoon period november to may to meet the challenges of depleting groundwater levels and thereby drying up of bore wells in the non monsoon season the management and development of groundwater resources is essential in the study area hence it is very important to know about the extent of natural recharge occurring to the aquifer of the region moreover the groundwater recharge estimation is a key component in groundwater flow or transport models satish chandra and saksena 1975 athavale et al 1992 kumar and seethapathi 2002 have carried out groundwater balance studies and quantified groundwater resources in various hard rock regions of india naga rajani et al 2006 have used remote sensing and gis techniques for groundwater exploration and identification of artificial recharge sites in kurmapalli watershed in nalgonda and ranga reddy districts of telangana india rangarajan et al 2009 have estimated the natural recharge and its relation with aquifer parameters near tuticorin town tamilnadu india varalakshmi et al 2014 have studied the groundwater recharge studies by using gec 1997 guidelines in the osmansagar and himayathsagar catchment areas which are comprised of basaltic and granitic terrains respectively in the telangana state the study has concluded that the percent rainfall converting to the groundwater recharge is nearly 22 in the basin khadri and moharir 2015 have analyzed the seasonal groundwater fluctuations with reference to the rainfall received by the man river basin maharashra india the study also interpreted that the high level extraction of groundwater during non monsoon period for irrigation purpose is causing groundwater fluctuation in the study area the main objective in this study is to evaluate the existing groundwater resources and stage of development percentage of renewable groundwater utilized annually in the kandivalasa river sub basin by using groundwater estimation committee gec methodology gec 1997 for sustainable development of water resources it is imperative to make quantitative estimation of the available water resources these studies can be useful for overall development of the basin on sustainable basis 2 hydrogeology of the study area kandivalasa river sub basin krsb fig 1 near chipurupally town of vizianagaram district of andhra pradesh india is covered with a typical khondalitic suite of rocks and is situated between east longitudes 83 32 15 to 83 39 10 and north latitudes of 18 9 15 to 18 19 54 having an areal extent of 121km2 is selected for this study it forms a part of survey of india toposheet nos 65 n 11 and 65n 12 in general the area is covered by a thick soil cover 1 4m followed by weathered and fractured khondalitic formation underlain by basement of granite gneiss the area is highly disturbed due to folding faulting and fracturing with isolated hills covered by khondalitic rocks on the top and lateritic soils on the sides fig 2 occasionally quartz veins are seen exposed to surface often serving as guide to locate high yielding wells the topography of the area is undulating at all locations between hills there is a high slope in the foot hill region and a gentle slope towards the valley fig 3 frequently small plateaus are also observed the average annual rainfall is around 1000mm groundwater occurs under water table conditions in the weathered portion of the khondalite the fact that the raise of water level in the bore well after penetrating the fractured environment and drying up of nearby open wells due to pumpage of bore wells demonstrate that the weathered and fractured environment are hydraulically connected therefore the fractured environment is under semi confining conditions venkateswara rao and briz kishore 1991 3 methods the groundwater levels of the 41 observation wells covering entire kandivalasa river sub basin are monitored for both pre and post monsoon seasons of 2013 2014 and 2015 plate 1 the gps survey has been done at all the observation wells groundwater contour maps in the basin are also prepared by using surfer software oseji julius 2011 to know the direction of groundwater flow the daily rainfall data of five mandals an administrative unit within a district namely cheepurupally garividi nellimarla of vizianagaram district and ranastalam and laveru mandals of srikakulam district covering entire basin is also collected from andhra pradesh state economics and statistics department the monsoon rainfall is estimated for each mandal table 1 the seasonal changes of groundwater levels of all the individual wells are carefully observed from the year 2013 2015 the analysis of depletion of groundwater levels during this period has been carried out in the basin by using well census data and rainfall data nandargi et al 2014 of the basin the groundwater fluctuation map chyan deng et al 2007 is prepared for the year 2015 using surfer software in order to find out the causes for the groundwater depletion scenario in the basin the groundwater recharge the groundwater abstraction and the groundwater balance in the basin are estimated by using gec 1997 guidelines kumar 2012 the stage of the groundwater development is calculated sitender and rajeshwari 2015 and finally the groundwater recharge areas and pumping areas are identified with the help of groundwater flow maps singhal and gupta 2010 3 1 water table fluctuation method the study of groundwater level fluctuations helps to understand the depletion and recharging conditions of an aquifer physical based techniques like water table fluctuation method have traditionally and widely been used more than chemical based techniques for estimating groundwater recharge in semiarid regions healy and cook 2002 the groundwater recharge has been calculated by using water table fluctuation method wtf method as per methodology recommended by groundwater estimation committee gec 1997 the water table fluctuation method is based on distinct changes in seasonal pre and post monsoon groundwater levels among the physical methods the water table fluctuation method links the change in groundwater storage with resulting water table fluctuations through the storage parameter i e specific yield in unconfined aquifer the wtf method is based on the recharge effect i e the rise of the water table due to previous rainfall careful analysis of the records enables the exclusion of variations in the water table due to fluctuations in climate and anthropogenic activities pumping irrigation land use etc healy and cook 2002 the wtf method is based on the premise that the rise in groundwater levels in unconfined aquifers is due to recharging water arriving at the water table delin et al 2007 recharge is calculated in the wtf method using the formula gec 1997 groundwater recharge geographical area specific yield rise in the water table the wtf method is used in this study because frequent and accurate water level measurements are available in all the observation wells of the entire basin to estimate the groundwater level rise in the basin the pre monsoon and post monsoon groundwater levels at 41 locations covering entire basin were collected during the years 2013 2014 and 2015 the difference of depth to water levels between pre and post monsoon seasons is estimated and is contoured using surfer software the rise in the water table during the rainy season is used to estimate the recharge since pumping for irrigation during monsoon period is negligible the rise in water table is primarily due to the rainfall recharge areas between successive contours of groundwater level fluctuations are estimated by using the arc gis 9 3 software to apply the wtf method an estimation of the specific yield s y at the depth of water table fluctuation is required the specific yield s y values of different formations are adopted from the recommendations of the groundwater estimation committee gec 1997 based on local geology as per local geology of the study area the recommended specific yield value of 3 is adopted for calculating the groundwater recharge table 2 the total groundwater recharge with wtf method by applying the suitable specific yield to the basin is presented in the table 3 the obtained total groundwater recharge with water table fluctuation method table 3 is the recharge directly occurring from the precipitation tanks and water conservation structures such as check dams contour bunds and contour trenches 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater depletion scenario in the basin in all the seasons under observation static water levels are more than 10m below ground level b g l in north eastern part and below 5m of b g l in the west south and south eastern part of the basin fig 4 by using above mean sea level a m s l data the groundwater flow directions are modelled with surfer software the flow directions indicate that the groundwater flow is towards the main stream which is flowing from north to south direction hence the water levels are following the topography of the basin since agriculture is the main occupation in the study area the farmers are mainly dependent on groundwater for irrigation in non monsoon period according to the well census data collected from electricity department of each mandal administrative unit nearly 1800 bore wells are being pumped in the basin having an area of 121km2 this huge pumping is one of the reasons for groundwater depletion in the basin the average annual rainfall of the basin is 1131mm cgwb 2013 with percent of deviation varying from 7 to 21 of the normal rainfall during the study period due to the less average annual rainfall occurred in the basin during the years 2014 and 2015 when compared to the year 2013 table 1 on account of these consecutive diminished rainfall years the decline of groundwater levels in the post monsoon season has increased from 2013 to 2015 fig 5 it is also observed that the decline of groundwater levels and groundwater fluctuations are much higher in the year 2015 when compared to the other two years 22 bore wells in the year 2014 and 28 bore wells in the year 2015 out of 41 bore wells have got depleted water table with respect to post monsoon season of 2013 to show the spatial variation of groundwater depletion in the basin the contour maps fig 6 of groundwater levels in m below ground level are prepared it can be observed that the groundwater levels are mainly depleted in the eastern part of the basin where the pumping wells are more fig 6 the groundwater fluctuation contour map of 2015 fig 7 is also prepared to identify the groundwater depletion at the places in the eastern side of the basin namely karkam chinnanadipally and itakarlapalli villages and the boppadam village in south western side of the basin the groundwater fluctuations are more where the pumping wells are more than hundred fig 7 to identify the causes for the groundwater depletion and high groundwater fluctuations in some places in the basin it is necessary to quantify the natural recharge occurring to the water table and withdrawal or draft of groundwater from the basin according to the central ground water board cgwb report cgwb 2013 the stage of development of groundwater for the three mandals of the study area namely cheepurupalli and garividi of the vizianagaram district and ranastalam mandal of srikakulam district are 70 and 104 respectively i e 70 and 104 of renewable groundwater is utilized annually 4 2 estimation of annual utilizable groundwater resources the average annual groundwater recharge in the basin is the average of total groundwater recharge for the years 2013 2014 and 2015 table 3 estimated as per the methodology explained in the article 3 1 the average annual groundwater storage during the study period in the basin is 13 27 mcm according to gec norms the annual utilizable groundwater resources are 85 of average annual groundwater storage hence annual utilizable groundwater resources in the basin is 11 3 mcm 4 3 estimation of total groundwater abstraction and the groundwater balance the groundwater abstraction or draft is the quantity of groundwater withdrawn from the groundwater reservoirs annual

12374,al mansourieh zone is located in diyala city iraq between the latitude 34 08 north and the longitude 44 96 east and consists of 244 wells these wells are distributed randomly without dependence on the geological and hydraulic information in addition the absence of a mechanism to regulate the operation of these wells it is necessary to manage these wells by determining the number of suitable daily operating hours to prevent their drying in this study a management of water usage of groundwater was investigated using groundwater modelling system gms software the area was divided into 92 grids with 500m 500m dimensions the model was calibrated using the hydraulic conductivity ranging from 9 to 15m day with storage coefficient 0 15 to obtain a match between observed and computed heads three scenarios of operation times 12 8 and 6 hours day were taken to test the drawdown head of groundwater the optimal management of water usage in the groundwater was selected based on the period of appearance the dry cells the results show that the operation time of 6h day was the optimal operation where the drawdown head does not exceed 8m after the first year and 15m at 20th year with no dry cells appearance moreover sensitivity analyses were investigated to study the response of groundwater drawdown in increase or decrease of hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient the results of sensitivity show that the groundwater drawdown was non linear responses with a low sensitive range graphical abstract three scenarios of operation times 12 8 and 6 hours day were taken to test the drawdown head of groundwater resources in the al mansourieh zone in the diyala river basin in eastern iraq in operation time with 6h day the drawdown head of groundwater in five cells begins with less than 1m for cell i 40 j 38 and increase to reached maximum value about 15m for cell i 75 j 45 in 20th year and the dry cell not appear until 8000day these results indicate that the 6h day is the

comprises 5 of the total water on the earth s surface as a result of the growth in population the groundwater has become increasingly vital in order to maintain the sustainability of groundwater sources they must be studied and analyzed for efficient use without exploitation it in the last decade a lot of researchers have conducted experimental and mathematical studies on behavior of groundwater from the literature review fetter 1988 there are two types of models were used in the study of groundwater behavior these models are physical and mathematical model the physical model includes scale models electrical models and viscous fluid models and characterized by good for visualization and higher accuracy the mathematical model includes analytical numerical and stochastic models fetter 1988 a mathematical model consists of differential equations developed from analyzing groundwater flow and are known to be governed by the physics of flow the reliability of model predictions depends on how well the model approximates the actual situation in the field in recent years many researchers have conducted studies on groundwater by introducing and developing different models to analyze the behavior of groundwater flow mohammadi 2008 visual modflow based transient numerical model was used by maheswaran et al 2016 to simulate subsurface movement of water within the alluvial formations of ganga basin system the model parameters were fine tuned for calibration using parameter estimation pest simulations binet et al 2017 explored the spatio temporal variability of the observed exchanges between a karstic conduit and the surrounding aquifer using 2d coupled continuum conduit flow model under saturated conditions the inputs from the water heads and stable water isotopes in the groundwater flow model suggest that the amounts of water flowing from the aquifer are significant if the conduit flow discharges are less than the conduit flow capacity david et al 2016 used standard reservoir modeling software in groundwater modeling pmwin modflow to test the accuracy of finite volume methods this model used coarse grid simulation to correct steady state well bore pressure for imposed discharge recharge rate and to correct well discharge rate for imposed hydraulic head saba et al 2016 simulated a three dimensional groundwater flow with solute transport model of moradabad city lying between rivers ramganga and ganga in response to aquifer and the migration of contaminant chloride in this case over a period of time modflow and mt3d software was run for steady state condition until a match between observed and computed heads was obtained hadzic et al 2015 optimized the results of groundwater mathematical model in the source zone of sokolovici to select optimal exploitation of groundwater different quantities from the sources exploitation sokolovici were simulated by applying the method of finite volumes of groundwater flow in stationary conditions to determine the main directions of recharge as well as the amount that from the model boundary flows or drains from the studied area for the given conditions and for three different hydrological conditions mathematical model designed by al shamma a et al 2008 was used to study the flow behavior in the upper aquifer in iraq umm er radhuma dammam and also to study the possibility of increasing the discharge rate to 3750l s the results showed that the mean yearly drawdown through the period 2003 2018 is expected to be range from 4m in the west to 50m in the east which in turn would effect the springs outflow that contribute to recharge of al razzazah lake gonc et al 2013 proposed a 3d groundwater flow model to represent the groundwater level and flow system in the pipiripau catchment the 3d mesh elements of the domain were generated through the groundwater modeling system software the numerical simulation of the finite element method was implemented in the framework of the scientific software opengeosys the steady state model was calibrated by the pest software using available data of the water level from wells the model results showed the highest values occurred in the east and west recharge areas and the lowest values were found in the southwest of the basin liang et al 2016 described an analytical model to improve the transport domain with a bounded radial extent and a finite thickness of vadose zone a comparison of the newly analytical solution with previous one in literature was considered to determine the influence of the radial and exit boundary conditions on the solute transport the analytical results show that both the radial and exit boundary conditions substantially affect the trailing segment of the breakthrough curves for a soil medium with large dispersion coefficients two simulations were taken by mc keown et al 1999 to study the fluid flow in the sellafield region the simulation of fluid flow assumes that the flow is steady state in two dimensions and coupled with heat flow simulation code from the sensitivity analyses of geological variables the groundwater flow through the potential repository site was dependent upon the hydraulic conductivity of the borrowdale volcanic group and was unaffected by the hydraulic conductivity of other hydro stratigraphic units zhou et al 2017 proposed a model to reveal the effects of cross anisotropic aquifer behavior on hydraulic head and land deformation as a result of comparison between the calculated results with the measured field values the methods can be a useful tool for designing groundwater pumping projects the main objective of this study is to investigate the management of groundwater resources in the al mansourieh zone using groundwater modeling system gmss software three scenarios of operation times 12 8 and 6 hours day were taken to test the drawdown head of groundwater the optimal management of water usage in the groundwater was selected depending upon the period of appearance the dry cells 2 hydrology of the study area al mansourieh city is an administrative unit at the north eastern part of al khalis city within province of diyala and locates between the latitude 34 08 north and the longitude 44 96 east as shown in fig 1 the area of al mansourieh city is about 830km2 and consists of 17 agricultural zones as shown in figure the diyala river runs along the city from north to south and the al khalis river flows through the city from the north east to south west so the main source for groundwater can be considered to be surface water derived from diyala and al khalis rivers the type of aquifer is unconfined within saturated zone with depth of nearly 10 25m below the ground surface the main factors that control the potential yield of groundwater in aquifer is hydraulic properties and storage coefficient the study area lies within the unstable sidewalk and within the scope of the low lying folds of them particularly in the hamrin mountains and alluvial plain from the geological configuration of the area we can know the soil structure and the type of parent material the most of original substance in the study area are depositions of the tigris and diyala during the quaternary age where the soils were formed from the decomposition and the effect of the fragmentation of the rock because weathering 3 climatic conditions recorded meteorological data of al khalis meteorological station have been used to evaluate the climate logical characteristics of the study area the meteorological data are temperature sunshine relative humidity wind rainfall and evaporation table 1 shows the monthly and annual average meteorological elements at al khalis station the average annual temperature is 22 2 c and the maximum monthly average temperature is 34 c in july while the minimum is 9 7 c in january the fluctuation between day and night temperatures is appreciable in winter as well as in summer the study area experiences long hours of sunshine especially in the summer the annual rate for the sunshine of the al khalis station is 8 5h day the maximum sunshine duration occurs in june with a monthly average of 11 4h day the minimum monthly average is 5 6h day in december the average value of relative humidity varies from 34 in june and july to 76 9 in january with annual average value that reaches up to 52 5 rainfall begins in october and ends in may after which it becomes scarce the maximum monthly average rainfall is 32 3mm occurring in january the minimum is 3mm during in may with an annual rainfall average of 149 7mm the maximum monthly average wind speed is 3 4m s during july while the minimum is 1 7m s during in november with an annual wind speed average of 2 5m s the maximum and minimum monthly averages of evaporation are 384 4 and 51 9mm in july and december respectively generally high annual evaporation rates characterize the climate of the study area it is clear from table 1 that the evaporation is many times higher than the rainfall which means that there is no important groundwater recharges from rainfall within the study area most groundwater recharge from precipitation commonly occurs during spring months when evaporation is small and soil moisture is maintained at or above field capacity during summer evaporation and soil moisture requirements are much higher and effectively reduce groundwater runoff so groundwater table is much less in july than in december 4 land use and land cover the area of al mansourieh city is about 830km2 and consists of 17 agricultural zones agriculture and the crops that are grown in this area are varying depending on the nature of the soil the study area consists of three types of soil the first type is a soft soil with high clay content and covers the largest area about 55 of the study area and characterized by the cultivation of all winter and summer crops the second type is a medium softness and represents the lands distributed along the diyala river and represented 28 of the total area and distinguished in the cultivation of palms and oranges groves while the third type is rough soil with a high proportion of sand and represents the heights of the hamrin mountains and its surrounding lands and lies outside arable land due to their inappropriate topography for agricultural production the plants covering the area are divided into two main types perennial and annual plants the perennial plants consist of alhagi maurorum lagunychium tamarix mannifera lyciumbarbarum etc while the annual plants consist of loinm rigidum malvoparuifluor hardumsp silybum marianuim etc 5 materials and methods 5 1 governing equation of groundwater flow numerical solution is the most common method of understanding the behavior and management of groundwater sources that allowed the researchers to develop a comprehensive conception of the groundwater systems the numerical model used the finite difference technique based on the continuity hypothesis and darcy s law using darcy s law and the principle of conservation of mass the general equation of groundwater flow in three dimensions can be

12374,al mansourieh zone is located in diyala city iraq between the latitude 34 08 north and the longitude 44 96 east and consists of 244 wells these wells are distributed randomly without dependence on the geological and hydraulic information in addition the absence of a mechanism to regulate the operation of these wells it is necessary to manage these wells by determining the number of suitable daily operating hours to prevent their drying in this study a management of water usage of groundwater was investigated using groundwater modelling system gms software the area was divided into 92 grids with 500m 500m dimensions the model was calibrated using the hydraulic conductivity ranging from 9 to 15m day with storage coefficient 0 15 to obtain a match between observed and computed heads three scenarios of operation times 12 8 and 6 hours day were taken to test the drawdown head of groundwater the optimal management of water usage in the groundwater was selected based on the period of appearance the dry cells the results show that the operation time of 6h day was the optimal operation where the drawdown head does not exceed 8m after the first year and 15m at 20th year with no dry cells appearance moreover sensitivity analyses were investigated to study the response of groundwater drawdown in increase or decrease of hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient the results of sensitivity show that the groundwater drawdown was non linear responses with a low sensitive range graphical abstract three scenarios of operation times 12 8 and 6 hours day were taken to test the

comprises 5 of the total water on the earth s surface as a result of the growth in population the groundwater has become increasingly vital in order to maintain the sustainability of groundwater sources they must be studied and analyzed for efficient use without exploitation it in the last decade a lot of researchers have conducted experimental and mathematical studies on behavior of groundwater from the literature review fetter 1988 there are two types of models were used in the study of groundwater behavior these models are physical and mathematical model the physical model includes scale models electrical models and viscous fluid models and characterized by good for visualization and higher accuracy the mathematical model includes analytical numerical and stochastic models fetter 1988 a mathematical model consists of differential equations developed from analyzing groundwater flow and are known to be governed by the physics of flow the reliability of model predictions depends on how well the model approximates the actual situation in the field in recent years many researchers have conducted studies on groundwater by introducing and developing different models to analyze the behavior of groundwater flow mohammadi 2008 visual modflow based transient numerical model was used by maheswaran et al 2016 to simulate subsurface movement of water within the alluvial formations of ganga basin system the model parameters were fine tuned for calibration using parameter estimation pest simulations binet et al 2017 explored the spatio temporal variability of the observed exchanges between a karstic conduit and the surrounding aquifer using 2d coupled continuum conduit flow model under saturated conditions the inputs from the water heads and stable water isotopes in the groundwater flow model suggest that the amounts of water flowing from the aquifer are significant if the conduit flow discharges are less than the conduit flow capacity david et al 2016 used standard reservoir modeling software in groundwater modeling pmwin modflow to test the accuracy of finite volume methods this model used coarse grid simulation to correct steady state well bore pressure for imposed discharge recharge rate and to correct well discharge rate for imposed hydraulic head saba et al 2016 simulated a three dimensional groundwater flow with solute transport model of moradabad city lying between rivers ramganga and ganga in response to aquifer and the migration of contaminant chloride in this case over a period of time modflow and mt3d software was run for steady state condition until a match between observed and computed heads was obtained hadzic et al 2015 optimized the results of groundwater mathematical model in the source zone of sokolovici to select optimal exploitation of groundwater different quantities from the sources exploitation sokolovici were simulated by applying the method of finite volumes of groundwater flow in stationary conditions to determine the main directions of recharge as well as the amount that from the model boundary flows or drains from the studied area for the given conditions and for three different hydrological conditions mathematical model designed by al shamma a et al 2008 was used to study the flow behavior in the upper aquifer in iraq umm er radhuma dammam and also to study the possibility of increasing the discharge rate to 3750l s the results showed that the mean yearly drawdown through the period 2003 2018 is expected to be range from 4m in the west to 50m in the east which in turn would effect the springs outflow that contribute to recharge of al razzazah lake gonc et al 2013 proposed a 3d groundwater flow model to represent the groundwater level and flow system in the pipiripau catchment the 3d mesh elements of the domain were generated through the groundwater modeling system software the numerical simulation of the finite element method was implemented in the framework of the scientific software opengeosys the steady state model was calibrated by the pest software using available data of the water level from wells the model results showed the highest values occurred in the east and west recharge areas and the lowest values were found in the southwest of the basin liang et al 2016 described an analytical model to improve the transport domain with a bounded radial extent and a finite thickness of vadose zone a comparison of the newly analytical solution with previous one in literature was considered to determine the influence of the radial and exit boundary conditions on the solute transport the analytical results show that both the radial and exit boundary conditions substantially affect the trailing segment of the breakthrough curves for a soil medium with large dispersion coefficients two simulations were taken by mc keown et al 1999 to study the fluid flow in the sellafield region the simulation of fluid flow assumes that the flow is steady state in two dimensions and coupled with heat flow simulation code from the sensitivity analyses of geological variables the groundwater flow through the potential repository site was dependent upon the hydraulic conductivity of the borrowdale volcanic group and was unaffected by the hydraulic conductivity of other hydro stratigraphic units zhou et al 2017 proposed a model to reveal the effects of cross anisotropic aquifer behavior on hydraulic head and land deformation as a result of comparison between the calculated results with the measured field values the methods can be a useful tool for designing groundwater pumping projects the main objective of this study is to investigate the management of groundwater resources in the al mansourieh zone using groundwater modeling system gmss software three scenarios of operation times 12 8 and 6 hours day were taken to test the drawdown head of groundwater the optimal management of water usage in the groundwater was selected depending upon the period of appearance the dry cells 2 hydrology of the study area al mansourieh city is an administrative unit at the north eastern part of al khalis city within province of diyala and locates between the latitude 34 08 north and the longitude 44 96 east as shown in fig 1 the area of al mansourieh city is about 830km2 and consists of 17 agricultural zones as shown in figure the diyala river runs along the city from north to south and the al khalis river flows through the city from the north east to south west so the main source for groundwater can be considered to be surface water derived from diyala and al khalis rivers the type of aquifer is unconfined within saturated zone with depth of nearly 10 25m below the ground surface the main factors that control the potential yield of groundwater in aquifer is hydraulic properties and storage coefficient the study area lies within the unstable sidewalk and within the scope of the low lying folds of them particularly in the hamrin mountains and alluvial plain from the geological configuration of the area we can know the soil structure and the type of parent material the most of original substance in the study area are depositions of the tigris and diyala during the quaternary age where the soils were formed from the decomposition and the effect of the fragmentation of the rock because weathering 3 climatic conditions recorded meteorological data of al khalis meteorological station have been used to evaluate the climate logical characteristics of the study area the meteorological data are temperature sunshine relative humidity wind rainfall and evaporation table 1 shows the monthly and annual average meteorological elements at al khalis station the average annual temperature is 22 2 c and the maximum monthly average temperature is 34 c in july while the minimum is 9 7 c in january the fluctuation between day and night temperatures is appreciable in winter as well as in summer the study area experiences long hours of sunshine especially in the summer the annual rate for the sunshine of the al khalis station is 8 5h day the maximum sunshine duration occurs in june with a monthly average of 11 4h day the minimum monthly average is 5 6h day in december the average value of relative humidity varies from 34 in june and july to 76 9 in january with annual average value that reaches up to 52 5 rainfall begins in october and ends in may after which it becomes scarce the maximum monthly average rainfall is 32 3mm occurring in january the minimum is 3mm during in may with an annual rainfall average of 149 7mm the maximum monthly average wind speed is 3 4m s during july while the minimum is 1 7m s during in november with an annual wind speed average of 2 5m s the maximum and minimum monthly averages of evaporation are 384 4 and 51 9mm in july and december respectively generally high annual evaporation rates characterize the climate of the study area it is clear from table 1 that the evaporation is many times higher than the rainfall which means that there is no important groundwater recharges from rainfall within the study area most groundwater recharge from precipitation commonly occurs during spring months when evaporation is small and soil moisture is maintained at or above field capacity during summer evaporation and soil moisture requirements are much higher and effectively reduce groundwater runoff so groundwater table is much less in july than in december 4 land use and land cover the area of al mansourieh city is about 830km2 and consists of 17 agricultural zones agriculture and the crops that are grown in this area are varying depending on the nature of the soil the study area consists of three types of soil the first type is a soft soil with high clay content and covers the largest area about 55 of the study area and characterized by the cultivation of all winter and summer crops the second type is a medium softness and represents the lands distributed along the diyala river and represented 28 of the total area and distinguished in the cultivation of palms and oranges groves while the third type is rough soil with a high proportion of sand and represents the heights of the hamrin mountains and its surrounding lands and lies outside arable land due to their inappropriate topography for agricultural production the plants covering the area are divided into two main types perennial and annual plants the perennial plants consist of alhagi maurorum lagunychium tamarix mannifera lyciumbarbarum etc while the annual plants consist of loinm rigidum malvoparuifluor hardumsp silybum marianuim etc 5 materials and methods 5 1 governing equation of groundwater flow numerical solution is the most common method of understanding the behavior and management of groundwater sources that allowed the researchers to develop a comprehensive conception of the groundwater systems the numerical model used the finite difference technique based on the continuity hypothesis and darcy s law using darcy s law and the principle of conservation of mass the general equation of groundwater flow in three dimensions can be expressed as follows maheswaran et al 2016 1 x k x h h x y k y h h y z k z h h z w s c h t where x y z cartesian coordinates l k x k y k z the hydraulic conductivity l t h head of groundwater pressure l w flux per unit volume l3 t s c specific storage for the porous medium dimensionless t time t the numerical solution of eq 1 depends on dividing the space into network of points and the time into certain periods using finite difference technique the way of the constituent cells of rows and columns that are linked mathematically with each other by central points nodes sets in every strip mall
