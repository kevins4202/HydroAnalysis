18530,uv irradiation was reported to be able to degrade some kinds of dbps yet its influence on the toxicity of chlorinated water to mammalian cells remains unknown this study systematically investigated the influence of low pressure uv irradiation on the dbps and toxicity of chlorinated drinking water dw and reclaimed water rw the apparent first order rate constant k obs of degradation kinetics of known dbps increased with the increased br substitutions haloacetonitriles were identified as toxicity drivers among the detected dbps which even contributed more to the toxicity after uv irradiation mainly due to the refractory bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and dichloroacetonitrile dcan both total organic halogen cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were significantly removed under uv irradiation with the removal rate of 22 9 41 7 for cytotoxicity and a higher rate of 33 1 55 5 for genotoxicity under 2400 mj cm2 irradiation uv irradiation significantly decreased the uv254 suva254 and fluorescence intensity flu of chlorinated water results from high performance size exclusion chromatography revealed that chlorinated dw mainly contained high molecular weight mw compounds 1000 da while chlorinated rw mainly contained lower mw compounds 100 500 da chromophores and fluorophores in compounds of 100 500 da increased in chlorinated dw while decreased in chlorinated rw under uv irradiation both the removal of uv254 suva254 flu mw based uv254 1000 da and mw based flu each fractions were significantly correlated p 0 05 with the removal of toxicity under uv irradiation the uv254 of chlorinated water was recommended as the optimal surrogate for toxicity removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorination uv irradiation toxicity driver cytotoxicity genotoxicity surrogate 1 introduction chlorination is a major disinfection method used widely both in drinking water and reclaimed water treatment processes however disinfection by products dbps would generate during the chlorination process du et al 2017a hua and reckhow 2007 to date more than 700 kinds of dbp have been reported richardson and postigo 2011 despite so many dbps having been identified only four kinds of trihalomethanes thms five kinds of haloacetic acids haas chlorite and bromate are regulated guilherme and rodriguez 2014 richardson et al 2007 in recent years many unregulated emerging dbps have been reported and studied such as haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms haloacetamides hacams and halogenated aromatic dbps richardson et al 2007 jiang et al 2017 while the majority of dbps still remain unidentified more than 100 kinds of dbps have proved to be cytotoxic and genotoxic through in vitro assay wagner and plewa 2017 and around 20 kinds of dbps was found to be carcinogenic by in vivo assay richardson et al 2007 li and mitch 2018 the risk of dbps is therefore a major concern during water chlorination the risk posed by dbps can be controlled by reducing the concentration generally dbp concentrations can be controlled by precursor removal disinfection process optimization and elimination after formation doederer et al 2014 hua and reckhow 2007 wang et al 2013 in the supply system for drinking water or reclaimed water secondary water supply tanks are usually needed to store and supply water to users recently some studies showed that uv irradiation could degrade dbps such as haas and thms bu et al 2018 xiao et al 2014 zalazar et al 2007 there is a possibility to eliminate the dbp level in secondary water supply tanks by uv irradiation right before use however previous studies mainly focused on several typical dbps or dbps in synthetic water the degradation of overall dbps generated in real water by uv photolysis needs further investigation among many kinds of dbps the regulated dbps like thms are most widely studied owing to their widespread presence and high concentrations in chlorinated water samples however only focusing on the high concentration dbps might be insufficient to guarantee the water safety because many emerging dbps especially nitrogenous dbps n dbps muellner et al 2007 are high toxic contaminants for example the emerging dbp bromochloroacetonitrile bcan is 1000 times more cytotoxic than tcm wagner and plewa 2017 identifying the toxicity drivers in known dbps by both considering the concentration and toxic potency would be more scientifically significant in risk control moreover due to the different degradation efficiency of dbps under uv irradiation it is therefore also necessary to understand toxicity drivers in chlorinated water after uv irradiation although more than 700 dbps have been identified known dbps comprise only a small fraction of all dbps generally accounting for 30 of the total organic halogen tox kristiana et al 2015 therefore changes of tox under uv irradiation would give a full description of dbp degradation furthermore the concern lies behind the dbps is their toxic effects the incomplete dehalogenation of dbps does not necessarily decrease the toxicity for example during the dehalogenation of trichloroacetic acid monochloroacetic acid might form liu et al 2017 which is even more toxic than trichloroacetic acid wagner and plewa 2017 similarly for haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides less halogen substitution generally leads to higher toxicity wagner and plewa 2017 toxicity elimination is the ultimate goal of dbp control cytotoxicity tests are mostly used to analyze the lethal effects of contaminants du et al 2017b sayess et al 2017 some dbps might not cause direct cell death but impair the genetic materials at low concentration levels mckie et al 2015 zheng et al 2015 results of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity would give a more comprehensive understanding about the effects of dbp control by uv irradiation yet few studies clarified the toxicity changes of chlorinated water under uv irradiation cytotoxicity and genotoxicity are ideal indexes to characterize the water safety however the drawback is the cost of time and money during toxicity assay when degrading dbps uv irradiation alters the water quality indexes at the same time finding surrogates for the toxicity changes would be more convenient for the toxicity regulation in previous studies some water parameters could be used as surrogates for toxicity formation during water chlorination such as uv254 absorbance can use as a surrogate for the increase of cytotoxicity du et al 2017b the formation of anti estrogenic activity can be predicted by fluorescence flu intensity tang et al 2014 however little research clarified surrogates for the toxicity removal of chlorinated water especially for cytotoxicity removal and genotoxicity removal under uv irradiation the main objective of this study is thusly to understand the effects of uv irradiation on toxicity removal of dbps in chlorinated drinking water and reclaimed water degradation kinetics of dbps toxicity drivers in chlorinated water before and after uv irradiation were investigated changes in tox cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of chlorinated water under uv irradiation were investigated furthermore water quality parameters and molecular weight mw distribution were measured to analyze their correlation with toxicity and identify suitable surrogates for indicating toxicity

into inorganic halides the cl and br concentrations were determined by ion chromatography ics 900 thermofisher scientific usa after irradiation the tox content was calculated from the difference between inorganic halide contents before and after vuv irradiation 2 7 toxicity index calculation cytotoxicity index and genotoxicity index were calculated using the toxic potency data reported by wagner and plewa 2017 in the literature the cytotoxicity index cti of the detected dbps was calculated based on the concentration at which the relative cell viability was 50 lc50 using a crystal violet cytotoxicity assay the genotoxicity index gti of the detected dbps was calculated using the scge 50 tail dna tdna value obtained using a single cell gel electrophoresis scge genotoxicity assay wagner and plewa 2017 both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assays used chinese hamster ovary cho cell line as the subject the lc50 and 50 tdna values of individual dbps are shown in table s3 as reported by wagner and plewa 2017 assuming that the toxicity of individual dbps was additive the cti and gti were weighted for toxic potency by dividing the dbp concentrations by the lc50 or 50 tdna values chuang et al 2019 2 8 molecular weight mw distribution transformation transformations in the molecular weight distributions of chlorinated water samples after uv irradiation were characterized by high

fab2 alexa fluor 647 molecular probe and hoechst 33258 together finally cell images were obtained using an hca system imagexpress micro molecular devices usa each test was performed with 4 6 replicates the ph2ax values per cell for which the cell viability was higher than 70 were used to obtain concentration response curves details can be found in wu et al 2019 2 12 statistical analysis dbp degradation under uv irradiation was fitted by first order reaction kinetics for cytotoxicity assay the relative cell viability against the negative control v s different concentration factors

negative control v s different concentration factors were used to obtain concentration response curves the concentration of the 1 5 fold induction rate ir1 5 of ph2ax per well was used to calculate the genotoxicity equivalents 4 nqo one way analysis of variance anova was used to determine whether there was a significant decrease in sample toxicity after uv irradiation p 0 05 to find the surrogates for toxicity removal under uv irradiation linear fitting was applied to the removal rate of toxicity and water quality parameter and the significant correlation was considered when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of detected dbps under uv irradiation concentration of the detected dbps after chlorination and their changes during uv irradiation are shown in figs s2a 2d the formation of thms during chlorination were highest in both rw and dw compared with other dbps especially in dw which was similar to the previous result krasner et al 2016 tcp ch dcan and tcacam were also found in chlorinated dw at concentrations of 10 8 8 0 5 2 and 1 7 Î¼g l respectively concentrations of nitrogenous dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetamide in chlorinated rw were higher than chlorinated dw which might be because rw contain more organic nitrogen hu et al 2016 owing to the presence of br brominated dbps br dbps were found in rw such as bdcm and bcan except tcp and ch all dbps showed significant degradation under uv irradiation in dw almost all of tcacam was removed tcm and dcan reduced 85 8 and 30 in 2000 s 2400 mj cm2 the removal rates of tcm in rw were around 58 which was a little lower compared with in dw the tcnm which only found in rw was also significantly removed by 91 1 and 80 1 in rw a and rw b the removal rate of br dbps were higher than there chlorinated counterparts for example bcan reduced by 55 in rw while dcan only reduced by 20 30 fig 1 d shows the apparent first order rate constants of degradation kobs of the detected dbps in dw and rw kinetics curves of dbps in each sample are shown in fig 1a c br dbps degraded faster than their chlorinated counterparts under uv irradiation the k obs values increased with the number of br substitutions increasing for example the degradation order was tbm cdbm tcm and dban bcan dcan other dbps such as haloacetic acids thms and halophenolic also followed this degradation rule which was reported previously wang et al 2017a b xiao et al 2014 liu et al 2019 the carbon halogen bonds in dbps such as c br and c cl can be broken by sufficient internal energy through absorption of the photon of uv light to an excited state pandit et al 2016 the photon absorption capacity of dbps depends on their molar extinction coefficient Îµ higher Îµ values lead to a faster degradation in dbps through direct uv photodegradation fang et al 2013 each substitution of a br can increase the Îµ value of trihalogenated dbps by 240 74 m 1cm 1 chuang et al 2016 indicating that more br substitution leads to an increase in the photodegradation rate of dbps as confirmed by our results in a previous study dcan was found to hardly degrade in ultrapure water under uv direct photolysis with a uv intensity of 6 23 mw cm2 hou et al 2017 which was much higher than that in this study 1 2 mw cm2 however the k obs values of dcan in dw and rw in this study were 0 132 0 170 10 3 s 1 indicating that direct uv photolysis was not the only degradation pathway for dbps in dw and rw hydroxyl radical oh and other radicals have been found to play an important role in the degradation of some dbps such as thms and 2 4 bromophenol luo et al 2019 xiao et al 2014 in rw and dw triplet dissolved organic matter 3dom and reactive oxygen species ros can be generated through uv irradiation of dissolved organic matter dom jacobs et al 2011 vione et al 2006 these radicals can react with br cn c h and other bonds eventually leading to bond cleavage and reconstruction wang et al 2018 which contributes to dbp degradation compared with cl substitution br substitution improved the reactivity of dbps with oh chuang et al 2016 this also explained why the kobs values of dbps were higher with the increased br substitution 3 2 toxicity drivers in detected dbps before and after uv irradiation to determine which dbps posed the greatest risk among the detected dbps before and after uv irradiation by using the toxic potency data of individual dbps reported by the same group wagner and plewa 2017 cytotoxicity index cti and genotoxicity index gti of the detected dbps to cho cells were calculated the cti of detected dbps in chlorinated rw and chlorinated dw were significantly decreased by uv irradiation with 32 1 42 2 and 51 0 removal from dw rw a and rw b respectively after uv irradiation at 2400 mj cm2 clearly before uv irradiation hans contributed most of the cti in all three water samples fig 2 a and b in dw dcan was the main cytotoxicity driver with its contribution ratio to the cti increasing from 86 0 to 89 4 after uv irradiation the remaining cti of less than 15 was contributed by tcm ch and tcacam the regulated tcm only contributed 8 6 of the cti initially decreasing to 3 1 after uv irradiation 2400 mj cm2 before uv irradiation hans had a greater effect on the cti in rw more than 97 which contained dcan bcan and dban contributed 38 8 52 6 and 5 8 of cti in chlorinated rw a 25 4 55 1 and 17 6 of cti in chlorinated rw b respectively when the uv dose reached 2400 mj cm2 97 of the cti was contributed by dcan and bcan furthermore the contributions of tcm to the cti were less than 1 in rw the results showed a decrease in the gti of detected dbps similar to that of the cti fig 2c and d uv irradiation significantly decreased the gtis of dw rw a and rw b by 35 5 61 2 and 65 4 respectively the initial contribution ratio of the gti of hans to dw rw a and rw b was 91 4 69 7 and 83 6 respectively all of which increased to more than 90 after irradiation with a uv dose of 2400 mj cm2 bcan and dcan remained the major toxicity drivers during uv photolysis tcnm made a different contribution to the gti of untreated rw a and rw b at 27 9 and 15 2 respectively however owing to the rapid degradation of tcnm its contribution to the gti was less than 10 after uv irradiation hans were the major toxicity drivers among the detected dbps especially dcan and bcan although dbcn was more toxic than the other two plewa et al 2002 the amount of dbcn generated during chlorination was small and it degraded much faster under uv irradiation bcan and dcan were not only highly toxic but also had slow degradation rates under uv irradiation therefore the contribution ratios of bcan and dcan to the toxicity index increased during uv irradiation thms the regulated dbps had the highest concentrations among the detected dbps after chlorination and did make some contribution to the cti in dw before irradiation no more than 10 however owing to the much lower toxicity and higher degradation rates of thms compared with those of bcan and dcan their contribution ratio to the toxicity index decreased during uv irradiation in rw the concentration ratio of hans among the detected dbps was much higher than that in dw such that the toxicity index contribution of thms was negligible previous study also implied that hans were the toxicity drivers of known dbps in drinking water plewa et al 2017 however after uv irradiation this study for the first time revealed that hans even contributed more to the toxicity index mainly resulted from the recalcitrant bcan and dcan under uv irradiation these results suggested that except for uv irradiation other treatments might be needed to further eliminate the hans to guarantee the water safety 3 3 removal of tox by uv irradiation the known dbps generally only accounted for 30 of the total halogenated dbps krasner et al 2006 the tox content is widely used to indicate the total halogenated dbp content du et al 2018b jiang et al 2017 wu et al 2019 therefore to comprehensively understand the removal of dbps under uv irradiation changes in tox contents were investigated fig 3 shows the effect of uv irradiation on the tox contents in each water sample the initial tocl concentration in dw rw a and rw b was 315 8 212 3 and 116 7 Î¼g l respectively after uv irradiation the tocl contents of all chlorinated water samples were significantly decreased by 25 9 35 1 and 53 6 for rw a rw b and dw respectively tobr was only found in rw at about 10 Î¼g l with more than 60 degradation under uv irradiation the removal rate of which was higher than that of tocl as the tox comprises a mixture of different dbps it might be improper to fit the degradation kinetics however by plotting the c c0 vs uv dose it was found that tobr clearly degraded faster than the tocl which was similar to the degradation of detected dbps all these results suggested that brominated dbps were more easily degraded than chlorinated dbps under uv irradiation 3 4 removal of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity as shown above although it was found that hans were toxicity drivers among the detected dbps the toxicity index from all the detected dbps remained very low only at 10 3 level the level of 1 means lc50 only focusing on the toxicity of a few known dbps is not enough evaluation of changes in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of all the dbps under uv irradiation are therefore necessary the concentration response curves of cytotoxicity for each sample are shown in fig 4 a c the curves shifted to the right as the uv dose increased leading to an increased lc50 which indicated decreased cytotoxicity the cytotoxicity equivalent was significantly reduced by uv irradiation fig 4d by 22 9 29 8 and 41 7 p 0 05 for chlorinated dw rw a and rw b respectively the rate of cytotoxicity decrease was fast in the first 600 mj cm2 but gradually slowed thereafter the cytotoxicity assay reflected the macroscopic hazards of dbps on cho cells while the genotoxicity assay evaluated the effects of dbps on cellular genes in this study ph2ax was measured to characterize the dna double strand breaks dsbs which is the most severe form of dna damage khanna and jackson 2001 mills et al 2003 fig 5 a and fig s4 shows the images of ph2ax foci formed in cell nucleus when cells were exposed to chlorinated water before and after uv irradiation uv dose 2400 mj cm2 there was a significant decrease of ph2ax foci numbers after the uv irradiation of chlorinated water the ir1 5 value increased with increasing uv dose representing the decrease in genotoxicity under uv irradiation fig 5b and fig s5 compared with the reduction in cytotoxicity uv irradiation had a greater influence on the removal of genotoxicity fig 5c the initial genotoxicity of chlorinated rw was higher than that of chlorinated dw uv irradiation significantly reduced the genotoxicity by 33 1 46 5 and 55 5 p 0 05 for chlorinated dw rw a and rw b respectively the trend in the reduction rate of genotoxicity was similar to that of cytotoxicity showing gradual slowing as the uv dose increased in conclusion uv irradiation could significantly reduce the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of chlorinated water 3 5 effect of uv irradiation on the quality of chlorinated water changes in doc content uv254 absorbance and flu values of chlorinated water were measured the doc contents of the three chlorinated water samples did not change much during uv irradiation fig s6 showing that uv irradiation was difficult to mineralize the organic matters uv irradiation significantly reduced the uv254 and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 of chlorinated dw and chlorinated rw fig s7 and fig s8 which represented the reduction in aromaticity double bonds and other unsaturated bonds singer 1999 uyguner and bekbolet 2005 feem was divided into five regions according to a previous study chen et al 2003 dw contained more fulvic humic substances region â² while rw contained more tryptophan like proteins region â± figs s9 s11 after uv irradiation the flu values of all chlorinated water samples first increased slightly and then decreased fig s12 the organic matters in water have been substantially oxidized during chlorination which led to the reduction in flu values when water samples were irradiated with uv the generated hydrated electron e aq are generated which can partially reduce the oxidized organic matters causing the flu value to increase neta et al 1988 then with increasing uv dose the flu value decreased due to further degradation of organic matters 3 6 changes of mw distribution under uv irradiation figs 6 s13 and s14 show the spectra of mw distribution of chlorinated dw and chlorinated rw under uv irradiation as determined by hpsec coupled with three tandem flu uv and toc detectors to quantitatively determine the changes in the different mw fractions of the organic matter the chromatograms were deconvoluted into gaussian peaks according to a previous study l wang et al 2017 chromatograms were divided into four fractions based on the apparent mw namely f1 100 da f2 100 500 da f3 500 1000 da and f4 1000 da signals from all the three detectors suggested that dw mainly contained high mw f4 1000 da while rw mainly contained lower mw f2 100 500 da this was in accordance with previous study that organic matters in rw consists of more low mw compounds hu et al 2016 the hpsec flu showed that changes in the flu ex em 240 360 nm of chlorinated dw first increased and then decreased with this change mainly attributed to 100 500 da compounds fig s13b hpsec flu tended to decrease with increasing uv dose in chlorinated rw especially for f2 100 500 da fig 6 b therefore it seems that fluorophores in f2 100 500 da were most susceptible to uv irradiation the hpsec toc showed that toc content in all three samples did not change much during uv irradiation but showed significant transformations between different mw fractions high mw f4 1000 da decreased while f3 500 1000 da increased which mainly occurred under the first 300 mj cm2 uv irradiation fig 6c the hpsec uv showed that uv254 absorbance of all three water samples showed a downward trend under uv irradiation in chlorinated dw the decrease in uv254 absorbance was mainly due to high mw f4 1000 da fig s13d simultaneously the uv254 absorbance of the low mw f2 100 500 da increased which might be attributed to the transformation of high mw compounds into low mw compounds for chlorinated rw the decreased uv254 mainly resulted from the fractions with mw 100 da fig 6d and fig s14d suggesting that chromophores in f2 f4 were more susceptible to uv irradiation uyguner and bekbolet 2005 3 7 correlation between removal of toxicity and water quality parameters to identify surrogates of toxicity removal during uv irradiation when there was a significant linear correlation p 0 05 between toxicity removal and changes in water quality parameters the coefficient of determination r2 was used to evaluate the degree of relevance taylor 1990 the data are summarized in table 1 no significant correlation was observed between removal of doc content and the toxicity because uv irradiation cause little mineralization of the organic matters removal of uv254 and suva254 showed good correlation with removal of cytotoxicity p 0 003 r2 0 602 and p 0 002 r2 0 619 respectively and genotoxicity p 0 001 r2 0 757 and p 0 001 r2 0 744 respectively figs s15a s15d the flu values from five regions were significantly correlated with the removal of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity especially the total flu value p 0 001 r2 0 816 and p 0 001 r2 0 793 respectively figs s15e and s15f the strong correlation between toxicity removal and the changes in flu value uv254 and suva254 indicated that toxicity removal from chlorinated water during uv irradiation occurred simultaneously with the oxidation of unsaturated bonds by evaluating the relationship between the mw distribution and the toxicity removal rate the uv254 absorbance of f4 1000 da was found to be strongly correlated p 0 001 with the toxicity removal rate with r2 values of 0 761 and 0 844 for cytotoxicity and genotoxicity respectively no strong correlation between the uv254 absorbance of fractions with mw 1000 da and toxicity removal was found for mw based flu except f1 100 da all fractions were significantly correlated with toxicity removal the mw based toc cannot serve as surrogates for toxicity removal as no significant correlation was found in all the fractions considering the total flu value would first increase it may be improper to indicate the toxicity removal when uv dose was less than 300 mj cm2 besides the availability of suva254 also requires the measurement of uv254 therefore changes in uv254 was the best surrogate for toxicity removal during uv irradiation of chlorinated water uv254 of f4 1000 da and mw based flu were not recommended to be surrogates due to the inconvenient availability and relatively low r2 although they were significantly correlated with toxicity removal 4 conclusions influences of uv irradiation on chlorinated water were systematically investigated in this study degradation kinetics of known dbps and their toxicity indexes were evaluated changes in tox contents cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of chlorinated water were studied the correlation between removal of toxicity and water quality parameters were also evaluated to identify surrogates for toxicity removal the main conclusions were as follows 1 for the same class of dbps increase in the number of br substitutions increased the degradation kobs under uv irradiation hans were the toxicity drivers in the detected dbps in chlorinated water which even contributed more to the toxicity index after uv irradiation with the refractory bcan and dcan being the main contributor 2 uv irradiation significantly decreased the tox in chlorinated water under the uv dose of 2400 mj cm2 tocl was eliminated by 25 9 53 6 while tobr was eliminated with a higher ratio of around 60 both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were significantly removed under uv irradiation with the removal rate of 22 9 41 7 for cytotoxicity equivalent and a higher rate of 33 1 55 5 for genotoxicity equivalents 3 uv irradiation showed little impact on doc of chlorinated water but significantly reduced the uv254 and suva254 flu values first increased then followed by a decrease under uv irradiation results of hpsec revealed that chlorinated dw mainly contained high mw compound 1000 da while chlorinated rw mainly contained lower mw compound 100 500 da chromophores and fluorophores in f2 100 500 da increased in chlorinated dw while decreased in chlorinated rw under uv irradiation 4 both the removal of uv254 suva254 flu total and five regions mw based uv254 1000 da and mw based flu were significantly correlated with the removal of toxicity in chlorinated water under

18530,uv irradiation was reported to be able to degrade some kinds of dbps yet its influence on the toxicity of chlorinated water to mammalian cells remains unknown this study systematically investigated the influence of low pressure uv irradiation on the dbps and toxicity of chlorinated drinking water dw and reclaimed water rw the apparent first order rate constant k obs of degradation kinetics of known dbps increased with the increased br substitutions haloacetonitriles were identified as toxicity drivers among the detected dbps which even contributed more to the toxicity after uv irradiation mainly due to the refractory bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and dichloroacetonitrile dcan both total organic halogen cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were significantly removed under uv irradiation with the removal rate of 22 9 41 7 for cytotoxicity and a higher rate of 33 1 55 5 for genotoxicity under 2400 mj cm2 irradiation uv irradiation significantly decreased the uv254 suva254 and fluorescence intensity flu of chlorinated water results from high performance size exclusion chromatography revealed that chlorinated dw mainly contained high molecular weight mw compounds 1000 da while chlorinated rw mainly contained lower mw compounds 100 500 da chromophores and fluorophores in compounds of 100 500 da increased in chlorinated dw while decreased in chlorinated rw under uv irradiation both the removal of uv254 suva254 flu mw based uv254 1000 da and mw based flu each fractions were significantly correlated p 0 05 with the removal of toxicity under uv irradiation the uv254 of chlorinated water was recommended as the optimal surrogate for toxicity removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorination uv irradiation toxicity driver cytotoxicity genotoxicity surrogate 1 introduction chlorination is a major disinfection method used widely both in drinking water and reclaimed water treatment processes however disinfection by products dbps would generate during the chlorination process du et al 2017a hua and reckhow 2007 to date more than 700 kinds of dbp have been reported richardson and postigo 2011 despite so many dbps having been identified only four kinds of trihalomethanes thms five kinds of haloacetic acids haas chlorite and bromate are regulated guilherme and rodriguez 2014 richardson et al 2007 in recent years many unregulated emerging dbps have been reported and studied such as haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms haloacetamides hacams and halogenated aromatic dbps richardson et al 2007 jiang et al 2017 while the majority of dbps still remain unidentified more than 100 kinds of dbps have proved to be cytotoxic and genotoxic through in vitro assay wagner and plewa 2017 and around 20 kinds of dbps was found to be carcinogenic by in vivo assay richardson et al 2007 li and mitch 2018 the risk of dbps is therefore a major concern during water chlorination the risk posed by dbps can be controlled by reducing the concentration generally dbp concentrations can be controlled by precursor removal disinfection process optimization and elimination after formation doederer et al 2014 hua and reckhow 2007 wang et al 2013 in the supply system for drinking water or reclaimed water secondary water supply tanks are usually needed to store and supply water to users recently some studies showed that uv irradiation could degrade dbps such as haas and thms bu et al 2018 xiao et al 2014 zalazar et al 2007 there is a possibility to eliminate the dbp level in secondary water supply tanks by uv irradiation right before use however previous studies mainly focused on several typical dbps or dbps in synthetic water the degradation of overall dbps generated in real water by uv photolysis needs further investigation among many kinds of dbps the regulated dbps like thms are most widely studied owing to their widespread presence and high concentrations in chlorinated water samples however only focusing on the high concentration dbps might be insufficient to guarantee the water safety because many emerging dbps especially nitrogenous dbps n dbps muellner et al 2007 are high toxic contaminants for example the emerging dbp bromochloroacetonitrile bcan is 1000 times more cytotoxic than tcm wagner and plewa 2017 identifying the toxicity drivers in known dbps by both considering the concentration and toxic potency would be more scientifically significant in risk control moreover due to the different degradation efficiency of dbps under uv irradiation it is therefore also necessary to understand toxicity drivers in chlorinated water after uv irradiation although more than 700 dbps have been identified known dbps comprise only a small fraction of all dbps generally accounting for 30 of the total organic halogen tox kristiana et al 2015 therefore changes of tox under uv irradiation would give a full description of dbp degradation furthermore the concern lies behind the dbps is their toxic effects the incomplete dehalogenation of dbps does not necessarily decrease the toxicity for example during the dehalogenation of trichloroacetic acid monochloroacetic acid might form liu et al 2017 which is even more toxic than trichloroacetic acid wagner and plewa 2017 similarly for haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides less halogen substitution generally leads to higher toxicity wagner and plewa 2017 toxicity elimination is the ultimate goal of dbp control cytotoxicity tests are mostly used to analyze the lethal effects of contaminants du et al 2017b sayess et al 2017 some dbps might not cause direct cell death but impair the genetic materials at low concentration levels mckie et al 2015 zheng et al 2015 results of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity would give a more comprehensive understanding about the effects of dbp control by uv irradiation yet few studies clarified the toxicity changes of chlorinated water under uv irradiation cytotoxicity and genotoxicity are ideal indexes to characterize the water safety however the drawback is the cost of time and money during toxicity assay when degrading dbps uv irradiation alters the water quality indexes at the same time finding surrogates for the toxicity changes would be more convenient for the toxicity regulation in previous studies some water parameters could be used as surrogates for toxicity formation during water chlorination such as uv254 absorbance can use as a surrogate for the increase of cytotoxicity du et al 2017b the formation of anti estrogenic activity can be predicted by fluorescence flu intensity tang et al 2014 however little research clarified surrogates for the toxicity removal of chlorinated water especially for cytotoxicity removal and genotoxicity removal under uv irradiation the main objective of this study is thusly to understand the effects of uv irradiation on toxicity removal of dbps in chlorinated drinking water and reclaimed water degradation kinetics of dbps toxicity drivers in chlorinated water before and after uv irradiation were investigated changes in tox cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of chlorinated water under uv irradiation were investigated furthermore water quality parameters and molecular weight mw distribution were measured to analyze their correlation with toxicity and identify suitable surrogates for indicating toxicity

wagner and plewa 2017 in the literature the cytotoxicity index cti of the detected dbps was calculated based on the concentration at which the relative cell viability was 50 lc50 using a crystal violet cytotoxicity assay the genotoxicity index gti of the detected dbps was calculated using the scge 50 tail dna tdna value obtained using a single cell gel electrophoresis scge genotoxicity assay wagner and plewa 2017 both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assays used chinese hamster ovary cho cell line as the subject the lc50 and 50 tdna values of individual dbps are shown in table s3 as reported by wagner and plewa 2017 assuming that the toxicity of individual dbps was additive the cti and gti were weighted for toxic potency by dividing the dbp concentrations by the lc50 or 50 tdna values chuang et al 2019 2 8 molecular weight mw distribution transformation transformations in the molecular weight distributions of chlorinated water samples after uv irradiation were characterized by high

surrogates for toxicity removal under uv irradiation linear fitting was applied to the removal rate of toxicity and water quality parameter and the significant correlation was considered when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of detected dbps under uv irradiation concentration of the detected dbps after chlorination and their changes during uv irradiation are shown in figs s2a 2d the formation of thms during chlorination were highest in both rw and dw compared with other dbps especially in dw which was similar to the previous result krasner et al 2016 tcp ch dcan and tcacam were also found in chlorinated dw at concentrations of 10 8 8 0 5 2 and 1 7 Î¼g l respectively concentrations of nitrogenous dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetamide in chlorinated rw were higher than chlorinated dw which might be because rw contain more organic nitrogen hu et al 2016 owing to the presence of br brominated dbps br dbps were found in rw such as bdcm and bcan except tcp and ch all dbps showed significant degradation under uv irradiation in dw almost all of tcacam was removed tcm and dcan reduced 85 8 and 30 in 2000 s 2400 mj cm2 the removal rates of tcm in rw were around 58 which was a little lower compared with in dw the tcnm which only found in rw was also significantly removed by 91 1 and 80 1 in rw a and rw b the removal rate of br dbps were higher than there chlorinated counterparts for example bcan reduced by 55 in rw while dcan only reduced by 20 30 fig 1 d shows the apparent first order rate constants of degradation kobs of the detected dbps in dw and rw kinetics curves of dbps in each sample are shown in fig 1a c br dbps degraded faster than their chlorinated counterparts under uv irradiation the k obs values increased with the number of br substitutions increasing for example the degradation order was tbm cdbm tcm and dban bcan dcan other dbps such as haloacetic acids thms and halophenolic also followed this degradation rule which was reported previously wang et al 2017a b xiao et al 2014 liu et al 2019 the carbon halogen bonds in dbps such as c br and c cl can be broken by sufficient internal energy through absorption of the photon of uv light to an excited state pandit et al 2016 the photon absorption capacity of dbps depends on their molar extinction coefficient Îµ higher Îµ values lead to a faster degradation in dbps through direct uv photodegradation fang et al 2013 each substitution of a br can increase the Îµ value of trihalogenated dbps by 240 74 m 1cm 1 chuang et al 2016 indicating that more br substitution leads to an increase in the photodegradation rate of dbps as confirmed by our results in a previous study dcan was found to hardly degrade in ultrapure water under uv direct photolysis with a uv intensity of 6 23 mw cm2 hou et al 2017 which was much higher than that in this study 1 2 mw cm2 however the k obs values of dcan in dw and rw in this study were 0 132 0 170 10 3 s 1 indicating that direct uv photolysis was not the only degradation pathway for dbps in dw and rw hydroxyl radical oh and other radicals have been found to play an important role in the degradation of some dbps such as thms and 2 4 bromophenol luo et al 2019 xiao et al 2014 in rw and dw triplet dissolved organic matter 3dom and reactive oxygen species ros can be generated through uv irradiation of dissolved organic matter dom jacobs et al 2011 vione et al 2006 these radicals can react with br cn c h and other bonds eventually leading to bond cleavage and reconstruction wang et al 2018 which contributes to dbp degradation compared with cl substitution br substitution improved the reactivity of dbps with oh chuang et al 2016 this also explained why the kobs values of dbps were higher with the increased br substitution 3 2 toxicity drivers in detected dbps before and after uv irradiation to determine which dbps posed the greatest risk among the detected dbps before and after uv irradiation by using the toxic potency data of individual dbps reported by the same group wagner and plewa 2017 cytotoxicity index cti and genotoxicity index gti of the detected dbps to cho cells were calculated the cti of detected dbps in chlorinated rw and chlorinated dw were significantly decreased by uv irradiation with 32 1 42 2 and 51 0 removal from dw rw a and rw b respectively after uv irradiation at 2400 mj cm2 clearly before uv irradiation hans contributed most of the cti in all three water samples fig 2 a and b in dw dcan was the main cytotoxicity driver with its contribution ratio to the cti increasing from 86 0 to 89 4 after uv irradiation the remaining cti of less than 15 was contributed by tcm ch and tcacam the regulated tcm only contributed 8 6 of the cti initially decreasing to 3 1 after uv irradiation 2400 mj cm2 before uv irradiation hans had a greater effect on the cti in rw more than 97 which contained dcan bcan and dban contributed 38 8 52 6 and 5 8 of cti in chlorinated rw a 25 4 55 1 and 17 6 of cti in chlorinated rw b respectively when the uv dose reached 2400 mj cm2 97 of the cti was contributed by dcan and bcan furthermore the contributions of tcm to the cti were less than 1 in rw the results showed a decrease in the gti of detected dbps similar to that of the cti fig 2c and d uv irradiation significantly decreased the gtis of dw rw a and rw b by 35 5 61 2 and 65 4 respectively the initial contribution ratio of the gti of hans to dw rw a and rw b was 91 4 69 7 and 83 6 respectively all of which increased to more than 90 after irradiation with a uv dose of 2400 mj cm2 bcan and dcan remained the major toxicity drivers during uv photolysis tcnm made a different contribution to the gti of untreated rw a and rw b at 27 9 and 15 2 respectively however owing to the rapid degradation of tcnm its contribution to the gti was less than 10 after uv irradiation hans were the major toxicity drivers among the detected dbps especially dcan and bcan although dbcn was more toxic than the other two plewa et al 2002 the amount of dbcn generated during chlorination was small and it degraded much faster under uv irradiation bcan and dcan were not only highly toxic but also had slow degradation rates under uv irradiation therefore the contribution ratios of bcan and dcan to the toxicity index increased during uv irradiation thms the regulated dbps had the highest concentrations among the detected dbps after chlorination and did make some contribution to the cti in dw before irradiation no more than 10 however owing to the much lower toxicity and higher degradation rates of thms compared with those of bcan and dcan their contribution ratio to the toxicity index decreased during uv irradiation in rw the concentration ratio of hans among the detected dbps was much higher than that in dw such that the toxicity index contribution of thms was negligible previous study also implied that hans were the toxicity drivers of known dbps in drinking water plewa et al 2017 however after uv irradiation this study for the first time revealed that hans even contributed more to the toxicity index mainly resulted from the recalcitrant bcan and dcan under uv irradiation these results suggested that except for uv irradiation other treatments might be needed to further eliminate the hans to guarantee the water safety 3 3 removal of tox by uv irradiation the known dbps generally only accounted for 30 of the total halogenated dbps krasner et al 2006 the tox content is widely used to indicate the total halogenated dbp content du et al 2018b jiang et al 2017 wu et al 2019 therefore to comprehensively understand the removal of dbps under uv irradiation changes in tox contents were investigated fig 3 shows the effect of uv irradiation on the tox contents in each water sample the initial tocl concentration in dw rw a and rw b was 315 8 212 3 and 116 7 Î¼g l respectively after uv irradiation the tocl contents of all chlorinated water samples were significantly decreased by 25 9 35 1 and 53 6 for rw a rw b and dw respectively tobr was only found in rw at about 10 Î¼g l with more than 60 degradation under uv irradiation the removal rate of which was higher than that of tocl as the tox comprises a mixture of different dbps it might be improper to fit the degradation kinetics however by plotting the c c0 vs uv dose it was found that tobr clearly degraded faster than the tocl which was similar to the degradation of detected dbps all these results suggested that brominated dbps were more easily degraded than chlorinated dbps under uv irradiation 3 4 removal of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity as shown above although it was found that hans were toxicity drivers among the detected dbps the toxicity index from all the detected dbps remained very low only at 10 3 level the level of 1 means lc50 only focusing on the toxicity of a few known dbps is not enough evaluation of changes in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of all the dbps under uv irradiation are therefore necessary the concentration response curves of cytotoxicity for each sample are shown in fig 4 a c the curves shifted to the right as the uv dose increased leading to an increased lc50 which indicated decreased cytotoxicity the cytotoxicity equivalent was significantly reduced by uv irradiation fig 4d by 22 9 29 8 and 41 7 p 0 05 for chlorinated dw rw a and rw b respectively the rate of cytotoxicity decrease was fast in the first 600 mj cm2 but gradually slowed thereafter the cytotoxicity assay reflected the macroscopic hazards of dbps on cho cells while the genotoxicity assay evaluated the effects of dbps on cellular genes in this study ph2ax was measured to characterize the dna double strand breaks dsbs which is the most severe form of dna damage khanna and jackson 2001 mills et al 2003 fig 5 a and fig s4 shows the images of ph2ax foci formed in cell nucleus when cells were exposed to chlorinated water before and after uv irradiation uv dose 2400 mj cm2 there was a significant decrease of ph2ax foci numbers after the uv irradiation of chlorinated water the ir1 5 value increased with increasing uv dose representing the decrease in genotoxicity under uv irradiation fig 5b and fig s5 compared with the reduction in cytotoxicity uv irradiation had a greater influence on the removal of genotoxicity fig 5c the initial genotoxicity of chlorinated rw was higher than that of chlorinated dw uv irradiation significantly reduced the genotoxicity by 33 1 46 5 and 55 5 p 0 05 for chlorinated dw rw a and rw b respectively the trend in the reduction rate of genotoxicity was similar to that of cytotoxicity showing gradual slowing as the uv dose increased in conclusion uv irradiation could significantly reduce the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of chlorinated water 3 5 effect of uv irradiation on the quality of chlorinated water changes in doc content uv254 absorbance and flu values of chlorinated water were measured the doc contents of the three chlorinated water samples did not change much during uv irradiation fig s6 showing that uv irradiation was difficult to mineralize the organic matters uv irradiation significantly reduced the uv254 and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 of chlorinated dw and chlorinated rw fig s7 and fig s8 which represented the reduction in aromaticity double bonds and other unsaturated bonds singer 1999 uyguner and bekbolet 2005 feem was divided into five regions according to a previous study chen et al 2003 dw contained more fulvic humic substances region â² while rw contained more tryptophan like proteins region â± figs s9 s11 after uv irradiation the flu values of all chlorinated water samples first increased slightly and then decreased fig s12 the organic matters in water have been substantially oxidized during chlorination which led to the reduction in flu values when water samples were irradiated with uv the generated hydrated electron e aq are generated which can partially reduce the oxidized organic matters causing the flu value to increase neta et al 1988 then with increasing uv dose the flu value decreased due to further degradation of organic matters 3 6 changes of mw distribution under uv irradiation figs 6 s13 and s14 show the spectra of mw distribution of chlorinated dw and chlorinated rw under uv irradiation as determined by hpsec coupled with three tandem flu uv and toc detectors to quantitatively determine the changes in the different mw fractions of the organic matter the chromatograms were deconvoluted into gaussian peaks according to a previous study l wang et al 2017 chromatograms were divided into four fractions based on the apparent mw namely f1 100 da f2 100 500 da f3 500 1000 da and f4 1000 da signals from all the three detectors suggested that dw mainly contained high mw f4 1000 da while rw mainly contained lower mw f2 100 500 da this was in accordance with previous study that organic matters in rw consists of more low mw compounds hu et al 2016 the hpsec flu showed that changes in the flu ex em 240 360 nm of chlorinated dw first increased and then decreased with this change mainly attributed to 100 500 da compounds fig s13b hpsec flu tended to decrease with increasing uv dose in chlorinated rw especially for f2 100 500 da fig 6 b therefore it seems that fluorophores in f2 100 500 da were most susceptible to uv irradiation the hpsec toc showed that toc content in all three samples did not change much during uv irradiation but showed significant transformations between different mw fractions high mw f4 1000 da decreased while f3 500 1000 da increased which mainly occurred under the first 300 mj cm2 uv irradiation fig 6c the hpsec uv showed that uv254 absorbance of all three water samples showed a downward trend under uv irradiation in chlorinated dw the decrease in uv254 absorbance was mainly due to high mw f4 1000 da fig s13d simultaneously the uv254 absorbance of the low mw f2 100 500 da increased which might be attributed to the transformation of high mw compounds into low mw compounds for chlorinated rw the decreased uv254 mainly resulted from the fractions with mw 100 da fig 6d and fig s14d suggesting that chromophores in f2 f4 were more susceptible to uv irradiation uyguner and bekbolet 2005 3 7 correlation between removal of toxicity and water quality parameters to identify surrogates of toxicity removal during uv irradiation when there was a significant linear correlation p 0 05 between toxicity removal and changes in water quality parameters the coefficient of determination r2 was used to evaluate the degree of relevance taylor 1990 the data are summarized in table 1 no significant correlation was observed between removal of doc content and the toxicity because uv irradiation cause little mineralization of the organic matters removal of uv254 and suva254 showed good correlation with removal of cytotoxicity p 0 003 r2 0 602 and p 0 002 r2 0 619 respectively and genotoxicity p 0 001 r2 0 757 and p 0 001 r2 0 744 respectively figs s15a s15d the flu values from five regions were significantly correlated with the removal of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity especially the total flu value p 0 001 r2 0 816 and p 0 001 r2 0 793 respectively figs s15e and s15f the strong correlation between toxicity removal and the changes in flu value uv254 and suva254 indicated that toxicity removal from chlorinated water during uv irradiation occurred simultaneously with the oxidation of unsaturated bonds by evaluating the relationship between the mw distribution and the toxicity removal rate the uv254 absorbance of f4 1000 da was found to be strongly correlated p 0 001 with the toxicity removal rate with r2 values of 0 761 and 0 844 for cytotoxicity and genotoxicity respectively no strong correlation between the uv254 absorbance of fractions with mw 1000 da and toxicity removal was found for mw based flu except f1 100 da all fractions were significantly correlated with toxicity removal the mw based toc cannot serve as surrogates for toxicity removal as no significant correlation was found in all the fractions considering the total flu value would first increase it may be improper to indicate the toxicity removal when uv dose was less than 300 mj cm2 besides the availability of suva254 also requires the measurement of uv254 therefore changes in uv254 was the best surrogate for toxicity removal during uv irradiation of chlorinated water uv254 of f4 1000 da and mw based flu were not recommended to be surrogates due to the inconvenient availability and relatively low r2 although they were significantly correlated with toxicity removal 4 conclusions influences of uv irradiation on chlorinated water were systematically investigated in this study degradation kinetics of known dbps and their toxicity indexes were evaluated changes in tox contents cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of chlorinated water were studied the correlation between removal of toxicity and water quality parameters were also evaluated to identify surrogates for toxicity removal the main conclusions were as follows 1 for the same class of dbps increase in the number of br substitutions increased the degradation kobs under uv irradiation hans were the toxicity drivers in the detected dbps in chlorinated water which even contributed more to the toxicity index after uv irradiation with the refractory bcan and dcan being the main contributor 2 uv irradiation significantly decreased the tox in chlorinated water under the uv dose of 2400 mj cm2 tocl was eliminated by 25 9 53 6 while tobr was eliminated with a higher ratio of around 60 both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were significantly removed under uv irradiation with the removal rate of 22 9 41 7 for cytotoxicity equivalent and a higher rate of 33 1 55 5 for genotoxicity equivalents 3 uv irradiation showed little impact on doc of chlorinated water but significantly reduced the uv254 and suva254 flu values first increased then followed by a decrease under uv irradiation results of hpsec revealed that chlorinated dw mainly contained high mw compound 1000 da while chlorinated rw mainly contained lower mw compound 100 500 da chromophores and fluorophores in f2 100 500 da increased in chlorinated dw while decreased in chlorinated rw under uv irradiation 4 both the removal of uv254 suva254 flu total and five regions mw based uv254 1000 da and mw based flu were significantly correlated with the removal of toxicity in chlorinated water under uv irradiation the uv254 was recommended as the optimal surrogate because of the highest r2 value declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18531,in this study an omniphobic membrane was fabricated by electrospraying fluorinated zinc oxide zno nanoparticles nps mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene pvdf hfp on the surface of an organosilane functionalized polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf membrane our results revealed that the functionalized zno nps membrane exhibited a rough hierarchical re entrant morphology with low surface energy which allowed it to achieve high omniphobic characteristics it was observed that the addition of 30 zno w w of pvdf hfp was found to be optimal and imparted a high repulsive

sulfate sds saline solution 0 3 mm sds in 3 5 nacl ethanol and vegetable oil respectively the low surface energy and high surface roughness ra of optimised membrane was assessed as 0 78 0 14 mn m 1 and 1 37 Î¼m respectively additionally in contrast with the commercial pvdf membrane the cpfp 30z membrane exhibited superior anti wetting anti fouling characteristics and high salt rejection

entrant structure low surface tension oily seawater desalination anti wetting 1 introduction membrane distillation md an emerging thermal based technology can be a viable option for the production of sustainable high quality water from super saline brine shale gas or oily wastewater when provided with access to waste low grade heat or solar energy sources alkhudhiri et al 2012 lee et al 2017 as md is driven by the temperature and vapor pressure gradient in which water evaporates from the hot feed side and travels through a hydrophobic membrane the md process is not affected by the feed concentration therefore in recent years md has expanded its applications into different fields including removal of volatile organic compounds from solutions cleaning of environmental impurities crystallization of valuable resources biomedical and food processing applications barbe et al 1998 kujawski et al 2013 motta et al 2017 villalba 2013 however while md has shown significant potential in a wide range of applications major hurdles such as wetting and fouling which result in flux decline and poor permeate quality still limits its largescale industrial application chen et al 2017 mishra et al 2016 rezaei et al 2018 wang et al 2018 whilst existing commercial md membranes undergo severe wetting and fouling when dealing with organic and low surface tension contaminants wang et al 2016 omniphobic membranes have gained attention due to their hydrophobic nature and ability to repel traditionally problematic low surface tension liquid substances such as oil surfactants etc lee et al 2016b lin et al 2014 wei et al 2005 the development of robust omniphobic membrane capable of repelling both water and oil while maintaining high water flux will therefore have remarkable scientific and commercial implications pan et al 2013 sheen et al 2008 the very first report on the fabrication of an omniphobic membrane for md application utilized silica nanoparticles si nps which were coated over a hydrophilic glass fibre membrane followed by surface fluorination however the membrane showed a contact angle ca below 90 with ethanol and a low water flux of 15 8 2 7 l m 2 h 1 lmh lin et al 2014 for a membrane to be omniphobic the membrane must demonstrate a ca for water and oil of nearly 140 and 110 respectively zheng et al 2018 one method for achieving such high cas is by grafting fluoroalkylsilanes fas onto the membrane via the chemical reaction between the hydroxyl oh group and ethoxy o et groups which can increase the membrane s hydrophobicity as well as improve its anti wetting characteristics sairiam et al 2013 zheng et al 2010 membrane surface modification is influenced by several factors such as stability uniformity reproducibility control processes cost etc which make it a challenging task innumerable approaches have been adopted for surface modification including layer by layer lbl chemical vapour deposition cvd or solution blending however all these techniques require either long fabrication time or require stringent operational conditions ray et al 2016 electrospraying technology has recently emerged as an attractive method for obtaining uniform hierarchical re entrant morphology with great potential for large scale applications lee et al 2019 2017 as an advancement in electrospinning electrospraying techniques develop porous microspheres over a membrane surface deka et al 2019 lee et al 2019 the morphology of these microspheres is mainly attributed to solvent evaporation polymer diffusion and coulomb fission gao et al 2014 formation of hierarchical micro nano scale surface morphology re entrant structure with air pockets can further retard the transformation of the stable cassie baxter cb state to wenzel state thereby enhancing the membrane s anti wetting properties brown and bhushan 2016 chen et al 2018 domingues et al 2018 lee et al 2019 wu and suzuki 2011 in addition to high hydrophobicity and low surface energy re entrant structures plays an important role in achieving the desired omniphobic properties in a membrane chen et al 2018 tuteja et al 2007 zheng et al 2018 the air pockets created by the surface morphology reduce the direct contact area of the liquid drops by restricting their contact to the apex of the re entrant structures and away from the underlying surface he and wang 2011 as such re entrant structures can be created by combining variety of materials and technologies to confer anti wetting properties which are resistant to oil and low surface tension liquids fukada et al 2014 hoefnagels et al 2007 lee et al 2017 leng et al 2009 in particular nanoparticles nps embedded polymeric membranes have been noted for their superior mechanical properties and morphologies which enhances the desired functionalities li et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 the size surface morphology and dispersion efficiency of nps are important parameters regulating the level of interaction with the chosen polymer and the cylindrical or spherical morphology of nps make them ideal candidates for forming re entrant structures and achieving omniphobic characteristics boo et al 2018 2016 huang et al 2017 recent studies have demonstrated the applicability of silica nps for forming re entrant surface morphologies lee et al 2016a 2016b lin et al 2014 zheng et al 2018 while zinc oxide zno nps has been introduced as a promising composite due to their desirable shape benign quality high surface to volume ratio thermal resistance stability under harsh operational conditions and stronger bactericidal property when compared to sio2 and tio2 adams et al 2006 anitha et al 2013 ghosh et al 2018 suresh et al 2018 tam et al 2008 additionally zno nps were found to impart superior dye rejection and resistance to organic fouling when compared to other nps balta et al 2012 currently zno is being used in sunscreens paints and coatings due to its ultraviolet resistant property and also used for microbial growth inhabitation in the pharmaceutical rubber and food industries dimapilis et al 2018 zno nps are also considered to be more economical when compared to alternative nanoparticles such as ag al2o3 and tio2 liang et al 2012 regarding environmental concerns sio2 nps can reduce the effectiveness of the soil layer as per research evidence in municipal landfill whereas zno nps have been found to improve it mendes de oliveira et al 2017 despite these attractive properties the application of zno nps in fabricating omniphobic membranes using the versatile electrospraying technology has not been reported in the literature in this work wet chemical treatment in which hydroxyl functional groups are introduced by alkaline treatment followed by cross linking with organosilane followed by electrospraying with fluorinated zno nps has been adopted to reduce surface energy increase surface roughness and develop re entrant structure a series of experiments were conducted to determine the optimal membrane configuration finally membranes were tested under a direct contact membrane distillation dcmd system with synthetic oil wastewater and low surface tension feeds 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials millipore brand commercial pvdf c pvdf membranes with an average pore size of 0 45 Î¼m and thickness of 120 0 Î¼m were used as the

submersed in a hot 70 75 c and highly alkaline solution 7 5 m naoh for 2 h to acquire the necessary hydroxyl functionalized pvdf oh membrane surface upon completion of the 2 h bath the membranes were carefully collected and washed with di water followed by an ethanol wash the washed membranes were kept in the ambient environment until they dried completely the dried membranes were then submerged in a 1 v v fas n hexane solution at 40 c for 24 h for surface fluorination then carefully washed with n hexane finally the membranes were collected and oven dried at 90 c for 2 h preparation procedures for organosilane functionalized c pvdf membrane referred as cpf is illusted in fig 1a 2 2 2 preparation of zno nanoparticle assisted electrospray dope solution the dope solution for electrospray was prepared by adding zno to the dmf solvent in quantities as per table 1 to ensure the homogenous dispersion of zno a 5 min sonication was conducted by an ultrasonic sonicator probe fs 250 n ultrasonic processor at the frequency and power of 20 khz and 80 w respectively then pvdf hfp was added to the homogenous zno dmf solution and vigorously mixed at 65 c for 12 h lastly a small fraction of fas 1 v v fas dope solution was added and mixed for 30 min the dope solution containing zno nanoparticles and pvdf hfp were then grafted by electrospraying over organosilane functionalized c pvdf membranes the role of pvdf hfp in the dope solution is to act as a carrier for zno during the electrospraying process the functionalized supporting membranes were placed on the aluminium foil which was wrapped over the drum metallic receiver of the electrospinning machine a syringe filled with the dope solution zno dmf pvdf hfp fas and equipped with a metal needle was placed at a 8 cm

carefully detached from the drum and placed in an oven 60 c for 24 h to dry completely 2 3 characterization of membranes 2 3 1 investigation of liquid contact angle surface roughness surface energy

the ca of each liquid was monitored and measured by the same ca machine as in the previous experiment 2 3 2 determination of pore size liquid entry pressure and porosity the liquid entry pressures lep and mean pore sizes of all surface modified c pvdf membranes were then determined by using a porometer instrument brand porolux germany then the porosity of each respective membrane was determined by adopting the gravimetric procedure for this method the weight of a specified membrane piece size 30 mm 30 mm was measured under both dry w2 and fully ethanol wetted w1 conditions thereafter the porosity of the respective membrane was evaluated through equation 1 1 Îµ w 1 w 2 d 1 w 1 w 2 d 1 w 2 d 2 where both the wet and dry weights g of the membrane are denoted by w1 and w2 respectively and the ethanol and polymer densities g m 3 are denoted as d 1 and d 2 respectively 2 3 3 membrane surface morphology and layer composition all the surface modified and c pvdf membranes were investigated by a field emission scanning electron microscope hitachi su5000 variable pressure fe sem equipped with an energy dispersive x ray edx analyzer the constituents and functional groups of the surface

scans for 450 4000 cm 1 range with resolution of 2 cm 1 the xrd x pert3 powder pan analytical netherlands was operational at 40 kv 40 ma and the diffraction peaks were transcribed by cu kÎ± radiation 2 4 performance of membranes in direct contact membrane distillation dcmd application the performance of the c pvdf and the optimized membranes were examined through lab scale dcmd experiments a customized dcmd module with an active membrane size of 18 mm 55 mm along with other fittings and accessories was used to conduct these experiments as shown in fig 2 an extreme low surface tension synthetic saline liquid comprised of di water 0 1 mm sds and 3 5 wt nacl was used to evaluate the membranes performances moreover to reduce the feed surface tension the sds was added at an increment of 0 1 mm in every 2 h up to a final concentration of 0 4 mm sds the surface tension of 0 4 mm sds with 3 5 nacl solution was measured to be around 33 36 mn m 1 as per previous studies matijevic and pethica 1958 the application of dcmd for the treatment of organic contaminants was also explored an oil in water emulsion was prepared by adding 10 ml vegetable oil to 1 0 l of saline water 3 5 wt nacl this oil water mixture was vigorously mixed overnight at room temperature and added at 2 h intervals to increase the oil concentrations from 0 005 v v to 0 015 v v in the feed water to evaluate the dcmd performance long term 48 h desalination performance was then assessed using 3 5 nacl with 0 015 v v oil as feed the feed and permeate side temperatures were maintained at 60 c and 20 c respectively using a hotplate equipped with a temperature sensor and a chiller unit as shown in the schematic process diagram fig 2 the salt rejection on the permeate side was constantly monitored using a conductivity meter hq40d hach the permeate flux j and salt rejection r during the dcmd operation were calculated based on equations 2 and 3 bush et al 2016 2 j w a t 3 r 1 v d 2 Ï d 2 v d 1

different liquids for commercial and modified membranes several studies have demonstrated the use of a combination of micro nano hierarchical rough structures with low surface energy materials for fabricating omniphobic membranes boo et al 2016 chen et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 by creating air pockets in between the hierarchical structures to reduce the contact area between liquid and the membrane surface in this study we hypothesized that the fluorinated zno nps combined with pvdf hfp will form a rough spherical micro nano structure morphology over the chemically modified supporting pvdf membrane to prove this hypothesis c pvdf membranes were chemically modified by hydroxylation alkaline treatment then functionalized by organosilane the cpf water ca 135 7 2 3 has a relatively higher hydrophobicity compared to the c pvdf water ca 126 1 3 9 membrane due to the chemical replacement of oh groups from the alkaline treated pvdf by the ethoxy groups of organosilane in the case of the cpfp membrane pvdf hfp with fas 1 v v was electrosprayed over the cpf membrane s surface to increase its hydrophobicity water ca 139 1 4 6 also to increase the membrane s hydrophobicity additional surface modification was performed by electrospraying well dispersed fluorinated zno nps with pvdf hfp dope solution on the cpfp membranes the optimisation of membranes in terms of membranes repellence of water is presented in supporting information si fig s1 the presence of fluorinated zno nps together with pvdf hfp forms spherical microspheres comprised of zno which create the hierarchical micro nano scale re entrant surface morphology the influence of zno on surface morphology was investigated by adopting different concentrations of zno 10 50 the cpfp 30z membrane zno concentration of 30 w w of pvdf hfp endowed the membrane with superhydrophobicity 159 0 3 1 and higher contact angles for ethanol 130 4 4 1 saline sds 129 6 2 2 and oil 126 1 1 2 as shown in fig 3 however no significant rise in hydrophobicity or ca was observed upon further increases in the zno np concentration therefore a zno np dose of around 30 w w of pvdf hfp was determined as optimal for achieving omniphobic properties in chemically modified phase inversion c pvdf membranes overall the hydrophobicity of membranes was found to be greater in the order of cpfp 30z cpfp cpf c pvdf the higher hydrophobicity demonstrated by the water ca of the cpfp 30z membrane which can be attributed to its ability to trap air beneath the interfaces of the surface re entrant microspheres can be explained by the cassie equation shown as eq 4 below as discussed by he and wang 2011 4 cos Î¸ 1 f 1 c o s Î¸ 2 f 2 f 1 c o s Î¸ 2 1 1 f 1 f 2 1 where Î¸1 is the ca of the rough surface modified membrane Î¸2 is the water ca of non permeable and smooth pvdf surface obtained after melting the c pvdf membrane at 200 210 c f1 and f2 are the factors for the fraction area for a solid surface and air in contact with water droplet where the f2 factor can then be calculated to be 0 802 as presented in table 2 in the absence of the organosilane functionalized pvdf hfp zno microspheres f2 was evaluated to be only 0 047 for the raw c pvdf membrane the surface modified cpfp 30z membrane s highest f2 fraction can be mainly explained by its rough re entrant surface morphology 3 2 determination of surface roughness and surface energy multiple studies have established the combined relationship between membrane surface roughness and low surface energy with regards to omniphobicity barati darband et al 2018 kota et al 2014 lee et al 2019 2017 these studies have mainly attributed the omniphobicity to the existence of air pockets between adjacent microsphere surfaces which reduces the direct contact of liquid with the membrane surface to maintain a stable cb state therefore surface roughness in combination with low surface energy has an important role in improving the anti wetting performance of a membrane the cpfp 30z membrane recorded the highest surface roughness at 1 37 Î¼m ra and the surface roughness ra of the chemically modified and raw c pvdf membranes were as follows fig 4 cpfp 30z ra 1 37 Î¼m cpfp ra 1 15 Î¼m cpf ra 0 88 Î¼m c pvdf ra 0 61 Î¼m adopting the owrk model the surface energies of the membranes were estimated by measuring the cas of water and diiodomethane similar trends were observed for surface energy as in the case of surface roughness the surface energy of the cpfp 30z was found to be as low as 0 78 0 14 mn m 1 compared to cpfp cpf and c pvdf membranes as presented in table 3 the optimized membrane attained the highest omniphobicity which can be mainly attributed to its low surface energy and high surface roughness 3 3 membrane wettability performance test as membrane wetting is an important parameter greatly affecting md performance the wettability of the optimised membrane was tested and compared with the other chemically modified membranes by sessile drop method the wettability test was conducted with water saline sds ethanol and vegetable oil the c pvdf membrane presented hydrophobic properties 125 8 3 0 with water and the saline sds solution 96 8 2 1 but showed instant wetting with ethanol and oil the chemically modified cpf membrane showed relatively higher hydrophobicity 132 4 2 7 with water and saline sds 97 3 1 8 but also underwent severe wetting with both ethanol and oil after 30 s enhancements in the cas with water 138 2 2 5 and saline sds 96 3 3 3 were observed for the membranes which had their surfaces modified by electrospraying pvdf hfp cpfp but these membranes still underwent partial to full wetting by both ethanol and oil initially both the ethanol and oil drops stood on the surface but gradually absorbed into the cpfp membrane after 30 s causing partial to full wetting compared to these three membranes the optimised omniphobic cpfp 30z membrane presented the spherical drops highest water ca 152 2 3 1 saline sds ca 129 2 2 3 ethanol ca 130 1 3 1 and oil ca 119 8 3 1 as shown in fig 5 the membranes treated with fluorinated zno nps coupled with pvdf hfp possessed hierarchical re entrant structures on their membrane surface which enhanced their oil repellent and superhydropbic property whereas in the absence of zno nps the c pvdf fas pvdf hfp cpfp membrane was unable to achieve omniphobicity 3 4 liquid entry pressure pore size porosity and thickness the liquid entry pressures lep pore sizes dp porosities Îµ and thicknesses Î´ of the raw commercial phase inversion membrane the electrospun nanofiber pvdf membranes and the chemically surface modified membranes are presented in table 4 compared to the c pvdf cpf and cpfp membranes the optimized cpfp 30z omniphobic membrane exhibited a higher lep 1 89 0 04 bar a higher porosity 78 3 0 13 with a smaller pore size 0 39 0 02 Î¼m and was notably thicker 139 0 0 2 Î¼m the cpfp 30z membrane s highest lep was mainly because of its relatively smaller pore size as compared to the other three membranes 3 5 surface morphology of the membranes fig 6 presents the fe sem images illustrating the different morphological changes with respect to the chemical characterization of the different membrane modifications the fe sem images of the commercial phase inversion membrane c pvdf used as the base reference is presented in fig 6 a 1 3 as can be seen from fig 6 b 1 3 despite the alkaline treatment with fluorination grafting no significant morphological changes were observed in the cpf membrane from the c pvdf membrane furthermore the cpfp membrane showed no significant formation of microspheres but rather exhibited thin polymeric spider nets after electrospraying mainly because of the low pvdf hfp concentration as seen in fig 6 c 1 3 however the treatment with the well dispersed fluorinated zno nps 0 1 Î¼m particle size formed hierarchical micro nano scale spherical average diameter of 1 0 Î¼m re entrant membrane morphology as shown in fig 6 d 1 3 as can be seen from the edx spectra analysis presented in fig 6 d 3 of the optimized membrane zno nps were effectively deposed over the optimized membrane s surface overall the surface morphology of the cpfp 30z membrane matched the hillock valley style of spherical re entrant structures convex texture which are responsible for the strong repellence of low surface tension liquids like oil and ethanol the presence of air pockets as shown in table 2 among the zno nps assisted the pvdf hfp microspheres as illustrated in fig 7 exerting a relatively higher upwards force compared to the downward gravitational force of the liquid thereby reduces the direct contact area between liquid and actual membrane surfaces due to the combined effects of the re entrant structures and the air pockets the membrane was able to achieve superhydrophobicity with omniphobic features which make this membrane suitable for saline oil desalination and wastewater treatment 3 6 chemical composition of the membranes the ftir and xrd spectra of the zno nps the c pvdf membrane and the cpfp 30z membrane are shown in fig s2 a table s1 and fig s2 b and table s2 respectively the ftir absorption bands between 520 and 650 cm 1 are indicative of the zno nps on the membrane surface bands at 1069 cm 1 and 1175 cm 1 840 cm 1 and 1273 cm 1 and 1234 cm 1 are attributed to the Î± Î² and Î³ phases of pvdf respectively similar observations were also recorded by other researchers khatun et al 2017 lee et al 2016b peng et al 2014 the Î² phase was relatively stronger than the Î± phases of pvdf and pvdf hfp due to the mechanical elongation under high electrical voltage the peaks at 871 cm 1 and 1402 cm 1 corresponds to the amorphous phase of pvdf hfp and the stretching of the cf band of pvdf respectively the xrd peaks for the Î± and Î² phases of pvdf were observed at 18 whereas the Î³ phase could be seen at 20 4 the signature xrd peaks for zno nps were detected between 29 and 60 3 7 dcmd performance of membranes the c pvdf and cpfp 30z membranes desalination performances for the low surface tension feed solution made of sds in a saline solvent 3 5 nacl were examined as shown in fig 8 a the initial water flux for the cpfp 30z membrane was found to be 24 29 lmh which is slightly less compared to desalination with the unmodified c pvdf membrane 26 13 lmh the lower initial flux is mainly attributed to the surface coating by pvdf hfp zno microspheres as illustrated in fig 7 despite this slightly lower initial flux the cpfp 30z membrane exhibited stable salt rejection against the low surface tension feed 0 4 mm sds with 3 5 nacl as presented in fig 8a whereas the unmodified c pvdf membrane exhibited a sharp decrease in salt rejection and an increase in flux with a 0 2 mm sds with 3 5 nacl feed which indicates that the membrane underwent partial wetting further increases in sds concentration led to the full wetting of the c pvdf membrane causing the leakage of salt from the feed to permeate side following the two surface tension performance tests the c pvdf and cpfp 30z membranes were then evaluated on their anti wetting and anti fouling performance for synthetic saline oil wastewater desalination the c pvdf and cpfp 30z membranes recorded initial water fluxes of 26 31 and 24 74 lmh respectively as illustrated in fig 8b the oil water emulsion was added to saline water 3 5 nacl every 2 h to achieve an oil concentration of 0 001 0 005 and 0 015 v v the unmodified c pvdf membrane experienced severe flux decline during the dcmd operation due to the absorbance of oil and salts into the membrane which blocked the membrane s pores and generated oleophilic features as shown in supplementary figure 3s a contrarily the cpfp 30z membrane demonstrated a stable desalination performance 99 salt rejection despite increasing oil concentrations up to 0 015 v v for 6 5 h due to the hierarchical rough re entrant surface formed by the deposition of spherical zno nps with pvdf hfp and its low surface energy of 0 74 0 23 mn m 1 the unique re entrant structure of the omniphobic membrane prevents the formation of an oil salt foulant layer as depicted in fig 3s b resulting in the existence of active membrane pores which allow stable desalination performance additionally long term oil wastewater desalination was carried out with the cpfp 30z membrane using feed composed of 3 5 nacl with 0 015 v v oil as illustrated in fig s4 stable water flux with high salt rejection 99 was achieved by the cpfp 30z membrane recording an initial and 48 h water flux of 24 34 and 22 17 lmh respectively this superior performance can be attributed to the rough membrane morphology with low surface energy which enabled the membrane to maintain the cb state preventing the organic fouling from the feed to permeate side during the long term continuous md processes 4 conclusions this study illustrated the successful fabrication of an omniphobic membrane with spherical micro nano hierarchical re entrant structure by electrospraying zno nps with pvdf hfp over a cpf membrane the presence of re entrant structures stabilized the cb state preventing wetting and restricting the liquids from having complete contact with the membrane surface the fabricated membrane fluorinated with 30 zno nps w w of pvdf

the ftir and xrd spectra evidenced the chemical integration of the nps with the polymeric membranes the highest surface roughness ra and lowest surface energy achieved was 1 37 Î¼m and 0 78 0 14 mn m

with stable water flux and high salt rejection 99 with low surface tension saline water as feed conclusively this work demonstrated about a methodology for the generation of omniphobic features to commercial membranes by organosilane functionalization and surface fluorination with zno nps via the simple and versatile electrospraying technique which effectively enhanced the membrane s ability to handle low surface tension liquids thereby opening the doors for the wider application of md technology prolonged experimental study is an important aspect for gaining understanding and insight into membrane fouling and wetting under representative operational conditions pilot scale performance of the membrane will provide more empirical evidence about the actual flux and quality of distillate

18531,in this study an omniphobic membrane was fabricated by electrospraying fluorinated zinc oxide zno nanoparticles nps mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene pvdf hfp on the surface of an organosilane functionalized polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf membrane our results revealed that the functionalized zno nps membrane exhibited a rough hierarchical re entrant morphology with low surface energy which allowed it to achieve high omniphobic characteristics it was observed that the addition of 30 zno w w of pvdf hfp was found to be optimal and imparted a high repulsive characteristic the optimized pvdf zno 30 fas pvdf hfp referred as cpfp 30z membrane exhibited a high contact angle values of 159 0 3 1 129 6 2 2 130 4 4 1 and 126 1 1 2 for water sodium dodecyl sulfate sds saline solution 0 3 mm sds in 3 5 nacl ethanol and vegetable oil respectively the low surface energy and high surface roughness ra of optimised membrane was assessed as 0 78 0 14 mn m 1 and 1 37 Î¼m respectively additionally in contrast with the commercial pvdf membrane the cpfp 30z membrane exhibited superior anti wetting anti fouling characteristics and high salt rejection

entrant structure low surface tension oily seawater desalination anti wetting 1 introduction membrane distillation md an emerging thermal based technology can be a viable option for the production of sustainable high quality water from super saline brine shale gas or oily wastewater when provided with access to waste low grade heat or solar energy sources alkhudhiri et al 2012 lee et al 2017 as md is driven by the temperature and vapor pressure gradient in which water evaporates from the hot feed side and travels through a hydrophobic membrane the md process is not affected by the feed concentration therefore in recent years md has expanded its applications into different fields including removal of volatile organic compounds from solutions cleaning of environmental impurities crystallization of valuable resources biomedical and food processing applications barbe et al 1998 kujawski et al 2013 motta et al 2017 villalba 2013 however while md has shown significant potential in a wide range of applications major hurdles such as wetting and fouling which result in flux decline and poor permeate quality still limits its largescale industrial application chen et al 2017 mishra et al 2016 rezaei et al 2018 wang et al 2018 whilst existing commercial md membranes undergo severe wetting and fouling when dealing with organic and low surface tension contaminants wang et al 2016 omniphobic membranes have gained attention due to their hydrophobic nature and ability to repel traditionally problematic low surface tension liquid substances such as oil surfactants etc lee et al 2016b lin et al 2014 wei et al 2005 the development of robust omniphobic membrane capable of repelling both water and oil while maintaining high water flux will therefore have remarkable scientific and commercial implications pan et al 2013 sheen et al 2008 the very first report on the fabrication of an omniphobic membrane for md application utilized silica nanoparticles si nps which were coated over a hydrophilic glass fibre membrane followed by surface fluorination however the membrane showed a contact angle ca below 90 with ethanol and a low water flux of 15 8 2 7 l m 2 h 1 lmh lin et al 2014 for a membrane to be omniphobic the membrane must demonstrate a ca for water and oil of nearly 140 and 110 respectively zheng et al 2018 one method for achieving such high cas is by grafting fluoroalkylsilanes fas onto the membrane via the chemical reaction between the hydroxyl oh group and ethoxy o et groups which can increase the membrane s hydrophobicity as well as improve its anti wetting characteristics sairiam et al 2013 zheng et al 2010 membrane surface modification is influenced by several factors such as stability uniformity reproducibility control processes cost etc which make it a challenging task innumerable approaches have been adopted for surface modification including layer by layer lbl chemical vapour deposition cvd or solution blending however all these techniques require either long fabrication time or require stringent operational conditions ray et al 2016 electrospraying technology has recently emerged as an attractive method for obtaining uniform hierarchical re entrant morphology with great potential for large scale applications lee et al 2019 2017 as an advancement in electrospinning electrospraying techniques develop porous microspheres over a membrane surface deka et al 2019 lee et al 2019 the morphology of these microspheres is mainly attributed to solvent evaporation polymer diffusion and coulomb fission gao et al 2014 formation of hierarchical micro nano scale surface morphology re entrant structure with air pockets can further retard the transformation of the stable cassie baxter cb state to wenzel state thereby enhancing the membrane s anti wetting properties brown and bhushan 2016 chen et al 2018 domingues et al 2018 lee et al 2019 wu and suzuki 2011 in addition to high hydrophobicity and low surface energy re entrant structures plays an important role in achieving the desired omniphobic properties in a membrane chen et al 2018 tuteja et al 2007 zheng et al 2018 the air pockets created by the surface morphology reduce the direct contact area of the liquid drops by restricting their contact to the apex of the re entrant structures and away from the underlying surface he and wang 2011 as such re entrant structures can be created by combining variety of materials and technologies to confer anti wetting properties which are resistant to oil and low surface tension liquids fukada et al 2014 hoefnagels et al 2007 lee et al 2017 leng et al 2009 in particular nanoparticles nps embedded polymeric membranes have been noted for their superior mechanical properties and morphologies which enhances the desired functionalities li et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 the size surface morphology and dispersion efficiency of nps are important parameters regulating the level of interaction with the chosen polymer and the cylindrical or spherical morphology of nps make them ideal candidates for forming re entrant structures and achieving omniphobic characteristics boo et al 2018 2016 huang et al 2017 recent studies have demonstrated the applicability of silica nps for forming re entrant surface morphologies lee et al 2016a 2016b lin et al 2014 zheng et al 2018 while zinc oxide zno nps has been introduced as a promising composite due to their desirable shape benign quality high surface to volume ratio thermal resistance stability under harsh operational conditions and stronger bactericidal property when compared to sio2 and tio2 adams et al 2006 anitha et al 2013 ghosh et al 2018 suresh et al 2018 tam et al 2008 additionally zno nps were found to impart superior dye rejection and resistance to organic fouling when compared to other nps balta et al 2012 currently zno is being used in sunscreens paints and coatings due to its ultraviolet resistant property and also used for microbial growth inhabitation in the pharmaceutical rubber and food industries dimapilis et al 2018 zno nps are also considered to be more economical when compared to alternative nanoparticles such as ag al2o3 and tio2 liang et al 2012 regarding environmental concerns sio2 nps can reduce the effectiveness of the soil layer as per research evidence in municipal landfill whereas zno nps have been found to improve it mendes de oliveira et al 2017 despite these attractive properties the application of zno nps in fabricating omniphobic membranes using the versatile electrospraying technology has not been reported in the literature in this work wet chemical treatment in which hydroxyl functional groups are introduced by alkaline treatment followed by cross linking with organosilane followed by electrospraying with fluorinated zno nps has been adopted to reduce surface energy increase surface roughness and develop re entrant structure a series of experiments were conducted to determine the optimal membrane configuration finally membranes were tested under a direct contact membrane distillation dcmd system with synthetic oil wastewater and low surface tension feeds 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials millipore brand commercial pvdf c pvdf membranes with an average pore size of 0 45 Î¼m and thickness of 120 0 Î¼m were used as the

procedures for organosilane functionalized c pvdf membrane referred as cpf is illusted in fig 1a 2 2 2 preparation of zno nanoparticle assisted electrospray dope solution the dope solution for electrospray was prepared by adding zno to the dmf solvent in quantities as per table 1 to ensure the homogenous dispersion of zno a 5 min sonication was conducted by an ultrasonic sonicator probe fs 250 n ultrasonic processor at the frequency and power of 20 khz and 80 w respectively then pvdf hfp was added to the homogenous zno dmf solution and vigorously mixed at 65 c for 12 h lastly a small fraction of fas 1 v v fas dope solution was added and mixed for 30 min the dope solution containing zno nanoparticles and pvdf hfp were then grafted by electrospraying over organosilane functionalized c pvdf membranes the role of pvdf hfp in the dope solution is to act as a carrier for zno during the electrospraying process the functionalized supporting membranes were placed on the aluminium foil which was wrapped over the drum metallic receiver of the electrospinning machine a syringe filled with the dope solution zno dmf pvdf hfp fas and equipped with a metal needle was placed at a 8 cm

carefully detached from the drum and placed in an oven 60 c for 24 h to dry completely 2 3 characterization of membranes 2 3 1 investigation of liquid contact angle surface roughness surface energy

version 1 9 2 3 double sessile drop measurement method the wettability of the membranes was investigated by dropping 5 Î¼l each of water ethanol saline sds and vegetable oil over the membrane surface the ca of each liquid was monitored and measured by the same ca machine as in the previous experiment 2 3 2 determination of pore size liquid entry pressure and porosity the liquid entry pressures lep and mean pore sizes of all surface modified c pvdf membranes were then determined by using a porometer instrument brand porolux germany then the porosity of each respective membrane was determined by adopting the gravimetric procedure for this method the weight of a specified membrane piece size 30 mm 30 mm was measured under both dry w2 and fully ethanol wetted w1 conditions thereafter the porosity of the respective membrane was evaluated through equation 1 1 Îµ w 1 w 2 d 1 w 1 w 2 d 1 w 2 d 2 where both the wet and dry weights g of the membrane are denoted by w1 and w2 respectively and the ethanol and polymer densities g m 3 are denoted as d 1 and d 2 respectively 2 3 3 membrane surface morphology and layer composition all the surface modified and c pvdf membranes were investigated by a field emission scanning electron microscope hitachi su5000 variable pressure fe sem equipped with an energy dispersive x ray edx analyzer the constituents and functional groups of the surface

scans for 450 4000 cm 1 range with resolution of 2 cm 1 the xrd x pert3 powder pan analytical netherlands was operational at 40 kv 40 ma and the diffraction peaks were transcribed by cu kÎ± radiation 2 4 performance of membranes in direct contact membrane distillation dcmd application the performance of the c pvdf and the optimized membranes were examined through lab scale dcmd experiments a customized dcmd module with an active membrane size of 18 mm 55 mm along with other fittings and accessories was used to conduct these experiments as shown in fig 2 an extreme low surface tension synthetic saline liquid comprised of di water 0 1 mm sds and 3 5 wt nacl was used to evaluate the membranes performances moreover to reduce the feed surface tension the sds was added at an increment of 0 1 mm in every 2 h up to a final concentration of 0 4 mm sds the surface tension of 0 4 mm sds with 3 5 nacl solution was measured to be around 33 36 mn m 1 as per previous studies matijevic and pethica 1958 the application of dcmd for the treatment of organic contaminants was also explored an oil in water emulsion was prepared by adding 10 ml vegetable oil to 1 0 l of saline water 3 5 wt nacl this oil water mixture was vigorously mixed overnight at room temperature and added at 2 h intervals to increase the oil concentrations from 0 005 v v to 0 015 v v in the feed water to evaluate the dcmd performance long term 48 h desalination performance was then assessed using 3 5 nacl with 0 015 v v oil as feed the feed and permeate side temperatures were maintained at 60 c and 20 c respectively using a hotplate equipped with a temperature sensor and a chiller unit as shown in the schematic process diagram fig 2 the salt rejection on the permeate side was constantly monitored using a conductivity meter hq40d hach the permeate flux j and salt rejection r during the dcmd operation were calculated based on equations 2 and 3 bush et al 2016 2 j w a t 3 r 1 v d 2 Ï d 2 v d 1

different liquids for commercial and modified membranes several studies have demonstrated the use of a combination of micro nano hierarchical rough structures with low surface energy materials for fabricating omniphobic membranes boo et al 2016 chen et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 by creating air pockets in between the hierarchical structures to reduce the contact area between liquid and the membrane surface in this study we hypothesized that the fluorinated zno nps combined with pvdf hfp will form a rough spherical micro nano structure morphology over the chemically modified supporting pvdf membrane to prove this hypothesis c pvdf membranes were chemically modified by hydroxylation alkaline treatment then functionalized by organosilane the cpf water ca 135 7 2 3 has a relatively higher hydrophobicity compared to the c pvdf water ca 126 1 3 9 membrane due to the chemical replacement of oh groups from the alkaline treated pvdf by the ethoxy groups of organosilane in the case of the cpfp membrane pvdf hfp with fas 1 v v was electrosprayed over the cpf membrane s surface to increase its hydrophobicity water ca 139 1 4 6 also to increase the membrane s hydrophobicity additional surface modification was performed by electrospraying well dispersed fluorinated zno nps with pvdf hfp dope solution on the cpfp membranes the optimisation of membranes in terms of membranes repellence of water is presented in supporting information si fig s1 the presence of fluorinated zno nps together with pvdf hfp forms spherical microspheres comprised of zno which create the hierarchical micro nano scale re entrant surface morphology the influence of zno on surface morphology was investigated by adopting different concentrations of zno 10 50 the cpfp 30z membrane zno concentration of 30 w w of pvdf hfp endowed the membrane with superhydrophobicity 159 0 3 1 and higher contact angles for ethanol 130 4 4 1 saline sds 129 6 2 2 and oil 126 1 1 2 as shown in fig 3 however no significant rise in hydrophobicity or ca was observed upon further increases in the zno np concentration therefore a zno np dose of around 30 w w of pvdf hfp was determined as optimal for achieving omniphobic properties in chemically modified phase inversion c pvdf membranes overall the hydrophobicity of membranes was found to be greater in the order of cpfp 30z cpfp cpf c pvdf the higher hydrophobicity demonstrated by the water ca of the cpfp 30z membrane which can be attributed to its ability to trap air beneath the interfaces of the surface re entrant microspheres can be explained by the cassie equation shown as eq 4 below as discussed by he and wang 2011 4 cos Î¸ 1 f 1 c o s Î¸ 2 f 2 f 1 c o s Î¸ 2 1 1 f 1 f 2 1 where Î¸1 is the ca of the rough surface modified membrane Î¸2 is the water ca of non permeable and smooth pvdf surface obtained after melting the c pvdf membrane at 200 210 c f1 and f2 are the factors for the fraction area for a solid surface and air in contact with water droplet where the f2 factor can then be calculated to be 0 802 as presented in table 2 in the absence of the organosilane functionalized pvdf hfp zno microspheres f2 was evaluated to be only 0 047 for the raw c pvdf membrane the surface modified cpfp 30z membrane s highest f2 fraction can be mainly explained by its rough re entrant surface morphology 3 2 determination of surface roughness and surface energy multiple studies have established the combined relationship between membrane surface roughness and low surface energy with regards to omniphobicity barati darband et al 2018 kota et al 2014 lee et al 2019 2017 these studies have mainly attributed the omniphobicity to the existence of air pockets between adjacent microsphere surfaces which reduces the direct contact of liquid with the membrane surface to maintain a stable cb state therefore surface roughness in combination with low surface energy has an important role in improving the anti wetting performance of a membrane the cpfp 30z membrane recorded the highest surface roughness at 1 37 Î¼m ra and the surface roughness ra of the chemically modified and raw c pvdf membranes were as follows fig 4 cpfp 30z ra 1 37 Î¼m cpfp ra 1 15 Î¼m cpf ra 0 88 Î¼m c pvdf ra 0 61 Î¼m adopting the owrk model the surface energies of the membranes were estimated by measuring the cas of water and diiodomethane similar trends were observed for surface energy as in the case of surface roughness the surface energy of the cpfp 30z was found to be as low as 0 78 0 14 mn m 1 compared to cpfp cpf and c pvdf membranes as presented in table 3 the optimized membrane attained the highest omniphobicity which can be mainly attributed to its low surface energy and high surface roughness 3 3 membrane wettability performance test as membrane wetting is an important parameter greatly affecting md performance the wettability of the optimised membrane was tested and compared with the other chemically modified membranes by sessile drop method the wettability test was conducted with water saline sds ethanol and vegetable oil the c pvdf membrane presented hydrophobic properties 125 8 3 0 with water and the saline sds solution 96 8 2 1 but showed instant wetting with ethanol and oil the chemically modified cpf membrane showed relatively higher hydrophobicity 132 4 2 7 with water and saline sds 97 3 1 8 but also underwent severe wetting with both ethanol and oil after 30 s enhancements in the cas with water 138 2 2 5 and saline sds 96 3 3 3 were observed for the membranes which had their surfaces modified by electrospraying pvdf hfp cpfp but these membranes still underwent partial to full wetting by both ethanol and oil initially both the ethanol and oil drops stood on the surface but gradually absorbed into the cpfp membrane after 30 s causing partial to full wetting compared to these three membranes the optimised omniphobic cpfp 30z membrane presented the spherical drops highest water ca 152 2 3 1 saline sds ca 129 2 2 3 ethanol ca 130 1 3 1 and oil ca 119 8 3 1 as shown in fig 5 the membranes treated with fluorinated zno nps coupled with pvdf hfp possessed hierarchical re entrant structures on their membrane surface which enhanced their oil repellent and superhydropbic property whereas in the absence of zno nps the c pvdf fas pvdf hfp cpfp membrane was unable to achieve omniphobicity 3 4 liquid entry pressure pore size porosity and thickness the liquid entry pressures lep pore sizes dp porosities Îµ and thicknesses Î´ of the raw commercial phase inversion membrane the electrospun nanofiber pvdf membranes and the chemically surface modified membranes are presented in table 4 compared to the c pvdf cpf and cpfp membranes the optimized cpfp 30z omniphobic membrane exhibited a higher lep 1 89 0 04 bar a higher porosity 78 3 0 13 with a smaller pore size 0 39 0 02 Î¼m and was notably thicker 139 0 0 2 Î¼m the cpfp 30z membrane s highest lep was mainly because of its relatively smaller pore size as compared to the other three membranes 3 5 surface morphology of the membranes fig 6 presents the fe sem images illustrating the different morphological changes with respect to the chemical characterization of the different membrane modifications the fe sem images of the commercial phase inversion membrane c pvdf used as the base reference is presented in fig 6 a 1 3 as can be seen from fig 6 b 1 3 despite the alkaline treatment with fluorination grafting no significant morphological changes were observed in the cpf membrane from the c pvdf membrane furthermore the cpfp membrane showed no significant formation of microspheres but rather exhibited thin polymeric spider nets after electrospraying mainly because of the low pvdf hfp concentration as seen in fig 6 c 1 3 however the treatment with the well dispersed fluorinated zno nps 0 1 Î¼m particle size formed hierarchical micro nano scale spherical average diameter of 1 0 Î¼m re entrant membrane morphology as shown in fig 6 d 1 3 as can be seen from the edx spectra analysis presented in fig 6 d 3 of the optimized membrane zno nps were effectively deposed over the optimized membrane s surface overall the surface morphology of the cpfp 30z membrane matched the hillock valley style of spherical re entrant structures convex texture which are responsible for the strong repellence of low surface tension liquids like oil and ethanol the presence of air pockets as shown in table 2 among the zno nps assisted the pvdf hfp microspheres as illustrated in fig 7 exerting a relatively higher upwards force compared to the downward gravitational force of the liquid thereby reduces the direct contact area between liquid and actual membrane surfaces due to the combined effects of the re entrant structures and the air pockets the membrane was able to achieve superhydrophobicity with omniphobic features which make this membrane suitable for saline oil desalination and wastewater treatment 3 6 chemical composition of the membranes the ftir and xrd spectra of the zno nps the c pvdf membrane and the cpfp 30z membrane are shown in fig s2 a table s1 and fig s2 b and table s2 respectively the ftir absorption bands between 520 and 650 cm 1 are indicative of the zno nps on the membrane surface bands at 1069 cm 1 and 1175 cm 1 840 cm 1 and 1273 cm 1 and 1234 cm 1 are attributed to the Î± Î² and Î³ phases of pvdf respectively similar observations were also recorded by other researchers khatun et al 2017 lee et al 2016b peng et al 2014 the Î² phase was relatively stronger than the Î± phases of pvdf and pvdf hfp due to the mechanical elongation under high electrical voltage the peaks at 871 cm 1 and 1402 cm 1 corresponds to the amorphous phase of pvdf hfp and the stretching of the cf band of pvdf respectively the xrd peaks for the Î± and Î² phases of pvdf were observed at 18 whereas the Î³ phase could be seen at 20 4 the signature xrd peaks for zno nps were detected between 29 and 60 3 7 dcmd performance of membranes the c pvdf and cpfp 30z membranes desalination performances for the low surface tension feed solution made of sds in a saline solvent 3 5 nacl were examined as shown in fig 8 a the initial water flux for the cpfp 30z membrane was found to be 24 29 lmh which is slightly less compared to desalination with the unmodified c pvdf membrane 26 13 lmh the lower initial flux is mainly attributed to the surface coating by pvdf hfp zno microspheres as illustrated in fig 7 despite this slightly lower initial flux the cpfp 30z membrane exhibited stable salt rejection against the low surface tension feed 0 4 mm sds with 3 5 nacl as presented in fig 8a whereas the unmodified c pvdf membrane exhibited a sharp decrease in salt rejection and an increase in flux with a 0 2 mm sds with 3 5 nacl feed which indicates that the membrane underwent partial wetting further increases in sds concentration led to the full wetting of the c pvdf membrane causing the leakage of salt from the feed to permeate side following the two surface tension performance tests the c pvdf and cpfp 30z membranes were then evaluated on their anti wetting and anti fouling performance for synthetic saline oil wastewater desalination the c pvdf and cpfp 30z membranes recorded initial water fluxes of 26 31 and 24 74 lmh respectively as illustrated in fig 8b the oil water emulsion was added to saline water 3 5 nacl every 2 h to achieve an oil concentration of 0 001 0 005 and 0 015 v v the unmodified c pvdf membrane experienced severe flux decline during the dcmd operation due to the absorbance of oil and salts into the membrane which blocked the membrane s pores and generated oleophilic features as shown in supplementary figure 3s a contrarily the cpfp 30z membrane demonstrated a stable desalination performance 99 salt rejection despite increasing oil concentrations up to 0 015 v v for 6 5 h due to the hierarchical rough re entrant surface formed by the deposition of spherical zno nps with pvdf hfp and its low surface energy of 0 74 0 23 mn m 1 the unique re entrant structure of the omniphobic membrane prevents the formation of an oil salt foulant layer as depicted in fig 3s b resulting in the existence of active membrane pores which allow stable desalination performance additionally long term oil wastewater desalination was carried out with the cpfp 30z membrane using feed composed of 3 5 nacl with 0 015 v v oil as illustrated in fig s4 stable water flux with high salt rejection 99 was achieved by the cpfp 30z membrane recording an initial and 48 h water flux of 24 34 and 22 17 lmh respectively this superior performance can be attributed to the rough membrane morphology with low surface energy which enabled the membrane to maintain the cb state preventing the organic fouling from the feed to permeate side during the long term continuous md processes 4 conclusions this study illustrated the successful fabrication of an omniphobic membrane with spherical micro nano hierarchical re entrant structure by electrospraying zno nps with pvdf hfp over a cpf membrane the presence of re entrant structures stabilized the cb state preventing wetting and restricting the liquids from having complete contact with the membrane surface the fabricated membrane fluorinated with 30 zno nps w w of pvdf hfp i e the cpfp 30z membrane was found to possess high liquid cas of 159 0 3 1 129 6 2 2 130 4 4 1 and 126 1 1 2 with water 0 3 mm sds saline 3 5 nacl solution ethanol and vegetable oil respectively the ftir and xrd spectra evidenced the chemical integration of the nps with the polymeric membranes the highest surface roughness ra and lowest surface energy achieved was 1 37 Î¼m and 0 78 0 14 mn m 1 in addition the optimized cpfp 30z membrane proved its stability against different low surface tension liquids through a wetting test and achieved significant anti wetting anti fouling performance with stable water flux and high salt rejection 99 with low surface tension saline water as feed conclusively this work demonstrated about a methodology for the generation of omniphobic features to commercial membranes by organosilane functionalization and surface fluorination with zno nps via the simple and versatile electrospraying technique which effectively enhanced the membrane s ability to handle low surface tension liquids thereby opening the doors for the wider application of md technology prolonged experimental study is an important aspect for gaining understanding and insight into membrane fouling and wetting under representative operational conditions pilot scale performance of the membrane will provide more empirical evidence about the actual flux and quality of distillate produced also we will instigate the design of specific re entrant morphologies created by different approaches to investigate and compare fouling and wetting resistance and the impact of alternative

18532,the coupling of high frequency data of water quality with physically based models of river systems is of great interest for the management of urban socio ecosystems one approach to exploit high frequency data is data assimilation which has received an increasing attention in the field of hydrology but not for water quality modeling so far we present here a first implementation of a particle filtering algorithm into a community centered hydro biogeochemical model to assimilate high frequency dissolved oxygen data and to estimate metabolism parameters in the seine river system the procedure is designed based on the results of a former sensitivity analysis of the model wang et al 2018 that allows for the identification of the twelve most sensible parameters all over the year those parameters are both physical and related to micro organisms reaeration coefficient photosynthetic parameters growth rates respiration rates and optimal temperature the performances of the approach are assessed on a synthetic case study that mimics 66 km of the seine river virtual dissolved oxygen data are generated using time varying parameters this paper aims at retrieving the predefined parameters by assimilating those data the simulated dissolved oxygen concentrations match the reference concentrations the identification of the parameters depends on the hydrological and trophic contexts and more surprisingly on the thermal state of the river the physical bacterial and phytoplanktonic parameters can be retrieved properly leading to the differentiation of two successive algal blooms by comparing the estimated posterior distribution of the optimal temperature for phytoplankton growth finally photosynthetic parameters distributions following circadian cycles during algal blooms are discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords data assimilation dissolved oxygen parameter estimation particle filter prose pa 1 introduction the coupling of high frequency data of water quality with physically based model of river systems is of great interest for the management of urban socio ecosystems one approach to exploit high frequency data is data assimilation which combines observations and short range forecasts to estimate the distribution of the true state of a process wikle and berliner 2007 assimilating high frequency data allows for the identification of the multiple sources of model uncertainty relative to parameters model structure forcing data e g temperature wind speed and solar radiation and observations evensen 2003 which limit the validation and application of water quality models beven 1989 polus et al 2011 a lot of data assimilation techniques exist in literature such as the variational methods sasaki 1955 1958 the kalman filter kf kalman 1960 the extended kalman filter ekf beck 1987 the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 and the particle filter pf doucet et al 2001 a review of these methods can be found in the literature wikle and berliner 2007 cappe et al 2007 sÃ¤rkkÃ¤ 2013 the variational methods minimizing a cost function have been widely used in numerical weather prediction courtier et al 1994 1998 gauthier et al 2007 kleist and ide 2015 yucel et al 2015 the major drawbacks of variational methods are the numerical implementation complexity and the computational cost the kf handles only linear models with gaussian errors which are not consistent with the hydrologic and water quality models to extend to nonlinear models the ekf uses the linearized formula tangent to the forward model which is an approximation and would be very costly to implement for high dimensional systems evensen 2003 the enkf uses monte carlo samples to approximate the forecast distribution and then applies linear update formulas to obtain the posterior distribution evensen 2003 while the particle filter based methods estimate the forecast and posterior distributions using discrete probability densities arulampalam et al 2002 obtained via bayes theorem bayes 1763 since the enkf and particle filter resolve the two major drawbacks related to the use of ekf and handle highly nonlinear models the enkf and particle filter based methods have become the most commonly used sequential data assimilation techniques in hydrologic modeling for state parameter estimation moradkhani et al 2005 weerts and el serafy 2006 andreadis et al 2007 salamon and feyen 2009 plaza et al 2012 dechant and moradkhani 2012 vrugt et al 2013 shi et al 2014 abbaszadeh et al 2018 in biogeochemical oceanography the efficiency of the ensemble based kalman filters has been assessed on ocean models for ocean biogeochemical state and parameter estimation simon and bertino 2012 simon et al 2012 gharamti et al 2017 yu et al 2018 due to the lack of data the difficulties in representing complex hydro ecosystems and the computational cost there are still relatively few applications about the state parameter estimation by assimilating high frequency dissolved oxygen do concentrations in river systems pastres et al 2003 have applied the ekf to update three parameters of a simple do chlorophyll model in the lagoon of venice mao et al 2009 used ekf to forecast algal blooms and dissolved oxygen dynamics in a marine ecosystem the recent studies focus particularly on forecasting algal bloom dynamics using enkf in river system kim et al 2014 or in lakes huang et al 2013 page et al 2018 xue et al 2012 applied also enkf in the massachusetts bay to design the optimal monitoring sites for do measurements however as stated by wikle and berliner 2007 p 10 11 we assume that the forecast distibution can be characterized by its first two moments or equivalently that it is gaussian with mean and estimated variance covariance matrix however in nonlinear cases since gaussianity cannot hold for all time the enkf must yield biased samples and estimates even for unlimited sample sizes the recent investigations concluded also that the assumption of a gaussian error structure for the forecast distribution may not be realistic for hydrologic systems and phytoplankton dynamics and the authors suggested testing the particle filter based methods to overcome this problem plaza et al 2012 pasetto et al 2012 dechant and moradkhani 2012 huang et al 2013 the feasibility of bayesian inference with a particle markov chain monte carlo algorithm is tested on a simple predator prey model in ecological research kattwinkel and reichert 2017 in this paper we present the prose pa model which consists in a first implementation of a particle filtering algorithm into the community centered hydro biogeochemical model prose even et al 1998 2007b flipo et al 2004 vilmin et al 2015b in order to assimilate 15 min do data and estimate metabolisms parameters in the seine river system the procedure is designed from the results of a sensitivity analysis of the biogeochemical module c rive of the prose model that identified the twelve most sensible parameters of the model wang et al 2018 those parameters are both physical water re aeration by fluvial navigation and physiological for instance growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria and photosynthetic parameters of phytoplankton the performances of prose pa are assessed on a synthetic case study that mimics 66 km of the seine river and generates virtual observation data of do the objectives of this study are to retrieve the predefined parameters used to generate the observation data and to distinguish two successive algal blooms by identifying different physiological properties the manuscript is organized as follows the section 2 presents the prose model and the study area followed by the prose pa approach including the mathematical formulations of the particle

flipo et al 2004 vilmin et al 2015b couples three libraries a hydrodynamic library a transport library and a biogeochemical library that simulate together the hydro biogeochemical functioning of a river system the hydraulic module solves the 1d shallow water equations with a finite volume scheme the transport module simulates the advection and dispersion of both particulate and dissolved substances including also water re oxygenation by overflowing over hydraulic works the biogeochemical library is based on the rive conceptual model which is a community centered model billen et al 1994 garnier et al 1995 https www fire upmc fr rive the cycles of carbon nutrients and dissolved oxygen are simulated in both water column and sediment layer the compound exchanges between water column and benthic layers have been successively developed even et al 2004 2007a flipo et al 2004 2007 vilmin et al 2015b the prose model has been well validated and largely applied in the seine river system even et al 1998 2004 2007a polus et al 2011 raimonet et al 2015 vilmin et al 2015a b 2016 2018 2 1 2 study area the study area is located downstream paris city and consists of 66 km of the seine river fig 1 the bathymetry data of the channel is extracted from the full 220 km seine model used in recent studies vilmin et al 2016 2018 this area is highly impacted by human activities including two waste water treatment plants wwtps seine aval and seine centre and two major combined sewer overflows csos the seine aval sav is the largest wwtp of europe which treats the effluents of over 6 5 million equivalent inhabitants rocher et al 2011 during rain events csos discharge large amount of suspended solids organic matters and nutrients into the seine river even et al 2007b assimilating do is therefore of great interest for the decision makers in this area 2 2 data assimilation framework using particle filtering the prose pa approach 2 2 1 state space model to begin with we represent the prose model as a state space model kalman 1960 a state space model uses inputs state variables outputs to describe the evolution of a system over time in our case it uses three equations eq 1 2 3 let y represents the state variable vector of the system in terms of physics do concentrations in this study and x be the vector of model parameters the state variable and the model parameters are both modelled as random variables y x characterized by their probability distribution functions pdf x and y denote the realizations of random variables x y the observation vector y is a realization of the random variable y the state space model explains the temporal evolution of the system by assuming that it behaves as a markov process markov 1906 this means that the values at t depend on the values at t 1 only 1 x t x t 1 Î· t 2 y t m y t 1 Î¼ t x t Î½ t 3 y t h y t Îµ t the transition of model parameter x from t 1 to t is described by a gaussian perturbation Î· t eq 1 in the above equations m is the forward model in our case prose and h is the observation operator relating the forecasted state variable y t to the observation y t in other words h denotes the selection of model cells where observations are available y t 1 stands for the posterior state variable at previous time step t 1 or equivalently for the prior state variable at current time step t the symbols Î¼ t and x t represent respectively the prior forcing data e g temperature wind speed and solar radiation and the prior model parameters at time step t the variables Î½ t and Îµ t characterize the unknown model and measurement errors respectively the prose model aims at conserving the mass balance the model does it with accuracy the relative errors being in the order 10 5 or 10 6 this is far below observation errors therefore no model errors are considered Î½ t 0 in our case note that the nomenclature we use here is not canonical in dynamical system literature the parameters would have been called the states because they are the hidden dynamic variables that govern the system s behaviour in forward modelling and especially hydrology the state variables designate the variable that are computed by the model while the parameters represents the time varying functional inputs of the numerical model we consider the latter as the reader is more likely to be accustomed to this definition please note that with this definition the input fluxes at the boundary of the model are not called parameters but boundary conditions 2 2 2 bayesian inference we seek to estimate the posterior pdf of both the random variable y and the parameter x conditionally to the observations y to simplify the writing we define the state vector z y t x t t and its realizations z y t x t t therefore our goal can be reformulated in finding the conditional pdf of z knowing y noted f z z y through bayes theorem bayes 1763 the posterior pdf f z z y can be deduced from the product of the prior pdf f z z and the likelihood distribution f y y z up to a normalizing constant independent from z 4 f z z y f y y z f z z the prior pdf f z z gives the prior knowledge on z before the measurements are taken the likelihood f y y z describes the pdf of the observation data given the model predictions 2 2 3 sequential form the formulation 4 does not relate to time to introduce a sequential form for data assimilation we define the temporal trajectories of the random variables z and y z 1 t z 1 z t and y 1 t y 1 y t discretized over time by sequences of state z i y i i 1 t as well as their realizations z 1 t y 1 t the posterior pdf of the trajectory z 1 t given observation y 1 t writes f z 1 t z 1 t y 1 t next we can write the posterior pdf f z 1 t z 1 t y 1 t under a recursive form arulampalam et al 2002 doucet et al 2001 wikle and berliner 2007 sÃ¤rkkÃ¤ 2013 owing to the markovian nature of the process we simplify the notations rewriting a pdf f z z into f z 5 f z 1 t y 1 t f y t z 1 t y 1 t 1 f z 1 t y 1 t 1 6 f y t z t f z t z 1 t 1 y 1 t 1 f z 1 t 1 y 1 t 1 7 f y t z t f z t z t 1 f z 1 t 1 y 1 t 1 where we use first the bayes theorem to get equation 5 then the bayes theorem and the markov property for equation 6 and the markov property to obtain the sequential relation 7 we propagate z t using the evolution equations 1 and 2 in order to model the distribution f z t z t 1 note in case of a deterministic formulation Î½ t Î· t 0 0 in equations 1 and 2 f z t z t 1 is a dirac measure consequently we can access the posterior pdf f z 1 t y 1 t of the trajectory z 1 t by updating it at each time step this will be done through the use of sampling techniques 2 2 4 the particle filter the particle filter aims at approximating the posterior pdf f z 1 t y 1 t of the trajectory z 1 t knowing y 1 t by a set of particles simulations associated with weights Ï t it is generally impossible to sample from f z 1 t y 1 t directly to address this problem sequential importance sampling has been suggested doucet et al 2000 liu 2001 for the ease of reading the principle of the importance sampling and the definition of the importance weights are detailed in b we give here the weight update formula for each particle directly which is a consequence of the sequential decomposition of the posterior of the trajectory obtained in eq 7 8 Ï t i f y t z t i Ï t 1 i 9 Ï Ë t i Ï t i Ï t i where f y t z t i denotes the likelihood function which quantifies how y t is likely to be observed given z t i at time t Ï t i and Ï t 1 i stand for the posterior and prior weights at time t in other words the posterior weight at time t 1 serves as a prior weight at time t we also define the normalised importance weight Ï Ë t i associated with the particle i in practice it is usually not necessary to estimate the posterior pdf f z 1 t y 1 t of the trajectory z 1 t knowing y 1 t we are interested here in the marginal distribution of f z 1 t y 1 t called filtering distribution f z t y 1 t it represents the distribution of the state variables knowing all the past observations as well as the current one in this paper we note the filtering posterior pdf at time t as f z t y 1 t which can be approximated as 10 f z t y 1 t n i 1 Ï Ë t i Î´ z t i where Î´ is a dirac delta function and n denotes the number of particles that is the filtering distribution is approximated by a discrete distribution whose probability mass function is defined by the normalised importance weights and charges the particles if we assume that the observation error is gaussian then the likelihood probability of each particle can be calculated using the pdf of the multivariate normal distribution 11 ln l y t z t i m 2 ln 2 Ï 1 2 ln Ï 1 2 y t h y t i t Ï 1 y t h y t i f y t z t i l y t z t i i 1 n l y t z t i where m is the number of observation sites and Ï is the error covariance matrix of the observations 2 2 5 resampling algorithm a common problem when using particle filtering is the degeneracy phenomena this occurs when almost all the particles have zero or very small importance weights only a few particles have significant importance weights therefore the discrete probability densities cannot represent the posterior pdf of a given state adequately a resampling procedure reduces the degeneracy effect the basic idea of the resampling is to discard particles that have a small weight and to duplicate particles with a large weight generally it is not necessary to perform resampling at every time step but only when necessary a way to monitor the need of resampling is to estimate the effective number of particles by the effective sample size n e f f the n e f f cannot be evaluated exactly but it can be estimated it by kong et al 1994 doucet et al 2000 12 n e f f Ë 1 i 1 n Ï Ë t i 2 when n e f f is below a threshold n t h r e s Î± n predefined by the user resampling is performed after the resampling step all weights are reset to 1 n as the particles having a important weight may be copied many times which results in sample impoverishment problem to maintain the diversity of the ensemble a random perturbation is added to the parameters value after the resampling step eq 13 13 x t 1 i x t r e s a m p l i n g i Î· t i Î· t i n 0 s Ï 2 where s is a percent perturbation predefined by the user 0 1 in this study and Ï denotes the parameter range the resampling technique used in this work is referred to as systematic resampling the procedure of systematic resampling is thoroughly described in the literature kitagawa 1996 moradkhani et al 2005 li et al 2015 2 2 6 numerical algorithm the coupling of the particle filtering algorithm with prose model is called prose pa pa stands for parallel computing and data assimilation a full description of the prose pa approach is given below fig 2 2 3 description of the synthetic case study 2 3 1 parameters considered and virtual observation data twelve parameters of the prose model were identified in different hydrological and trophic contexts in a previous work wang et al 2018 those parameters are both physical and physiological table 1 five monitoring stations are located in the study area suresnes chatou bougival sartrouville and andresy from upstream to downstream respectively fig 1 the assimilation period is the year 2011 when algal blooms occurred in march and july in the seine river vilmin et al 2016 the two successive algal blooms are characterized by different physiological properties especially the optimal temperature for growth of phytoplankton vilmin 2014 a high frequency do dissolved oxygen dataset y r e f every 15 min which corresponds to the frequency of the real measurement is generated using predefined parameters table 1 three phytoplanktonic parameters are modified manually at day 139 in order to represent the two different algal blooms p m a x p p r m p p and t o p t p p see table 1 for parameter definition in this case study the observation data are obtained adding a gaussian error to the reference dataset with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 0 01 y r e f y t y t r e f Îµ t Îµ t n 0 0 01 y t r e f 2 a standard deviation of 0 01 y r e f ensures that the 95 observation errors are less than 0 02 y r e f which is coherent with the sensors used in the seine river system garnier et al 2019 the reference dataset and predefined parameters are assumed to be true and are assessed via data assimilation in this study no model errors are considered Î½ t 0 see eq 2 the major aims of this work are to retrieve the reference do concentrations and the dominant predefined parameters identified by wang et al 2018 over time 2 3 2 input data for prose model apart from hydraulic time varying river discharge and csos data geometric data river channels the prose model also requires time varying concentrations of the biogeochemical variables micro organism biomass dissolved oxygen nutrients organic matters suspended solids entering the system and the meteorological data solar irradiance water temperature and wind speed these data are used as boundary conditions of the prose model the quantification of uncertainties on boundary conditions is an ambitious topic that extent far beyond the scope of this paper and will require the study of real systems here we only investigate uncertainties on parameters 2 3 3 qualitative description of the simulation period state classification according to the former sensitivity analysis of the biogeochemical module c rive of the prose model wang et al 2018 we can classify the year 2011 into different periods fig 3 the polygons at the bottom show this classification fig 3 the water temperature increases from black to white color gradient and the line shaded polygons represent algal bloom periods c chl a 10 Î¼ g l wang et al 2018 concluded that at low temperatures interbloom t 6 c black polygons the river system is controlled by the reaeration process k n a v i g at moderate and high water temperatures the maximum growth rate of bacteria Î¼ m a x h b is most sensitive to variation of do concentrations when no algal bloom occurs interbloom t 6 c gray polygons once algal bloom occurs phytoplanktonic parameters related to respiration r m p p and to photosynthesis Î± p p p m a x p p etc are dominant a supplementary sensitivity analysis by sobol method sobol 1993 during algal bloom shows that the optimal temperature t o p t p p plays an important role on the growth of phytoplankton and that the sensitivity of r m p p respiration of maintenance depends on the water temperature fig a1 when the water temperature exceeds 20 c the total sensitivity index of r m p p decreases dramatically fig a1 2 4 numerical setting and computational cost according to a test of the number of particles not shown here we select 500 particles in this work which is sufficient to i match the observed oxygen concentrations and ii identify the posterior pdfs of sensible parameters the openmp application programming interface api is implemented in the code to simulate the 500 particles in parallel for a 1 year simulation period 365 days at a 15 min time step the computation takes 1 13 days with 20 processors intel r xeon r cpu e5 2640 v4 2 40 ghz a resampling threshold of Î± 0 3 is chosen corresponding to a minimum effective sample size of 150 3 results oxygen simulation and parameter identification 3 1 effective sample size for resampling procedure although the effective sample size n e f f reduce fast after two months synchronously with the start of the first algal bloom day 64 the parameter perturbation allows the restoration of particle diversity fig 4 n e f f 450 after resampling which indicates a proper exploration of the parameter space by the algorithm this is achieved by selecting a configuration of the gaussian random walk pearson 1905 through its standard deviation after several trials not shown here the standard deviation of the random walk has been set to 0 1 times the parameters range eq 13 3 2 almost perfect do simulation with prose pa fig 5 shows simulated do concentrations at three downstream monitoring stations those stations are selected because they are less sensitive to input boundary conditions and therefore permit to evaluate the conceptual structure of the code and the conceptualization of processes the model performances are evaluated by four statistical criteria rmse root mean square error mae maximum absolute error nse nash sutcliffe efficiency r correlation coefficient the ensemble weighted average do concentrations at all stations match the reference do concentrations two algal blooms are well retrieved the first starts at 64th day and the second around 171st day fig 5 the maximum rmse and mae values between ensemble weighted mean and reference do data are obtained at the suresnes station with an error of 0 035 mgo2 l and an error of 0 321 mgo2 l respectively table 2 furthermore all nses and correlation coefficients r are close to 1 which signifies a perfect match of simulated do concentration to the reference do data in addition the 95 percentile confidence intervals are very narrow which means a perfect simulation also 3 3 parameter identification in the frame of the state classification in this section the identification of physical bacterial and phytoplanktonic parameters is shown in plots displaying normalised weights over time figs 6 8 for each parameter of interest the daily normalised weights over time permits to represent the evolution of the posterior pdf of each parameter each parameter range is divided in 20 intervals the sum of daily normalised weights in each interval which approximates the posterior pdf are shown by a image plot the dashed black line represents the predefined value of parameter used to generate observation data 3 3 1 physical parameters two physical parameters are assimilated in this paper the light extinction coefficient for pure water Î· w a t e r and the reaeration coefficient related to the navigation k n a v i g albeit light extinction by clear water Î· w a t e r is a physical parameter it is an important control for phytoplankton growth wang et al 2018 it is not very well determined most of the time except during algal blooms when the posterior pdfs focus around the reference value of 0 32 m 1 see the line shaded polygons in fig 6a k n a v i g controls the reaeration process and is the most sensitive parameter to variation of do in winter when the water temperature is below 6 c wang et al 2018 in this period see the second black polygon in fig 6b the particle filter achieves a very fine identification of its pdf seeing other periods of the year its effect remains negligible and logically it remains unidentified 3 3 2 bacterial parameters in the previous sensitivity analysis wang et al 2018 the maximum growth rate of bacteria Î¼ m a x h b is the first ranked parameter out of algal bloom with a moderate water temperature t 6 c and the bacterial growth yield y h b is identified as the second sensitive parameter for inter algal bloom periods both low and moderate water temperatures Î¼ m a x h b can be retrieved well for several periods these periods match globally the gray polygons which correspond to inter algal bloom periods with a water temperature t 6 c fig 7 y h b is slightly overestimated during the simulation except for the algal blooms periods see the line shaded polygons in fig 7 the optimal temperature for bacterial growth t o p t h b can be determined at the beginning of simulation however the maximal mortality rate of bacteria m o r t h b spreads uniformly over the parameter range during the data assimilation period 3 3 3 phytoplanktonic parameters it can be observed that the respiration of maintenance r m p p the photosynthetic capacity Î± p p the light extinction coefficient by algal sell shading Î· c h l a p p and the optimal temperature for growth of phytoplankton t o p t p p are well estimated during the first algal bloom see the gray line shaded polygon in fig 8 while the maximum photosynthesis rate p m a x p p is overestimated fig 8 similarly almost all the phytoplanktonic parameters can be retrieved during the second algal bloom see the clear line shaded polygons in fig 8 but not for r m p p and chl a c p p the ratio of chlorophyll a to carbon chl a c p p is unidentified during the simulation because chl a c p p has little effect on the variation of do concentrations wang et al 2018 the particle filter captures the change of phytoplanktonic properties after 139 day for p m a x p p and t o p t p p during algal blooms five among seven parameters including Î· w a t e r can be retrieved even though the two other parameters are not well estimated we obtain satisfying simulated do concentrations during algal blooms fig 5 although Î± p p Î· w a t e r Î· c h l a p p and t o p t p p are always identified by the algorithm during blooms this is not the case for r m p p and p m a x p p which are supposed to be important during algal bloom wang et al 2018 this is further discussed in the next section 4 discussion 4 1 specifications for real time parameter identification as shown by the results the identification of the different parameters is not always ensured during the data assimilation period this result can be explained by the parameters sensitivity in contrasted hydrological and trophic contexts one parameter that is dominant on do concentration can be well estimated while the other insensitive parameters have a relatively large uncertainty in this section we discussed the real time parameter identification 4 1 1 parameters identified between algal blooms out of algal blooms the identified parameters are Î¼ m a x h b and k n a v i g which is coherent with the previous sensitivity analysis wang et al 2018 at low temperatures t 6 c bacterial and phytoplanktonic activities are limited the reaeration k n a v i g controls do concentration within water column the river system is governed by physical processes the daily posterior pdfs of k n a v i g at low temperature period day 21 38 are shown fig 9 a although the pdfs of k n a v i g from day 21 to day 28 have more dispersion than those for day 29 38 their modes are centered on the reference value fig 9a however the water temperature is below 6 c at the beginning of the simulation days 0 6 k n a v i g is not very well estimated see the first black polygon in fig 6b this can be explained by the fact that the prior pdf of k n a v i g is uniform at the start of the simulation and this period is too short when the water temperature increases t 6 c the heterotrophic bacteria develops and degrades organic matters Î¼ m a x h b becomes the most important parameter governing the do concentration in river system wang et al 2018 the identification of Î¼ m a x h b in those periods can be expected see the gray polygons in fig 7 the pdfs of Î¼ m a x h b are displayed for day 45 62 when the water temperature increases fig 9b it can be clearly seen that the modes of the pdfs of Î¼ m a x h b move towards the reference value fig 9b the particle filter captures the change from physical control k n a v i g to bacterial control Î¼ m a x h b next the mortality of phytoplankton at the end of algal blooms supplies organic matters for bacterial growth Î¼ m a x h b is thus well estimated after algal blooms see the gray polygons day 91 140 and day 280 300 in fig 7 this indicates that the algorithm adapts the evolution of the regime of river system from autotroph to heterotroph however Î¼ m a x h b is not well estimated for day 300 325 even if this period corresponds to inter algal blooms the correlation between the water temperature and the do concentration in this period fig 3 signifies that the do concentration is controlled by water temperature and then colsed to saturation the reaeration and micro organism activities are not important in this period therefore no parameter can be identified in this period 4 1 2 parameters identified during algal blooms the maximum photosynthesis rate p m a x p p is third ranked parameter during algal blooms in the sensitivity analysis wang et al 2018 however p m a x p p is overestimated with a stable posterior pdf during the first algal bloom see line shaded polygon day 64 90 in fig 8 the particles with p m a x p p close to 0 2 h 1 predefined value are under weighted that means the compensation of p m a x p p with the other parameters exist the parameter interaction of p m a x p p has been shown by the difference between the total sensitivity index and the first order sensitivity index wang et al 2018 nonetheless the do concentrations have been well estimated the former sensitivity analysis which used almost constant water temperatures didn t highlight the sensitivity of t o p t p p the supplementary result shows that the sensitivity of t o p t p p depends on the water temperature fig a1 therefore the water temperature is a crucial factor for algal blooms when t o p t p p is defined this is the reason why t o p t p p can be identified before algal blooms but not after algal blooms fig 8 contrarily to the first algal bloom the identification of r m p p fails for the second algal bloom fig 8 the supplementary sensitivity analysis shows that when the water temperature exceeds 20 c the total sensitivity index of r m p p reduces dramatically fig a1 the water temperatures are over 21 c during the second bloom fig 3 therefore r m p p is insensitive during the second algal bloom and remains unidentified the other identified parameters match the sensitivity analysis Î± p p Î· w a t e r Î· c h l a p p in conclusion the identification of the parameters depends on not only the hydrological and trophic contexts but also on the thermal state of the river system the detailed identification of the parameters is resumed in fig 10 4 2 possibility to identify different phytoplanktonic communities in this paper we define two different phytoplanktonic properties to distinguish blooms in march and in july r m p p p m a x p p and t o p t p p the particle filter detects well the change of phytoplanktonic properties fig 8 especially the optimal temperature for the growth of phytoplankton t o p t p p the posterior pdfs of t o p t p p are stable during the two algal blooms fig 11 it is therefore possible to differentiate phytoplanktonic communities in real time by comparing the posterior distributions of t o p t p p the different optimal temperatures that have been used for modeling the phytoplanktonic communities during spring and summer are the ones determined in the loire and seine rivers descy et al 2012 garnier et al 1995 vilmin 2014 4 3 circadian rhythm at night the photosynthetic parameters are absolutely insensitive and thus should remain unidentified therefore a circadian rhythm day and night can be expected for the photosynthetic parameters to study the circadian rhythm of photosynthetic parameters the posterior pdfs of p m a x p p Î± p p and t o p t p p are displayed every 3 h during days 184 186 fig 12 it can be clearly noticed that the posterior pdfs of the three parameters have more dispersion at night 00 00 6 00 than those during the day 9 00 18 00 their modes don t match the reference values at night while the three parameters are well estimated during the day fig 12 the prose pa approach retrieves well the circadian rhythm of the photosynthetic parameters sensitivity 4 4 performances sensitivity to the observation error the proof of concept of the particle filter has been achieved assuming a relative error on observations of 1 in this section we assess the impact of the relative error on both prose pa ability to simulate oxygen concentrations and to identify parameter posterior pdfs to this aim various relative observation errors are tested from 1 to 10 the kling gupta efficiencies kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 are calculated to evaluate the model performances kge is based on the decomposition of the mean squared error and nse performance criteria gupta et al 2009 kges range from inf to 1 essentially the closer to 1 the more accurate the model is the results show that the model performance decreases slightly with the increase of the observation relative error nevertheless prose pa retrieves in average the reference do concentrations for all observation relative errors tested kges are always larger than 0 96 not shown here whatever the relative error the identifiability of the bacterial parameters Î¼ m a x h b y h b and t o p t p p and the reaeration coefficient related to navigation k n a v i g is not ensured when the observation relative error exceeds 5 while prose pa is able to capture phytoplanktonic properties for all tested relative errors 1 10 table 3 except for the ratio of chlorophyll a to carbon chl a c p p which has little influence on the variation of do concentrations wang et al 2018 5 conclusions in this work we present a first implementation of particle filter into a hydro biogeochemical model for metabolism s parameter estimation the assimilation of a 15 min observation do data is realized in the seine river system on a synthetic case study it can be concluded that the particle filter is an efficient method for the biogeochemical data assimilation and for the metabolism s parameter estimation in urban river systems the prose pa approach is capable to retrieve perfectly the reference do concentrations at all stations the identification of the metabolism parameters depends on the hydrological an trophic conetxts and more surprisingly on the thermal state of the river system the data assimilation method adapts to the trophic state s change of the seine river system and the circadian cycle of photosynthetic parameters is well captured by the prose pa approach it is possible to distinguish phytoplanktonic species by identifying the different physiological properties via data assimilation the prose pa model is operational and transferable to waste water manager for assessing the impact of their practices now however it is necessary to quantify input uncertainties forcing data reject water of wwtps and csos etc which are not considered in this

appendix b importance sampling and definition of the importance weights in particle filtering we suppose here that we want to simulate a random variable u which may have a complex distribution the importance sampling method uses an instrumental distribution called the importance distribution Ï from which we know how to draw samples sÃ¤rkkÃ¤ 2013 the importance sampling relies on the following formula b1 f u u d u f u u Ï u u Ï u u d u where Ï u u is a proposal pdf for the random variable u from which we can draw samples and f u u is the posterior pdf of given state u from which we cannot directly or efficiently draw samples the equation b 1 transforms the expectation of u into the expectation of the term u f u u Ï u u we can perform monte carlo approximation to estimate the

18532,the coupling of high frequency data of water quality with physically based models of river systems is of great interest for the management of urban socio ecosystems one approach to exploit high frequency data is data assimilation which has received an increasing attention in the field of hydrology but not for water quality modeling so far we present here a first implementation of a particle filtering algorithm into a community centered hydro biogeochemical model to assimilate high frequency dissolved oxygen data and to estimate metabolism parameters in the seine river system the procedure is designed based on the results of a former sensitivity analysis of the model wang et al 2018 that allows for the identification of the twelve most sensible parameters all over the year those parameters are both physical and related to micro organisms reaeration coefficient photosynthetic parameters growth rates respiration rates and optimal temperature the performances of the approach are assessed on a synthetic case study that mimics 66 km of the seine river virtual dissolved oxygen data are generated using time varying parameters this paper aims at retrieving the predefined parameters by assimilating those data the simulated dissolved oxygen concentrations match the reference concentrations the identification of the parameters depends on the hydrological and trophic contexts and more surprisingly on the thermal state of the river the physical bacterial and phytoplanktonic parameters can be retrieved properly leading to the differentiation of two successive algal blooms by comparing the estimated posterior distribution of the optimal temperature for phytoplankton growth finally photosynthetic parameters distributions following circadian cycles during algal blooms are discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords data assimilation dissolved oxygen parameter estimation particle filter prose pa 1 introduction the coupling of high frequency data of water quality with physically based model of river systems is of great interest for the management of urban socio ecosystems one approach to exploit high frequency data is data assimilation which combines observations and short range forecasts to estimate the distribution of the true state of a process wikle and berliner 2007 assimilating high frequency data allows for the identification of the multiple sources of model uncertainty relative to parameters model structure forcing data e g temperature wind speed and solar radiation and observations evensen 2003 which limit the validation and application of water quality models beven 1989 polus et al 2011 a lot of data assimilation techniques exist in literature such as the variational methods sasaki 1955 1958 the kalman filter kf kalman 1960 the extended kalman filter ekf beck 1987 the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 and the particle filter pf doucet et al 2001 a review of these methods can be found in the literature wikle and berliner 2007 cappe et al 2007 sÃ¤rkkÃ¤ 2013 the variational methods minimizing a cost function have been widely used in numerical weather prediction courtier et al 1994 1998 gauthier et al 2007 kleist and ide 2015 yucel et al 2015 the major drawbacks of variational methods are the numerical implementation complexity and the computational cost the kf handles only linear models with gaussian errors which are not consistent with the hydrologic and water quality models to extend to nonlinear models the ekf uses the linearized formula tangent to the forward model which is an approximation and would be very costly to implement for high dimensional systems evensen 2003 the enkf uses monte carlo samples to approximate the forecast distribution and then applies linear update formulas to obtain the posterior distribution evensen 2003 while the particle filter based methods estimate the forecast and posterior distributions using discrete probability densities arulampalam et al 2002 obtained via bayes theorem bayes 1763 since the enkf and particle filter resolve the two major drawbacks related to the use of ekf and handle highly nonlinear models the enkf and particle filter based methods have become the most commonly used sequential data assimilation techniques in hydrologic modeling for state parameter estimation moradkhani et al 2005 weerts and el serafy 2006 andreadis et al 2007 salamon and feyen 2009 plaza et al 2012 dechant and moradkhani 2012 vrugt et al 2013 shi et al 2014 abbaszadeh et al 2018 in biogeochemical oceanography the efficiency of the ensemble based kalman filters has been assessed on ocean models for ocean biogeochemical state and parameter estimation simon and bertino 2012 simon et al 2012 gharamti et al 2017 yu et al 2018 due to the lack of data the difficulties in representing complex hydro ecosystems and the computational cost there are still relatively few applications about the state parameter estimation by assimilating high frequency dissolved oxygen do concentrations in river systems pastres et al 2003 have applied the ekf to update three parameters of a simple do chlorophyll model in the lagoon of venice mao et al 2009 used ekf to forecast algal blooms and dissolved oxygen dynamics in a marine ecosystem the recent studies focus particularly on forecasting algal bloom dynamics using enkf in river system kim et al 2014 or in lakes huang et al 2013 page et al 2018 xue et al 2012 applied also enkf in the massachusetts bay to design the optimal monitoring sites for do measurements however as stated by wikle and berliner 2007 p 10 11 we assume that the forecast distibution can be characterized by its first two moments or equivalently that it is gaussian with mean and estimated variance covariance matrix however in nonlinear cases since gaussianity cannot hold for all time the enkf must yield biased samples and estimates even for unlimited sample sizes the recent investigations concluded also that the assumption of a gaussian error structure for the forecast distribution may not be realistic for hydrologic systems and phytoplankton dynamics and the authors suggested testing the particle filter based methods to overcome this problem plaza et al 2012 pasetto et al 2012 dechant and moradkhani 2012 huang et al 2013 the feasibility of bayesian inference with a particle markov chain monte carlo algorithm is tested on a simple predator prey model in ecological research kattwinkel and reichert 2017 in this paper we present the prose pa model which consists in a first implementation of a

metabolisms parameters in the seine river system the procedure is designed from the results of a sensitivity analysis of the biogeochemical module c rive of the prose model that identified the twelve most sensible parameters of the model wang et al 2018 those parameters are both physical water re aeration by fluvial navigation and physiological for instance growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria

flipo et al 2004 vilmin et al 2015b couples three libraries a hydrodynamic library a transport library and a biogeochemical library that simulate together the hydro biogeochemical functioning of a river system the hydraulic module solves the 1d shallow water equations with a finite volume scheme the transport module simulates the advection and dispersion of both particulate and dissolved substances including also water re oxygenation by overflowing over hydraulic works the biogeochemical library is based on the rive conceptual model which is a community centered model billen et al 1994 garnier et al 1995 https www fire upmc fr rive the cycles of carbon nutrients and dissolved oxygen are simulated in both water column and sediment layer the compound exchanges between water column and benthic layers have been successively developed even et al 2004 2007a flipo et al 2004 2007 vilmin et al 2015b the prose model has been well validated and largely applied in the seine river system even et al 1998 2004 2007a polus et al 2011 raimonet et al 2015 vilmin et al 2015a b 2016 2018 2 1 2 study area the study area is located downstream paris city and consists of 66 km of the

over 6 5 million equivalent inhabitants rocher et al 2011 during rain events csos discharge large amount of suspended solids organic matters and nutrients into the seine river even et al 2007b assimilating do is therefore of great interest for the decision makers in this area 2 2 data assimilation framework using particle filtering the prose pa approach 2 2 1 state space model to begin with we represent the prose model as a state space model kalman 1960 a state space model uses inputs state variables outputs to describe the evolution of a system over time in our case it uses three equations eq 1 2 3 let y represents the state variable vector of the system in terms of physics do concentrations in this study and x be the vector of model parameters the state variable and the model parameters are both modelled as random variables y x characterized by their probability distribution functions pdf x and y denote the realizations of random variables x y the observation vector y is a realization of the random variable y the state space model explains the temporal evolution of the system by assuming that it behaves as a markov process markov 1906 this means that the values at t depend on the values at t 1 only 1 x t x t 1 Î· t 2 y t m y t 1 Î¼ t x t Î½ t 3 y t h y t Îµ t the transition of model parameter x from t 1 to t is described by a gaussian perturbation Î· t eq 1 in the above equations m is the forward model in our case prose and h is the observation operator relating the forecasted state variable y t to the observation y t in other words h denotes the selection of model cells where observations are available y t 1 stands for the posterior state variable at previous time step t 1 or equivalently for the prior state variable at current time step t the symbols Î¼ t and x t represent respectively the prior forcing data e g temperature wind speed and solar radiation and the prior model parameters at time step t the variables Î½ t and Îµ t characterize the unknown model and measurement errors respectively the prose model aims at conserving the mass balance the model does it with accuracy the relative errors being in the order 10 5 or 10 6 this is far below observation errors therefore no model errors are considered Î½ t 0 in our case note that the nomenclature we use here is not canonical in dynamical system literature the parameters would have been called the states because they are the hidden dynamic variables that govern the system s behaviour in forward modelling and especially hydrology the state variables designate the variable that are computed by the model while the parameters represents the time varying functional inputs of the numerical model we consider the latter as the reader is more likely to be accustomed to this definition please note that with this definition the input fluxes at the boundary of the model are not called parameters but boundary conditions 2 2 2 bayesian inference we seek to estimate the posterior pdf of both the random variable y and the parameter x conditionally to the observations y to simplify the writing we define the state vector z y t x t t and its realizations z y t x t t therefore our goal can be reformulated in finding the conditional pdf of z knowing y noted f z z y through bayes theorem bayes 1763 the posterior pdf f z z y can be deduced from the product of the prior pdf f z z and the likelihood distribution f y y z up to a normalizing constant independent from z 4 f z z y f y y z f z z the prior pdf f z z gives the prior knowledge on z before the measurements are taken the likelihood f y y z describes the pdf of the observation data given the model predictions 2 2 3 sequential form the formulation 4 does not relate to time to introduce a sequential form for data assimilation we define the temporal trajectories of the random variables z and y z 1 t z 1 z t and y 1 t y 1 y t discretized over time by sequences of state z i y i i 1 t as well as their realizations z 1 t y 1 t the posterior pdf of the trajectory z 1 t given observation y 1 t writes f z 1 t z 1 t y 1 t next we can write the posterior pdf f z 1 t z 1 t y 1 t under a recursive form arulampalam et al 2002 doucet et al 2001 wikle and berliner 2007 sÃ¤rkkÃ¤ 2013 owing to the markovian nature of the process we simplify the notations rewriting a pdf f z z into f z 5 f z 1 t y 1 t f y t z 1 t y 1 t 1 f z 1 t y 1 t 1 6 f y t z t f z t z 1 t 1 y 1 t 1 f z 1 t 1 y 1 t 1 7 f y t z t f z t z t 1 f z 1 t 1 y 1 t 1 where we use first the bayes theorem to get equation 5 then the bayes theorem and the markov property for equation 6 and the markov property to obtain the sequential relation 7 we propagate z t using the evolution equations 1 and 2 in order to model the distribution f z t z t 1 note in case of a deterministic formulation Î½ t Î· t 0 0 in equations 1 and 2 f z t z t 1 is a dirac measure consequently we can access the posterior pdf f z 1 t y 1 t of the trajectory z 1 t by updating it at each time step this will be done through the use of sampling techniques 2 2 4 the particle filter the particle filter aims at approximating the posterior pdf f z 1 t y 1 t of the trajectory z 1 t knowing y 1 t by a set of particles simulations associated with weights Ï t it is generally impossible to sample from f z 1 t y 1 t directly to address this problem sequential importance sampling has been suggested doucet et al 2000 liu 2001 for the ease of reading the principle of the importance sampling and the definition of the importance weights are detailed in b we give here the weight update formula for each particle directly which is a consequence of the sequential decomposition of the posterior of the trajectory obtained in eq 7 8 Ï t i f y t z t i Ï t 1 i 9 Ï Ë t i Ï t i Ï t i where f y t z t i denotes the likelihood function which quantifies how y t is likely to be observed given z t i at time t Ï t i and Ï t 1 i stand for the posterior and prior weights at time t in other words the posterior weight at time t 1 serves as a prior weight at time t we also define the normalised importance weight Ï Ë t i associated with the particle i in practice it is usually not necessary to estimate the posterior pdf f z 1 t y 1 t of the trajectory z 1 t knowing y 1 t we are interested here in the marginal distribution of f z 1 t y 1 t called filtering distribution f z t y 1 t it represents the distribution of the state variables knowing all the past observations as well as the current one in this paper we note the filtering posterior pdf at time t as f z t y 1 t which can be approximated as 10 f z t y 1 t n i 1 Ï Ë t i Î´ z t i where Î´ is a dirac delta function and n denotes the number of particles that is the filtering distribution is approximated by a discrete distribution whose probability mass function is defined by the normalised importance weights and charges the particles if we assume that the observation error is gaussian then the likelihood probability of each particle can be calculated using the pdf of the multivariate normal distribution 11 ln l y t z t i m 2 ln 2 Ï 1 2 ln Ï 1 2 y t h y t i t Ï 1 y t h y t i f y t z t i l y t z t i i 1 n l y t z t i where m is the number of observation sites and Ï is the error covariance matrix of the observations 2 2 5 resampling algorithm a common problem when using particle filtering is the degeneracy phenomena this occurs when almost all the particles have zero or very small importance weights only a few particles have significant importance weights therefore the discrete probability densities cannot represent the posterior pdf of a given state adequately a resampling procedure reduces the degeneracy effect the basic idea of the resampling is to discard particles that have a small weight and to duplicate particles with a large weight generally it is not necessary to perform resampling at every time step but only when necessary a way to monitor the need of resampling is to estimate the effective number of particles by the effective sample size n e f f the n e f f cannot be evaluated exactly but it can be estimated it by kong et al 1994 doucet et al 2000 12 n e f f Ë 1 i 1 n Ï Ë t i 2 when n e f f is below a threshold n t h r e s Î± n predefined by the user resampling is performed after the resampling step all weights are reset to 1 n as the particles having a important weight may be copied many times which results in sample impoverishment problem to maintain the diversity of the ensemble a random perturbation is added to the parameters value after the resampling step eq 13 13 x t 1 i x t r e s a m p l i n g i Î· t i Î· t i n 0 s Ï 2 where s is a percent perturbation predefined by the user 0 1 in this study and Ï denotes the parameter range the resampling technique used in this work is referred to as systematic resampling the procedure of systematic resampling is thoroughly described in the literature kitagawa 1996 moradkhani et al 2005 li et al 2015 2 2 6 numerical algorithm the coupling of the particle filtering algorithm with prose model is called prose pa pa stands for parallel computing and data assimilation a full description of the prose pa approach is given below fig 2 2 3 description of the synthetic case study 2 3 1 parameters considered and virtual observation data twelve parameters of the prose model were identified in different hydrological and trophic contexts in a previous work wang et al 2018 those parameters are both physical and physiological table 1 five monitoring stations are located in the study area suresnes chatou bougival sartrouville and andresy from upstream to downstream respectively fig 1 the assimilation period is the year 2011 when algal blooms occurred in march and july in the seine river vilmin et al 2016 the two successive algal blooms are characterized by different physiological properties especially the optimal temperature for growth of phytoplankton vilmin 2014 a high frequency do dissolved oxygen dataset y r e f every 15 min which corresponds to the frequency of the real measurement is generated using predefined parameters table 1 three phytoplanktonic parameters are modified manually at day 139 in order to represent the two different algal blooms p m a x p p r m p p and t o p t p p see table 1 for parameter definition in this case study the observation data are obtained adding a gaussian error to the reference dataset with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 0 01 y r e f y t y t r e f Îµ t Îµ t n 0 0 01 y t r e f 2 a standard deviation of 0 01 y r e f ensures that the 95 observation errors are less than 0 02 y r e f which is coherent with the sensors used in the seine river system garnier et al 2019 the reference dataset and predefined parameters are assumed to be true and are assessed via data assimilation in this study no model errors are considered Î½ t 0 see eq 2 the major aims of this work are to retrieve the reference do concentrations and the dominant predefined parameters identified by wang et al 2018 over time 2 3 2 input data for prose model apart from hydraulic time varying river discharge and csos data geometric data river channels the prose model also requires time varying concentrations of the biogeochemical variables micro organism biomass dissolved oxygen nutrients organic matters suspended solids entering the system and the meteorological data solar irradiance water temperature and wind speed these data are used as boundary conditions of the prose model the quantification of uncertainties on boundary conditions is an ambitious topic that extent far beyond the scope of this paper and will require the study of real systems here we only investigate uncertainties on parameters 2 3 3 qualitative description of the simulation period state classification according to the former sensitivity analysis of the biogeochemical module c rive of the prose model wang et al 2018 we can classify the year 2011 into different periods fig 3 the polygons at the bottom show this classification fig 3 the water temperature increases from black to white color gradient and the line shaded polygons represent algal bloom periods c chl a 10 Î¼ g l wang et al 2018 concluded that at low temperatures interbloom t 6 c black polygons the river system is controlled by the reaeration process k n a v i g at moderate and high water temperatures the maximum growth rate of bacteria Î¼ m a x h b is most sensitive to variation of do concentrations when no algal bloom occurs interbloom t 6 c gray polygons once algal bloom occurs phytoplanktonic parameters related to respiration r m p p and to photosynthesis Î± p p p m a x p p etc are dominant a supplementary sensitivity analysis by sobol method sobol 1993 during algal bloom shows that the optimal temperature t o p t p p plays an important role on the growth of phytoplankton and that the sensitivity of r m p p respiration of maintenance depends on the water temperature fig a1 when the water temperature exceeds 20 c the total sensitivity index of r m p p decreases dramatically fig a1 2 4 numerical setting and computational cost according to a test of the number of particles not shown here we select 500 particles in this work which is sufficient to i match the observed oxygen concentrations and ii identify the posterior pdfs of sensible parameters the openmp application programming interface api is implemented in the code to simulate the 500 particles in parallel for a 1 year simulation

effective sample size of 150 3 results oxygen simulation and parameter identification 3 1 effective sample size for resampling procedure although the effective sample size n e f f reduce fast after two months synchronously with the start of the first algal bloom day 64 the parameter perturbation allows the restoration of particle diversity fig 4 n e f f 450 after resampling which indicates a proper exploration of the parameter space by the algorithm this is achieved by selecting a configuration of the gaussian random walk pearson 1905 through its standard deviation after several trials not shown here the standard deviation of the random walk has been set to 0 1 times the parameters range eq 13 3 2 almost perfect do simulation with prose pa fig 5 shows simulated do concentrations at three downstream monitoring stations those stations are selected because they are less sensitive to input boundary conditions and therefore permit to evaluate the conceptual structure of the code and the conceptualization of processes the model performances are evaluated by four statistical criteria rmse root mean square error mae maximum absolute error nse nash sutcliffe efficiency r correlation coefficient the ensemble weighted average do concentrations at all stations match the reference do concentrations two algal blooms are well retrieved the first starts at 64th day and the second around 171st day fig 5 the maximum rmse and mae values between ensemble weighted mean and reference do data are obtained at the suresnes station with an error of 0 035 mgo2 l and an error of 0 321 mgo2 l respectively table 2 furthermore all nses and correlation coefficients r are close to 1 which signifies a perfect match of simulated do concentration to the reference do data in addition the 95 percentile confidence intervals are very narrow which means a perfect simulation also 3 3 parameter identification in the frame of the state classification in this section the identification of physical bacterial and phytoplanktonic parameters is shown in plots displaying normalised weights over time figs 6 8 for each parameter of interest the daily normalised weights over time permits to represent the evolution of the posterior pdf of each parameter each parameter range is divided in 20 intervals the sum of daily normalised weights in each interval which approximates the posterior pdf are shown by a image plot the dashed black line represents the predefined value of parameter used to generate observation data 3 3 1 physical parameters two physical parameters are assimilated in this paper the light extinction coefficient for pure water Î· w a t e r and the reaeration coefficient related to the navigation k n a v i g albeit light extinction by clear water Î· w a t e r is a physical parameter it is an important control for phytoplankton growth wang et al 2018 it is not very well determined most of the time except during algal blooms when the posterior pdfs focus around the reference value of 0 32 m 1 see the line shaded polygons in fig 6a k n a v i g controls the reaeration process and is the most sensitive parameter to variation of do in winter when the water temperature is below 6 c wang et al 2018 in this period see the second black polygon in fig 6b the particle filter achieves a very fine identification of its pdf seeing other periods of the year its effect remains negligible and logically it remains unidentified 3 3 2 bacterial parameters in the previous sensitivity analysis wang et al 2018 the maximum growth rate of bacteria Î¼ m a x h b is the first ranked parameter out of algal bloom with a moderate water temperature t 6 c and the bacterial growth yield y h b is identified as the second sensitive parameter for inter algal bloom periods both low and moderate water temperatures Î¼ m a x h b can be retrieved well for several periods these periods match globally the gray polygons which correspond to inter algal bloom periods with a water temperature t 6 c fig 7 y h b is slightly overestimated during the simulation except for the algal blooms periods see the line shaded polygons in fig 7 the optimal temperature for bacterial growth t o p t h b can be determined at the beginning of simulation however the maximal mortality rate of bacteria m o r t h b spreads uniformly over the parameter range during the data assimilation period 3 3 3 phytoplanktonic parameters it can be observed that the respiration of maintenance r m p p the photosynthetic capacity Î± p p the light extinction coefficient by algal sell shading Î· c h l a p p and the optimal temperature for growth of phytoplankton t o p t p p are well estimated during the first algal bloom see the gray line shaded polygon in fig 8 while the maximum photosynthesis rate p m a x p p is overestimated fig 8 similarly almost all the phytoplanktonic parameters can be retrieved during the second algal bloom see the clear line shaded polygons in fig 8 but not for r m p p and chl a c p p the ratio of chlorophyll a to carbon chl a c p p is unidentified during the simulation because chl a c p p has little effect on the variation of do concentrations wang et al 2018 the particle filter captures the change of phytoplanktonic properties after 139 day for p m a x p p and t o p t p p during algal blooms five among seven parameters including Î· w a t e r can be retrieved even though the two other parameters are not well estimated we obtain satisfying simulated do concentrations during algal blooms fig 5 although Î± p p Î· w a t e r Î· c h l a p p and t o p t p p are always identified by the algorithm during blooms this is not the case for r m p p and p m a x p p which are supposed to be important during algal bloom wang et al 2018 this is further discussed in the next section 4 discussion 4 1 specifications for real time parameter identification as shown by the results the identification of the different parameters is not always ensured during the data assimilation period this result can be explained by the parameters sensitivity in contrasted hydrological and trophic contexts one parameter that is dominant on do concentration can be well estimated while the other insensitive parameters have a relatively large uncertainty in this section we discussed the real time parameter identification 4 1 1 parameters identified between algal blooms out of algal blooms the identified parameters are Î¼ m a x h b and k n a v i g which is coherent with the previous sensitivity analysis wang et al 2018 at low temperatures t 6 c bacterial and phytoplanktonic activities are limited the reaeration k n a v i g controls do concentration within water column the river system is governed by physical processes the daily posterior pdfs of k n a v i g at low temperature period day 21 38 are shown fig 9 a although the pdfs of k n a v i g from day 21 to day 28 have more dispersion than those for day 29 38 their modes are centered on the reference value fig 9a however the water temperature is below 6 c at the beginning of the simulation days 0 6 k n a v i g is not very well estimated see the first black polygon in fig 6b this can be explained by the fact that the prior pdf of k n a v i g is uniform at the start of the simulation and this period is too short when the water temperature increases t 6 c the heterotrophic bacteria develops and degrades organic matters Î¼ m a x h b becomes the most important parameter governing the do concentration in river system wang et al 2018 the identification of Î¼ m a x h b in those periods can be expected see the gray polygons in fig 7 the pdfs of Î¼ m a x h b are displayed for day 45 62 when the water temperature increases fig 9b it can be clearly seen that the modes of the pdfs of Î¼ m a x h b move towards the reference value fig 9b the particle filter captures the change from physical control k n a v i g to bacterial control Î¼ m a x h b next the mortality of phytoplankton at the end of algal blooms supplies organic matters for bacterial growth Î¼ m a x h b is thus well estimated after algal blooms see the gray polygons day 91 140 and day 280 300 in fig 7 this indicates that the algorithm adapts the evolution of the regime of river system from autotroph to heterotroph however Î¼ m a x h b is not well estimated for day 300 325 even if this period corresponds to inter algal blooms the correlation between the water temperature and the do concentration in this period fig 3 signifies that the do concentration is controlled by water temperature and then colsed to saturation the reaeration and micro organism activities are not important in this period therefore no parameter can be identified in this period 4 1 2 parameters identified during algal blooms the maximum photosynthesis rate p m a x p p is third ranked parameter during algal blooms in the sensitivity analysis wang et al 2018 however p m a x p p is overestimated with a stable posterior pdf during the first algal bloom see line shaded polygon day 64 90 in fig 8 the particles with p m a x p p close to 0 2 h 1 predefined value are under weighted that means the compensation of p m a x p p with the other parameters exist the parameter interaction of p m a x p p has been shown by the difference between the total sensitivity index and the first order sensitivity index wang et al 2018 nonetheless the do concentrations have been well estimated the former sensitivity analysis which used almost constant water temperatures didn t highlight the sensitivity of t o p t p p the supplementary result shows that the sensitivity of t o p t p p depends on the water temperature fig a1 therefore the water temperature is a crucial factor for algal blooms when t o p t p p is defined this is the reason why t o p t p p can be identified before algal blooms but not after algal blooms fig 8 contrarily to the first algal bloom the identification of r m p p fails for the second algal bloom fig 8 the supplementary sensitivity analysis shows that when the water temperature exceeds 20 c the total sensitivity index of r m p p reduces dramatically fig a1 the water temperatures are over 21 c during the second bloom fig 3 therefore r m p p is insensitive during the second algal bloom and remains unidentified the other identified parameters match the sensitivity analysis Î± p p Î· w a t e r Î· c h l a p p in conclusion the identification of the parameters depends on not only the hydrological and trophic contexts but also on the thermal state of the river system the detailed identification of the parameters is resumed in fig 10 4 2 possibility to identify different phytoplanktonic communities in this paper we define two different phytoplanktonic properties to distinguish blooms in march and in july r m p p p m a x p p and t o p t p p the particle filter detects well the change of phytoplanktonic properties fig 8 especially the optimal temperature for the growth of phytoplankton t o p t p p the posterior pdfs of t o p t p p are stable during the two algal blooms fig 11 it is therefore possible to differentiate phytoplanktonic communities in real time by comparing the posterior distributions of t o p t p p the different optimal temperatures that have been used for modeling the phytoplanktonic communities during spring and summer are the ones determined in the loire and seine rivers descy et al 2012 garnier et al 1995 vilmin 2014 4 3 circadian rhythm at night the photosynthetic parameters are absolutely insensitive and thus should remain unidentified therefore a circadian rhythm day and night can be expected for the photosynthetic parameters to study the circadian rhythm of photosynthetic parameters the posterior pdfs of p m a x p p Î± p p and t o p t p p are displayed every 3 h during days 184 186 fig 12 it can be clearly noticed that the posterior pdfs of the three parameters have more dispersion at night 00 00 6 00 than those during the day 9 00 18 00 their modes don t match the reference values at night while the three parameters are well estimated during the day fig 12 the prose pa approach retrieves well the circadian rhythm of the photosynthetic parameters sensitivity 4 4 performances sensitivity to the observation error the proof of concept of the particle filter has been achieved assuming a relative error on observations of 1 in this section we assess the impact of the relative error on both prose pa ability to simulate oxygen concentrations and to identify parameter posterior pdfs to this aim various relative observation errors are tested from 1 to 10 the kling gupta efficiencies kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 are calculated to evaluate the model performances kge is based on the decomposition of the mean squared error and nse performance criteria gupta et al 2009 kges range from inf to 1 essentially the closer to 1 the more accurate the model is the results show that the model performance decreases slightly with the increase of the observation relative error nevertheless prose pa retrieves in average the reference do concentrations for all observation relative errors tested kges are always larger than 0 96 not shown here whatever the relative error the identifiability of the bacterial parameters Î¼ m a x h b y h b and t o p t p p and the reaeration coefficient related to navigation k n a v i g is not ensured when the observation relative error exceeds 5 while prose pa is able to capture phytoplanktonic properties for all tested relative errors 1 10 table 3 except for the ratio of chlorophyll a to carbon chl a c p p which has little influence on the variation of do concentrations wang et al 2018 5 conclusions in this work we present a first implementation of particle filter into a hydro biogeochemical model for metabolism s parameter estimation the assimilation of a 15 min observation do data is realized in the seine river system on a synthetic case study it can be concluded that the particle filter is an efficient method for the biogeochemical data assimilation and for the metabolism s parameter estimation in urban river systems the prose pa approach is capable to retrieve perfectly the reference do concentrations at all stations the identification of the metabolism parameters depends on the hydrological an trophic conetxts and more surprisingly on the thermal state of the river system the data assimilation method adapts to the trophic state s change of the seine river system and the circadian cycle of photosynthetic parameters is well captured by the prose pa approach it is possible to distinguish phytoplanktonic species by identifying the different physiological properties via data assimilation the prose pa model is operational and transferable to waste water manager for assessing the impact of their practices now however it is necessary to quantify input uncertainties forcing data reject water of wwtps and csos etc which are not considered in this

the paper appendix a sobol sensitivity analysis of c rive module during algal bloom at different temperatures the sensitivity analysis of c rive model during algal blooms is realized every two degrees from 2 c to 26 c fig a1 the results show that the optimal temperature for the growth of phytoplankton t o p t p p is the most influential parameter at low temperatures 6 c when the water temperature exceeds 20 c the importance of the respiration of maintenance r m p p reduces drastically for more detailed information about the sensitivity analysis of c rive model one can consult wang et al 2018 appendix b importance sampling and definition of the importance weights in particle filtering we suppose here that we want to simulate a random variable u which may have a complex distribution the importance sampling method uses an instrumental distribution called the importance distribution Ï from which we know how to draw samples sÃ¤rkkÃ¤ 2013 the importance sampling relies on the following formula b1 f u u d u f u u Ï u u Ï u u d u where Ï u u is a proposal pdf for the random variable u from which we can draw samples and f u u is the posterior pdf of given state u from which we cannot directly or efficiently draw samples the equation b 1 transforms the expectation of u into the expectation of the term u f u u Ï u u we can perform monte carlo approximation to estimate the expectation of g u denoted e g u for any function g b2 e g u g u f u u Ï u u Ï u u d u 1 n n i 1 g u i f u u i Ï u u i Ï i 1 n f u u i Ï u u i where u i i 1 n is ith sample particle drawn from the importance distribution Ï u u and Ï i denotes the weight associated with ith sample particle with particular choices of g we can hence retrieve the expectation of u its variance quantiles etc

we define the normalised importance weight Ï Ë t i associated with the particle i normalizing the weights allows to evacuate the problem of the normalizing constant in the bayesian representation of the posterior 5 equation b 7 shows that we only need to store the state z t at time t in addition it is usually not necessary to estimate the full pdf f z 1 t y 1 t in practice in this work we are

18533,emerging contaminants ecs are primarily synthetic organic chemicals that have a focus of increasing attention due to either increased awareness of their potential risks to humans and aquatic biota or only recently been detected in the aquatic environment or drinking water supplies through improved analytical techniques many ecs have no regulatory standards due to the lack of information on the effects of chronic exposure pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides and flame retardants are some of the most frequently detected ecs in aquatic environments with over 200 individual compounds identified to date current wastewater treatment is ineffective at removing ecs and there is a vital need for the development of efficient cost effective ec treatment systems that can be applied to a range of scales and wastewater types microalgae have demonstrated potential for detoxifying organic and inorganic pollutants with a number of large scale wastewater treatment microalgal technologies already developed there are three main pathways that microalgae can bioremediate ecs bioadsorption bio uptake and biodegradation microalgal bioadsorption occurs when ecs are either adsorbed to cell wall components or onto organic substances excreted by the cells while bio uptake involves the active transport of the contaminant into the cell where it binds to intracellular proteins and other compounds microalgal biodegradation of ecs involves the transformation of complex compounds into simpler breakdown molecules through catalytic metabolic degradation biodegradation provides one of the most promising technologies for the remediation of contaminants of concern as it can transform the contaminant to less toxic compounds rather than act as a biofilter further research is needed to exploit microalgal species for ec bioremediation properties such as increased bioadsorption enhanced biodegrading enzymes and optimised growth conditions when coupled with nutrient removal microalgal treatment of ec can be a cost effective viable option for the reduction of contaminant pollution in waterways graphical abstract image 1 keywords emerging contaminants bioadsorption biodegradation aquatic pollution microalgal treatment systems 1 background water quality management for the protection of aquatic and human health values has traditionally focused on nutrients suspended sediment heavy metals and human pathogens pal et al 2014 however in recent years there have been increasing concerns over the presence of emerging contaminants ec in aquatic environments and their associated risks and impacts to both aquatic ecosystems and human health ecs are primarily synthetic organic chemicals that have while present in the environment for some time only recently been detected due to either improved analytical techniques or increased awareness of their risks escapa et al 2015 ahmed et al 2017 tran et al 2018 ecs are described as substances that either have no current or have emerging and evolving regulatory standards and they could potentially cause deleterious effects to the aquatic environment or humans at environmentally relevant concentrations us epa 2008 most ecs enter waterways via human mediated routes including direct discharge of raw or treated municipal wastewater streams landfill leachate urban and rural surface and groundwater runoff or from industrial waste discharge tran and gin 2017 ali et al 2018 tran et al 2018 municipal wastewater treatment plants have been shown to contribute the most continual and ec rich discharge into the aquatic environment with the number of specific ecs reported in wastewater discharge ranging from 25 to 200 compounds wang et al 2016 tran and gin 2017 villar navarro et al 2018 however these numbers are likely to increase with improved analytical techniques and industrial application of newly created compounds that will become new ecs ecs typically fall into several broad categories including pharmaceuticals personal care products illicit drugs artificial sweeteners pesticides plasticisers and flame retardants petrie et al 2015 norvill et al 2016 tran et al 2018 pharmaceuticals pesticides and personal care products are the most frequently detected ecs in aquatic habitats due to both their high use and high solubility rykowska and wasiak 2015 manamsa et al 2016 bai et al 2018 however both the number and concentration of different ecs present in the waterways is dependent on the socio economic composition of the community contributing to the ec discharges tran et al 2018 while pharmaceuticals and personal care products pcp in aquatic environments are often reported at low concentrations their presence in both aquatic environments and drinking water supplies is of concern for both human and ecosystem health who 2011 rodriguez narvaez et al 2017 types of pharmaceutical and pcp compounds frequently reported in the aquatic environment include human and veterinary antibiotics antimicrobial agents neuroactive drugs hormones painkiller medication sunscreens insect repellents and fragrances norvill et al 2016 xiong et al 2018a concerns regarding these compounds as ecs include the potential effects of endocrine disruptors and hormones on the life stages of aquatic biota as well as the development of antibiotic resistance genes from chronic exposure to antibiotic and antimicrobial agents which can enter food chains and infect humans petrie et al 2015 tran et al 2018 xiong et al 2018a studies have shown that continuous exposure to low sub toxic concentrations of certain pcps has resulted in endocrine developmental and epigenetic disruption to aquatic organisms and direct impact on human health wilkinson et al 2016 ebele et al 2017 pesticides and other agri chemicals are used widely in both urban and rural environments their high application rate high mobility and persistence in soils results in the transport of these ecs into waterways via runoff and percolation loague et al 1990 pal et al 2014 pesticides have been known to negatively impact ecosystem function and biodiversity values as well as bioaccumulation into aquatic organisms disrupting the food chain and posing a potential risk to human health rodriguez narvaez et al 2017 knillmann et al 2018 machado and soares 2018 however for many of the ecs detected in the aquatic environment the lack of ecotoxic and ecological data means that their potential ecological risks are not understood bai et al 2018 many reports cite ec concentrations typically in the nanogram to low micrograms per litre range in wastewater surface water groundwater and drinking water but some contaminants such as the antibiotic ciprofloxacin and per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have been reported as high as milligrams and grams per litre range respectively nakayama et al 2019 kelly and brooks 2018 while ecs are not currently regulated public concern regarding their presence in the environment has led to the development of interim aquatic guidelines for a number of ecs including but not limited to nitrophenols pfas carbamazepine and ibuprofen scher 2011 petrie et al 2015 anzecc 2018 ccme 2018 and priority pollutant lists have been developed by the european union water framework directive and the united states environment protection agency however one of the challenges that regulators waterbody managers and other stakeholders face when considering the impacts of ecs is a scarcity of published information on the effects of long term exposure to these compounds and their metabolites on aquatic biota and human health conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp are not currently designed to sufficiently treat and remove ecs from the influent while partial removal of some ecs from the wastewater occurs through adsorption onto activated sludge guerra et al 2014 relatively high concentrations of ecs still remain in the effluent leaving the wwtp tran and gin 2017 ali et al 2018 furthermore disposal of the ec laden sludge onto land such is common practice for many wwtps may result in ecs percolating into groundwater or surface runoff as the sludge degrades thus resulting in further contamination of new environments a number technologies such as chemical precipitation solvent extraction constructed treatment wetlands electrocoagulation and anaerobic bed reactors have been trialled for the treatment and removal of ecs in wastewater lee et al 2012 lladÃ³ et al 2016 however these methods are often ineffective particularly at dilute concentrations or the construction and operation costs make implementation of some of these options cost prohibitive marchal et al 2013 ali et al 2018 due to the rising number of ecs their persistence in the environment and bioaccumulation in the food web as well as potential adverse ecological and human health effects there is a growing need for cost effective mitigation technologies that can be applied to a range of ecs across a range of industrial scales using microalgae to treat emerging contaminants provides an opportunity to meet the needs of enhanced wastewater treatment here we review the opportunities and challenges for the use of microalgal based technologies for the bioremediation of ecs 2 microalgal bioremediation mechanisms over the last several decades the use of microalgae for the bioremediation of nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and carbon from various wastewater streams has been successfully demonstrated at a range of scales sutherland et al 2018 microalgal based wastewater treatment systems were shown to have lower capital and operational costs provide natural disinfection and be more efficient for remediating nutrient pollution compared to traditional wastewater treatment systems benemann 2008 craggs et al 2012 when coupled with wastewater treatment microalgae have the potential to provide cost effective remediation of ecs another advantage of using microalgae for bioremediation is the ability to recover resources for beneficial re use through biorefinery of the microalgal bacterial biomass for a range of both high value and low value products such as fertiliser algal plastics and fibres or protein rich feed sutherland et al 2018 while the potential for microalgae to detoxify organic and inorganic pollutants has been well documented over the last 30 years only recently has attention been paid to the use of microalgae for bioremediation of the current ecs coupling nutrient removal with ec bioremediation further improves the cost efficiency of microalgal based for wastewater treatment while further protecting the environment through the removal of ecs the potential mechanisms for microalgal bioremediation of ecs by are discussed below 3 microalgal bioadsorption of emerging contaminants bioadsorption by microalgal cells occurs when compounds are either adsorbed to cell wall components or onto organic substances such as extracellular polysaccharides eps that are excreted by the cell into the surrounding environment kaplan 2013 saavedra et al 2018 this passive process is a non metabolic interaction between the contaminant and the negatively charged microalgal cell wall or secretions both collectively termed cell surfaces exhibits some chemical affinity for the positively charged contaminant the ability of an ec to adsorb onto microalgal cell surfaces is dependent on the chemical structure of the ec hydrophobic cationic ecs are actively attracted toward the microalgal cell surface through electrostatic interactions whereas hydrophilic ecs are repelled xiong et al 2017a once at the cell surface the amount of ec that can be adsorbed is determined by the area and chemistry of the cell surface norvill et al 2016 the microalgal cell surfaces contain a range of functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl sulphate and other charged groups which differ in affinity and specificity for various organic and inorganic compounds campbell et al 1997 dÃ¶nmez et al 1999 hansda kumar 2016 bioadsorption includes a number of chemical processes at the cell surface that may include adsorption reactions ion exchange reactions with functional groups on the microalgal surface surface complexation reactions chelation and micro precipitation dÃ¶nmez et al 1999 schmitt et al 2001 the rate or thermodynamics of the adsorption process is determined by the physico chemical properties of the immediate environment including temperature redox and ph microalgal bioadsorption technologies have been well document in scientific literature over the last decade with the main focus being on heavy metal removal e g ibuot et al 2019 however with an increasing awareness of ecs there has been an increase in the number of published studies on bioadsorption of ecs by microalgae with 27 of studies featured in table 1 showing adsorption to be at least partially involved in the treatment of 16 ecs where removal mechanisms had been identified however reported rates for adsorption of ecs have been variable with adsorption rates reported to be from 0 to 100 for example de wilt et al 2016 found that adsorption rates for six pharmaceutical drugs onto the cell surface of the green microalga chlorella sorokiniana were 20 similarly peng et al 2014a reported approximately 10 adsorption rate of the hormones progesterone and norgestrel by scenedesmus obliquus and chlorella pyrenoidosa in contrast ali et al 2018 reported microalgal bioadsorption rate of 91 scenedesmus obliquus for tramadol while guo et al 2016 microalgal bioadsorption rates of 100 chlorella sp chlamydomonas sp mychonastes sp for 7 amino cephalosporanie acid table 1 one explanation for the reported low adsorption rates for those pharmaceuticals studied by peng et al 2014a and de wilt et al 2016 were that the compounds were water soluble or hydrophilic hydrophilic compounds are anionic negatively charged and have low bioadsorption affinity values with microalgal cells due to the cells also being negatively charged in contrast lipophilic pharmaceuticals which are cationic have high bioadsorption affinity values with microalgae for example gojkovic et al 2019 found average microalgal bioadsorption rates 70 for the lipophilic pharmaceuticals biperiden trihexyphenidyl clomipramine and amitriptyline whereas the hydrophilic pharmaceuticals fluconazole trimetoprim codeine carbamazepine oxazepam and tramadol had low 0 20 bioadsorption rates one of the challenges with microalgal bioadsorption is that the process is non selective meaning that in the case where multiple contaminants are present binding sites may become saturated with non target contaminants that may also present in the wastewater the presence of other contaminants may also interfere with the adsorption rate of the contaminant of concern regardless of the availability of binding sites on the cell wall as bioadsorption is a non metabolic process binding of ecs onto the microalgal surface occurs on both living and non living microalgal cell surfaces because most of the cell receptors for the contaminant remain viable even after the cell has died choi and lee 2015 the use of non living microalgal biomass as a bioadsorption agent has several advantages over living microalgae including the non living microalgae is not subject to any contaminant toxicity limitations with the aid of a suitable desorbing agent the bioadsorbed ec can be desorbed and microalgal biomass can be reused operational costs including the need for growth media are substantially reduced as there is no requirement to maintain viable microalgal cultures mane et al 2011 dixit and singh 2014 regardless of whether living or non living microalgae are used bioadsorption provides a potential treatment option for some hydrophobic cationic ecs however further research is needed to not only identify which ecs would be most suitable for microalgal bioadsorption treatment technologies but also in optimising the bioadsorption process for the contaminant of concern in order to industrialise the process 3 1 microalgal bioadsorption research opportunities opportunities for improving microalgal adsorption technologies for ec bioremediation include bioprospecting for species that have a high affinity for the target ec preferentially adsorbing it onto the cell surface essentially acting as hyper adsorbents or hyper accumulators species belonging to the genera anabaena dolichospermum chlorella cladophora oscillatoria and scenedesmus have already demonstrated hyper accumulators and hyper adsorbents properties with respect to heavy metal adsorption kumar et al 2016 bwapwa et al 2017 and similar properties could potentially exist with these and other microalgal species for a range of ecs enhancement of the physico chemical properties of the immediate adsorption environment such as optimising ph and temperature for the given species and ec of concern or stimulation of eps secretions may help to facilitate hyper adsorbency by the microalgae modification of the microalgal cell surface through either physical e g grinding thermal drying steaming and lyophilisation or chemical e g acid and alkaline conditions pre treatment processes may also be a viable method for enhancing ec bioadsorption by the microalgae ali et al 2018 demonstrated a 70 higher bioadsorption rate with chemically 0 1 n naoh modified microalgal biomass compared to unmodified microalgal biomass for the pharmaceutical drug tramadol increased adsorption rates were a result of chemical modifications of the microalgal cell surfaces that permitted hydrophilic interactions between the hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups of the cell surface and the amino and carbonyl groups in the molecules ali et al 2018 similarly cell surface chemical modification can result in enhanced electrostatic attraction between the ec ions and the cell surface functional groups such as amines carboxyls and hydroxyls by deprotonation which increases the negative charge of the cell surface bilal et al 2018 other mechanisms for enhancing bioadsorption of ecs by microalgae include optimising temperature optimising algal growth conditions and the exposure time as bioadsorption is a thermodynamic process changes in temperature will alter the rate of ec adsorption onto the microalgal cell surface how temperature affects the adsorption rate will depend on whether the process is endothermic or exothermic increased temperature enhances the rate of bioadsorption for endothermic processes but has the opposite effect on exothermic processes increase in temperature decreases biosorption in the case of exothermic sorption processes zeraatkar et al 2016 optimised growth conditions will increase the total numbers of microalgal cells thus increase the total available cell surface area for bioadsorption while optimised exposure time will enhance the total removal rate of the ec and is dependent on both the hydraulic residence time of the body of water and the thickness of the boundary layer surrounding the cell 4 microalgal bio uptake of emerging contaminants during bio uptake the contaminant is transported through the cell wall into the cell where it binds to intracellular proteins and other compounds bo uptake of contaminants into the cell occurs over hours to days and unlike adsorption it only occurs in living microalgal cells microalgal cells can uptake ecs by three major pathways 1 passive diffusion 2 passive facilitated diffusion or 3 energy dependent active uptake across the cell membrane passive diffusion of ecs into the cell does not require any energy exertion from the cell as the ec diffuses through the membrane from a high external concentration to a low internal concentration as the cell membrane is hydrophobic low molecular weight ec that are non polar and lipid soluble material may potentially diffuse through the cell membrane while polar molecules molecules with high molecular weight and ions cannot pass through passively accumulation of the antibiotics triclosan and triclocarban by the filamentous green alga cladophora sp and the anti epileptic drug carbamazepine by the green alga pseudokirchneriella subcapitata are two examples of ecs bio uptake through passive cell membrane diffusion e g coogan et al 2007 vernouillet et al 2010 passive diffusion can also result from changes to the cell membrane permeability as a result of expose to the ec this process is not mediated by the microalgal cell itself but is a result of either depolarisation or hyperpolarisation of the membrane caused by the ec interference with the integrity of the cell membrane by the ec can lead to increased diffusion of the ec or other contaminants present into the cell for example several of the compounds within the ec family perfluorinated alkyl acids pfaas have been shown to increase microalgal cell membrane permeability at concentrations well below that which affected cell viability liu et al 2018 exposure of a cyanobacterium anabaena cpb4337 to the pfaas compounds perfluorooctano sulphonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa resulted in changed sensitivity to several herbicides with some herbicides becoming more toxic and some less toxic to the cell rodea palomares et al 2015 passive facilitated diffusion is the process where ecs diffuse across the cell membrane with the help of transporter proteins whose role is to mediate the influx of polar molecules into the cell the final mechanism is active transport of the ec across the cell membrane which requires the use of energy by the cell often in active transport the compound moves against a concentration gradient although this is not always the case regardless of the mechanism bio uptake affected by the physico chemical environment including temperature and ph the metabolic state or health of the cell and the presence of any metabolic inhibitors wilde and benemann 1993 of ec treatment by microalgae to date bio uptake is the least represented mechanism with only 10 of studies featured in table 1 showing bio uptake to be at least partially involved in the treatment of 6 ecs where removal mechanisms had been identified however several studies have demonstrated uptake as the main removal mechanism for some lipophilic pharmaceuticals by microalgae e g gattullo et al 2012 maes et al 2014 bai and acharya 2016 bio uptake accounted for approximately 23 removal of 17Î¬ ethinylestadiol by the green alga desmodesmus subspicatus maes et al 2014 and approximately 42 removal of triclosan by the green alga nannochloris sp bai and acharya 2016 one of the challenges with bio uptake is that the accumulation of ecs into the microalgal cell may likely result in overproduction of reactive oxygen species which may lead to oxidative damage to biomolecules cellular dysfunction and ultimately cell death zhang et al 2011 this presents a number of challenges when considering bio uptake as a viable bioremediation technology for ecs including but not limited to re release of unbound ecs back into the surrounding media following cell death maintenance of a viable cell culture during bioremediation and efficiency of ec removal it is therefore important to ensure that the ec concentrations are at levels that allow for accumulation within the cell but not interrupt or result in unbalanced cellular redox status in the cell that may result in cell death microalgal bio uptake is best suited for dilute concentrations of ecs where filtering and concentrating of the ecs for other treatment options would be cost prohibitive 4 1 bio uptake research opportunities opportunities for enhancing microalgal bio uptake of ecs include selecting for strains that are both tolerant to anticipated concentrations of the ec of concern and have high uptake rates of that contaminant uptake rates of ecs vary among different species genera and families of microalgae for example gojkovic et al 2019 found that the bio uptake rate of amitriptyline was 32 in coelastrum astroideum 8 in chlorella saccharophyla and 0 for chlorella vulgaris while uptake rate of clomipramine was 100 in c astroideum and 0 for c saccharophyla and c vulgaris see table 1 in addition to determining optimum species the lifecycle stage may also influence the amount of ec that is taken up by the cell lee et al 2019 observed that the highest bio uptake rates of the radionuclide caesium by the green alga haematococcus pluvialis occurred when the cells were in the red cyst stage while the lowest uptake rates occurred in the flagellate stage changes in the number of cellular potassium transporters at the different lifecycle stages is thought to explain the measured differences in the caesium uptake rates by this species lee et al 2019 both the cellular metabolic processes themselves and their rates are influenced by the external and internal physico chemical environments that the cell experiences such as ph and temperature optimisation of those physico chemical parameters that affect both the rate and quantity of contaminant taken up by the cell and or protect the cell from any associated toxicity will most likely enhance contaminant removal rates 5 microalgal biodegradation biodegradation or biotransformation of ecs by microalgae provides one of the most promising technologies for the remediation of contaminants of concern unlike bioadsorption or bio uptake which simply acts as biological filters to concentrate the ec and remove it from the surrounding aqueous solution biodegradation involves the transformation of complex compounds into simpler breakdown molecules through catalytic metabolic degradation biodegradation overcomes any issues associated with either the disposal of ec laden microalgal biomass that is generated during bioadsorption or bio uptake treatment microalgal biodegradation can occur via two principle mechanisms either by metabolic degradation in which the ec serves as the carbon source or electron donor acceptor for the microalga or by co metabolism in which the ec is degraded by enzymes that are catalysing other substrates present tiwari et al 2017 in the case of metabolic degradation some microalgal species can employ mixotrophic growth strategies where both organic carbon and dissolved inorganic carbon are simultaneously assimilated meaning that they can operate both autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolisms co currently the microalgal biodegradation process can occur either intracellularly or extracellularly or a combination of both where initial degradation occurring extracellularly and the breakdown products are further degraded intracellularly tiwari et al 2017 intracellular degradation relies on the bio uptake of the ec by the cell see above while extracellular degradation relies on the excretion of enzymes into the eps to function as an external digestive system the eps can also act as a surfactant and emulsifier to increase the bioavailability of the ecs for subsequent up take by the cell xiong et al 2018a microalgal biodegradation of ecs involves a complex enzymatic process that involves both phase i and phase ii enzyme families phase i of the biodegradation involves cytochrome p450 enzymes which includes monooxygenase dioxygenase hydroxylase carboxylase and decarboxylase enzymes thies et al 1996 pflugmacher and sandermann 1998 in biodegradation the main role of these enzymes is to make a contaminant more hydrophilic through the addition or unmasking of a hydroxyl group through either hydrolysis oxidation or reduction reactions xiong et al 2018a in phase ii enzymes such as gluthathione s transferases catalyse the conjugation of glutathione with a wide group of compounds possessing electrophilic centres resulting in the opening of the epoxide ring to protect against oxidative damage in the cell xiong et al 2018a a large number of enzymes have been reported as having a role in cellular protection deactivation and or degradation of a range of organic compounds that induce cellular stress in microalgae wang et al 2019 these include superoxide dismutase catalase glutamyl trna reductase malate pyruvate dehydrogenase mono di oxygenase pyrophosphatase carboxylase decarboxylase dehydratase alkaline and acid phosphatase transferase and hydrolases elbaz et al 2010 xiong et al 2018a wang et al 2019 several of these enzymes including superoxide dismutase and catalase have shown increased activity in several microalgal species when the cells were exposed to human and veterinary antibiotics aderemi et al 2018 wang et al 2019 microalgal biodegradation of ecs is regarded as being highly complex and the exact role of the multiple enzymes in both the phase i and phase ii enzyme families are not fully understood xiong et al 2018a and both the enzymes involved and their respective roles is likely to differ at least in part between different microalgal species one enzyme thought to play a role in microalgal biodegradation of contaminants is the extracellular glycoprotein laccase ec 1 10 3 2 p diphenol o2 oxidoreductases laccase glycoproteins are multi copper oxidases that catalyse the one electron oxidation of a wide range of substrates such as mono and poly phenols and aromatic amines to radicals which may undergo cross linking or depolymerization reactions thereafter claus 2004 otto and schlosser 2014 while laccase mediated biodegradation of aromatic compounds by fungi and bacteria has been studied intensively the role of laccase in microalgal biodegradation is still in the early stages of investigation otto and schlosser 2014 laccase glycoproteins have been identified as playing a major role in the microalgal mediated biodegradation of both phenol and industrial dyes kÄ±lÄ±Ã§ et al 2011 otto and schlosser 2014 increased secretion and activity of laccase and polyphenol oxidase has been reported in cultures of the cyanobacterium phormidium valderianum during the biodegradation of phenol shashirekha et al 1997 while laccase mediated biodegradation of industrial dyes has been reported in the green alga gonium sp kÄ±lÄ±Ã§ et al 2011 however laccase has also been shown to have no role in microalgal biodegradation of other compounds such as Ï chlorophenol while the enzymes that were responsible had not been determined forootanfar et al 2013 one reason for this is that there is very limited information available with respect to the behaviour of laccase or other enzymes during microalgal mediated biodegradation of ecs and therefore further investigations are required xiong et al 2018a pharmaceuticals and personal care products are some of the more frequently studied contaminants for microalgal biodegradation norvill et al 2016 over the last five years biodegradation of ecs by microalgae has been well reported in the literature with 47 of studies featured in table 1 showing biodegradation to be at least partially involved in the remediation of 28 ec compounds where the removal mechanism had been identified by the authors for example microalgal biodegradation of the hormone progesterone and norgestrel has been successfully demonstrated in the two freshwater microalgae scenedesmus obliquus and chlorella pyrenoidosa peng et al 2014a while hom diaz et al 2015 reported biodegradation of the hormones 17Î² estradiol and 17Î¬ ethinylestradiol by the microalgae selenastrum capricornutum and chlamydomonas reinhardtii peng et al 2014a identified the main reactions involved in the microalgal transformation of the progesterone and norgestrel as being reduction hydrogenation hydroxylation oxidation dehydrogenation and side chain breakdown xiong et al 2017a successfully demonstrated co metabolic removal of ciprofloxacin by the green alga chlamydomonas mexicana under laboratory conditions the electron donating properties of sodium acetate is thought to have enhanced the efficiency of c mexicana s co metabolism of the antibiotic but the exact mechanisms were unknown while the addition of other sources of carbon were either inhibitory or had no effect suggesting limited or no mixotrophic metabolism xiong et al 2017a for the flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa sulfation glucosylation and o methylation and debromination were identified as the main transformation mechanisms utilised by six freshwater green microalgae during tbbpa biodegradation peng et al 2014b other contaminants that have been biodegraded by microalgae include salicylic acid and paracetamol by chlorella sorokiniana escapa et al 2015 the antimicrobial agent triclosan by chlorella pyrenoidosa wang et al 2013 and the chemical bisphenol a by chlamydomonas mexicana and chlorella vulgaris ji et al 2014 one of the challenges associated with screening microalgae for potential biodegradation of ecs is that the enzymes responsible may not be active at the time of screening and the microalga may require a threshold concentration of the ec before the degrading enzymes can be triggered production and maintenance of these enzymes are metabolically expensive to the cell and comes at the cost of growth and reproduction aderemi et al 2018 found that cellular energy budget and growth rates were significantly reduced in the microalga raphidocelis subcapitata following exposure to four different antibiotics the authors concluded that the decreased cellular energy budget was in response to the induction of superoxide dismutase production by the cells following antibiotic exposure pre acclimation of the microalgal strains to sub toxic concentrations the contaminant of concern may be an important initial step required prior to undertaking any biodegradation potential screening studies have shown that microalgae acclimated to contaminants showed enhanced photosynthesis growth rates metabolic functions and or other cellular processes e g osundeko et al 2014 cho et al 2016 it is plausible to suggest that for some microalgae their tolerances increase in response to chronic exposure due to the induction of enzymatic pathways to counteract the toxic effects chen et al 2015 reported that the removal efficiency of the antibiotic cefradine by chlorella pyrenoidosa increased when it was pre exposed to the antibiotic similarly xiong et al 2017b found that the biodegradation of the antibiotic levofloxacin significantly increased when chlorella vulgaris was pre acclimated to the antibiotic both authors reported that the acclimation mechanism included increased xanthophyll pigment production these pigments acts as antioxidants membrane stabilizing agents and protectant against damaging radiation xiong et al 2017b another challenge for biodegradation is that while the breakdown products are often less toxic to aquatic biota or human health this may not always the case for example tadros et al 2000 found that the hydroxylamino intermediates formed during the transformation of tnt 24dnt and 26dnt exerted elevated toxic effects on the microalga selenastrum capricornutum isolation identification and screening for toxicity and fate of the breakdown products is therefore an important step in developing microalgal biodegradation treatment systems 5 1 microalgal assisted bacterial biodegradation microalgae may also play a role in enhancing bacterial biodegradation of ecs in microalgae bacteria coupled treatment systems such as wastewater high rate algal ponds hraps microalgal photosynthesis provides the necessary oxygen a key electron acceptor for aerobic bacterial degradation of the organic compounds which in turn provides the co2 required for microalgal photosynthesis sutherland et al 2015 for example different microalgae bacteria consortium have been used for the degradation of black oil safonova et al 1999 acetonitrile muÃ±oz et al 2005 salicylate guieysse et al 2002 and the detoxification of industrial wastewater safonova et al 2004 where the microalgae provided the oxygen to support aerobic bacteria degradation microalgae can also enhance bacterial mediated degradation of ecs through the release of dissolved organic matter dom which can provide the necessary substrates for bacterial co metabolism of the contaminant although the exact mechanism for enhanced biodegradation is not fully understood for example wolfaardt et al 1994 observed increased removal of the contaminant diclofop methyl by bacteria when grown in the presence of algae or their metabolites similarly matamoros et al 2016 observed enhanced biodegradation of ibuprofen and caffeine in the presence of microalga bacteria consortia than just bacteria alone matamoros et al 2016 postulated that the enhanced biodegradation was a result of microalgae either releasing exudates such as enzymes or oxygen that aided degradation or microalgal uptake of the compounds however microalgae bacteria relationships with respect to ec degradation may not necessarily be beneficial as both are capable of inhibiting each other depending on the species present investigations into the role microalgae play in bacterial mediated biodegradation of contaminants of concern or vice versa are important for developing enhanced treatment systems for effective bioremediation of ecs understanding which exudates released by the microalgae enhance bacterial biodegradation the mechanisms behind this enhancement and the physico chemical conditions that stimulate their release will most likely further increase the degradation rate of a given contaminant or contaminants 5 2 microalgal biodegradation research opportunities for microalgal species with demonstrated biodegradation capacity abilities optimising the physico chemical environment to stimulate degradation of the contaminant of concern is an important first step for the development of this technology research opportunities include enhancing both the enzyme activation and metabolism of the contaminant as well as enhancing growth of the microalga and therefore efficiency of biodegradation further understanding on the role of enzymes produced in the presence of pollutants and their behaviour during degradation or detoxification may offer some insight into the enzymatic pathways for microalgal biodegradation of other ecs understanding these pathways will allow for the development of treatment systems that are operated for optimal enzyme production and therefore maximal biodegradation once ec degrading enzymes have been identified research into how culture conditions can be manipulated to stimulate over production of the enzymes will help to increase the efficiency of microalgal biodegradation of the contaminant of concern for example otto et al 2010 demonstrated that laccase like enzyme activity in the microalgal chlamydomonas moewusii biodegrading phenolic compounds was enhanced with the addition of 20 Î¼m of cuso4 to the culture media whereas 10 Î¼m was not sufficient to further enhance laccase production while 30 Î¼m resulted in acute toxicity to the cell however one of the challenges with optimising conditions that stimulate enzyme production is applicability of a full scale system both cost and downstream environmental consequences need to be taken into consideration in the above example of cuso4 addition for laccase like enzyme production copper concentrations in the discharge would exceed regulatory aquatic environmental guidelines other research opportunities for enhancing microalgal biodegradation of emerging contaminants includes inducing gene expression and genetic transformation inducing elevated production of enzyme activity in the target microalga can be achieved through enhanced gene expression techniques including exposing the cells to high levels of uvc irradiance to induce random mutagenesis or targeted gene editing genetic modification for example the insertion of a fungal or bacterial gene into the microalga may be an effective means of improving biodegrading enzyme production however for many countries the use of genetically modified organisms for bioremediation at full scale is not a viable option at present due to restrictions on their use manamsa et al 2016 6 photodegradation and volatilisation if an ec of concern is not able to be bioremediated by microalgae through either bioadsorption bio uptake or biodegradation microalgae may still play a role in its successful remediation two ec remediation processes that can be further enhanced by either the presence of microalgae or the microalgal treatment system itself are photodegradation and volatilisation photodegradation of an ec can occur by either photolysis or photooxidative degradation of the compound abo et al 2016 photolysis occurs when the contaminant absorbs light directly resulting in the chemical alteration and subsequent degradation of the contaminant while photooxidative degradation involves the degradation of the contaminant through interactions with hydroxyl radicals or other similar oxidants that are formed due either dissolved organic molecules or nitrate reactions with light castro jimÃ©nez and van de meent 2011 abo et al 2016 photodegradation of ecs is dependent on several factors including the physico chemical properties of the contaminant the intensity and wavelength of light exposure and the physico chemical properties of the waterbody while light exposure is fundamental to photodegradation processes light in a microalgal treatment system is highly attenuated as the cells either absorb or scatter the light as it passes through the water column such high light attenuation may have negative impacts on the rate of photodegradation however both the design and operation of the treatment system can be modified to help alleviate some of the light limitation that impedes photodegradation discussed further below photodegradation may also be enhanced in microalgal treatment systems through the increased presence of dissolved organic molecules dom dom is collective term for a range of organic compounds comprising of molecules such as hydrophilic organic acids hemicellulose humic acids and fulvic acids microalgal release dom into the surrounding culture medium and this matter may play a role in enhancing photodegradation through various mechanisms including catabolic processes redox cycling via production of hydroxyl radicals or in inhibiting photo oxidation by competitive reaction with radicals van trump et al 2006 norvill et al 2016 this occurs as a result of the photosensitised transformation of low light absorbing ecs following chemical reaction with the various doms de wilt et al 2016 suggested that indirect photodegradation in the presence of microalgal dissolved organic matter was the possible pathway for the removal of the pharmaceutical drug ibuprofen in a microalgal bioreactor photodegradation of ecs can be successfully coupled with nutrient removal by wastewater treatment microalgal treatment systems for example the photodegradation of several ecs has been successfully demonstrated in wastewater treatment hraps including the pharmaceuticals tetracycline de godos et al 2012 ciprofloxacin hom diaz et al 2017a b and diclofenac villar navarro et al 2018 volatilisation of ecs is the loss of volatile organic compounds from the liquid phase into the atmosphere the process is dependent on both the physico chemical properties of the ec of concern e g henry s law constant as well as the operating conditions of the treatment system for example aeration or agitation rates temperature and atmospheric pressure tran et al 2018 in microalgal based treatment systems high aeration rates provided by the mixing devices e g paddlewheel bubble lift column stirrers coupled with high sunlight and temperatures compared to conventional wastewater treatment systems may help enhance the removal of volatile ecs matamoros et al 2015 found that for hydrophobic volatile compounds such as musk fragrances volatilisation during the summer time operations where both sunlight and temperatures were higher 6 1 photodegradation research opportunities microalgal treatment systems are designed to increase light exposure through the water column including the use of short path lengths such as thin layer cascades and algal turf scrubbers turbulent mixing such as hraps or a combination of them both such as photobioreactors specifically for the purpose of increased microalgal biomass however further research into both the intensity and duration of light exposure for successful photodegradation of the ec of concern is needed for selecting the optimal microalgal treatment system for enhanced photodegradation similarly changes in the operation of the microalgal treatment system that alter the chemical and physical environment such as hydraulic retention time depth mixing speed and frequency co2 augmentation species control and effluent recycling may result in improved conditions for enhanced photodegradation of ec for example hom diaz et al 2017a b observed increased photodegradation of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin in a pilot scale hrap when the hydraulic retention time was reduced from 7 to 3 days further research into how these operational factors impact on photodegradation is needed to develop a cost effective ec remediation system in situations where microalgal mediated dissolved organic matter dom plays a significant role in the photodegradation of ec of concern better understanding of the conditions that stimulate release of this matter in microalgal based treatment systems will allow for enhanced remediation dissolved organic matter is released extracellularly by some microalgae either in response to a physico chemical stress such as nutrient limitation low light or unfavourable temperature or ph bacterial or viral infections or through cell decay while other species may also release dom under optimal growth conditions villacorte et al 2015 better understanding of the role of dom and its production in relation to photodegradation will aide in developing a cost effective treatment system 7 full scale systems much of the research that has been undertaken to date on microalgal bioremediation of ecs has been undertaken within a laboratory setting under batch culture conditions with long hydraulic retention times table 2 one of the challenges with laboratory based batch culture conditions is its translation to full scale systems while low volume point source supply of emerging contaminants such as discharge from industry manufactures or contaminated sites could potentially be treated under batch conditions municipal wastewater treatment plants even at regional and rural scales are unable to be operated under batch culture conditions due to the large volume and daily supply of wastewater influent an algal based treatment system for emerging contaminants for wastewater streams will need to be operated under semi continuous or continuous conditions with a daily inflow and outflow of at least part of the wastewater how this may affect treatment of the ecs is unclear there are two studies that have demonstrated removal of ecs in particular pharmaceutical and pcps from pilot scale wastewater treatment hraps one outdoor and one indoor and one study from a constructed treatment wetland that contained both plants and algae table 2 these systems were operated on a semi continuous culture condition where a proportion of the culture medium was exchanged daily e g 12 5 exchange on an eight day hrt percentage removal rates of the pharmaceuticals diclofenac and salicylic acid were similar in the outdoor hrap and in laboratory based batch cultures despite the sometimes longer hrt in the laboratory cultures tables 1 and 2 further investigations on the removal rates in outdoor hraps with mixed microalgal species over seasonal scales is required to justify microalgal based ec treatment systems 8 other research opportunities one area that is often overlooked in studies assessing microalgae bioremediation of ecs is the potential interactions of multiple ecs on the bioremediation process in most instances municipal and industrial wastewater streams landfill leachate or urban aquatic surface and groundwater environments have multiple ecs in their discharge tran et al 2018 the numbers of known ecs have been reported to range up to 200 individual compounds while the number of potential ecs present but currently not tested for or are newly emerging onto the market is unknown multi contaminants may result in either competition for the binding sites or changes in the stability of the ec ion microalgae interactions pradhan and rai 2001 interference amongst contaminants saavedra et al 2018 or the antagonistic synergistic or additive toxicity of multiple contaminants on the microalgal cell zhang et al 2017 how multi contaminants interact with each other the environment or the microalgae itself highlights the need for undertaking contaminant removal assessments under conditions that are realistic to the environment for which they will be applied different microalgal species most likely have different tolerances bioadsorption or biodegradation properties for each contaminant in situations where there are more than one contaminant of concern requiring bioremediation microalgal treatment systems comprised of a consortia a species that each have their target contaminant would likely offer a more cost effective and efficient means of remediation than a single species treatment system many of the studies on microalgal bioremediation of ec to date have focused on species form the genera chlamydomonas chlorella and scenedesmus of the studies listed in table 1 25 of species listed were from the genus chlorella 25 from scenedesmus desmodesmus and 12 from the genus chlamydomonas table 3 chlorella sorokiniana scenedesmus obliquus and chlorella vulgaris are the most frequently reported species for ec treatment treating 21 20 and 17 ecs respectively table 3 each of these three species has demonstrated bioadsorption biodegradation and bio uptake pathways table 3 as well as often being recorded in wastewater treatment ponds the species listed in table 3 are often regarded as model species for laboratory studies for several reasons including availability established cultures and growth conditions as well as a wealth of information on their genome photosynthetic and metabolic pathways however given the high diversity of phenotypes across both microalgae and cyanobacteria high through put screening programmes that test a wide range of species against chemically diverse contaminants are needed to help fast track the development of microalgal based ec treatment systems 9 conclusions microalgae have demonstrated ability to filter concentrated remove or biotransform a range of emerging contaminants direct treatment options include bioadsorption bio uptake and biodegradation by the microalgal cells while photodegradation and volatilisation can be enhanced in a microalgal treatment system further research is needed to exploit microalgal species for ec bioremediation properties increase bioadsorption enhance biodegrading enzymes and optimising growth conditions when coupled with nutrient removal such as hraps microalgal treatment of ec can be a cost effective viable option for the reduction of contaminant pollution in waterways declaration of interest the authors declare that they have no known

18533,emerging contaminants ecs are primarily synthetic organic chemicals that have a focus of increasing attention due to either increased awareness of their potential risks to humans and aquatic biota or only recently been detected in the aquatic environment or drinking water supplies through improved analytical techniques many ecs have no regulatory standards due to the lack of information on the effects of chronic exposure pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides and flame retardants are some of the most frequently detected ecs in aquatic environments with over 200 individual compounds identified to date current wastewater treatment is ineffective at removing ecs and there is a vital need for the development of efficient cost effective ec treatment systems that can be applied to a range of scales and wastewater types microalgae have demonstrated potential for detoxifying organic and inorganic pollutants with a number of large scale wastewater treatment microalgal technologies already developed there are three main pathways that microalgae can bioremediate ecs bioadsorption bio uptake and biodegradation microalgal bioadsorption occurs when ecs are either adsorbed to cell wall components or onto organic substances excreted by the cells while bio uptake involves the active transport of the contaminant into the cell where it binds to intracellular proteins and other compounds microalgal biodegradation of ecs involves the transformation of complex compounds into simpler breakdown molecules through catalytic metabolic degradation biodegradation provides one of the most promising technologies for the remediation of contaminants of concern as it can transform the contaminant to less toxic compounds rather than act as a biofilter further research is needed to exploit microalgal species for ec bioremediation properties such as increased bioadsorption enhanced biodegrading enzymes and optimised growth conditions when coupled with nutrient removal microalgal treatment of ec can be a cost effective viable option for the reduction of contaminant pollution in waterways graphical abstract image 1 keywords emerging contaminants bioadsorption biodegradation aquatic pollution microalgal treatment systems 1 background water quality management for the protection of aquatic and human health values has traditionally focused on nutrients suspended sediment heavy metals and human pathogens pal et al 2014 however in recent years there have been increasing concerns over the presence of emerging contaminants ec in aquatic environments and their associated risks and impacts to both aquatic ecosystems and human health ecs are primarily synthetic organic chemicals that have while present in the environment for some time only recently been detected due to either improved analytical techniques or increased awareness of their risks escapa et al 2015 ahmed et al 2017 tran et al 2018 ecs are described as substances that either have no current or have emerging and evolving regulatory standards and they could potentially cause deleterious effects to the aquatic environment or humans at environmentally relevant concentrations us epa 2008 most ecs enter waterways via human mediated routes including direct discharge of raw or treated municipal wastewater streams landfill leachate urban and rural surface and groundwater runoff or from industrial waste discharge tran and gin 2017 ali et al 2018 tran et al 2018 municipal wastewater treatment plants have been shown to contribute the most continual and ec rich discharge into the aquatic environment with the number of specific ecs reported in wastewater discharge ranging from 25 to 200 compounds wang et al 2016 tran and gin 2017 villar navarro et al 2018 however these numbers are likely to increase with improved analytical techniques and industrial application of newly created compounds that will become new ecs ecs typically fall into several broad categories including pharmaceuticals personal care products illicit drugs artificial sweeteners pesticides plasticisers and flame retardants petrie et al 2015 norvill et al 2016 tran et al 2018 pharmaceuticals pesticides and personal care products are the most frequently detected ecs in aquatic habitats due to both their high use and high solubility rykowska and wasiak 2015 manamsa et al 2016 bai et al 2018 however both the number and concentration of different ecs present in the waterways is dependent on the socio economic composition of the community contributing to the ec discharges tran et al 2018 while pharmaceuticals and personal care products pcp in aquatic environments are often reported at low concentrations their presence in both aquatic environments and drinking water supplies is of concern for both human and ecosystem health who 2011 rodriguez narvaez et al 2017 types of pharmaceutical and pcp compounds frequently reported in the aquatic environment include human and veterinary antibiotics antimicrobial agents neuroactive drugs hormones painkiller medication sunscreens insect repellents and fragrances norvill et al 2016 xiong et al 2018a concerns regarding these compounds as ecs include the potential effects of endocrine disruptors and hormones on the life stages of aquatic biota as well as the development of antibiotic resistance genes from chronic exposure to antibiotic and antimicrobial agents which can enter food chains and infect humans petrie et al 2015 tran et al 2018 xiong et al 2018a studies have shown that continuous exposure to low sub toxic concentrations of certain pcps has resulted in endocrine developmental and epigenetic disruption to aquatic organisms and direct impact on human health wilkinson et al 2016 ebele et al 2017 pesticides and other agri chemicals are used widely in both urban and rural environments their high application rate high mobility and persistence in soils results in the transport of these ecs into waterways via runoff and percolation loague et al 1990 pal et al 2014 pesticides have been known to negatively impact ecosystem function and biodiversity values as well as bioaccumulation into aquatic organisms disrupting the food chain and posing a potential risk to human health rodriguez narvaez et al 2017 knillmann et al 2018 machado and soares 2018 however for many of the ecs detected in the aquatic environment the lack of ecotoxic and ecological data means that their potential ecological risks are not understood bai et al 2018 many reports cite ec concentrations typically in the nanogram to low micrograms per litre range in wastewater surface water groundwater and drinking water but some contaminants such as the antibiotic ciprofloxacin and per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have been reported as high as milligrams and grams per litre range respectively nakayama et al 2019 kelly and brooks 2018 while ecs are not currently regulated public concern regarding their presence in the environment has led to the development of interim aquatic guidelines for a number of ecs including but not limited to nitrophenols pfas carbamazepine and ibuprofen scher 2011 petrie et al 2015 anzecc 2018 ccme 2018 and priority pollutant lists have been developed by the european union water framework directive and the united states environment protection agency however one of the challenges that regulators waterbody managers and other stakeholders face when considering the impacts of ecs is a scarcity of published information on the effects of long term exposure to these compounds and their metabolites on aquatic biota and human health conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp are not currently designed to sufficiently treat and remove ecs from the influent while partial removal of some ecs from the wastewater occurs through adsorption onto activated sludge guerra et al 2014 relatively high concentrations of ecs still remain in the effluent leaving the wwtp tran and gin 2017 ali et al 2018 furthermore disposal of the ec laden sludge onto land such is common practice for many wwtps may result in ecs percolating into groundwater or surface runoff as the sludge degrades thus resulting in further contamination of new environments a number technologies such as chemical precipitation solvent extraction constructed treatment wetlands electrocoagulation and anaerobic bed reactors have been trialled for the treatment and removal of ecs in wastewater lee et al 2012 lladÃ³ et al 2016 however these methods are often ineffective particularly at dilute concentrations or the construction and operation costs make implementation of some of these options cost prohibitive marchal et al 2013 ali et al 2018 due to the rising number of ecs their persistence in the environment and bioaccumulation in the food web as well as potential adverse ecological and human health effects there is a growing need for cost effective mitigation technologies that can be applied to a range of ecs across a range of industrial scales using microalgae to treat emerging contaminants provides an opportunity to meet the needs of enhanced wastewater treatment here we review the opportunities and challenges for the use of microalgal based technologies for the bioremediation of ecs 2 microalgal bioremediation mechanisms over the last several decades the use of microalgae for the bioremediation of nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and carbon from various wastewater streams has been successfully demonstrated at a range of scales sutherland et al 2018 microalgal based wastewater treatment systems were shown to have lower capital and operational costs provide natural disinfection and be more efficient for remediating nutrient pollution compared to traditional wastewater treatment systems benemann 2008 craggs et al 2012 when coupled with wastewater treatment microalgae have the potential to provide cost effective remediation of ecs another advantage of using microalgae for bioremediation is the ability to recover resources for beneficial re use through biorefinery of the microalgal bacterial biomass for a range of both high value and low value products such as fertiliser algal plastics and fibres or protein rich feed sutherland et al 2018 while the potential for microalgae to detoxify organic and inorganic pollutants has been well documented over the last 30 years only recently has attention been paid to the use of microalgae for bioremediation of the current ecs coupling nutrient removal with ec bioremediation further improves the cost efficiency of microalgal based for wastewater treatment while further protecting the environment through the removal of ecs the potential mechanisms for microalgal bioremediation of ecs by are discussed below 3 microalgal bioadsorption of emerging contaminants bioadsorption by microalgal cells occurs when compounds are either adsorbed to cell wall components or onto organic substances such as extracellular polysaccharides eps that are excreted by the cell into the surrounding environment kaplan 2013 saavedra et al 2018 this passive process is a non metabolic interaction between the contaminant and the negatively charged microalgal cell wall or secretions both collectively termed cell surfaces exhibits some chemical affinity for the positively charged contaminant the ability of an ec to adsorb onto microalgal cell surfaces is dependent on the chemical structure of the ec hydrophobic cationic ecs are actively attracted toward the microalgal cell surface through electrostatic interactions whereas hydrophilic ecs are repelled xiong et al 2017a once at the cell surface the amount of ec that can be adsorbed is determined by the area and chemistry of the cell surface norvill et al 2016 the microalgal cell surfaces contain a range of functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl sulphate and other charged groups which differ in affinity and specificity for various organic and inorganic compounds campbell et al 1997 dÃ¶nmez et al 1999 hansda kumar 2016 bioadsorption includes a number of chemical processes at the cell surface that may include adsorption reactions ion exchange reactions with functional groups on the microalgal surface surface complexation reactions chelation and micro precipitation dÃ¶nmez et al 1999 schmitt et al 2001 the rate or thermodynamics of the adsorption process is determined by the physico chemical properties of the immediate environment including temperature redox and ph microalgal bioadsorption technologies have been well document in scientific literature over the last decade with the main focus being on heavy metal removal e g ibuot et al 2019 however with an increasing awareness of ecs there has been an increase in the number of published studies on bioadsorption of ecs by microalgae with 27 of studies featured in table 1 showing adsorption to be at least partially involved in the treatment of 16 ecs where removal mechanisms had been identified however reported rates for adsorption of ecs have been variable with adsorption rates reported to be from 0 to 100 for example de wilt et al 2016 found that adsorption rates for six pharmaceutical drugs onto the cell surface of the green microalga chlorella sorokiniana were 20 similarly peng et al 2014a reported approximately 10 adsorption rate of the hormones progesterone and norgestrel by scenedesmus obliquus and chlorella pyrenoidosa in contrast ali et al 2018 reported microalgal bioadsorption rate of 91 scenedesmus obliquus for tramadol while guo et al 2016 microalgal bioadsorption rates of 100 chlorella sp chlamydomonas sp mychonastes sp for 7 amino cephalosporanie acid table 1 one explanation for the reported low adsorption rates for those pharmaceuticals studied by peng et al 2014a and de wilt et al 2016 were that the compounds were water soluble or hydrophilic hydrophilic compounds are anionic negatively charged and have low bioadsorption affinity values with microalgal cells due to the cells also being negatively charged in contrast lipophilic pharmaceuticals which are cationic have high bioadsorption affinity values with microalgae for example gojkovic et al 2019 found average microalgal bioadsorption rates 70 for the lipophilic pharmaceuticals biperiden trihexyphenidyl clomipramine and amitriptyline whereas the hydrophilic pharmaceuticals fluconazole trimetoprim codeine carbamazepine oxazepam and tramadol had low 0 20 bioadsorption rates one of the challenges with microalgal bioadsorption is that the process is non selective meaning that in the case where multiple contaminants are present binding sites may become saturated with non target contaminants that may also present in the wastewater the presence of other contaminants may also interfere with the adsorption rate of the contaminant of concern regardless of the availability of binding sites on the cell wall as bioadsorption is a non metabolic process binding of ecs onto the microalgal surface occurs on both living and non living microalgal cell surfaces because most of the cell receptors for the contaminant remain viable even after the cell has died choi and lee 2015 the use of non living microalgal biomass as a bioadsorption agent has several advantages over living microalgae including the non living microalgae is not subject to any contaminant toxicity limitations with the aid of a suitable desorbing agent the bioadsorbed ec can be desorbed and microalgal biomass can be reused operational costs including the need for growth media are substantially reduced as there is no requirement to maintain viable microalgal cultures mane et al 2011 dixit and singh 2014 regardless of whether living or non living microalgae are used bioadsorption provides a potential treatment option for some hydrophobic cationic ecs however further research is needed to not only identify which ecs would be most suitable for microalgal bioadsorption treatment technologies but also in optimising the bioadsorption process for the contaminant of concern in order to industrialise the process 3 1 microalgal bioadsorption research opportunities opportunities for improving microalgal adsorption technologies for ec bioremediation include bioprospecting for species that have a high affinity for the target ec preferentially adsorbing it onto the cell surface essentially acting as hyper adsorbents or hyper accumulators species belonging to the genera anabaena dolichospermum chlorella cladophora oscillatoria and scenedesmus have already demonstrated hyper accumulators and hyper adsorbents properties with respect to heavy metal adsorption kumar et al 2016 bwapwa et al 2017 and similar properties could potentially exist with these and other microalgal species for a range of ecs enhancement of the physico chemical properties of the immediate adsorption environment such as optimising ph and temperature for the given species and ec of concern or stimulation of eps secretions may help to facilitate hyper adsorbency by the microalgae modification of the microalgal cell surface through either physical e g grinding thermal drying steaming and lyophilisation or chemical e g acid and alkaline conditions pre treatment processes may also be a viable method for enhancing ec bioadsorption by the microalgae ali et al 2018 demonstrated a 70 higher bioadsorption rate with chemically 0 1 n naoh modified microalgal biomass compared to unmodified microalgal biomass for the pharmaceutical drug tramadol increased adsorption rates were a result of chemical modifications of the microalgal cell surfaces that permitted hydrophilic interactions between the hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups of the cell surface and the amino and carbonyl groups in the molecules ali et al 2018 similarly cell surface chemical modification can result in enhanced electrostatic attraction between the ec ions and the cell surface functional groups such as amines carboxyls and hydroxyls by deprotonation which increases the negative charge of the cell surface bilal et al 2018 other mechanisms for enhancing bioadsorption of ecs by microalgae include optimising temperature optimising algal growth conditions and the exposure time as bioadsorption is a thermodynamic process changes in temperature will alter the rate of ec adsorption onto the microalgal cell surface how temperature affects the adsorption rate will depend on whether the process is endothermic or exothermic increased temperature enhances the rate of bioadsorption for endothermic processes but has the opposite effect on exothermic processes increase in temperature decreases biosorption in the case of exothermic sorption processes zeraatkar et al 2016 optimised growth conditions will increase the total numbers of microalgal cells thus increase the total available cell surface area for bioadsorption while optimised exposure time will enhance the total removal rate of the ec and is dependent on both the hydraulic residence time of the body of water and the thickness of the boundary layer surrounding the cell 4 microalgal bio uptake of emerging contaminants during bio uptake the contaminant is transported through the cell wall into the cell where it binds to intracellular proteins and other compounds bo uptake of contaminants into the cell occurs over hours to days and unlike adsorption it only occurs in living microalgal cells microalgal cells can uptake ecs by three major pathways 1 passive diffusion 2 passive facilitated diffusion or 3 energy dependent active uptake across the cell membrane passive diffusion of ecs into the cell does not require any energy exertion from the cell as the ec diffuses through the membrane from a high external concentration to a low internal concentration as the cell membrane is hydrophobic low molecular weight ec that are non polar and lipid soluble material may potentially diffuse through the cell membrane while polar molecules molecules with high molecular weight and ions cannot pass through passively accumulation of the antibiotics triclosan and triclocarban by the filamentous green alga cladophora sp and the anti epileptic drug carbamazepine by the green alga pseudokirchneriella subcapitata are two examples of ecs bio uptake through passive cell membrane diffusion e g coogan et al 2007 vernouillet et al 2010 passive diffusion can also result from changes to the cell membrane permeability as a result of expose to the ec this process is not mediated by the microalgal cell itself but is a result of either depolarisation or hyperpolarisation of the membrane caused by the ec interference with the integrity of the cell membrane by the ec can lead to increased diffusion of the ec or other contaminants present into the cell for example several of the compounds within the ec family perfluorinated alkyl acids pfaas have been shown to increase microalgal cell membrane permeability at concentrations well below that which affected cell viability liu et al 2018 exposure of a cyanobacterium anabaena cpb4337 to the pfaas compounds perfluorooctano sulphonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa resulted in changed sensitivity to several herbicides with some herbicides becoming more toxic and some less toxic to the cell rodea palomares et al 2015 passive facilitated diffusion is the process where ecs diffuse across the cell membrane with the help of transporter proteins whose role is to mediate the influx of polar molecules into the cell the final mechanism is active transport of the ec across the cell membrane which requires the use of energy by the cell often in active transport the compound moves against a concentration gradient although this is not always the case regardless of the mechanism bio uptake affected by the physico chemical environment including temperature and ph the metabolic state or health of the cell and the presence of any metabolic inhibitors wilde and benemann 1993 of ec treatment by microalgae to date bio uptake is the least represented mechanism with only 10 of studies featured in table 1 showing bio uptake to be at least partially involved in the treatment of 6 ecs where removal mechanisms had been identified however several studies have demonstrated uptake as the main removal mechanism for some lipophilic pharmaceuticals by microalgae e g gattullo et al 2012 maes et al 2014 bai and acharya 2016 bio uptake accounted for approximately 23 removal of 17Î¬ ethinylestadiol by the green alga desmodesmus subspicatus maes et al 2014 and approximately 42 removal of triclosan by the green alga nannochloris sp bai and acharya 2016 one of the challenges with bio uptake is that the accumulation of ecs into the microalgal cell may likely result in overproduction of reactive oxygen species which may lead to oxidative damage to biomolecules cellular dysfunction and ultimately cell death zhang et al 2011 this presents a number of challenges when considering bio uptake as a viable bioremediation technology for ecs including but not limited to re release of unbound ecs back into the surrounding media following cell death maintenance of a viable cell culture during bioremediation and efficiency of ec removal it is therefore important to ensure that the ec concentrations are at levels that allow for accumulation within the cell but not interrupt or result in unbalanced cellular redox status in the cell that may result in cell death microalgal bio uptake is best suited for dilute concentrations of ecs where filtering and concentrating of the ecs for other treatment options would be cost prohibitive 4 1 bio uptake research opportunities opportunities for enhancing microalgal bio uptake of ecs include selecting for strains that are both tolerant to anticipated concentrations of the ec of concern and have high uptake rates of that contaminant uptake rates of ecs vary among different species genera and families of microalgae for example gojkovic et al 2019 found that the bio uptake rate of amitriptyline was 32 in coelastrum astroideum 8 in chlorella saccharophyla and 0 for chlorella vulgaris while uptake rate of clomipramine was 100 in c astroideum and 0 for c saccharophyla and c vulgaris see table 1 in addition to determining optimum species the lifecycle stage may also influence the amount of ec that is taken up by the cell lee et al 2019 observed that the highest bio uptake rates of the radionuclide caesium by the green alga haematococcus pluvialis occurred when the cells were in the red cyst stage while the lowest uptake rates occurred in the flagellate stage changes in the number of cellular potassium transporters at the different lifecycle stages is thought to explain the measured differences in the caesium uptake rates by this species lee et al 2019 both the cellular metabolic processes themselves and their rates are influenced by the external and internal physico chemical environments that the cell experiences such as ph and temperature optimisation of those physico chemical parameters that affect both the rate and quantity of contaminant taken up by the cell and or protect the cell from any associated toxicity will most likely enhance contaminant removal rates 5 microalgal biodegradation biodegradation or biotransformation of ecs by microalgae provides one of the most promising technologies for the remediation of contaminants of concern unlike bioadsorption or bio uptake which simply acts as biological filters to concentrate the ec and remove it from the surrounding aqueous solution biodegradation involves the transformation of complex compounds into simpler breakdown molecules through catalytic metabolic degradation biodegradation overcomes any issues associated with either the disposal of ec laden microalgal biomass that is generated during bioadsorption or bio uptake treatment microalgal biodegradation can occur via two principle mechanisms either by metabolic degradation in which the ec serves as the carbon source or electron donor acceptor for the microalga or by co metabolism in which the ec is degraded by enzymes that are catalysing other substrates present tiwari et al 2017 in the case of metabolic degradation some microalgal species can employ mixotrophic growth strategies where both organic carbon and dissolved inorganic carbon are simultaneously assimilated meaning that they can operate both autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolisms co currently the microalgal biodegradation process can occur either intracellularly or extracellularly or a combination of both where initial degradation occurring extracellularly and the breakdown products are further degraded intracellularly tiwari et al 2017 intracellular degradation relies on the bio uptake of the ec by the cell see above while extracellular degradation relies on the excretion of enzymes into the eps to function as an external digestive system the eps can also act as a surfactant and emulsifier to increase the bioavailability of the ecs for subsequent up take by the cell xiong et al 2018a microalgal biodegradation of ecs involves a complex enzymatic process that involves both phase i and phase ii enzyme families phase i of the biodegradation involves cytochrome p450 enzymes which includes monooxygenase dioxygenase hydroxylase carboxylase and decarboxylase enzymes thies et al 1996 pflugmacher and sandermann 1998 in biodegradation the main role of these enzymes is to make a contaminant more hydrophilic through the addition or unmasking of a hydroxyl group through either hydrolysis oxidation or reduction reactions xiong et al 2018a in phase ii enzymes such as gluthathione s transferases catalyse the conjugation of glutathione with a wide group of compounds possessing electrophilic centres resulting in the opening of the epoxide ring to protect against oxidative damage in the cell xiong et al 2018a a large number of enzymes have been reported as having a role in cellular protection deactivation and or degradation of a range of organic compounds that induce cellular stress in microalgae wang et al 2019 these include superoxide dismutase catalase glutamyl trna reductase malate pyruvate dehydrogenase mono di oxygenase pyrophosphatase carboxylase decarboxylase dehydratase alkaline and acid phosphatase transferase and hydrolases elbaz et al 2010 xiong et al 2018a wang et al 2019 several of these enzymes including superoxide dismutase and catalase have shown increased activity in several microalgal species when the cells were exposed to human and veterinary antibiotics aderemi et al 2018 wang et al 2019 microalgal biodegradation of ecs is regarded as being highly complex and the exact role of the multiple enzymes in both the phase i and phase ii enzyme families are not fully understood xiong et al 2018a and both the enzymes involved and their respective roles is likely to differ at least in part between different microalgal species one enzyme thought to play a role in microalgal biodegradation of contaminants is the extracellular glycoprotein laccase ec 1 10 3 2 p diphenol o2 oxidoreductases laccase glycoproteins are multi copper oxidases that catalyse the one electron oxidation of a wide range of substrates such as mono and poly phenols and aromatic amines to radicals which may undergo cross linking or depolymerization reactions thereafter claus 2004 otto and schlosser 2014 while laccase mediated biodegradation of aromatic compounds by fungi and bacteria has been studied intensively the role of laccase in microalgal biodegradation is still in the early stages of investigation otto and schlosser 2014 laccase glycoproteins have been identified as playing a major role in the microalgal mediated biodegradation of both phenol and industrial dyes kÄ±lÄ±Ã§ et al 2011 otto and schlosser 2014 increased secretion and activity of laccase and polyphenol oxidase has been reported in cultures of the cyanobacterium phormidium valderianum during the biodegradation of phenol shashirekha et al 1997 while laccase mediated biodegradation of industrial dyes has been reported in the green alga gonium sp kÄ±lÄ±Ã§ et al 2011 however laccase has also been shown to have no role in microalgal biodegradation of other compounds such as Ï chlorophenol while the enzymes that were responsible had not been determined forootanfar et al 2013 one reason for this is that there is very limited information available with respect to the behaviour of laccase or other enzymes during microalgal mediated biodegradation of ecs and therefore further investigations are required xiong et al 2018a pharmaceuticals and personal care products are some of the more frequently studied contaminants for microalgal biodegradation norvill et al 2016 over the last five years biodegradation of ecs by microalgae has been well reported in the literature with 47 of studies featured in table 1 showing biodegradation to be at least partially involved in the remediation of 28 ec compounds where the removal mechanism had been identified by the authors for example microalgal biodegradation of the hormone progesterone and norgestrel has been successfully demonstrated in the two freshwater microalgae scenedesmus obliquus and chlorella pyrenoidosa peng et al 2014a while hom diaz et al 2015 reported biodegradation of the hormones 17Î² estradiol and 17Î¬ ethinylestradiol by the microalgae selenastrum capricornutum and chlamydomonas reinhardtii peng et al 2014a identified the main reactions involved in the microalgal transformation of the progesterone and norgestrel as being reduction hydrogenation hydroxylation oxidation dehydrogenation and side chain breakdown xiong et al 2017a successfully demonstrated co metabolic removal of ciprofloxacin by the green alga chlamydomonas mexicana under laboratory conditions the electron donating properties of sodium acetate is thought to have enhanced the efficiency of c mexicana s co metabolism of the antibiotic but the exact mechanisms were unknown while the addition of other sources of carbon were either inhibitory or had no effect suggesting limited or no mixotrophic metabolism xiong et al 2017a for the flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa sulfation glucosylation and o methylation and debromination were identified as the main transformation mechanisms utilised by six freshwater green microalgae during tbbpa biodegradation peng et al 2014b other contaminants that have been biodegraded by microalgae include salicylic acid and paracetamol by chlorella sorokiniana escapa et al 2015 the antimicrobial agent triclosan by chlorella pyrenoidosa wang et al 2013 and the chemical bisphenol a by chlamydomonas mexicana and chlorella vulgaris ji et al 2014 one of the challenges associated with screening microalgae for potential biodegradation of ecs is that the enzymes responsible may not be active at the time of screening and the microalga may require a threshold concentration of the ec before the degrading enzymes can be triggered production and maintenance of these enzymes are metabolically expensive to the cell and comes at the cost of growth and reproduction aderemi et al 2018 found that cellular energy budget and growth rates were significantly reduced in the microalga raphidocelis subcapitata following exposure to four different antibiotics the authors concluded that the decreased cellular energy budget was in response to the induction of superoxide dismutase production by the cells following antibiotic exposure pre acclimation of the microalgal strains to sub toxic concentrations the contaminant of concern may be an important initial step required prior to undertaking any biodegradation potential screening studies have shown that microalgae acclimated to contaminants showed enhanced photosynthesis growth rates metabolic functions and or other cellular processes e g osundeko et al 2014 cho et al 2016 it is plausible to suggest that for some microalgae their tolerances increase in response to chronic exposure due to the induction of enzymatic pathways to counteract the toxic effects chen et al 2015 reported that the removal efficiency of the antibiotic cefradine by chlorella pyrenoidosa increased when it was pre exposed to the antibiotic similarly xiong et al 2017b found that the biodegradation of the antibiotic levofloxacin significantly increased when chlorella vulgaris was pre acclimated to the antibiotic both authors reported that the acclimation mechanism included increased xanthophyll pigment production these pigments acts as antioxidants membrane stabilizing agents and protectant against damaging radiation xiong et al 2017b another challenge for biodegradation is that while the breakdown products are often less toxic to aquatic biota or human health this may not always the case for example tadros et al 2000 found that the hydroxylamino intermediates formed during the transformation of tnt 24dnt and 26dnt exerted elevated toxic effects on the microalga selenastrum capricornutum isolation identification and screening for toxicity and fate of the breakdown products is therefore an important step in developing microalgal biodegradation treatment systems 5 1 microalgal assisted bacterial biodegradation microalgae may also play a role in enhancing bacterial biodegradation of ecs in microalgae bacteria coupled treatment systems such as wastewater high rate algal ponds hraps microalgal photosynthesis provides the necessary oxygen a key electron acceptor for aerobic bacterial degradation of the organic compounds which in turn provides the co2 required for microalgal photosynthesis sutherland et al 2015 for example different microalgae bacteria consortium have been used for the degradation of black oil safonova et al 1999 acetonitrile muÃ±oz et al 2005 salicylate guieysse et al 2002 and the detoxification of industrial wastewater safonova et al 2004 where the microalgae provided the oxygen to support aerobic bacteria degradation microalgae can also enhance bacterial mediated degradation of ecs through the release of dissolved organic matter dom which can provide the necessary substrates for bacterial co metabolism of the contaminant although the exact mechanism for enhanced biodegradation is not fully understood for example wolfaardt et al 1994 observed increased removal of the contaminant diclofop methyl by bacteria when grown in the presence of algae or their metabolites similarly matamoros et al 2016 observed enhanced biodegradation of ibuprofen and caffeine in the presence of microalga bacteria consortia than just bacteria alone matamoros et al 2016 postulated that the enhanced biodegradation was a result of microalgae either releasing exudates such as enzymes or oxygen that aided degradation or microalgal uptake of the compounds however microalgae bacteria relationships with respect to ec degradation may not necessarily be beneficial as both are capable of inhibiting each other depending on the species present investigations into the role microalgae play in bacterial mediated biodegradation of contaminants of concern or vice versa are important for developing enhanced treatment systems for effective bioremediation of ecs understanding which exudates released by the microalgae enhance bacterial biodegradation the mechanisms behind this enhancement and the physico chemical conditions that stimulate their release will most likely further increase the degradation rate of a given contaminant or contaminants 5 2 microalgal biodegradation research opportunities for microalgal species with demonstrated biodegradation capacity abilities optimising the physico chemical environment to stimulate degradation of the contaminant of concern is an important first step for the development of this technology research opportunities include enhancing both the enzyme activation and metabolism of the contaminant as well as enhancing growth of the microalga and therefore efficiency of biodegradation further understanding on the role of enzymes produced in the presence of pollutants and their behaviour during degradation or detoxification may offer some insight into the enzymatic pathways for microalgal biodegradation of other ecs understanding these pathways will allow for the development of treatment systems that are operated for optimal enzyme production and therefore maximal biodegradation once ec degrading enzymes have been identified research into how culture conditions can be manipulated to stimulate over production of the enzymes will help to increase the efficiency of microalgal biodegradation of the contaminant of concern for example otto et al 2010 demonstrated that laccase like enzyme activity in the microalgal chlamydomonas moewusii biodegrading phenolic compounds was enhanced with the addition of 20 Î¼m of cuso4 to the culture media whereas 10 Î¼m was not sufficient to further enhance laccase production while 30 Î¼m resulted in acute toxicity to the cell however one of the challenges with optimising conditions that stimulate enzyme production is applicability of a full scale system both cost and downstream environmental consequences need to be taken into consideration in the above example of cuso4 addition for laccase like enzyme production copper concentrations in the discharge would exceed regulatory aquatic environmental guidelines other research opportunities for enhancing microalgal biodegradation of emerging contaminants includes inducing gene expression and genetic transformation inducing elevated production of enzyme activity in the target microalga can be achieved through enhanced gene expression techniques including exposing the cells to high levels of uvc irradiance to induce random mutagenesis or targeted gene editing genetic modification for example the insertion of a fungal or bacterial gene into the microalga may be an effective means of improving biodegrading enzyme production however for many countries the use of genetically modified organisms for bioremediation at full scale is not a viable option at present due to restrictions on their use manamsa et al 2016 6 photodegradation and volatilisation if an ec of concern is not able to be bioremediated by microalgae through either bioadsorption bio uptake or biodegradation microalgae may still play a role in its successful remediation two ec remediation processes that can be further enhanced by either the presence of microalgae or the microalgal treatment system itself are photodegradation and volatilisation photodegradation of an ec can occur by either photolysis or photooxidative degradation of the compound abo et al 2016 photolysis occurs when the contaminant absorbs light directly resulting in the chemical alteration and subsequent degradation of the contaminant while photooxidative degradation involves the degradation of the contaminant through interactions with hydroxyl radicals or other similar oxidants that are formed due either dissolved organic molecules or nitrate reactions with light castro jimÃ©nez and van de meent 2011 abo et al 2016 photodegradation of ecs is dependent on several factors including the physico chemical properties of the contaminant the intensity and wavelength of light exposure and the physico chemical properties of the waterbody while light exposure is fundamental to photodegradation processes light in a microalgal treatment system is highly attenuated as the cells either absorb or scatter the light as it passes through the water column such high light attenuation may have negative impacts on the rate of photodegradation however both the design and operation of the treatment system can be modified to help alleviate some of the light limitation that impedes photodegradation discussed further below photodegradation may also be enhanced in microalgal treatment systems through the increased presence of dissolved organic molecules dom dom is collective term for a range of organic compounds comprising of molecules such as hydrophilic organic acids hemicellulose humic acids and fulvic acids microalgal release dom into the surrounding culture medium and this matter may play a role in enhancing photodegradation through various mechanisms including catabolic processes redox cycling via production of hydroxyl radicals or in inhibiting photo oxidation by competitive reaction with radicals van trump et al 2006 norvill et al 2016 this occurs as a result of the photosensitised transformation of low light absorbing ecs following chemical reaction with the various doms de wilt et al 2016 suggested that indirect photodegradation in the presence of microalgal dissolved organic matter was the possible pathway for the removal of the pharmaceutical drug ibuprofen in a microalgal bioreactor photodegradation of ecs can be successfully coupled with nutrient removal by wastewater treatment microalgal treatment systems for example the photodegradation of several ecs has been successfully demonstrated in wastewater treatment hraps including the pharmaceuticals tetracycline de godos et al 2012 ciprofloxacin hom diaz et al 2017a b and diclofenac villar navarro et al 2018 volatilisation of ecs is the loss of volatile organic compounds from the liquid phase into the atmosphere the process is dependent on both the physico chemical properties of the ec of concern e g henry s law constant as well as the operating conditions of the treatment system for example aeration or agitation rates temperature and atmospheric pressure tran et al 2018 in microalgal based treatment systems high aeration rates provided by the mixing devices e g paddlewheel bubble lift column stirrers coupled with high sunlight and temperatures compared to conventional wastewater treatment systems may help enhance the removal of volatile ecs matamoros et al 2015 found that for hydrophobic volatile compounds such as musk fragrances volatilisation during the summer time operations where both sunlight and temperatures were higher 6 1 photodegradation research opportunities microalgal treatment systems are designed to increase light exposure through the water column including the use of short path lengths such as thin layer cascades and algal turf scrubbers turbulent mixing such as hraps or a combination of them both such as photobioreactors specifically for the purpose of increased microalgal biomass however further research into both the intensity and duration of light exposure for successful photodegradation of the ec of concern is needed for selecting the optimal microalgal treatment system for enhanced photodegradation similarly changes in the operation of the microalgal treatment system that alter the chemical and physical environment such as hydraulic retention time depth mixing speed and frequency co2 augmentation species control and effluent recycling may result in improved conditions for enhanced photodegradation of ec for example hom diaz et al 2017a b observed increased photodegradation of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin in a pilot scale hrap when the hydraulic retention time was reduced from 7 to 3 days further research into how these operational factors impact on photodegradation is needed to develop a cost effective ec remediation system in situations where microalgal mediated dissolved organic matter dom plays a significant role in the photodegradation of ec of concern better understanding of the conditions that stimulate release of this matter in microalgal based treatment systems will allow for enhanced remediation dissolved organic matter is released extracellularly by some microalgae either in response to a physico chemical stress such as nutrient limitation low light or unfavourable temperature or ph bacterial or viral infections or through cell decay while other species may also release dom under optimal growth conditions villacorte et al 2015 better understanding of the role of dom and its production in relation to photodegradation will aide in developing a cost effective treatment system 7 full scale systems much of the research that has been undertaken to date on microalgal bioremediation of ecs has been undertaken within a laboratory setting under batch culture conditions with long hydraulic retention times table 2 one of the challenges with laboratory based batch culture conditions is its translation to full scale systems while low volume point source supply of emerging contaminants such as discharge from industry manufactures or contaminated sites could potentially be treated under batch conditions municipal wastewater treatment plants even at regional and rural scales are unable to be operated under batch culture conditions due to the large volume and daily supply of wastewater influent an algal based treatment system for emerging contaminants for wastewater streams will need to be operated under semi continuous or continuous conditions with a daily inflow and outflow of at least part of the wastewater how this may affect treatment of the ecs is unclear there are two studies that have demonstrated removal of ecs in particular pharmaceutical and pcps from pilot scale wastewater treatment hraps one outdoor and one indoor and one study from a constructed treatment wetland that contained both plants and algae table 2 these systems were operated on a semi continuous culture condition where a proportion of the culture medium was exchanged daily e g 12 5 exchange on an eight day hrt percentage removal rates of the pharmaceuticals diclofenac and salicylic acid were similar in the outdoor hrap and in laboratory based batch cultures despite the sometimes longer hrt in the laboratory cultures tables 1 and 2 further investigations on the removal rates in outdoor hraps with mixed microalgal species over seasonal scales is required to justify microalgal based ec treatment systems 8 other research opportunities one area that is often overlooked in studies assessing microalgae bioremediation of ecs is the potential interactions of multiple ecs on the bioremediation process in most instances municipal and industrial wastewater streams landfill leachate or urban aquatic surface and groundwater environments have multiple ecs in their discharge tran et al 2018 the numbers of known ecs have been reported to range up to 200 individual compounds while the number of potential ecs present but currently not tested for or are newly emerging onto the market is unknown multi contaminants may result in either competition for the binding sites or changes in the stability of the ec ion microalgae interactions pradhan and rai 2001 interference amongst contaminants saavedra et al 2018 or the antagonistic synergistic or additive toxicity of multiple contaminants on the microalgal cell zhang et al 2017 how multi contaminants interact with each other the environment or the microalgae itself highlights the need for undertaking contaminant removal assessments under conditions that are realistic to the environment for which they will be applied different microalgal species most likely have different tolerances bioadsorption or biodegradation properties for each contaminant in situations where there are more than one contaminant of concern requiring bioremediation microalgal treatment systems comprised of a consortia a species that each have their target contaminant would likely offer a more cost effective and efficient means of remediation than a single species treatment system many of the studies on microalgal bioremediation of ec to date have focused on species form the genera chlamydomonas chlorella and scenedesmus of the studies listed in table 1 25 of species listed were from the genus chlorella 25 from scenedesmus desmodesmus and 12 from the genus chlamydomonas table 3 chlorella sorokiniana scenedesmus obliquus and chlorella vulgaris are the most frequently reported species for ec treatment treating 21 20 and 17 ecs respectively table 3 each of these three species has demonstrated bioadsorption biodegradation and bio uptake pathways table 3 as well as often being recorded in wastewater treatment ponds the species listed in table 3 are often regarded as model species for laboratory studies for several reasons including availability established cultures and growth conditions as well as a wealth of information on their genome photosynthetic and metabolic pathways however given the high diversity of phenotypes across both microalgae and cyanobacteria high through put screening programmes that test a wide range of species against chemically diverse contaminants are needed to help fast track the development of microalgal based ec treatment systems 9 conclusions microalgae have demonstrated ability to filter concentrated remove or biotransform a range of emerging contaminants direct treatment options include bioadsorption bio uptake and biodegradation by the microalgal cells while photodegradation and volatilisation can be enhanced in a microalgal treatment system further research is needed to exploit microalgal species for ec bioremediation properties increase bioadsorption enhance biodegrading enzymes and optimising growth conditions when coupled with nutrient removal such as hraps microalgal treatment of ec can be a cost effective viable option for the reduction of contaminant pollution in waterways declaration of interest the authors declare that they have no known

18534,advanced oxidation processes aops have been increasingly used for the treatment of source waters and wastewaters aops characteristically produce oxidation byproducts obps from the partial degradation of dissolved organic matter dom and or the transformation of inorganic ions especially halides into highly toxic substances including bromate and halogenated organic obps x obps however despite the enormous health and environmental risks posed by x obps an integral understanding of the complex obp formation mechanisms during aops is lacking which limits the development of safe and effective aop based water treatment schemes the present critical and comprehensive review was intended to fill in this important knowledge gap the study shows contrary to the hitherto prevailing opinion that the direct incorporation of halide atoms x into dom makes an insignificant contribution to the formation of organic x obps the principal halogenating agent is hypohalous acid hypohalite hox xo whose control is therefore critical to the reduction of both organic and inorganic x obps significant generation of x obps has been observed during sulfate radical aops sr aops which arises principally from the oxidizing effects of the unactivated oxidant and or the applied catalytic activator rather than the sulfate radical as is commonly held a high organic carbon x molar ratio 5 an effective non catalytic activator such as uv or fe2 a low oxidant concentration and short treatment time are suggested to limit the accumulation of hox xo and thus the generation of x obps during sr aops at present there are no established techniques to prevent the formation of x obps during uv chlor am ine aops because the maintenance of substantial amounts of active halogen is essential to

obps following oxidative treatment and disinfection li and mitch 2018 miklos et al 2018 richardson and ternes 2018 sillanpÃ¤Ã¤ et al 2018 von gunten 2018 however these reviews and previous studies bond et al 2011 chowdhury et al 2014 kim et al 2015 krasner 2009 matilainen and sillanpÃ¤Ã¤ 2010 plewa and wagner 2015 focused mainly on the dbps generated from conventional chlor am ination in fact some otherwise insightful recent reviews provided substantial assessment of neither dbps nor obps boczkaj and fernandes 2017 gÄgol et al 2018 for miklos et al 2018 as the energy efficiency of aops was their chief focus only a limited evaluation of obps was specified in their recent review the aim of this work is to develop an integrated understanding of the complex mechanisms of obp generation through a critical evaluation of the relevant publications sections 2 3 4 5 and 6 of this work extensively discussed obps generated during ozone h2o2 sulfate radical based uv chlor am ine and ultraviolet radiation aops respectively section 7 was dedicated to the discussion of the mitigation of obps and further research needs and the concluding remarks were reserved for section 8 the literatures on obps generated during electrochemical aops uv h2o2 and uv photocatalytic aops are largely excluded from this study as they have been extensively discussed in recent reviews chaplin 2014 martÃ­nez huitle et al 2015 wang et al 2018 2 obps generated by ozone based aops for several decades ozone o3 has been used extensively for water treatment when radical generation is enhanced through uv irradiation or the prior addition of h2o2 the treatment may be designated an o3 based aop matilainen and sillanpÃ¤Ã¤ 2010 miklos et al 2018 sillanpÃ¤Ã¤ et al 2018 von gunten 2003b 2003a a selection of experimental parameters and results from publications relevant to obp formation from o3 based aop treatment of dom is presented in table 1 2 1 the production of obps by uv o3 aops uv photolysis is known to increase the decomposition of o3 leading to the formation of h2o2 and the enhanced degradation of dom latifoglu and gurol 2003 ratpukdi et al 2010 it is also known that the ozonation of br containing water form bro3 von gunten 2003a as the schematic of the reactions presented in fig 1 indicates the reduction in the o3 level may directly favor the production of lower amounts of bro3 further the rapid reaction between h2o2 predominantly as ho2 even in neutral conditions von gunten and oliveras 1997 and hobr bro also inhibits bro3 formation eq 1 mao et al 2018 von gunten 2003a 1 hobr ho 2 br h 2 o o 2 k 7 6 x 108 m 1 s 1 latifoglu and gurol 2003 demonstrated the accumulation of substantial amounts of h2o2 during uv o3 treatment of dom with higher dom concentrations promoting higher formation of h2o2 hence uv o3 is expected to reduce the formation of bro3 compared to conventional ozonation however the accumulation of h2o2 during uv o3 is associated with the generation of the hydroxyl radical ho the reaction between ho and hobr bro is almost diffusion controlled at 2 â¹ 109 m 1s 1 4 5 109 m 1s 1 von gunten 2003a consequently with respect to ho the uv o3 process may in fact promote the formation of bro3 compared to conventional ozonation indeed zhao et al 2013 reported increased bro3 formation by uv o3 compared to a corresponding o3 treatment however the reduced formation of bro3 by uv o3 compared to o3 was reported by collivignarelli and sorlini 2001 overall it seems the dom and matrix properties and the aop operational parameters determine if uv o3 would increase or decrease bro3 relative to o3 2 2 the production of obps by o3 h2o2 processes the direct addition of h2o2 to decrease the stability of o3 and increase radical generation has been an important aop with advantages of enhanced dom degradation and reduced bro3 formation relative to conventional ozonation yao et al 2018 however demerits such as impaired disinfection increased formation of lmwcs and the reduced removal of certain dbp precursors have also been associated with o3 h2o2 relative to o3 de vera et al 2015 2016 for instance wert et al 2007 observed a suppressed bro3 formation but impaired disinfection effectiveness after adding h2o2 to an ozonation treatment of tertiary wastewater they also reported higher concentrations of aldehydes and carboxylic acids in the o3 h2o2 system compared to the conventional ozonation system in contrast tubic et al 2011 reported no significant difference in the formation of total aldehydes between the o3 and the o3 h2o2 treatments wang et al 2013 noted greater efficacy in bro3 suppression when using equal molar amounts of o3 and h2o2 or higher proportions of the latter this result illustrates the opposing effects of ho and h2o2 in the formation of bro3 as depicted in fig 1 low concentrations of added h2o2 promoted the formation of ho by enhancing o3 decomposition but was insufficient to effectively reduce hobr bro to br meanwhile the promoted generation of ho increased the formation of bro3 at much higher concentrations of h2o2 the increased efficacy of hobr bro reduction and scavenging of ho eq 2 may be enough to retard bro3 formation 2 ho h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o k 2 7 x 107 m 1 s 1 several researchers have considered the impact of the in situ electrochemical generation of h2o2 on pollutant abatement and obps formation during ozonation y li et al 2015 mao et al 2018 yao et al 2019 2018 this procedure called the e peroxone process was designed to reduce bro3 formation during ozonation while increasing ho generation by comparing the concentration of br and bro3 after their e peroxone processes with the initial br concentration mao et al 2018 concluded a negligible formation of organic br obps following von gunten 2003a they explained the observation by positing o3 more competitive reaction with dom compared to the main halogenating bromine species hobr bro which was present at a much lower concentration it is apropos mentioning that von gunten 2003a also suggested the formation of organic br obps due to br generated from ho reaction with br eqs 3 and 4 3 br ho broh k 1 06 x 108 m 1 s 1 k 3 3 x 107 s 1 4 broh h br h 2 o k 1 06 x 108 m 1 s 1 k 1 36 s 1 the negligible presence of organic br obps in the e peroxone processes notwithstanding the expected br formation from ho implies that br reaction with dom did not significantly form organic br obps in order words br reaction with dom was preferentially oxidative rather than additive subsequent discussions in this paper buttress this oxidative preference hypothesis 2 3 the production of obps by o3 tio2 processes heterogeneous catalysis is a promising technique for enhancing the effectiveness of ozonation processes zhang et al 2008b reported the enhanced mineralization of dom by feooh catalyzed ozonation compared to conventional ozonation two other iron based catalysts Î² feooh al2o3 nie et al 2014 and fe al ldh al2o3 nie et al 2015 were shown to improve both dom mineralization and the suppression of bro3 during ozonation the enhancement of o3 decomposition involved a fe ii fe iii redox transformation that simultaneously reconverted generated bro3 to br varying degrees of effectiveness in suppressing bro3 formation during the ozonation of br containing waters have been reported for the following heterogeneous catalysts ceo2 zhang et al 2008a ce mcm 48 li et al 2015 mnox al2o3 nie et al 2013 fe cu mcm 41 chen et al 2018 high silica zsm 5 zhang et al 2011 and perovskite oxides zhang et al 2018b of the various mechanisms advanced to explain the observed inhibition of bro3 some entailed the accumulation of hobr bro chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2008a 2018b while others entailed its removal nie et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 it is likely that processes that accumulate hobr bro may have the disadvantage of increased formation of organic br obps 2 4 the production of obps by other o3 based aops lu et al 2015b showed that while the formation of bro3 reduced at low and high o3 doses during sonolytic o3 aops compared to regular ozonation the reverse was the case for the intermediate o3 dosage 0 05 0 2 lmin 1 these outcomes once again reflect the opposing effects of ho and h2o2 on bro3 formation produced in this case by o3 sonolysis cui et al 2017 reported improved bro3 removal with the addition of the tio2 catalyst to their ultrasonication reactor sonocatalysis due to the enhanced generation of reductive electrons although ferrate vi does slowly oxidize br to hobr bro and thence to bro3 or organic x obps jiang et al 2016 han et al 2013 reported a measurable inhibition of bro3 formation attributable to o3 ferrate vi aop compared to regular ozonation the inhibition was ascribed to fe iii fe ii redox effects and the complementary enhanced formation of h2o2 the formation of obps during o3 based aops as discussed in this study is summarized in fig 2 3 the production of obps by h2o2 based aops aops that employ h2o2 as the primary oxidant include uv h2o2 and the fenton and fenton like processes typically associated with the insignificant formation of x obps wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a uv h2o2 aop has been described as a relatively obps free aops grebel et al 2010 miklos et al 2018 however the substantial formation of x obps has been reported for waters with high cl or br concentrations baycan et al 2007 as further detailed in section 4 2 the x obp formation at high cl concentrations is probably due to hocl clo rather than the direct incorporation of cl into the dom indeed the direct incorporation of cl as suggested by baycan et al 2007 should form more x obps at lower cl concentrations as scavenging of cl by cl is then limited on the contrary more cl obps form at high cl concentrations in which the generation of the halogenating hocl clo is more likely an ample amount of added or generated h2o2 during uv h2o2 or electrochemical aops respectively makes for a particularly effective suppression of hypohalous acid hypohalite hox xo under regular water treatment conditions held et al 1978 lin et al 2016 von gunten 2003a yao et al 2019 the increased formation of lmwcs may be a downside for uv h2o2 processes but this is a common drawback for all aops an extended discussion of lmwcs generation from uv h2o2 and photocatalytic aops may be found in a recent review authored by wang et al 2018 fenton like processes encompass both photo fenton and electro fenton treatments with externally added or in situ generated h2o2 as the primary oxidant the formation of obps in fenton like processes are expected to be analogous to uv h2o2 processes however the higher chemical potential that is readily attained during electro fenton processes and other electrochemical aops may promote the generation of x obps the reader may reference the review by chaplin 2014 for further reading on the subject fig 3 summarizes the formation of obps during h2o2 based aops at low halide concentrations i e systems in which hox xo formation is limited 4 obps generated by sulfate radical based aops the application of the sulfate radical so4 to the degradation of micropollutants in both surface and subsurface environments has greatly expanded over the last two decades so4 is typically generated from the activation of peroxodisulfate pds or peroxomonosulfate pms through the energizing effect of electromagnetic radiations i e uv and heat or via chemical electron transfer ike et al 2018a a larger storage capability longer life of so4 compared to ho the ease of transportation of the solid oxidants and their limited demand for chlorine are but a few of the advantages of sulfate oxidants over h2o2 ike et al 2018 ike et al 2018a xie et al 2015 a selection of experimental parameters and results from publications relevant to obp formation from sulfate radical aops sr aops treating dom is summarized in table 2 4 1 br obp formation fang and shang 2012 reported a complete transformation of br to bro3 with a hobr obr intermediate by so4 generated from the uv activation of pds in the absence of nom when br was spiked into a natural water sample the generation of bro3 was reduced which the authors suggested was due to the formation of organic br obps the following series of reactions have been proposed for the generation of hobr obr from br eqs 5 11 lu et al 2016 5 br so 4 br so 4 2 k 3 5 x 10 9 m 1 s 1 6 br br br 2 k 1 2 x 10 10 m 1 s 1 7 br oh hbro k 1 06 x 10 10 m 1 s 1 8 br 2 br br 2 br k 2 0 x 10 9 m 1 s 1 9 2 br 2 br 2

from so4 reactions with various nom isolates and model compounds in the presence of br the authors noted a marked production of several organic br obps while bro3 remained undetected during sr aops in which so4 was generated from a cufe2o4 pms system the results appear to confirm the view of fang and shang 2012 that organic br obps are generated when dom suppresses bro3 formation it has been shown that cufe2o4 activates pms by a catalytic process involving the recycling of the surface cu ii sites cu ii eq 12 and 13 zhang et al 2013 12 cu ii ho hso 5 cu iii ho so 4 ho 13 cu iii ho hso 5 cu ii ho

br while wang et al 2014 stated that the effect of so4 was the cause of all bromination in their cufe2o4 pms aops the possible oxidation of br as detailed in reaction 14 may have contributed to the formation of br obps the significant production of bro3 and br obps has also been observed under various pds and pms activation scenarios li et al 2015c lu et al 2016 li et al 2015c showed the inverse coupling of bro3 formation and organic br obps generation when so4 was generated by the co2 activation of pms in the presence of both br and varying nom concentrations it was further noted that the co3 oxidation of br facilitated the production of hobr obr eq 15 18 li et al 2015c 15 co 2 hso 5 h co 3 so 4 h 2 o 16 co 3 br co 2 br 17 br br br 2 18 co 3 br 2 co 2 br 2 in the presence of methanol as a radical scavenger bromine accumulated in the co2 pms system but no bro3 was formed li et al 2015c indicating that the oxidation of br to hobr obr by co3 proceeded by a non radical mechanism inner sphere complexation and subsequent electron transfer on the catalyst surface rather than the outer sphere direct electron transfer suggested by eqs 16 and 18 seem to characterize this accumulation better by analogical reasoning the suggested oxidation of br to active bromine in the cufe2o4 pms system may also involve non radical inner sphere electron transfer that yields hobr obr without a br intermediate in a separate study xie et al 2016 demonstrated that in addition to so4 and co3 the unactivated pms in the presence of nom contributed to the oxidation of br and the subsequent production of organic br obps lu et al 2015a conducted a study of the thermal activation of pds in the presence of br and nom operating under conditions conducive for the significant production of so4 ike et al 2018b a sequential transformation of br to hobr obr organic br obps and finally to bro3 after marked dom mineralization was documented similarly lu et al 2016 observed substantial generation of br obps working with a model compound and generating so4 by the heat activation of pds and co2 activation of pms with reference to a uv pms aop wang et al 2017 showed that substantial levels of br obps were formed from humic acid ha solutions while no br obps were generated during a corresponding uv h2o2 aop the authors explained the different outcomes in terms of the accumulation of hobr bro during the uv pms aop but not during the uv h2o2 aop in stark contrast to the reviewed reports which documented significant br obps formation from br during sr aops lutze et al 2014 and liu et al 2018 claimed that in the co presence of dom and br neither bro3 nor br obps was generated to any significant degree by so4 lutze et al 2014 advanced this opinion while interpreting the results of the degradation of micropollutants spiked into raw river water their results showed that while achieving approximately 95 micropollutant degradation no bro3 was formed and no change in the br concentration was observed the authors inferred from these results a minimal production of organic br obps during the sr aop they suggested that the non formation of br obps was caused by the generation of the superoxide anion o2 which has been observed in pds reactions with dom liu et al 2018 and is known to rapidly reduce hobr bro schwarz and bielski 1986 eq 19 23 19 so 4 hc 2 o 4 2 so 4

1 7 x 10 8 m 1 s 1 through a combination of modeling and controlled experiments liu et al 2018 showed that so4 oxidation of oxalate in the presence of br produced neither bro3 nor hobr bro before the compound was significantly mineralized the authors supported the claim that o2 played a role in suppressing the formation of bro3 by reducing hobr bro in addition and perhaps more importantly the bromine radicals br and br2 by oxidizing dom prevented the accumulation of hobr bro and the formation of bro3 eq 24 and 25 24 hc 2 o 4 br co 2 co 2 br h k 5 5 x 10 7 m 1 s 1 25 hc 2 o 4 br 2 co 2 co 2 2 br h k 1 0 x 10 5 m 1 s 1 apparently the experimental data and the accompanying interpretation of lutze et al 2014 and liu et al 2018 are in opposition to the conclusions of the other studies in this subsection regarding the insignificant production in the presence of br of br obps during sr aops a possible reconciliation of these results may revolve around the evolution of hobr bro it has been demonstrated that about 80 of the reactions between hobr bro and nom is oxidative and would therefore not yield br obps criquet et al 2015 further considering the expected production of bromine radicals and the insignificant formation of br obps in the presence of br during uv h2o2 aops wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a it follows that these radicals react predominately by oxidation with labile dom this supposition is supported by the claim that br is nearly as effective as ho in dom mineralization goldstone et al 2002 however it contradicts the common position that both radical and nonradical active bromine may directly and substantially react with nom to produce organic br obps lu et al 2015a xie et al 2016 young et al 2018 liu et al 2018 demonstrated that the transformation of br and br2 to hobr bro is significantly limited due to scavenging by dom when present at an oxalate concentration of 200 Î¼m which is equivalent to 400 Î¼m c or 4 8 mg cl 1 no hobr bro or bro3 in the presence of 20 Î¼m br accumulated after 60 min of uv pds treatment however a rapid increase in the concentrations of both hobr bro and bro3 was observed after 5 min of uv pds oxidation when the oxalate initial concentration was 50 Î¼m or 1 2 mg cl 1 100 Î¼m c similar behavior was exhibited by l tyrosine phenol tert butanol citric acid and methanol which suggests that dissolved organic carbon doc rather than any specific chemical functionality was responsible for the phenomenon with reference to the parameters reported by liu et al 2018 sr aops which quantitatively generate br obps when the doc br molar ratio 5 appear to generate hobr bro via routes that do not involve br and br2 as intermediates such routes include the direct nonradical oxidation of br by the sulfate oxidant lu et al 2016 xie et al 2016 and by the chemical activator or a derivative of the activator e g co2 li et al 2015c ling et al 2018 and cufe2o4 in contrast to the effect of co2 or cufe2o4 net removal of hobr bro is possible via uv activation when considering the following photolytic reactions 26 h o b r h v h o b r k 2 75 10 3 s 1 liu et al 2018 27 hobr bro h v bro 3 k 2 5 x 10 4 s 1 fang and shang 2012 shown in table 3 are some experimental parameters from reviewed studies that might have contributed to the formation of br obps during the sr aops the parameters in a given study which are probably responsible for the formation of br obps are underlined the radical route of hobr bro formation eqs 6 11 is considered important in studies with low doc br molar ratios 5 given the insufficiency of dom radical scavenging the non radical formation of hobr bro are relevant to studies detailing co2 or cufe2o4 activation and that are characterized by high oxidant concentrations and long periods of reaction none of the hobr bro formation routes however are applicable to two studies linked with the non formation of br dbps 4 2 cl obp formation xie et al 2016 noted the absence of organic x obps after an sr aop when cl was the only halide in a nom containing water given the ubiquity of cl in natural and engineered water systems the absence of organic x obps is advantageous particularly as cl

hr aop conformation the dependence of clo3 formation on ph is emphasized in eq 30 32 a decrease in ph would reduce cl transformation to ho increasing the chance of cl transformation into hocl clo and subsequently into clo3 it may be assumed that negligible clo3 may form during sr aop under both typical water treatment conditions ph 6 lutze et al 2015 and in situ chemical oxidation isco in commonly encountered subsurface conditions nasr and zahran 2014 pradesh 2016 shivshankar et al 2014 weishaar et al 2003 but not under optimized co2 pms treatment where a ph of 4 is prescribed ling et al 2018 however a substantial increase in the concentration of cl would indeed shift eq 29 more to the right and thus increase the chance of hocl clo and clo3 formation irrespective of the solution ph baycan et al 2007 the enhanced formation of hocl clo and the active chlorine subsequent chlorination of dom during a uv h2o2 treatment of a high cl concentration solution is perhaps a more valid explanation for the formation of cl obps in such a system than the claim of a direct cl incorporation into dom as proposed by baycan et al 2007 the same is probably true even for the minuscule 0 52 and 0 03 generation of x obps relative to the micropollutant reported by grebel et al 2010 due to uv h2o2 degradation of phenol spiked into seawater 540 mm cl and 0 8 mm br and wastewater 141 mm cl and 0 05 mm br respectively working at a low ph of 4 hou et al 2018 compared the formation of clo3 and hocl ocl by uv pds and co2 pms systems from cl in the co presence of either br nom or nitrate co2 pms was observed to produce higher levels of clo3 and hocl ocl than uv pds due to the importance of co3 in the oxidation of cl to hocl ocl a simplified expression for the formation of active chlorine due to co3 is as follows 40 co 3 cl h 2 o co 2 hocl ocl an important exception was noted at the highest cl concentration tested 1 mm in which the clo3 formation by the uv pds system exceeded the production from the co2 pms system a substantial amount of hocl ocl was generated by the latter under this condition hou et al 2018 explained this observation by assuming higher consumption of so4 by cl and hocl ocl in the co2 pms system this account is not completely satisfactory for two reasons first 1 mm cl was used in both the uv pds and co2 pms systems and second the so4 reaction with hocl ocl should produce more clo3 and not less a recognition of the role of co3 in a co2 pms system may provide a more satisfactory explanation in such a system co3 in addition to co2 may generate reactive radicals as follows ghanbari and moradi 2017 41 co 3 hso 5 so 5 co 2 h co2 possibly consumes so5 to produce more co3 42 co 2 so 4 co 3 so 4 2 higher cl concentrations increase the transformation of co3 into co2 eq 40 thus producing more hocl ocl and suppressing radical formation concurrently a larger proportion of so4 is spent reacting with the regenerated co2 with the overall result that less clo3 is produced the net effect is a relative acceleration in the hocl ocl accrual and a corresponding deceleration in clo3 formation in contrast for the uv pds system although the generation of reactive radicals so4 and ho is not directly affected by the increase in cl concentration such an increase promotes the generation of more hocl ocl which is the rate limiting step in the formation of clo3 hou et al 2018 hence in the uv pds system clo3 formation increases with the cl concentration the formation of obps during the sr aops is summarized in fig 4 5 the production of obps from uv chlor am ine aops the uv chlorine and uv chloramine processes are two recent additions to the suite of aops used for the treatment of source waters and wastewaters jin et al 2011 li et al 2016a one important advantage of these processes is that both chlorine and or chloramine are routinely added into water for primary or secondary disinfection purposes consequently unlike the more conventional uv h2o2 aops the oxidants for uv chlor am ine aops may be present in the water under treatment having been added upstream for instance to mitigate biofouling at the same time uv chlor am ination obviate the additional chlorine demand typically required to quench residual h2o2 after a uv h2o2 aop uv chlor am ine aops are also superior to uv h2o2 in radical production due to the higher combined molar absorption coefficients Îµ 254 nm and quantum yields Ï254 nm of hocl and nh2cl compared to h2o2 chuang et al 2017 for hocl nh2cl and h2o2 the Îµ 254 nm have been given as 62 371 and 18 6 m 1cm 1 and the Ï254 nm as 0 62 0 2 and 0 5 mol einstein respectively chuang et al 2017 the photolysis of free chlorine and monochloramine directly yields the following radicals which in turn produces other daughter radicals eq 43 and 44 chuang et al 2017 fang et al 2014 43 hocl ocl h v ho o cl 44 nh 2 cl h v nh 2 cl the large concentration of hocl ocl and nh2cl and the substantial generation of cl and h2n have raised concerns regarding the possible significant increases in the generation of organic and inorganic x obps from uv chlor am ination since br reacts rapidly with hocl eq 45 deborde and von gunten 2008 the formation of br obps may be important during uv chlorine aops in the presence of br 45 hocl br hobr cl k 1 2 5 3 x 10 3 m 1 s 1 during uv chlor am ination the active halogen present may react directly with dom to form organic x obps while the generated reactive radicals in the presence of substantial amounts of active halogen may result in the formation of halates xo3 criquet et al 2015 deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 presented in table 4 is a selection of experimental parameters and results from publications relevant to the formation of obps during uv chlor am ination and standalone uv treatments zhao et al 2011 found that relative to regular chlorination uv chlorine aop increased the amount of tox formed from the deactivated aromatic compounds benzoic acid and nitrobenzene this effect was attributed to ring activation resulting from hydroxylation more tox however was formed from the activated aromatic compound phenol by conventional chlorination compared to the uv chlorine treatment the implication is that the uv chlorine aop relative to dark chlorination produces more x obps from chlorination resistant dom and less from readily chlorinated dom li et al 2016b observed a greater level of x obp formation from dark chlorination relative to uv chlorination attributing the lower level of organic x obp formation during uv chlorination to dom mineralization and the degradation of x obp intermediates the authors hypothesized the direct involvement of cl in organic x obps formation in contrast wang et al 2015 noted that uv chlorine treatments formed more obps compared to either conventional chlorination or standalone uv irradiation an extensive generation of clo3 by uv chlorination was also observed in a separate study wang et al 2017 reported that the x obps formed after 30 min of oxidation via uv chlorination was approximately twice the amount formed by dark chlorination for the same period the result stems more from the slower reaction of dark chlorination compared to uv chlorination as the longer reaction time that was needed to determine the dbp formation potential dbpfp resulted in similar total organic x obps differences in scale matrix and operational parameters may explain some of the conflicting results from these studies see table 4 for experimental specifics several authors have suggested that the cl generated during uv chlor am ination or during other aops may directly add to the organic precursors to form cl obps baycan et al 2007 chaplin 2014 li et al 2016a b wang et al 2015 young et al 2018 the implication of this hypothesis is a quantitative formation of organic x obps from at least two routes radical and nonradical during uv chlor am ination the validation of this hypothesis requires the greater formation of cl dbpfp from uv chlor am ination compared to uv h2o2 dark chlorination and standalone uv irradiation assuming comparable mineralization however several published results have shown that uv chlor am ine and uv h2o2 aops as well as conventional chlorination and uv irradiation produce roughly the same dbpfp liu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 2017 furthermore as argued in sections 3 and 4 2 cl does not characteristically add onto dom directly to form x obps hence in analogy to the behavior of br as detailed in section 4 1 and adopting the position set forth in fang et al 2014 and grebel et al 2010 it may be affirmed that the reaction of cl with dom yields a set of principally oxidative rather than additive products the formation of obps during uv chlor am ine aops is summarized in fig 5 6 the production of obps from ultraviolet radiation aops ultraviolet radiation aops uv aops are water treatment radical processes initiated and maintained by uv irradiation without the prior addition of a chemical oxidant typically uv aops employ vacuum uv vuv sources or lamps that produce photons with wavelengths of 254 and 185 nm schalk et al 2005 zoschke et al 2014 or light emitting diode led uv sources kheyrandish et al 2018 matafonova and batoev 2018 substantial production of ho at a Ñ 0 3 and hydrogen atom h as well as the hydrated electron eaq Ñ 0 04 is obtainable

with dissolved oxygen as follows 48 h o 2 ho 2 k 1 x 10 10 m 1 s 1 49 e aq o 2 o 2 k 2 x 10 10 m 1 s 1 the commonly touted advantage of uv aops over other aops is that it is chemical free buchanan et al 2005 uv aops are also capable of direct radical generation from dom and certain inorganic ions such as no3 and fe3 without the prior addition of a chemical oxidant frimmel 1994 lyon et al 2012 vione et al 2001 zoschke et al 2014 thomson et al 2004 2002 noted that at significantly high doses both uvc and vuv can effectively mineralize dom the degradation of dom by vuc and vuv is accompanied by the formation of lmwcs and in the presence of no3 no2 is also formed thomson et al 2004 zoschke et al 2012 as no3 is widespread in natural and engineered water systems no2 and other nitrating agents such as no2 may form substantially during uv aops shah et al 2011 thomson et al 2004 vione et al 2001 zoschke et al 2014 eq 50 52 50 no 3 h v no 2 o 51 o h 2 o ho ho 52 2 no 2 h 2 o no 2 no 3 2

demonstrated the reduction of no2 concentration to a regulatory acceptable value through the addition or in situ vuv generation of o3 the vuv generation of o3 from o2 in the presence of a molecule m

the presence of no3 is summarized in fig 6 7 mitigating obps and recommended future studies the formation of lmwcs necessarily follows the degradation of dom although extensive mineralization can result in a substantial reduction of lmwcs the energy intensive nature of the process prevents its practical use ike et al 2018 toor and mohseni 2007 it has been demonstrated that so4 due to its greater selectivity and superior decarboxylation capability may achieve more effective mineralization of dom than the less selective ho and cl madhavan et al 2019 varanasi et al 2018 however the significant transformation of so4 into cl and ho in the presence of cl nullifies this unique advantage lutze et al 2015 consequently the most effective and practical solution for the reduction of lmwcs post aops entails the adoption of biofiltration chen et al 2009 de vera et al 2016 toor and mohseni 2007 von gunten 2003a the suppression of x obps during o3 based aops is practically identical to their inhibition during conventional ozonation such mitigation typically involves either the maintenance of a high h2o2 concentration or the addition of nh3 von gunten 2003a heterogeneous catalytic inhibitors of x obps e g mnox al2o3 and high silica zsm 5 are particularly promising given their efficacy in simultaneously enhancing radical formation during o3 aops while mitigating the formation of hobr obr zhang et al 2011 nie et al 2013 the possible simultaneous reduction of the formation of bro3 and organic br obps using such inhibitors is still undocumented as far as is known to the authors of this review therefore research into the demonstration and optimization of concurrent catalytic promotion of radical generation and inhibition of organic and inorganic x obps during o3 aops is recommended the identified key parameters that determine the formation of organic and inorganic x obps during sr aops are the concentrations of halides x relative to the dom the nature of the oxidant activation and the oxidant concentration and contact times with the water matrix chemical activation high oxidant concentration and long oxidant residence time are all possible factors in the promotion of x obps formation to better understand the mechanisms of these outcomes and the available countermeasures the standard electrode potentials e o for selected redox couples relevant to aops are presented in table 5 swaddle 2017 although the table indicates the favorable electrochemical potential of pds in oxidizing cl br and i the reactions are generally slow at ordinary water treatment conditions ike et al 2018a the same is applicable to pms with an e o of 1 8 v zhang et al 2013 hence a recommended protocol to limit hox xo and mitigate x obps generation from the pds and pms direct oxidation of x entails the use of low concentrations of oxidants and short reaction periods which necessitates efficient oxidant activation also shown in table 5 is the favorable oxidation potential for h2o2 reaction with x however unlike pds which reacts principally as an oxidant ike et al 2018a h2o2 can react effectively as a reductant bancroft and murphy 1934 bray and livingston 1928 1923 as demonstrated by its excellent reduction of hox xo under practical water treatment conditions von gunten 2003a the high positive e o assigned to co3 co2 determines its significant contribution to the oxidation of x and thus x obps formation as previously discussed in the pms cufe2o4 aop the e o of the solid phase cu iii cu ii couple was reported as 2 3 v which is much higher than the corresponding aqueous cu3 cu2 e o of 1 57 v zhang et al 2013 consequently the catalyst will also contribute to the formation of x obps through x oxidation as was earlier proposed in contrast the e o of the fe3 fe2 couple which is lower than the e o of cl and br but not i means that fe3 cannot oxidize cl and br in the same way that it cannot catalytically activate pms zhang et al 2013 as indicated in table 5 nevertheless fe3 fe2 has a favorable electrochemical potential to reduce bro3 as has been demonstrated in practice von gunten 2003a in a brief analysis li et al 2015c observed the insignificant formation of bro3 during pds and pms activation by fe2 fe3 and ag the authors explained the observation by suggesting insufficient radical generation from fe2 and fe3 activation and speculated the precipitation of agbr during the ag activation although a significant degree of radical generation measured by the degradation of organic compounds is possible for both fe2 and fe3 activation of pds under relevant oxidant concentrations and time intervals ike et al 2018a 2018c ike and duke 2018 both systems are less effective when compared to co2 pms anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 nevertheless it is more likely that the fe2 and fe3 non formation of bro3 is related to their lower e o in comparison to cl and br as discussed above assuming the non formation of bro3 which is derived from the non generation of hobr bro as informed by the e o relationships of table 5 fe2 and fe3 may also not form organic br obps during sr aops hence it appears that the low efficacy of the fe3 fe2 catalysis during either pds or pms aops arising from an unfavorable e o results in the desirable inhibition of hox xo and bro3 zhang et al 2013 a thorough investigation of this subject is needed however to either confirm or disprove this hypothesis it is also possible that the ag non formation of bro3 as reported by li et al 2015c relates to its unusual catalytic behavior regarding the activation of pds ike et al 2018a although the ag2 ag couple has the appreciably high e o of 1 98 inexplicably it has failed to efficiently activate pds ike et al 2018a it is likely that its impaired catalysis towards pds as with the fe3 fe2 system is responsible for the non formation of bro3 therefore further study is necessary to elucidate the uncertainties surrounding ag activation of pds and its effect upon the evolution of x obps it has also been demonstrated that bro3 formation during sr aops is significantly suppressed at ph 9 fang and shang 2012 li et al 2015a b c as a consequence of the minimal generation of free bromine fang and shang 2012 this observation has been explained by the scavenging of br by ho which has been expressed as follows fang and shang 2012 liu et al 2018 60 br ho broh k 1 06 x 10 10 m 1 s 1 k 4 2 x 10 6 s 1 61 broh ho br k 3 3 x 10 7 s 1 k 1 1 x 10 10 m 1 s 1 surprisingly studies of the base activation of pds which is commonly adopted in field applications ike et al 2018a and the general effects of high ph on sr aop generation of organic x obps are rather rare indeed in one evaluation of the effect of ph on organic br obps formation a significant but lower generation of tobr at a ph of 9 5 was obtained compared to a neutral ph wang et al 2014 more studies are required to more fully elucidate the generation of obps during the base activation of sr aop especially in terms of conditions relevant to isco applications by means of the appreciably effective reduction of the generated hobr bro to br huang et al 2017 showed that reduced graphene oxide rgo can retard the generation of bro3 in sr aops however as far as is known to the authors of this review the impact of the rgo technique in suppressing the production of organic br obp during sr aops remains unevaluated it should also be noted that the suppression of a particular byproduct may sometimes result in the greater formation of another shah et al 2012 for instance although the addition of nh3 to suppress bro3 does indeed simultaneously reduce the formation of regulated dbps it may increase the formation of highly cytotoxic and genotoxic unregulated or iodinated dbps bond et al 2011 li and mitch 2018 xia et al 2018 yang et al 2015b the condition of treatment may sometimes diminish the efficacy of the inhibition of x obps using certain techniques as an example at the low ph of 4 recommended for optimized co2 activation of pms nh3 was ineffective in preventing the formation of bro3 in that the protonation of nh3 limits the scavenging of hobr ling et al 2018 however the addition of hocl either before or after nh3 to form nh2cl was more effective in the inhibition of bro3 which readily removed hobr by forming nhbrcl especially at low co2 concentrations ling et al 2018 as such more innovative techniques that provide an overall reduction in the formation of x obps during aops are required the characteristic maintenance of a high concentration of hocl makes the mitigation of x obps during the uv chlorine aop a major process challenge although the addition of nh3 may reduce the rate of dom chlorination the formation of a different suit of organic obps especially the highly cytotoxic n dbps may result bond et al 2011 li and mitch 2018 patton et al 2017 plewa and wagner 2015 the uv chloramine aop may generate less amount of inorganic x obps compared to uv chlorine assuming similar reaction pathways to those ascribed to ozonation von gunten 2003a given the relatively nascent research in uv chlor am ine aop more studies are needed to more fully elucidate the mechanisms of obps generation and the options available for its effective mitigation 8 conclusions contrary to the common position in the literature this study has shown that the direct incorporation of x into dom likely makes an insignificant contribution to the observed formation of organic x obps the principal halogenating agent is hox xo which may always be present in solution in the case of uv chlorine aop or is formed from the reaction of x with x when the latter is present at a high concentration relative to the dom in addition for ozone and sr aops the oxidant especially at a high concentration may directly react with x to produce hox xo without a prior formation of x specific to sr aops the use of a catalytic activator introduces an additional route for the possible non radical transformation of x to hox xo other than the o3 aops hox xo is the sole principal intermediate for the generation of inorganic x obps consequently suppressing the accumulation of hox xo during aops is critical for the reduction of both organic and inorganic x obps the accumulation of hox xo is prevented by ample concentrations of h2o2 in h2o2 based aops and some o3 based aops the absence of an effective hox xo reducing agent in sr aops implies that the mitigation of x obp generation is possible only through the inhibition of hox xo such prevention in practice requires operating at a high doc x molar ratio 5 utilizing an effective non catalytic activator such as uv or fe2 and a low oxidant concentration currently there is no established technique to prevent the formation of x obps during uv chlor am ine aops as active halogen is always present it is expected that the findings of this review would advance future research and application of aops declaration of

18534,advanced oxidation processes aops have been increasingly used for the treatment of source waters and wastewaters aops characteristically produce oxidation byproducts obps from the partial degradation of dissolved organic matter dom and or the transformation of inorganic ions especially halides into highly toxic substances including bromate and halogenated organic obps x obps however despite the enormous health and environmental risks posed by x obps an integral understanding of the complex obp formation mechanisms during aops is lacking which limits the development of safe and effective aop based water treatment schemes the present critical and comprehensive review was intended to fill in this important knowledge gap the study shows contrary to the hitherto prevailing opinion that the direct incorporation of halide atoms x into dom makes an insignificant contribution to the formation of organic x obps the principal halogenating agent is hypohalous acid hypohalite hox xo whose control is therefore critical to the reduction of both organic and inorganic x obps significant generation of x obps has been observed during sulfate radical aops sr aops which arises principally from the oxidizing effects of the unactivated oxidant and or the applied catalytic activator rather than the sulfate radical as is commonly held a high organic carbon x molar ratio 5 an effective non catalytic activator such as uv or fe2 a low oxidant concentration and short treatment time are suggested to limit the accumulation of hox xo and thus the generation of x obps during sr aops at present there are no established techniques to prevent the formation of x obps during uv chlor am ine aops because the maintenance of substantial amounts of active halogen is essential to

uv irradiation or the prior addition of h2o2 the treatment may be designated an o3 based aop matilainen and sillanpÃ¤Ã¤ 2010 miklos et al 2018 sillanpÃ¤Ã¤ et al 2018 von gunten 2003b 2003a a selection of experimental parameters and results from publications relevant to obp formation from o3 based aop treatment of dom is presented in table 1 2 1 the production of obps by uv o3 aops uv photolysis is known to increase the decomposition of o3 leading to the formation of h2o2 and the enhanced degradation of dom latifoglu and gurol 2003 ratpukdi et al 2010 it is also known that the ozonation of br containing water form bro3 von gunten 2003a as the schematic of the reactions presented in fig 1 indicates the reduction in the o3 level may directly favor the production of lower amounts of bro3 further the rapid reaction between h2o2 predominantly as ho2 even in neutral conditions von gunten and oliveras 1997 and hobr bro also inhibits bro3 formation eq 1 mao et al 2018 von gunten 2003a 1 hobr ho 2 br h 2 o o 2 k 7 6 x 108 m 1 s 1 latifoglu and gurol 2003 demonstrated the accumulation of substantial amounts of h2o2 during uv o3 treatment of dom with higher dom concentrations promoting higher formation of h2o2 hence uv o3 is expected to reduce the formation of bro3 compared to conventional ozonation however the accumulation of h2o2 during uv o3 is associated with the generation of the hydroxyl radical ho the reaction between ho and hobr bro is almost diffusion controlled at 2 â¹ 109 m 1s 1 4 5 109 m 1s 1 von gunten 2003a consequently with respect to ho the uv o3 process may in fact promote the formation of bro3 compared to conventional ozonation indeed zhao et al 2013 reported increased bro3 formation by uv o3 compared to a corresponding o3 treatment however the reduced formation of bro3 by uv o3 compared to o3 was reported by collivignarelli and sorlini 2001 overall it seems the dom and matrix properties and the aop operational parameters determine if uv o3 would increase or decrease bro3 relative to o3 2 2 the production of obps by o3 h2o2 processes the direct addition of h2o2 to decrease the stability of o3 and increase radical generation has been an important aop with advantages of enhanced dom degradation and reduced bro3 formation relative to conventional ozonation yao et al 2018 however demerits such as impaired disinfection increased formation of lmwcs and the reduced removal of certain dbp precursors have also been associated with o3 h2o2 relative to o3 de vera et al 2015 2016 for instance wert et al 2007 observed a suppressed bro3 formation but impaired disinfection effectiveness after adding h2o2 to an ozonation treatment of tertiary wastewater they also reported higher concentrations of aldehydes and carboxylic acids in the o3 h2o2 system compared to the conventional ozonation system in contrast tubic et al 2011 reported no significant difference in the formation of total aldehydes between the o3 and the o3 h2o2 treatments wang et al 2013 noted greater efficacy in bro3 suppression when using equal molar amounts of o3 and h2o2 or higher proportions of the latter this result illustrates the opposing effects of ho and h2o2 in the formation of bro3 as depicted in fig 1 low concentrations of added h2o2 promoted the formation of ho by enhancing o3 decomposition but was insufficient to effectively reduce hobr bro to br meanwhile the promoted generation of ho increased the formation of bro3 at much higher concentrations of h2o2 the increased efficacy of hobr bro reduction and scavenging of ho eq 2 may be enough to retard bro3 formation 2 ho h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o k 2 7 x 107 m 1 s 1 several researchers have considered the impact of the in situ electrochemical generation of h2o2 on pollutant abatement and obps formation during ozonation y li et al 2015 mao et al 2018 yao et al 2019 2018 this procedure called the e peroxone process was designed to reduce bro3 formation during ozonation while increasing ho generation by comparing the concentration of br and bro3 after their e peroxone processes with the initial br concentration mao et al 2018 concluded a negligible formation of organic br obps following von gunten 2003a they explained the observation by positing o3 more competitive reaction with dom compared to the main halogenating bromine species hobr bro which was present at a much lower concentration it is apropos mentioning that von gunten 2003a also suggested the formation of organic br obps due to br generated from ho reaction with br eqs 3 and 4 3 br ho broh k 1 06 x 108 m 1 s 1 k 3 3 x 107 s 1 4 broh h br h 2 o k 1 06 x 108 m 1 s 1 k 1 36 s 1 the negligible presence of organic br obps in the e peroxone processes notwithstanding the expected br formation from ho implies that br reaction with dom did not significantly form organic br obps in order words br reaction with dom was preferentially oxidative rather than additive subsequent discussions in this paper buttress this oxidative preference hypothesis 2 3 the production of obps by o3 tio2 processes heterogeneous catalysis is a promising technique for enhancing the effectiveness of ozonation processes zhang et al 2008b reported the enhanced mineralization of dom by feooh catalyzed ozonation compared to conventional ozonation two other iron based catalysts Î² feooh al2o3 nie et al 2014 and fe al ldh al2o3 nie et al 2015 were shown to improve both dom mineralization and the suppression of bro3 during ozonation the enhancement of o3 decomposition involved a fe ii fe iii redox transformation that simultaneously reconverted generated bro3 to br varying degrees of effectiveness in suppressing bro3 formation during the ozonation of br containing waters have been reported for the following heterogeneous catalysts ceo2 zhang et al 2008a ce mcm 48 li et al 2015 mnox al2o3 nie et al 2013 fe cu mcm 41 chen et al 2018 high silica zsm 5 zhang et al 2011 and perovskite oxides zhang et al 2018b of the various mechanisms advanced to explain the observed inhibition of bro3 some entailed the accumulation of hobr bro chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2008a 2018b while others entailed its removal nie et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 it is likely that processes that accumulate hobr bro may have the disadvantage of increased formation of organic br obps 2 4 the production of obps by other o3 based aops lu et al 2015b showed that while the formation of bro3 reduced at low and high o3 doses during sonolytic o3 aops compared to regular ozonation the reverse was the case for the intermediate o3 dosage 0 05 0 2 lmin 1 these outcomes once again reflect the opposing effects of ho and h2o2 on bro3 formation produced in this case by o3 sonolysis cui et al 2017 reported improved bro3 removal with the addition of the tio2 catalyst to their ultrasonication reactor sonocatalysis due to the enhanced generation of reductive electrons although ferrate vi does slowly oxidize br to hobr bro and thence to bro3 or organic x obps jiang et al 2016 han et al 2013 reported a measurable inhibition of bro3 formation attributable to o3 ferrate vi aop compared to regular ozonation the inhibition was ascribed to fe iii fe ii redox effects and the complementary enhanced formation of h2o2 the formation of obps during o3 based aops as discussed in this study is summarized in fig 2 3 the production of obps by h2o2 based aops aops that employ h2o2 as the primary oxidant include uv h2o2 and the fenton and fenton like processes typically associated with the insignificant formation of x obps wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a uv h2o2 aop has been described as a relatively obps free aops grebel et al 2010 miklos et al 2018 however the substantial formation of x obps has been reported for waters with high cl or br concentrations baycan et al 2007 as further detailed in section 4 2 the x obp formation at high cl concentrations is probably due to hocl clo rather than the direct incorporation of cl into the dom indeed the direct incorporation of cl as suggested by baycan et al 2007 should form more x obps at lower cl concentrations as scavenging of cl by cl is then limited on the contrary more cl obps form at high cl concentrations in which the generation of the halogenating hocl clo is more likely an ample amount of added or generated h2o2 during uv h2o2 or electrochemical aops respectively makes for a particularly effective suppression of hypohalous acid hypohalite hox xo under regular water treatment conditions held et al 1978 lin et al 2016 von gunten 2003a yao et al 2019 the increased formation of lmwcs may be a downside for uv h2o2 processes but this is a common drawback for all aops an extended discussion of lmwcs generation from uv h2o2 and photocatalytic aops may be found in a recent review authored by wang et al 2018 fenton like processes encompass both photo fenton and electro fenton treatments with externally added or in situ generated h2o2 as the primary oxidant the formation of obps in fenton like processes are expected to be analogous to uv h2o2 processes however the higher chemical potential that is readily attained during electro fenton processes and other electrochemical aops may promote the generation of x obps the reader may reference the review by chaplin 2014 for further reading on the subject fig 3 summarizes the formation of obps during h2o2 based aops at low halide concentrations i e systems in which hox xo formation is limited 4 obps generated by sulfate radical based aops the application of the sulfate radical so4 to the degradation of micropollutants in both surface and subsurface environments has greatly expanded over the last two decades so4 is typically generated from the activation of peroxodisulfate pds or peroxomonosulfate pms through the energizing effect of electromagnetic radiations i e uv and heat or via chemical electron transfer ike et al 2018a a larger storage capability longer life of so4 compared to ho the ease of transportation of the solid oxidants and their limited demand for chlorine are but a few of the advantages of sulfate oxidants over h2o2 ike et al 2018 ike et al 2018a xie et al 2015 a selection of experimental parameters and results from publications relevant to obp formation from sulfate radical aops sr aops treating dom is summarized in table 2 4 1 br obp formation fang and shang 2012 reported a complete transformation of br to bro3 with a hobr obr intermediate by so4 generated from the uv activation of pds in the absence of nom when br was spiked into a natural water sample the generation of bro3 was reduced which the authors suggested was due to the formation of organic br obps the following series of reactions have been proposed for the generation of hobr obr from br eqs 5 11 lu et al 2016 5 br so 4 br so 4 2 k 3 5 x 10 9 m 1 s 1 6 br br br 2 k 1 2 x 10 10 m 1 s 1 7 br oh hbro k 1 06 x 10 10 m 1 s 1 8 br 2 br br 2 br k 2 0 x 10 9 m 1 s 1 9 2 br 2 br 2

from so4 reactions with various nom isolates and model compounds in the presence of br the authors noted a marked production of several organic br obps while bro3 remained undetected during sr aops in which so4 was generated from a cufe2o4 pms system the results appear to confirm the view of fang and shang 2012 that organic br obps are generated when dom suppresses bro3 formation it has been shown that cufe2o4 activates pms by a catalytic process involving the recycling of the surface cu ii sites cu ii eq 12 and 13 zhang et al 2013 12 cu ii ho hso 5 cu iii ho so 4 ho 13 cu iii ho hso 5 cu ii ho

br while wang et al 2014 stated that the effect of so4 was the cause of all bromination in their cufe2o4 pms aops the possible oxidation of br as detailed in reaction 14 may have contributed to the formation of br obps the significant production of bro3 and br obps has also been observed under various pds and pms activation scenarios li et al 2015c lu et al 2016 li et al 2015c showed the inverse coupling of bro3 formation and organic br obps generation when so4 was generated by the co2 activation of pms in the presence of both br and varying nom concentrations it was further noted that the co3 oxidation of br facilitated the production of hobr obr eq 15 18 li et al 2015c 15 co 2 hso 5 h co 3 so 4 h 2 o 16 co 3 br co 2 br 17 br br br 2 18 co 3 br 2 co 2 br 2 in the presence of methanol as a radical scavenger bromine accumulated in the co2 pms system but no bro3 was formed li et al 2015c indicating that the oxidation of br to hobr obr by co3 proceeded by a non radical mechanism inner sphere complexation and subsequent electron transfer on the catalyst surface rather than the outer sphere direct electron transfer suggested by eqs 16 and 18 seem to characterize this accumulation better by analogical reasoning the suggested oxidation of br to active bromine in the cufe2o4 pms system may also involve non radical inner sphere electron transfer that yields hobr obr without a br intermediate in a separate study xie et al 2016 demonstrated that in addition to so4 and co3 the unactivated pms in the presence of nom contributed to the oxidation of br and the subsequent production of organic br obps lu et al 2015a conducted a study of the thermal activation of pds in the presence of br and nom operating under conditions conducive for the significant production of so4 ike et al 2018b a sequential transformation of br to hobr obr organic br obps and finally to bro3 after marked dom mineralization was documented similarly lu et al 2016 observed substantial generation of br obps working with a model compound and generating so4 by the heat activation of pds and co2 activation of pms with reference to a uv pms aop wang et al 2017 showed that substantial levels of br obps were formed from humic acid ha solutions while no br obps were generated during a corresponding uv h2o2 aop the authors explained the different outcomes in terms of the accumulation of hobr bro during the uv pms aop but not during the uv h2o2 aop in stark contrast to the reviewed reports which documented significant br obps formation from br during sr aops lutze et al 2014 and liu et al 2018 claimed that in the co presence of dom and br neither bro3 nor br obps was generated to any significant degree by so4 lutze et al 2014 advanced this opinion while interpreting the results of the degradation of micropollutants spiked into raw river water their results showed that while achieving approximately 95 micropollutant degradation no bro3 was formed and no change in the br concentration was observed the authors inferred from these results a minimal production of organic br obps during the sr aop they suggested that the non formation of br obps was caused by the generation of the superoxide anion o2 which has been observed in pds reactions with dom liu et al 2018 and is known to rapidly reduce hobr bro schwarz and bielski 1986 eq 19 23 19 so 4 hc 2 o 4 2 so 4

1 7 x 10 8 m 1 s 1 through a combination of modeling and controlled experiments liu et al 2018 showed that so4 oxidation of oxalate in the presence of br produced neither bro3 nor hobr bro before the compound was significantly mineralized the authors supported the claim that o2 played a role in suppressing the formation of bro3 by reducing hobr bro in addition and perhaps more importantly the bromine radicals br and br2 by oxidizing dom prevented the accumulation of hobr bro and the formation of bro3 eq 24 and 25 24 hc 2 o 4 br co 2 co 2 br h k 5 5 x 10 7 m 1 s 1 25 hc 2 o 4 br 2 co 2 co 2 2 br h k 1 0 x 10 5 m 1 s 1 apparently the experimental data and the accompanying interpretation of lutze et al 2014 and liu et al 2018 are in opposition to the conclusions of the other studies in this subsection regarding the insignificant production in the presence of br of br obps during sr aops a possible reconciliation of these results may revolve around the evolution of hobr bro it has been demonstrated that about 80 of the reactions between hobr bro and nom is oxidative and would therefore not yield br obps criquet et al 2015 further considering the expected production of bromine radicals and the insignificant formation of br obps in the presence of br during uv h2o2 aops wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a it follows that these radicals react predominately by oxidation with labile dom this supposition is supported by the claim that br is nearly as effective as ho in dom mineralization goldstone et al 2002 however it contradicts the common position that both radical and nonradical active bromine may directly and substantially react with nom to produce organic br obps lu et al 2015a xie et al 2016 young et al 2018 liu et al 2018 demonstrated that the transformation of br and br2 to hobr bro is significantly limited due to scavenging by dom when present at an oxalate concentration of 200 Î¼m which is equivalent to 400 Î¼m c or 4 8 mg cl 1 no hobr bro or bro3 in the presence of 20 Î¼m br accumulated after 60 min of uv pds treatment however a rapid increase in the concentrations of both hobr bro and bro3 was observed after 5 min of uv pds oxidation when the oxalate initial concentration was 50 Î¼m or 1 2 mg cl 1 100 Î¼m c similar behavior was exhibited by l tyrosine phenol tert butanol citric acid and methanol which suggests that dissolved organic carbon doc rather than any specific chemical functionality was responsible for the phenomenon with reference to the parameters reported by liu et al 2018 sr aops which quantitatively generate br obps when the doc br molar ratio 5 appear to generate hobr bro via routes that do not involve br and br2 as intermediates such routes include the direct nonradical oxidation of br by the sulfate oxidant lu et al 2016 xie et al 2016 and by the chemical activator or a derivative of the activator e g co2 li et al 2015c ling et al 2018 and cufe2o4 in contrast to the effect of co2 or cufe2o4 net removal of hobr bro is possible via uv activation when considering the following photolytic reactions 26 h o b r h v h o b r k 2 75 10 3 s 1 liu et al 2018 27 hobr bro h v bro 3 k 2 5 x 10 4 s 1 fang and shang 2012 shown in table 3 are some experimental parameters from reviewed studies that might have contributed to the formation of br obps during the sr aops the parameters in a given study which are probably responsible for the formation of br obps are underlined the radical route of hobr bro formation eqs 6 11 is considered important in studies with low doc br molar ratios 5 given the insufficiency of dom radical scavenging the non radical formation of hobr bro are relevant to studies detailing co2 or cufe2o4 activation and that are characterized by high oxidant concentrations and long periods of reaction none of the hobr bro formation routes however are applicable to two studies linked with the non formation of br dbps 4 2 cl obp formation xie et al 2016 noted the absence of organic x obps after an sr aop when cl was the only halide in a nom containing water given the ubiquity of cl in natural and engineered water systems the absence of organic x obps is advantageous particularly as cl transforms rapidly into cl in the presence of so4 lutze et al 2015 eq 28 28 so 4 cl cl so 4 2 k 2 7 x 10 8 m 1 s 1 k 2 5 x 10 8 m 1 s 1 lutze et al 2015 demonstrated the strong influence of the

hr aop conformation the dependence of clo3 formation on ph is emphasized in eq 30 32 a decrease in ph would reduce cl transformation to ho increasing the chance of cl transformation into hocl clo and subsequently into clo3 it may be assumed that negligible clo3 may form during sr aop under both typical water treatment conditions ph 6 lutze et al 2015 and in situ chemical oxidation isco in commonly encountered subsurface conditions nasr and zahran 2014 pradesh 2016 shivshankar et al 2014 weishaar et al 2003 but not under optimized co2 pms treatment where a ph of 4 is prescribed ling et al 2018 however a substantial increase in the concentration of cl would indeed shift eq 29 more to the right and thus increase the chance of hocl clo and clo3 formation irrespective of the solution ph baycan et al 2007 the enhanced formation of hocl clo and the active chlorine subsequent chlorination of dom during a uv h2o2 treatment of a high cl concentration solution is perhaps a more valid explanation for the formation of cl obps in such a system than the claim of a direct cl incorporation into dom as proposed by baycan et al 2007 the same is probably true even for the minuscule 0 52 and 0 03 generation of x obps relative to the micropollutant reported by grebel et al 2010 due to uv h2o2 degradation of phenol spiked into seawater 540 mm cl and 0 8 mm br and wastewater 141 mm cl and 0 05 mm br respectively working at a low ph of 4 hou et al 2018 compared the formation of clo3 and hocl ocl by uv pds and co2 pms systems from cl in the co presence of either br nom or nitrate co2 pms was observed to produce higher levels of clo3 and hocl ocl than uv pds due to the importance of co3 in the oxidation of cl to hocl ocl a simplified expression for the formation of active chlorine due to co3 is as follows 40 co 3 cl h 2 o co 2 hocl ocl an important exception was noted at the highest cl concentration tested 1 mm in which the clo3 formation by the uv pds system exceeded the production from the co2 pms system a substantial amount of hocl ocl was generated by the latter under this condition hou et al 2018 explained this observation by assuming higher consumption of so4 by cl and hocl ocl in the co2 pms system this account is not completely satisfactory for two reasons first 1 mm cl was used in both the uv pds and co2 pms systems and second the so4 reaction with hocl ocl should produce more clo3 and not less a recognition of the role of co3 in a co2 pms system may provide a more satisfactory explanation in such a system co3 in addition to co2 may generate reactive radicals as follows ghanbari and moradi 2017 41 co 3 hso 5 so 5 co 2 h co2 possibly consumes so5 to produce more co3 42 co 2 so 4 co 3 so 4 2 higher cl concentrations increase the transformation of co3 into co2 eq 40 thus producing more hocl ocl and suppressing radical formation concurrently a larger proportion of so4 is spent reacting with the regenerated co2 with the overall result that less clo3 is produced the net effect is a relative acceleration in the hocl ocl accrual and a corresponding deceleration in clo3 formation in contrast for the uv pds system although the generation of reactive radicals so4 and ho is not directly affected by the increase in cl concentration such an increase promotes the generation of more hocl ocl which is the rate limiting step in the formation of clo3 hou et al 2018 hence in the uv pds system clo3 formation increases with the cl concentration the formation of obps during the sr aops is summarized in fig 4 5 the production of obps from uv chlor am ine aops the uv chlorine and uv chloramine processes are two recent additions to the suite of aops used for the treatment of source waters and wastewaters jin et al 2011 li et al 2016a one important advantage of these processes is that both chlorine and or chloramine are routinely added into water for primary or secondary disinfection purposes consequently unlike the more conventional uv h2o2 aops the oxidants for uv chlor am ine aops may be present in the water under treatment having been added upstream for instance to mitigate biofouling at the same time uv chlor am ination obviate the additional chlorine demand typically required to quench residual h2o2 after a uv h2o2 aop uv chlor am ine aops are also superior to uv h2o2 in radical production due to the higher combined molar absorption coefficients Îµ 254 nm and quantum yields Ï254 nm of hocl and nh2cl compared to h2o2 chuang et al 2017 for hocl nh2cl and h2o2 the Îµ 254 nm have been given as 62 371 and 18 6 m 1cm 1 and the Ï254 nm as 0 62 0 2 and 0 5 mol einstein respectively chuang et al 2017 the photolysis of free chlorine and monochloramine directly yields the following radicals which in turn produces other daughter radicals eq 43 and 44 chuang et al 2017 fang et al 2014 43 hocl ocl h v ho o cl 44 nh 2 cl h v nh 2 cl the large concentration of hocl ocl and nh2cl and the substantial generation of cl and h2n have raised concerns regarding the possible significant increases in the generation of organic and inorganic x obps from uv chlor am ination since br reacts rapidly with hocl eq 45 deborde and von gunten 2008 the formation of br obps may be important during uv chlorine aops in the presence of br 45 hocl br hobr cl k 1 2 5 3 x 10 3 m 1 s 1 during uv chlor am ination the active halogen present may react directly with dom to form organic x obps while the generated reactive radicals in the presence of substantial amounts of active halogen may result in the formation of halates xo3 criquet et al 2015 deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 presented in table 4 is a selection of experimental parameters and results from publications relevant to the formation of obps during uv chlor am ination and standalone uv treatments zhao et al 2011 found that relative to regular chlorination uv chlorine aop increased the amount of tox formed from the deactivated aromatic compounds benzoic acid and nitrobenzene this effect was attributed to ring activation resulting from hydroxylation more tox however was formed from the activated aromatic compound phenol by conventional chlorination compared to the uv chlorine treatment the implication is that the uv chlorine aop relative to dark chlorination produces more x obps from chlorination resistant dom and less from readily chlorinated dom li et al 2016b observed a greater level of x obp formation from dark chlorination relative to uv chlorination attributing the lower level of organic x obp formation during uv chlorination to dom mineralization and the degradation of x obp intermediates the authors hypothesized the direct involvement of cl in organic x obps formation in contrast wang et al 2015 noted that uv chlorine treatments formed more obps compared to either conventional chlorination or standalone uv irradiation an extensive generation of clo3 by uv chlorination was also observed in a separate study wang et al 2017 reported that the x obps formed after 30 min of oxidation via uv chlorination was approximately twice the amount formed by dark chlorination for the same period the result stems more from the slower reaction of dark chlorination compared to uv chlorination as the longer reaction time that was needed to determine the dbp formation potential dbpfp resulted in similar total organic x obps differences in scale matrix and operational parameters may explain some of the conflicting results from these studies see table 4 for experimental specifics several authors have suggested that the cl generated during uv chlor am ination or during other aops may directly add to the organic precursors to form cl obps baycan et al 2007 chaplin 2014 li et al 2016a b wang et al 2015 young et al 2018 the implication of this hypothesis is a quantitative formation of organic x obps from at least two routes radical and nonradical during uv chlor am ination the validation of this hypothesis requires the greater formation of cl dbpfp from uv chlor am ination compared to uv h2o2 dark chlorination and standalone uv irradiation assuming comparable mineralization however several published results have shown that uv chlor am ine and uv h2o2 aops as well as conventional chlorination and uv irradiation produce roughly the same dbpfp liu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 2017 furthermore as argued in sections 3 and 4 2 cl does not characteristically add onto dom directly to form x obps hence in analogy to the behavior of br as detailed in section 4 1 and adopting the position set forth in fang et al 2014 and grebel et al 2010 it may be affirmed that the reaction of cl with dom yields a set of principally oxidative rather than additive products the formation of obps during uv chlor am ine aops is summarized in fig 5 6 the production of obps from ultraviolet radiation aops ultraviolet radiation aops uv aops are water treatment radical processes initiated and maintained by uv irradiation without the prior addition of a chemical oxidant typically uv aops employ vacuum uv vuv sources or lamps that produce photons with wavelengths of 254 and 185 nm schalk et al 2005 zoschke et al 2014 or light emitting diode led uv sources kheyrandish et al 2018 matafonova and batoev 2018 substantial production of ho at a Ñ 0 3 and hydrogen atom h as well as the hydrated electron eaq Ñ 0 04 is obtainable

with dissolved oxygen as follows 48 h o 2 ho 2 k 1 x 10 10 m 1 s 1 49 e aq o 2 o 2 k 2 x 10 10 m 1 s 1 the commonly touted advantage of uv aops over other aops is that it is chemical free buchanan et al 2005 uv aops are also capable of direct radical generation from dom and certain inorganic ions such as no3 and fe3 without the prior addition of a chemical oxidant frimmel 1994 lyon et al 2012 vione et al 2001 zoschke et al 2014 thomson et al 2004 2002 noted that at significantly high doses both uvc and vuv can effectively mineralize dom the degradation of dom by vuc and vuv is accompanied by the formation of lmwcs and in the presence of no3 no2 is also formed thomson et al 2004 zoschke et al 2012 as no3 is widespread in natural and engineered water systems no2 and other nitrating agents such as no2 may form substantially during uv aops shah et al 2011 thomson et al 2004 vione et al 2001 zoschke et al 2014 eq 50 52 50 no 3 h v no 2 o 51 o h 2 o ho ho 52 2 no 2 h 2 o no 2 no 3 2

n dbp lyon et al 2012 reckhow et al 2010 shah et al 2011 more discussion of the formation of n dbps from uv aops may be found in a recent review authored by ike et al 2019 zoschke et al 2012 demonstrated the reduction of no2 concentration to a regulatory acceptable value through the addition or in situ vuv generation of o3 the vuv generation of o3 from o2 in the presence of a molecule m

the presence of no3 is summarized in fig 6 7 mitigating obps and recommended future studies the formation of lmwcs necessarily follows the degradation of dom although extensive mineralization can result in a substantial reduction of lmwcs the energy intensive nature of the process prevents its practical use ike et al 2018 toor and mohseni 2007 it has been demonstrated that so4 due to its greater selectivity and superior decarboxylation capability may achieve more effective mineralization of dom than the less selective ho and cl madhavan et al 2019 varanasi et al 2018 however the significant transformation of so4 into cl and ho in the presence of cl nullifies this unique advantage lutze et al 2015 consequently the most effective and practical solution for the reduction of lmwcs post aops entails the adoption of biofiltration chen et al 2009 de vera et al 2016 toor and mohseni 2007 von gunten 2003a the suppression of x obps during o3 based aops is practically identical to their inhibition during conventional ozonation such mitigation typically involves either the maintenance of a high h2o2 concentration or the addition of nh3 von gunten 2003a heterogeneous catalytic inhibitors of x obps e g mnox al2o3 and high silica zsm 5 are particularly promising given their efficacy in simultaneously enhancing radical formation during o3 aops while mitigating the formation of hobr obr zhang et al 2011 nie et al 2013 the possible simultaneous reduction of the formation of bro3 and organic br obps using such inhibitors is still undocumented as far as is known to the authors of this review therefore research into the demonstration and optimization of concurrent catalytic promotion of radical generation and inhibition of organic and inorganic x obps during o3 aops is recommended the identified key parameters that determine the formation of organic and inorganic x obps during sr aops are the concentrations of halides x relative to the dom the nature of the oxidant activation and the oxidant concentration and contact times with the water matrix chemical activation high oxidant concentration and long oxidant residence time are all possible factors in the promotion of x obps formation to better understand the mechanisms of these outcomes and the available countermeasures the standard electrode potentials e o for selected redox couples relevant to aops are presented in table 5 swaddle 2017 although the table indicates the favorable electrochemical potential of pds in oxidizing cl br and i the reactions are generally slow at ordinary water treatment conditions ike et al 2018a the same is applicable to pms with an e o of 1 8 v zhang et al 2013 hence a recommended protocol to limit hox xo and mitigate x obps generation from the pds and pms direct oxidation of x entails the use of low concentrations of oxidants and short reaction periods which necessitates efficient oxidant activation also shown in table 5 is the favorable oxidation potential for h2o2 reaction with x however unlike pds which reacts principally as an oxidant ike et al 2018a h2o2 can react effectively as a reductant bancroft and murphy 1934 bray and livingston 1928 1923 as demonstrated by its excellent reduction of hox xo under practical water treatment conditions von gunten 2003a the high positive e o assigned to co3 co2 determines its significant contribution to the oxidation of x and thus x obps formation as previously discussed in the pms cufe2o4 aop the e o of the solid phase cu iii cu ii couple was reported as 2 3 v which is much higher than the corresponding aqueous cu3 cu2 e o of 1 57 v zhang et al 2013 consequently the catalyst will also contribute to the formation of x obps through x oxidation as was earlier proposed in contrast the e o of the fe3 fe2 couple which is lower than the e o of cl and br but not i means that fe3 cannot oxidize cl and br in the same way that it cannot catalytically activate pms zhang et al 2013 as indicated in table 5 nevertheless fe3 fe2 has a favorable electrochemical potential to reduce bro3 as has been demonstrated in practice von gunten 2003a in a brief analysis li et al 2015c observed the insignificant formation of bro3 during pds and pms activation by fe2 fe3 and ag the authors explained the observation by suggesting insufficient radical generation from fe2 and fe3 activation and speculated the precipitation of agbr during the ag activation although a significant degree of radical generation measured by the degradation of organic compounds is possible for both fe2 and fe3 activation of pds under relevant oxidant concentrations and time intervals ike et al 2018a 2018c ike and duke 2018 both systems are less effective when compared to co2 pms anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 nevertheless it is more likely that the fe2 and fe3 non formation of bro3 is related to their lower e o in comparison to cl and br as discussed above assuming the non formation of bro3 which is derived from the non generation of hobr bro as informed by the e o relationships of table 5 fe2 and fe3 may also not form organic br obps during sr aops hence it appears that the low efficacy of the fe3 fe2 catalysis during either pds or pms aops arising from an unfavorable e o results in the desirable inhibition of hox xo and bro3 zhang et al 2013 a thorough investigation of this subject is needed however to either confirm or disprove this hypothesis it is also possible that the ag non formation of bro3 as reported by li et al 2015c relates to its unusual catalytic behavior regarding the activation of pds ike et al 2018a although the ag2 ag couple has the appreciably high e o of 1 98 inexplicably it has failed to efficiently activate pds ike et al 2018a it is likely that its impaired catalysis towards pds as with the fe3 fe2 system is responsible for the non formation of bro3 therefore further study is necessary to elucidate the uncertainties surrounding ag activation of pds and its effect upon the evolution of x obps it has also been demonstrated that bro3 formation during sr aops is significantly suppressed at ph 9 fang and shang 2012 li et al 2015a b c as a consequence of the minimal generation of free bromine fang and shang 2012 this observation has been explained by the scavenging of br by ho which has been expressed as follows fang and shang 2012 liu et al 2018 60 br ho broh k 1 06 x 10 10 m 1 s 1 k 4 2 x 10 6 s 1 61 broh ho br k 3 3 x 10 7 s 1 k 1 1 x 10 10 m 1 s 1 surprisingly studies of the base activation of pds which is commonly adopted in field applications ike et al 2018a and the general effects of high ph on sr aop generation of organic x obps are rather rare indeed in one evaluation of the effect of ph on organic br obps formation a significant but lower generation of tobr at a ph of 9 5 was obtained compared to a neutral ph wang et al 2014 more studies are required to more fully elucidate the generation of obps during the base activation of sr aop especially in terms of conditions relevant to isco applications by means of the appreciably effective reduction of the generated hobr bro to br huang et al 2017 showed that reduced graphene oxide rgo can retard the generation of bro3 in sr aops however as far as is known to the authors of this review the impact of the rgo technique in suppressing the production of organic br obp during sr aops remains unevaluated it should also be noted that the suppression of a particular byproduct may sometimes result in the greater formation of another shah et al 2012 for instance although the addition of nh3 to suppress bro3 does indeed simultaneously reduce the formation of regulated dbps it may increase the formation of highly cytotoxic and genotoxic unregulated or iodinated dbps bond et al 2011 li and mitch 2018 xia et al 2018 yang et al 2015b the condition of treatment may sometimes diminish the efficacy of the inhibition of x obps using certain techniques as an example at the low ph of 4 recommended for optimized co2 activation of pms nh3 was ineffective in preventing the formation of bro3 in that the protonation of nh3 limits the scavenging of hobr ling et al 2018 however the addition of hocl either before or after nh3 to form nh2cl was more effective in the inhibition of bro3 which readily removed hobr by forming nhbrcl especially at low co2 concentrations ling et al 2018 as such more innovative techniques that provide an overall reduction in the formation of x obps during aops are required the characteristic maintenance of a high concentration of hocl makes the mitigation of x obps during the uv chlorine aop a major process challenge although the addition of nh3 may reduce the rate of dom chlorination the formation of a different suit of organic obps especially the highly cytotoxic n dbps may result bond et al 2011 li and mitch 2018 patton et al 2017 plewa and wagner 2015 the uv chloramine aop may generate less amount of inorganic x obps compared to uv chlorine assuming similar reaction pathways to those ascribed to ozonation von gunten 2003a given the relatively nascent research in uv chlor am ine aop more studies are needed to more fully elucidate the mechanisms of obps generation and the options available for its effective mitigation 8 conclusions contrary to the common position in the literature this study has shown that the direct incorporation of x into dom likely makes an insignificant contribution to the observed formation of organic x obps the principal halogenating agent is hox xo which may always be present in solution in the case of uv chlorine aop or is formed from the reaction of x with x when the latter is present at a high concentration relative to the dom in addition for ozone and sr aops the oxidant especially at a high concentration may directly react with x to produce hox xo without a prior formation of x specific to sr aops the use of a catalytic activator introduces an additional route for the possible non radical transformation of x to hox xo other than the o3 aops hox xo is the sole principal intermediate for the generation of inorganic x obps consequently suppressing the accumulation of hox xo during aops is critical for the reduction of both organic and inorganic x obps the accumulation of hox xo is prevented by ample concentrations of h2o2 in h2o2 based aops and some o3 based aops the absence of an effective hox xo reducing agent in sr aops implies that the mitigation of x obp generation is possible only through the inhibition of hox xo such prevention in practice requires operating at a high doc x molar ratio 5 utilizing an effective non catalytic activator such as uv or fe2 and a low oxidant concentration currently there is no established technique to prevent the formation of x obps during uv chlor am ine aops as active halogen is always present it is expected that the findings of this review would advance future research and application of aops declaration of
