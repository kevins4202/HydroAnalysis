9505,the increase water demand for irrigation is leading to the use of low quality water resources the combined impact of drought and salinity on olive production sustainability yield quality growth soil salinity and soil water conditions in arid areas has been little investigated this study s purpose was conducted to investigate the effects of the monitoring of saline water irrigation on soil properties and olive trees cv chemlali grown in an arid region of tunisia sfax on the potential yield growth and quality of the resultant virgin olive oil in comparison to rain fed conditions it is also intended to compare olive productive performance during a severe drought with and without irrigation and to assess recovering capacities after long driest period three irrigation levels were considered i full irrigation 100 etc with saline water 7 5 ds m 1 fi ii full irrigation with same amount of water than the fi applied with tap water 2 46 ds m 1 tw and iii rain fed conditions dry the results have showed that irrigation with saline water maintained the soils permeability induced the distribution of salts outside the root zone additionally it has maintained an adequate hydration of the rhizosphere through continuous and efficient leaching of salts to deep horizons after drought period the increase of the yield of rain fed trees indicated 50 of recovery as compared to saline water irrigation with saline water reduced this gap due to drought impact but it was 50 under that tap water while reduction was 15 as a reduction capacity of potential yield hence drought and salt stress alter the olive tree capacity and potential yield in an irreversible way if their severity is very intense as salinity increased there was a desirable sink in measured total phenols and flavonoids levels and a rise of oleic and linoleic acids as compared to rainfed conditions for the triglycerides composition triolein ooo was present in very large quantity in three oils with a high content for fi 23 94 saline water treatment did not affect free acidity peroxide value k232 k270 chlorophyll carotenoids in contrast to rain fed treatment which was decreased olive trees permanently lost less than half of their potential yield during drought without irrigation irrigation with saline water seems to ensure sustainable monitoring olive yield and oil quality keywords olea europaea irrigation saline water drought soil potential production yield quality 1 introduction water scarcity and the current and predicted decrease of water resources in the mediterranean ecosystems are leading to the urgent need to improve water productivity in the arid and semi arid regions ghrab et al 2013 2014 trabelsi et al 2019 climate change is likely to increase of irrigation demand masmoudi et al 2010 trabelsi et al 2019 indeed models estimate an increase of temperature and a reduction of rainfall thus evaporative demand will increase while natural water supply will decrease this will lead to the shift from rainfed to irrigated production systems irrigation is one of the most effective agricultural practices conditioning yield and fruit quality ghrab et al 2014 drip irrigation is fully used for applying water to olive trees due to the drought conditions in mediterranean areas however one can notice the development of intensive orchard using poor water quality abdel latef and chaoxing 2014 trabelsi et al 2019 irrigation with low water quality or rising water tables has different impacts on soils irrigation increases agricultural productivity and affects soil properties and may increase soil fertility but can reduce it as well the most investigated positive effects of soil irrigation are associated to increased soil moisture and the organic matter contents aidarov 1985 oriola 2005 nikolskii gavrilov et al 2014 negative effects of soil irrigation are usually related to using poor quality water salinity sodicity or soil contamination as well as soil erosion salinity is the presence of salt in the land surface in soil or rocks or dissolution in water in our rivers or groundwater saline water is also produced from several industries desalination oil and gas etc and has high concentration of several ions such as na k cl panagopoulos 2021 2022 that may affect the physicochemical property of soil and cause deleterious effect on plant growth and productivity gomez bellot et al 2015 nicolas et al 2018 there are different recommendations for reducing the damages of soil and plant to prevent or reclaim soil salinity and sodicity of irrigated lands aidarov 1985 alguacil del mar et al 2012 nikolskii gavrilov 2014 irrigation affected positively olive trees lavee et al 1990 goldhamer et al 1994 patumi et al 1999 moriana et al 2003 ghrab et al 2013 2014 trabelsi et al 2019 indeed irrigation increases yield and fruit characteristics when climate suffer a lack of water supply during severe drought period trabelsi et al 2019 reported that rain fed conditions led to very low production 5 76 12 4 kg tree as compared to control fi 100 etc with saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 and tap water 100 etc with tap water treatments with a higher production 16 6 75 kg tree for fi and 10 8 6 kg tree for tw irrigation with saline water produced a significant improvement of cumulated yield during nine years from 2003 to 2011 in comparison to rain fed conditions in spite of the low quality of irrigation water 6 7 ds m 1 with 116 and 176 kg tree 1 for rain fed and control full irrigation respectively ghrab et al 2013 2014 full irrigation induced an increase of 48 of cumulative yield in comparison to rain fed conditions melgar et al 2008 however melgar et al 2009 found no differences in annual or cumulated yield due to irrigation with moderate saline water for olive tree under field conditions ghrab et al 2013 2014 reported that after nine years of plantation olive yield and fruit quality were not affected by irrigation with saline water the same trends as the yield also appeared on fresh fruit weight it increased with the water supply and ranged between 0 62 and 1 33 g this is a characteristic of a typical small fruit of cv chemlali irrigation also affected fruit water content rain fed olive trees exhibited lower water content in fresh olive fruits whereas irrigation at different levels induced the highest fruit water content 59 as compared to rain fed conditions 40 4 ghrab et al 2013 2014 irrigation increased fresh weight chartzoulakis et al 1992 conde innamorato et al 2022 volume mesocarp to endocarp ratio chlorophyll content and mesocarp water content it also decreased firmness and sugar content of the fruit goldhamer et al 1994 conde innamorato et al 2022 water stress could decrease the fruit oil content lavee and wodner 1991 conde innamorato et al 2022 or increase it moriana et al 2003 2012 lavee et al 2007 iniesta et al 2009 arbizu milagro et al 2022 ghrab et al 2014 and arbizu milagro et al 2022 reported that fruit oil content decreased with applied irrigation and increased with water stress during the study period moreover free oil acidity k232 k270 and oleic acid increased slightly with irrigation applied as compared to rain fed conditions however the contents of chlorophyll carotenoids and phenols lowered significantly with irrigation and decreased the oil stability as well differing effect of irrigation on triglyceride accumulation and fatty acid composition was obtained by lavee and wodner 1991 conde innamorato et al 2022 and arbizu milagro et al 2022 nevertheless other authors reported that oil content fatty acid composition sugar or acid contents were not affected by irrigation patumi et al 1999 costagli et al 2003 magliulo et al 2003 d andria et al 2004 ghrab et al 2014 caruso et al 2014 moreover polyphenols content could be reduced under water deficit conditions inglese et al 1996 ismail et al 1997 caruso et al 2014 while the results of other field trials indicated a reduction in phenols with increasing amount of applied water patumi et al 1999 stefanoudaki et al 2001 d andria et al 2008 ghrab et al 2014 the irrigation regimes had little or no effect on free acidity peroxide value or fatty acid composition of olive oil stefanoudaki et al 2001 ghrab et al 2014 while the concentrations of phenols were negatively correlated with predawn water potential servili et al 2007 ghrab et al 2013 2014 conde innamorato et al 2022 water resources in tunisia are characterized by problems of quantity and quality the experimentation was conducted in sfax region southern tunisia to evaluate the combined effect of water and salt stresses on olive trees submitted to different regimes and soil properties to the best of our knowledge this was not assessed in arid climate during long drought 11 months defined using spi standardized precipitation index to estimate meteorological drought mckee et al 1993 1995 in field conditions the second novelty of this study is the evaluation of temporary and permanent damages caused to the olive tree productive performance and the relationships between yield fruits characteristics and oil quality due to salinity and water scarcity during severe drought period several authors studied the combined effect of water supply and saline water on olive oil quality dettori et al 1989 patumi et al 2002 ghrab et al 2013 2014 but to the best of our knowledge the assessment of this combined effect under long drought and the efficacy in drought mitigation was not achieved on the other hand pannelli et al 1990 arbizu milagro et al 2022 and conde innamorato et al 2022 stressed that oil quality is strictly dependent on the cultivar environment interaction and more specifically on the nature of fruit ripening besides ghrab et al 2014 and zhang et al 2022 observed that the olive ripening and oil quality seemed to be affected by soil quality and plant nutrition salvador et al 2003 and nieves cirado et al 2004 reported that the chemical composition of virgin olive oil is influenced by genetic and environmental factors i e edaphic characteristics accordingly prolonged drought and salinity conditions would likely affect productive potential in addition to deleterious effects on fruits characteristics oil quality and soil properties this was not assessed before with the application of various treatments rain fed saline water and tap water in same experimentation under an arid climate the aims of this work are therefore to study the issues and impacts of severe drought and salinity on olive production quantitatively and qualitatively with the changes in growing conditions created by the different regimes and to determine some interaction between parameters yield efficiency fruits characteristics and oil quality moreover it focused on the assessment of the impacts of severe water stress in field conditions on olive trees behavior and performance of yield recovery and the efficacy of irrigation with saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 to mitigate it 2 materials and methods 2 1 orchard site and irrigation treatments the experiment was conducted in an orchard at the olive institute in the region of sfax 34 43 n 10

experimental years 2015 2016 2017 from march to november every year 2 2 spi determination standardized precipitation index spi was calculated monthly from october 2015 to january 2017 to estimate meteorological drought mckee et al 1993 1995 spi aims to describe the major events of different types of drought observed in our study table 4 it is calculated by fitting historical precipitation data one of the significant advantages of this index is that it can be calculated for different timescales to monitor meteorological droughts with respect to severity duration onset extent and end actual research was based on the calculation of standardized precipitation index spi on a rainfall time series of 27 years from 1980 to 2017 the main input parameter is the monthly rainfall in mm to provide a more representative month as possible of the variable climatic conditions the spi index is calculated as described by soro et al 2014 spi pi pm s with pi the annual rainfall of the year i pm the average rainfall of the series on the timescale considered s standard deviation of the series on the timescale considered 2 3 physical and chemical analyses of soil samples the study plot is characterized by a deep sandy loamy soil 49 7 sand 7 clay 43 3 silt up to the depth of 140 cm soil water holding capacity was 5 5 field capacity and wilting point of 8 8 and 3 3 respectively ghrab et al 2013 for depths between 140 and 220 cm the texture becomes light sandy loam characterized by a sand content varying between 33 and 48 between 5 and 7 clay and between 45 and 60 silt the soil of the study plot is fairly homogeneous over the entire profile from 0 to 220 cm in depth ghrab et al 2013 as a result any difference that will be observed excludes any influence of the soil factor especially with the absence of fertilization and phytosanitary treatments soil characteristics were determined in 2014 samples were taken from tree root zone using soil auger up to 2 2 m in depth distant 1 m from relative to the drip lines and 2 m from the tree rows for each sampling point 11 samples were obtained at 0 2 m intervals three replications were taken per treatment during a study

fruit pomological and technological analysis 2 6 1 maturity index fruit weight pulp stone ratio and olive water and oil content fruits samples were harvested in december 2015 and 2017 by hand the olive maturity index was determined according to the method proposed by the national institute of agronomical research of spain the procedure consists of distributing a randomly taken sample of 100 healthy olives in eight groups intense green group n 0 yellowish green group n 1 green with reddish spots group n 2 reddish brown group n 3 black with white flesh group n 4 black with 50 purple flesh group n 5 black with 50 purple flesh group n 6 and black with 100 purple flesh group n 7 hermoso et al 2001 the index is expressed as ni ni total number of olives where n is the group number and n is the fruit number in that group hermoso et al 2001 fruit weight was measured in g the stone was then removed pulp and stone were weighed separately in g the ratio pulp stone was determined water content was estimated from the difference between fresh and dry mass and expressed as a percentage of wet weight agar et al 1998 briefly fifty olives from each replicate were transferred into a petri dish weighed and placed in an oven at 105 c until a constant mass was reached that is until all water was removed from the samples to measure dried samples and determine oil content although the oil was extracted from the dried samples the oil content of the olive fruits was calculated per percent of dry weight dw by nuclear magnetic resonance nmr using an oxford analyser oxford analytical instruments ltd oxford uk three samples of 50 olive fruits were used per treatment 2 7 olive oil extraction and oil quality analysis representative olive fruits were handpicked from ten trees of different treatments and brought to the laboratory for oil extraction using oil mill able to handle sample of 2 kg of olives the oil obtained was separated by decantation 2 7 1 oil mechanical extraction process oil extraction was performed using a lab scale system whereby the fruits were crushed by a hammer mill the resulting olive paste malaxed at 25 c for 40 60 min and the oil separated by centrifugation and decantation then the oil samples were filtered transferred into amber glass bottles and stored in the dark at 4 c until analysis servili et al 2 7 2 oil quality indices and photosynthetic pigments contents olive oil was extracted using a laboratory scale olive mill and analytical determinations were focused on oil acidity oleic acid and peroxide index ip meq o2 kg were measured following the analytical method as described in the european regulation 1991 the method is based on an iodometric titration with sodium thiosulphate solution which measures the iodine

test and significance was set at p 0 05 the pca was carried out using the statistical analysis system sas studio 3 4 software sas to examine multivariate relationship and to explain most of the variance in the data while reducing the number of variable to groups of individuals based on the principal component scores 3 results the climate at the experimental site is basically an arid mediterranean type the environmental conditions in the study area were characterized by a severe water deficit the experimental period was characterized by two years on 2015 and 2017 alternated with one year off 2016 3 1 drought occurrence the drought occurred when a succession of three dry months were registered as described by trabelsi et al 2019 using spi index standardized precipitation index was used to identify drought occurrence determine length and severity of drought this index is widely used in climatic analyzes dealing with drought mckee et al 1993 1995 soro et al 2014 thus drought conditions are accepted when the spi was below 1 and ended when the spi became positive spi indicated a long dry period from october 2015 to august 2016 indeed it ranged between 1 and 0 for nine months indicating moderate drought while the drought was severe for two months on 2015 such as december 1 and march 1 06 fig 1 after that dry period september 2016 was classified as moderately wet with spi of 0 63 followed by 68 8 mm of rain a moderately dry month and then one moderately wet november and one extremely wet december 2016 with spi of 2 79 based on these results the drought period was from october 2015 to august 2016 for this reason two periods were identified and used for the evaluation of potential yield these two periods were the beginning of october 2015 to august 2016 that corresponded to the last month of a long drought and the end of october 2016 that corresponded to the end of drought and after this long period of drought by re watering 68 8 mm of rainfall in september 2016 and 56 5 mm in october november 2017 before the second harvest 2017 3 2 soil characteristics the characteristics of the soil collected from the different treatments were determined at the beginning and the end of the experimental period soil moisture content smc showed the same trend for the two periods considered table 5 and table 6 soil moisture increased with the use of irrigation at the different depths for the soil electrical conductivity and before the application of irrigation the lowest values of ec were recorded at the surface 0 20 cm about 2 ds m 1 and increased at depths the same ec distribution profile was observed for all treatments and both dates irrigation with saline water showed high ec for a long period three years and had induced a significant increase in the soil ec in comparison to the treatment irrigated with tap water the na and cl contents were significantly higher in rain fed treatment 1570 mg kg na 2506 30 mg kg cl as compared to fi and tw the irrigation of soil with tap water had significantly reduced both the na and cl contents as compared to saline water table 6 3 3 vegetative potential annual growth the annual growth focused on spring and autumn elongation of vegetative shoots in 2017 irrigated trees showed an improvement in height and number of axillary shoots in comparison with rain fed trees the annual growth varied according to the water regime applied indeed it was higher in olive trees irrigated under tap water tw followed by saline water fi with respective values of 1 84 and 0 74 cm by the end of experimentation 2017 as compared to rain fed 0 22 cm irrigation with tap water has shown the best vegetative potential however all differences observed in 2017 were not significant 3 4 olive yield and water productivity olive production kg ha showed a clear increase with irrigation as compared to rain fed treatment during study 2015 2016 2017 table 7 in fact the overall average yield of olives from rain fed trees was around 2575 kg ha while it was 10 468 77 kg ha for fi and 10 968 75 kg ha for tw during three years table 7 for all treatments the first crop season 2015 was marked by a referential olive yield the yield variation could be due to the alternate bearing phenomenon characterizing olive tree production or the effects of climatic conditions characterizing the experimental site or the changes in growing conditions created by the different irrigation water water salinity and water scarcity during severe drought period in irrigated treatments the potential yield was different depending on water quality indeed irrigation with saline water reduced the drought impact by increasing the potential yield by 50 but remained under that with tw treatment which reached 85 however after long drought period 2017 the improvement of production was accompanied by 66 recovery capacity of productive performance for rain fed treatment reaching values of 3600 kg ha and the reduction of potential yield rainfed olive trees was 13 while it remained lower than irrigated ones indeed irrigation with saline water reduced the drought impact by increasing the production by66 but the potential yield was 50 and remained under that with tw treatment 15 applied irrigation ia has also stabilized olive production from one year to another the impact of irrigation has gone beyond increasing yield to dramatically improving water productivity the mean of water productivity of irrigation and precipitations twp were improved when the two are used together reaching 1 64 and 1 67 kg m3 of water for fi and tw respectively during the study however the mean of rainwater productivity rwp was 1 75 kg m3 of water moreover the mean of the gain water productivity of irrigation giwp was between 2 31 and 2 42 kg m3 of water for fi and tw respectively olive trees therefore responded positively to the application of irrigation 3 5 olive yield efficiency fruit pomological and technological analysis the yield and fruit quality under different irrigation treatments are reported in table 8 the experimental period was characterized by two on years 2015 and 2017 and one off year 2016 the olive yield efficiency showed a clear increase with applied irrigation water during study period the accumulated yield from 2015 to 2017 showed significant differences among rain fed and irrigated treatments table 8 in 2015 and during drought period the olive yield efficiency in kg of fresh weight per m3 tree volume was significantly higher around 0 70 kg m3 in olive trees irrigated with tw and fi as compared to rainfed ones which reached 0 17 kg m3 indeed irrigation with saline water improved yield significantly by 76 in drought period as compared to rainfed treatment in addition yield efficiency was limited to 61 of 2015 one while irrigation with tap water permitted a yield up to 86 of that of 2015 after long drought period 2017 the improvement of yield efficiency was accompanied by 75 recovery capacity for rain fed treatment reaching lowest values of 0 15 kg m3 tree volume but remained higher than fi treatment by 27 due to salinity besides irrigation with saline water decreased the potential yield by 39 as compared to tap water with 14 after long drought period the maturity index mi as described by hermoso fernandez et al 1991 did not change with the increase in applied water level table 8 indeed the same maturity index of value 7 is observed for all treatments in 2015and 2017 fresh fruit weight increased with the water supply but seemed to be affected by crop load table 8 indeed enhanced fruit size was recorded during 2015 2017 in irrigated trees with fi and tw in comparison with rain fed treatment reaching 0 52 0 76 g during the respective periods during both crop seasons salinity has altered fruit weight in 2015 their values were 0 97 and 1 g in fi and tw treated plants respectively in 2017 these values were 0 63 and 0 97 g in fi and tw treated plants respectively these results showed that the increase was more important under irrigation with tap water furthermore the fruit fresh weight in fi plants was statistically p 0 05 lower than that in tw ones the results relating to the ration pulp stone showed a significant difference between the treatments for the year 2015 where the olives from the fi and tw seemed to be richer in pulp compared to the rainfed ones in 2017 this parameter was the same for all treatments fruit water content was also affected by irrigation trees under rain fed conditions exhibited lower water content in fresh olive fruits whereas different water regimes induced the highest fruit water content table 8 the two irrigation treatments showed almost similar values around 60 in 2015 and 49 in 2017 for which differences were not statistically significant consequently the analysis of oil content estimated as percentage of dry weight dw decreased with irrigation water applied rain fed trees had significantly higher oil content during the entire experimental period table 8 the lowest oil content dw was observed with 100 etc irrigation with tw ec 2 46 ds m 1 around 30 93 dw and the saline water treatment we applied to chemlali olive tended to increase significantly oil content dw reaching 36 42 dw in 2017 therefore the irrigation and the quality of the water used seemed to affect the increasing of the oil content however in drought period 2015 the irrigation treatments did not affect oil accumulation in the chemlali olive tree as no statistically significant differences were observed between total oil content dw of the two treatments p 0 05 it was 47 52 and 48 48 in fi and fw table 8 if we compare the reduction in olive potential yield with that in oil content a more drastic effect of salt stress was found on olive yield 50 than on oil yield which ranged 23 35 3 6 olive oil composition oil acidity k232 k270 chlorophyll and carotenoids contents total phenols flavonoids peroxide and saponification index and dpph ic 50 µg ml were determined during two years 2015 2017 drought and after long period of severe and moderate drought table 9 free oil acidity ranged between 0 34 and 0 53 for the two years 2015 and 2017 irrigation seemed to have no or slight effects on this parameter indeed only the rain fed treatment in drought period 2015 obtained the highest value 0 53 whereas all treatments registered no significant differences in 2017 after long period of drought thus all the oils analyzed and whatever their origin seemed to be classified in the category extra virgin olive oil coi 2013 2015 with a free fatty acid content below 0 8 as oleic acid established by eu legislation for extra virgin olive oil uv absorption characteristics at 232 and 270 nm k232 k270 were in the range assigned by the international olive council coi 2013 2015 for extra virgin olive oil however these specific extinction coefficients at 270 nm and 232 nm of the oils studied had values below the upper limits k270 0 22 and k232 2 50 above which these oils are downgraded from the category extra virgin olive oil k232 k270 were unaffected by irrigation treatments and relatively stable from year to year although some variability for the tw regime for k232 between 2015 and 2017 was observed table 9 the chlorophyll concentrations in the virgin oils showed great variations between 2015 and 2017 these levels remained low in 2015 during drought period similar chlorophyll contents were measured in olive oil from the various treatments however in 2017 after long period of drought variability was observed and the oils were obtained from olive rainfed trees which had the highest values similarly carotenoid contents exhibited high fluctuations over the study period being between 4 7 53 mg kg 6 13 16 mg kg and 7 12 8 mg kg for rain fed fi and tw respectively our results showed that olive oil from irrigated olive trees and especially during drought period 2015 had significantly higher carotenoid contents than for 2017 the lowest content was measured in the rainfed conditions in 2015 the other treatments fi and tw did not generate variability in the carotenoid content of the oils in 2015 after long period of drought in 2017 the carotenoid contents were not influenced by saline irrigation regimes indeed the slight differences in carotenoid compounds between treatments were not significant total phenols contents of olive oils from different treatments were higher in 2017 than in 2015 for both irrigated treatments these compounds seemed to be higher in rainfed treatment in 2015 and 2017 than in irrigated olive trees in fi and tw regimes however the use of saline water ec 7 5 dsm 1 increased phenolic compounds content and did not alter other oil quality parameters the flavonoid contents of the oils obtained from all the treatments were lower in 2017 after long period of drought than in 2015 during drought period the oil obtained from olive rainfed trees had the highest values as compared to treated olive trees with fi and tw where the differences were significant for all treatments during the study analysis of the peroxide index pi which was used to assess the oxidation state of the oil showed fluctuated values between 2 1 meq o2 kg in 2015 during drought period for the tw treatment and 15 75 meq o2 kg in rain fed conditions at the end of the experiment in 2017 after long period of drought these results showed that the values obtained meet the standards of the coi 2013 2015 which recommends a lower peroxide index or equal to 20 meq o2 kg moreover this quality index were influenced by the application of irrigation and the water quality treatment because statistically significant differences were observed between treatments p 0 05 the saponification index si was inversely proportional to the length of the fatty acid chain when the oil is hydrolyzed it gives fatty acids soluble in aqueous alkaline medium glycerol soluble in water and other compounds insoluble in aqueous alkaline medium gunstone no significant variability was observed in oils from all treatments in 2015 and 2017 table 9 these values were slightly higher than those of belarbi et al 2011 on olive oil 162 9 mg koh g this index was not influenced by the year effect harvest or by the type of water treatment applied antioxidant activity was evaluated by the effect of extract samples on dpph radical scavenging activities at all the treatments in 2017 after long period of drought had significantly lower ic50 than 2015 during drought period in rainfed samples dpph radical scavenging ic50 values µg ml 1 were highly significant during the study statistical analysis showed significant differences p 0 05 between the phenolic extracts from the rainfed trees and irrigated ones with fi ec 7 5 ds m 1 as compared to tw ec 2 46 ds m 1 indeed the samples under the tw treatment showed the best anti radical activities therefore the effects of salts and water stresses were highly significant in 2015 and 2017 samples which had a low concentration of dpph radical scavenging ic50 values µg ml 1 were rich in total phenols therefore a higher and effective antioxidant activity for example the phenolic extract of olive oil treated with fi had a low ic50value 43 87 µg ml associated with a high content of total phenols 110 67 mg kg and 51 75 meq quercetine kg of flavonoids in 2015 during drought period accordingly olive oils extracts in 2015 drought period had high total phenols concentrations which associated with a low dpph radical scavenging ic50 values µg ml 1 as compared to 2017 after drought period therefore there is a correlation between the anti radical activity and the content of total phenols in the samples 3 7 fatty acid composition the fatty acid composition of olive oil was only slightly influenced by irrigation but the changes in the individual fractions depended on the growing season table 10 the gc profile of the main fatty acids revealed levels complying with the standards established by the coi 2010 for olive oil a significant increase in oleic acid c18 1 and linoleic acid c18 2 percentages in oils extracted from irrigated trees fi and tw after long drought period in 2017 was observed as compared to rain fed ones table 10 for all treatments the most abundant acid was the oleic one which values that had been recorded in oil obtained from saline water and tap water treated plants statistically higher p 0 05 than those in rainfed ones with acceptable levels established for virgin olive oil 55 56 minor differences were found in the percentage of linoleic c18 2 acids when using irrigation treatments fi and tw and which was higher by 20 than in rain fed in 2017 after drought period in parallel substantial increases of palmitic c16 0 as the main saturated fatty acid were observed in 2017 compared to 2015 for all treatments its proportions varied from 17 to 19 without significant differences p 0 05 moreover changes in the individual fractions depended on the growing season with special marked fatty acid composition was obtained in 2015 independent of irrigation treatments which affected the olive oil composition after long period of drought indeed the oil obtained from irrigated plants with fi was not influenced by the saline water 3 8 relations on yield fruits characteristics and oil quality on olive trees under different treatments and periods the principal component analysis of the collected data revealed three factors which explained 74 75 of the total variance were respectively 31 3 25 2 and 18 16 for factors 1 2 and 3 fig 2 the first factor f1 was formed by the variables the fruit weight g the fruit water content the pulp stone ratio and the oil content dw table 11 therefore this factor reflected the characteristics of fruits the second factor f2 was composed of three acids oleic palmitic and linoleic this factor was related to the quality of olive oil the third factor f3 formed the yield efficiency and the maturity index mi these two variables were related to olive productivity the nature of the correlations between different variables of each group was displayed in table 12 in fact the level of oleic acid was negatively correlated with the level of palmitic and linoleic acids the fruit weight was positively correlated with pulp stone and oil content on the other hand the water content of fruits and the yield efficiency were positively correlated these results summarized the different correlations between parameters that characterized the quality of the fruit oil and production 3 9 composition of triacylglycerols on olive trees under different treatments and periods triacylglycerol composition has been established as a measure for olive oil quality control as well as for the determination of their origin and purity oils from both irrigation and rain fed regimes are characterized by four major triacylglycerol fractions ooo poo ool and plo fig 3 as specified for fatty acids the variation in the proportions of the major triacylglycerols between the two crop seasons 2015 and 2017 is not the same in the three studied treatments but it is important to note that the majority of molecular groups revealed some differences based on the results in table 13 all treatments from the 2015 crop season are characterized by a decrease in the triolein percentage ooo compared to the oil samples from 2017 crop season similary a decrease was observed in the linoleyldiolein ool level in all treatments in 2015 as compared to 2017 on the other hand palmityldiolein poo showed a decrease in the proportion between the two crop seasons for all treatments during 2017 the variation in triacylglycerol molecular species composition due to irrigation followed trends similar to those of the corresponding fatty acids thus molecular species containing linoleate or linolenate oll were decreased in oils from irrigated trees with tw in 2015 and fi in 2017 whereas major species containing oleate but not polyunsaturated fatty acids e g ooo poo were increased the most abundant triacylglycerol species is ooo with percentages of 23 94 and 21 for oils from fi irrigated and non irrigated trees respectively in 2017 after re watering period furthermore the value of δecn42 for both treatments was below the established maximum limit of 0 2 ec legislation 2568 91 4 discussion 4 1 effects of drought and salinity on soil characteristics the quality of the soil collected from the different treatments was determined at the beginning and the end of the experimentation results showed a significance increase in the moisture content smc of irrigated soil as compared to rain fed at the beginning in the end of the experimentation this increase was 17 93 at depth 180 220 cm in comparison to the value recorded in the tw and rain fed treatments saline water did not significantly affect smc for the soil electrical conductivity ec rain fed treatment with high ec and without drainage application for a long period three years had induced a significant increase in the soil ec in comparison to the irrigated treatments fi and tw in rain fed treatment the ec was 10 63 ds m 1 at depth 180 200 cm while it was 5 42 and 3 82dsm 1for fi and tw respectively the high ec observed at depth for the rain fed conditions indicated that the source of soluble salts was not only irrigation with saline water but mainly the salts water table located at 2 5 m of depth indeed the same pattern of the ec distribution was observed for all treatments and both dates the ec decreased on low layers and increased with depth for all treatments this indicated that irrigation with saline water did not change the chemical properties of the soil the soil ec and the na and cl contents were increased in rain fed in comparison to the irrigated soil in fact the na level in the soils was higher and showed differences from upper and mid layers 0 100 cm to 100 220 cm of deeper soil horizons rain fed treatment recorded the highest content during experimentation 6400 mg kg at 180 200 cm however the sodium level in the soils registered no difference from layer 0 20 60 80 cm therefore the raise of na levels in deeper layers is related to leaching by infiltration for irrigated soils the decrease of cl may be due to the downward movement of chloride with water infiltration into deeper layers however choride is highly soluble and remains in the soil solution abyaneh et al 2004 ben mbarek et al 2020 the highest concentration of cl in upper layers is due to water irrigation applied therefore irrigation applied reduced sodium soils values and chloride contents as compared to rain fed water and salt dynamics in the soil depended on applied water and precipitations these results are in agreement with the findings of melgar et al 2009 and ghrab et al 2013 showing that salts were leached by rainfall occurring at the end of the irrigation period which corresponded 68 8 mm of rainfall in september 2016 and 56 5 mm in october november 2017 in our case 4 2 effects of water and salt stresses on olive growth the annual growth that occurred during this cycle of development for the year of 2017 at the end of experimentation was relatively low for all treatments it was lower for the rain fed regime 0 22 cm than fi and tw in 2017 however drought and the use of salt water did not significantly influence growth as compared to tw ec 2 46 ds m 1 in 2017 independently from water quality and water scarcity indeed in 2016 rain fed conditions led to very low shoot growth 0 2 cm as compared to fi and tw treatments saline water irrigation ec 7 5 ds m 1 is significantly slowing p 0 05 the growth rate during severe drought period as compared to tap water treatment tw as described in previous work trabelsi et al 2019 thus irrigation with saline water reduces the drought impact by increasing elongation by 90 but remains lower that with tw by 50 a gradual increase of growth is marked in plants irrigated with saline water fi and tap water tw to reach by the end of the monitoring growth in 2016 9 03 and 9 7 cm respectively after heavy rain 68 8 mm irrigated trees with saline water have more important growth level similar to tw trabelsi et al 2019 the growth rate of rainfed remained weak even after re watering this may be due to the permanent limitation of photosynthetic activity of mature leaves trabelsi et al 2019 and the changes in growing conditions created by the different irrigation water water salinity and water scarcity trabelsi et al 2019 reported that growth and development could be decreased with the increased degree of salinity and duration of imposed saline water irrigation when compared to tap water regime carr et al 2014 approved also similar findings on other species trabelsi et al 2019 and munns 2002 explained that the application of saline water 7 5 ds m 1 ec reduced the ability of plants to take up water as indicated by a significant limitation of transpiration and low leaf water status and this quickly caused reductions in growth rate indeed it also could be explained by the reduction of gas exchange rates gs pn and e trabelsi at al 2019 arbizu milagro et al 2022 and stem specific hydraulic conductivity and contraction due to progressive inability of roots munns 2002 to absorb from the soil the needed water for normal growth caused by water scarcity arbizu milagro et al 2022 or salinity however tounsi mehdi et al 2017 claimed that irrigation with the high salinity water 12 ds m 1 induces growth inhibition in pistachio trees 4 3 effects of water and salt stresses on potential yield and fruit characteristics results showed that the fresh olive yield fruit weight and fruit water content increased with irrigation as previously reported by ghrab et al 2013 2014 conde innamorato et al 2022 arbizu milagro et al 2022 these results are in agreement with previous studies for olive cultivars patumi et al 1999 lavee and wodner 2004 gomez rico et al 2007 stefanoudaki et al 2009 in particular in arid climate characterized by lack of rainfall during the summer fruit mean weight of treatment rain fed was 21 lower than fi in 2015 drought period this yield reduction could be due at the same time to the negative effects on fruit development process via limitation of water availability and also to the alternate bearing phenomenon conde innamorato et al 2022 high temperatures and radiations can affect fruit growth hence olive yield in rain fed treatment therefore according to milella and dettori 1986 ghrab et al 2013 2014 ben ahmed et al 2009 2015 and trabelsi et al 2019 the climatic trends of a particular year can influence the productive response of an olive grove nevertheless the tree performance was related with the changes in growing conditions created by the different irrigation water water salinity and water scarcity full irrigation treatments with tap water resulted in an increase of 75 of cumulative yield efficiency as a recovery of productive performance in comparison to rain fed conditions due to the drought effect and the irrigation with saline water ec 7 5 dsm 1 which reduced the salinity impact by 27 compared to tw ec 2 46 dsm 1 many authors goldhamer et al 1994 moriana et al 2003 ghrab et al 2013 2014 trabelsi et al 2019 conde innamorato et al 2022 arbizu milagro et al 2022 reported positive responses of olive trees to irrigation irrigation with moderate saline water showed no differences in annual or cumulated yield for olive tree under field conditions which also reported by bouaziz 1990 weissbein et al 2008 and melgar et al 2009 however in irrigated treatments the potential yield was different dependently of water quality indeed irrigation with saline water reduced the drought impact by increasing the potential yield by 50 but remained under that with tw treatment which his potential yield reaching 85 during severe drought however after long drought period 2017 water stress persistently affected production indeed the increase of the yield of rain fed trees indicated the improvement which was associated with a gradual recovery of production however this recovery was limited to 66 for rain fed treatment and its reduction of potential yield was 13 while it remained lower than irrigated ones indeed irrigation with saline water reduced the drought impact by increasing the production by 66 but the half potential yield was reduced 50 and remained under that with tw treatment 15 thus drought caused permanent damages to productive capacity in rainfed trees in addition during drought and even after long drought period 2015 2017 olive trees irrigated with fi were able to be as efficient as olive trees treated with tw then drought or salt stress induced decreasing potential yield and even after drought period they were not able to recover their initial performance as 2015 hence drought and salt stresses alter the olive tree capacity and potential in an irreversible way if their severity is very intense it is important to notice that the use of saline water mitigated the impact of drought and didn t affect the production in spite of the low quality however the alleviation of yield efficiency didn t reach full capacity since a part corresponding to 27 was lost due to salinity even after drought period without irrigation olive trees lost permanently around 20 24 of their productive performance during severe drought in 2015 while the potential yield was 61 with the use of saline water and remained lower than irrigation with tap water reaching 86 after long drought period 2017 the improvement of yield efficiency was accompanied by 75 recovery capacity and the use of saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 reduced this gap to 27 on yield efficiency due to salinity indeed irrigation with saline water decreased the potential yield by 39 compared to tap water with 14 after long drought period this can be explained by many basic physiological and biochemical mechanisms attributed to olive trees behavior by water and salt stress intensity which also reported by trabelsi et al 2019 nevertheless the application of irrigation produced more olives per unit of water where rainfall is negligible water productivity varied on average from 1 41 kg m3 of water for the tw regime ec 2 46 ds m 1 to around 2 46 kg m3 for the fi regime ec 7 5 ds m 1 this difference suggests that the allocation of low quality water resources should be shifted to more efficient practice fresh fruit weight showed a significant increase with applied irrigation but seemed to be affected by crop load where big fruit size was recorded in the first referential year of study 2015 in irrigated trees in fact considering our experimental work rain fed olive trees had the lowest fruit weight regardless of the others treatments hannachi et al 2007 reported that fruit weight was low due to typical small fruit of olive tree cv chemlali the application of 100 etc irrigation with saline water increased the fruit weight by 12 compared to the rainfed trees but remained under that with tap water with 30 due to salinity impact the decrease of fruit weight and olive yield under salinity conditions has been reported by klein et al 1994 ben ahmed et al 2009 and trabelsi et al 2019 however bouaziz 1990 did not record any effect of irrigation with brackish water on olive production the increased mean fruit weight recorded during study for both irrigated plants could be due to the decrease of fruit set the same results have been noted in olive cv leccino by gucci et al who have demonstrated that at harvest the fruit fresh weight decreased as crop load increased however such tendency was not apparent for severe deficit irrigated plants similarly wiesman et al 2004 have indicated that the most productive saline treatment 4 2 ds m 1 yielded smaller olives whereas high saline treatment 7 5 dsm 1 with lower yield produced larger olives in terms of both fruit weight and diameter our results corroborated with ghrab et al 2014 gomez rico et al 2007 stefanoudaki et al 2009 conde innamorato et al 2022 and arbizu milagro et al 2022 claimed that fruit size was significantly higher for irrigated trees than rainfed ones while others observed no significant differences in the fresh fruit weight under contrasting watering conditions dabbou et al 2010 significant increase of ratio pulp stone was obtained with irrigated olive trees however using saline water during whole period of experimentation was not significantly different as compared to tap water and indicating that low water quality may not change the pulp stone ratio d andria et al 2004 and lavee et al 2007 reported that irrigated olive trees had higher pulp stone ratio compared to control treatments trees under rain fed conditions gave less water content in fresh olives whereas irrigation induced the highest fruit water content independently of water quality used these results are in agreement with previous reports indicating that irrigation lead to high fruits water content ben gal et al 2011 ghrab et al 2014 conde innamorato et al 2022 arbizu milagro et al 2022 stefanoudaki et al 2009 found that water contents of olive fruits is related to the rainfall before harvest where olive cultivars recover rapidly from the effect of water stress after autumn rain moriana et al 2007 the non significant differences in fruit water contents values between for both treatments fi and tw revealed the role of the active root zone of chemlali olive in upholding a suitable hydration level for its tissues this was more displayed via the comparable fruit water contents values of saline water treated olive trees although not significant in comparison to those of tap water irrigated ones during study period these results are also reported by ben ahmed et al 2009 fruit oil content dw decreased with applied irrigation stressed trees yield significant higher oil content dw during the study period 2015 2017 the application of saline water improved oil content dw in fruits by 12 5 higher than irrigation with tap water contradictory results were previously reported some findings indicated lower oil content for olive trees grown under soil water deficit lavee and wodner 1991 inglese et al 1996 1999 stefanoudaki et al 2009 while other studies claimed that oil content decreased with increased applied water grattan et al 2006 gomez rico et al 2007 in addition some authors reported no difference in oil content between irrigated and non irrigated trees michelakis et al 1994 patumi et al 2002 d andria et al 2004 conde innamorato et al 2022 reported that the oil content in response to irrigation depends on cultivar in fact water restriction conditions did not affect the oil content of olives in arbequina while in frantoio it increased it saline irrigation induces a slight increase of oil content klein et al 1994 gucci and tattini 1997 wiesman et al 2002 2004 this result is consistent with previous findings ghrab et al 2006 2007 2013 2014 aganchich et al 2008 other authors reported an increase in the percentage of oil in conditions of uniform and moderate water stress moriana et al 2003 2012 lavee et al 2007 iniesta et al 2009 hence during the study period significant increase of yield and fruit characteristics and the efficacy of the irrigation with saline water were found in response to impact of irrigation supply which was also approved by melgar et al 2008 and ghrab et al 2014 in contrast with previous studies klein et al 1994 wiesman et al 2004 gucci et al 1997 the high saline treatment we applied to chemlali olive tended to decrease oil content relative to tw treated plants although not significantly so in the case described by wiesman et al 2004 there were clear increases of total oil content by 25 and 10 under 4 2 and 7 5 ds m 1 respectively in comparison to control treatment 1 2 ds m 1 in klein et al 1994 the increase of oil content was observed only in the early years of the high density planted trees treated with moderate saline water ben ahmed et al 2009 reported during both crop season irrigation treatment did not affect oil accumulation in the chemlali olive tree as no statistically significant differences on fruit oil content under tap and saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 around 27 8 30 5 fw in tap water and 25 7 28 3 fw in saline water treated olive trees during experimentation 4 4 effect of water and salt stresses on olive oil composition and quality olive tree cv chemlali produced extra virgin olive oil under irrigation regimes over the experimental period 2015 2017 according to the norms codex stan 33 1989 and eec regulation no 702 2007 eec no 2568 91 no or slight effects on oil acidity seemed to have with irrigation regimes the highest acidity was observed in 2015 during drought period and the lowest values were observed in irrigated olive trees after long drought period in 2017 this quality index was not influenced by water quality treatment because no statistically significant differences were observed between all treatments p 0 05 wiesman et al 2004 reported that free fatty acid level of both olive oil samples was lower than those recorded in barnea olive oil subjected to similar salinity treatments and differences between fw and ss treated plants were not significant these results were also reported by ben ahmed et al 2009 our results had been also reported by ghrab et al 2014 several reports showed that acidity increases with irrigation berenguer et al 2006 gomez rico et al 2007 although acidity seemed to be affected positively by irrigation the acidity level of the olive tree cv chemlali was much below the limits of 0 8 of oleic acid established by european economic community legislation 1991 for high quality oils that is extra virgin olive oil during 2015 the comparison of spectrophotometric absorption characteristics in the uv at 232 and 270 nm k232 and k270 between oils from all treatments showed high fluctuations from year to year the lowest values of k232 k270 were recorded in 2017 after long drought period for all treatments these results had been also reported by ghrab et al 2014 and ben ahmed et al 2009 during study irrigation water supply affects chlorophyll and carotenoids contents differences between the treatments were significant p 0 05 in either season during drought in 2015 as for the chlorophyll contents during both crop seasons the carotenoid contents were influenced by irrigation and depended to the water quality indeed the slight differences in carotenoid compounds between irrigated olive trees were not significant only after long drought period in 2017decreased significantly levels of phenols with irrigation applied during study which is conversed also in previous studies patumi et al 2002 moriana et al 2007 gomez rico et al 2006 servili et al 2007 stefanoudaki et al 2009 benincasa et al 2012 ghrab et al 2014 however dabbou et al 2010 reported an increase of total phenols associated with application of irrigation in arbequina olive cultivar under tunisian conditions caruso et al 2014 reported that irrigation strongly influenced phenolic concentrations olive trees with high water status yielded oils with lower concentrations of total phenols the phenol contents during experimental study 2015 2017 were very low compared to values observed by ben ahmed et al 2009 in the same region which could be attributed to harvest period crop load and procedure of oil extraction though these results were similar to ghrab et al 2014 the content of polyphenols in fruits and in oil increased under water restriction with lesser changes in other oil quality parameters conde innamorato et al 2022 the use of saline water at7 5 ds m 1 and the deficit water reinforced phenol accumulation and did not alter oil quality during drought period the phenolic contents under saline water and rain fed treatments could be involved in the antioxidative mechanisms developed by the olive tree in response to oxidative stress induced by salt stress conditions as suggested by foyer et al in the case of wiesman et al 2004 the higher polyphenol contents recorded in oils of saline irrigated plants has been explained by the acceleration of maturation of the olives which could account for the higher levels of phenols furthermore as it is known salt stress could result in both water deficit and salt accumulation consequently the increase of phenol contents in saline water treated plants might be due to the effects of water deficit on the activation of phenylalanine ammonialyase pal a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of phenolic compounds which is directly involved in the accumulation of polyphenols in the virgin olive oil romero et al 2002 tovar et al ben ahmed et al 2009 the increase of phenolic concentrations under water deficit conditions has been recently reported in cv leccino olive by servili et al 2007 and conde innamorato et al 2022 moreover periods of severe drought conditions could influence phenylalanine ammonialyase activity in olive fruit tovar et al 2002a 2002b ben ahmed et al 2009 and this could be an explanation for the reduced level of phenol concentration in tw treated plants these results are also reported by ben ahmed et al 2009 the higher values of phenolic concentrations recorded in saline water and rainfed olive trees during study testified to the tolerance of the chemlali variety to saline water irrigation and water deficit in addition olive oil obtained from salt stressed and rainfed plants were classified as extra virgin with higher levels of phenolic compounds than that of plants irrigated with tap water besides the significant differences between severe parameters of irrigated and rainfed olive trees between the two crop seasons regardless of treatment confirm the effects of environmental conditions on these characteristics indeed the virgin olive oil quality is dependent not only on saline water level but also on cultivar salt exposure duration and climatic conditions of each environment preliminary results of a study on the effects of environmental conditions on oil quality confirm this statement ben ahmed et al 2009 ghrab et al 2014 moreover flavonoids concentrations decreased significantly p 0 05 with the use of low water quality ec 7 5 ds m 1 saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 registered the lowest values of dpph ic50 in 2015 drought period compared to other regimes besides these oils were characterized by high polyphenol contents thus the antioxidant activity of different treatments may be due in part to the highest concentration of phenols our results showed a correlation between total phenol contents and the dpph radical scavenging activity which was also reported by bouaziz et al 2004 in chemlali cultivar and oueslèti et al 2009 the peroxide index was affected by irrigation treatments indeed the tw regime ec 2 46 ds m 1 showed the lowest one these values always remained within the standard set by legislation 20 meqo2 kg oil which are also higher than our results similar findings are also reported by ouni et al 2011 previous works indicated that irrigation increases the peroxide index berenguer et al 2006 gomez rico et al 2007 d andria et al 2004 and patumi et al 2002 found insignificant changes it could probably be that acidity and peroxide values were highly affected by environmental conditions caruso et al 2014 reported that irrigation had negligible effects on free acidity peroxide value results showed fatty acid composition of olive oil was only slightly influenced by irrigation but changed over the experimental years in the individual fractions similar results are also found by caruso et al 2014 and conde innamorato et al 2022 the effect of saline water induced a slight increase of oleic acid and subsequent decrease of linoleic acid in olive oil which is in agreement with previous results obtained by servili et al 2007 stefanoudaki et al 2009 and ghrab et al 2014 however the linoleic acid content seemed higher in 2017 after drought period by around 20 under tw and fi than in rainfed conditions these results corroborate el antari et al 2003 and ben brahim et al 2016 in fact irrigation with saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 modified qualitatively and quantitatively the lipid composition of olive oils which was also reported by chartzoulakis 2005 the linoleic acid content increased steadily and significantly with high salt concentrations rahmani 1996 patumi et al 2002 reported that no differences were detected in fatty acid composition with different irrigation treatments however other authors found opposite results with higher oleic content for the rain fed regime gomez rico et al 2007 dabbou et al 2010 conde innamorato et al 2022 reported that oleic acid decreased in arbequina and frantoio in the non irrigated treatment these contradictory results revealed strong differences in the response of olive trees to water deficit stefanoudaki et al 2009 significant increase of oleic and linoleic acids were also observed in the same year 2017 after drought period the variability found in the levels of fatty acids affected significantly oil composition conde innamorato et al 2022 observed high levels of linoleic acid in arbequina without irrigation the palmitic acid ranged between 17 72 and 19 65 for stressed trees rain fed reaching the upper limit 20 set by the international olive council mainly moreover oils produced from rainfed trees had the lowest percentages of oleic acid with similar values limit 55 these could be partly explained by the exceptional warm climatic conditions observed during this period characterized by severe drought as described by trabelsi et al 2019 in this same site and period in fact minimum and maximum temperatures in 2015 2016 were above the eight previous year s averages which also had a significant effect on fruit and oil quality that have been reported by ghrab et al 2014 and elloumi et al 2016 moreover climate changes may confuse the concept of specific and constant oil characteristics for the mediterranean region ben gal et al 2011 ghrab et al 2014 only palmitic acid a major saturated fatty acid was unaffected as the amount of water increased nevertheless the oil obtained from high saline water irrigated plants would be nutritionally better than that obtained in the case of tap water irrigated ones the increase of oleic acid and the decrease of palmitic acid concentrations could be due to the triacylglycerol active biosynthesis involving a decrease of relative percentage of palmitic acid content salvador et al 2001 as the palmitic acid is implicated in oleic acid synthesis the triacylglycerol biosynthesis which is more important during late fruit ripening stage as the lipogenesis is more remarkable induces the increase of oleic acid and the decrease of palmitic acid contents on the other hand the higher amounts of linoleic acid recorded in irrigated treated plants and the low level of oleic acid found in the case of chemlali olive oil after long drought period in comparison to other cultivars such as arbequina motilva et al 2000 and cornicabra gomez rico et al 2007 conducted under different irrigation regimes may be due according to sanchez and harwood 2002 to the transformation of oleic acid into linoleic acid by the oleate desaturase activity and or probably the disturbance of the activities of enzymes involved in the oleic acid synthesis chain by salt stress likewise el agaimy et al 1994 focusing on olive oil composition under different saline water levels have shown that oleic acid percentage 66 6 70 6 displayed a slight increase under irrigation with saline water 1800 3600 and 6000 ppm of salts in comparison to the control treatment 320 ppm the slight increase of oleic acid content recorded under saline water treatment has been also noted by wiesman et al 2004 whereas palmitic acid did not show a similar variation in oil samples of both chemlali and barnea olive trees subjected to the same salinity levels although there were differences recorded in fatty acid composition between treatments both olive oil samples showed variability in the normal range expected for virgin olive oils nonetheless the low values of oleic acid concentrations registered in our study if compared to data reported by el agaimy et al 1994 in the case of picual olive could result from the interaction of many factors such as the cultivar stage of fruit maturity salt exposure duration and climatic conditions of each environment these results have been reported also by ben ahmed et al 2009 in comparison between olive trees under saline water treatment ec 7 5 ds m 1 and tap water 4 5 relation between yield fruits characteristics and oil quality of olive trees under different treatments and periods on one hand principal component analysis revealed that the first component was positively affected by the pomological variables of the fruit namely the fruit weight the pulp stone ratio the oil and water contents on the other hand the variables of the acidic composition were related with the second component as an olive oil quality factor the variables correlated with the third component linked rather the production im and yield efficiency therefore we could deduce that mi was negatively correlated with water and oil contents of fruits fruit weight and pulp stone ratio on another side a new positive correlation between yield efficiency and oleic acid has been detected we noted a negative correlation between oleic acid and other palmitic linoleic acids these results summarized the different contributions and correlations between different parameters that characterized the quality of the fruits oil and production for the farmer and the olive grower the oil content and yield efficiency were most important as well as a higher fruit weight was desired but the exporter demanded good oil quality with a higher level of oleic acid and a lower level of palmitic acid from the results obtained it appeared that it was possible to reconcile the two objectives by harvesting at the best maturity index 4 6 effect of water and salt stresses on triacylglycerol molecular species percent total triacylglycerols in olive oils the results showed an effect of climatic variations on the molecular composition of triacylglycerols for all the analyzed treatments as specified for fatty acids the changes in the fractions of the major triacylglycerols between the seasons were not the same in the all treatments but it is important to note that the majority of molecular groups revealed differences the high linoleyldiolein ool level was observed in rain fed treatment similarly palmityldiolein poo did not show an important variation in the proportion between the treatments while irrigated oils with fi and tw are characterized by an increase in the poo proportion during the 2015 2017 crop seasons this different behavior towards climatic conditions could be explained by the genetic factor taking into account the influence of other factors on olive oil s triacylglycerol composition mainly the genetic factor and the maturity stage of olives giuffrè 2013 mansouri et al 2018 our results of triacylglycerols in the analyzed olive oils can be compared to those found in tunisia olive oils by manai djebali et al 2012 ooo 30 46 and poo 19 7 26 3 with italian olive oils ooo 21 70 39 37 poo 18 84 22 01 giuffrè 2013 and with french olive oils ooo 32 63 54 59 and poo 17 22 21 72 ollivier et al 2006 in addition to changes in fatty acid biosynthesis referred to above alterations in the balance of triacylglycerol molecular species could also reflect changes in the activity of enzymes used for triacylglycerol assembly salas et al 2000 stefanoudaki et al 2009 thus irrigation could have resulted in a different balance of isoforms for the lysophosphatidate acyltransferase or diacylglycerol acyltransferase reactions used in triacylglycerol accumulation alternatively the activity of the phospholipid diacylglycerol acyltransferase could have been altered which would have allowed preferential incorporation of oleate into ooo or poo fractions finally membrane species remodeling via a lands type mechanism could be involved harwood 1996 salas et al 2000 stefanoudaki et al 2009 however without definite enzymatic evidence on these possibilities it would seem premature to speculate on the mechanism s involved in general whereas the increase in the amount of overall fatty acid saturation for oils from irrigated fruits might also increase oxidative stability changes in molecular species could alter consumer perception through mouth feel patumi et al 2002 stefanoudaki et al 2009 other research findings garcia et al stefanoudaki et al 2009 have reported the influence of fatty acid composition on taste receptor cells these authors proposed that lipid matrices play a key role in the perception of bitterness in virgin olive oil because polyunsaturated matrices produce milder sensations and are less bitter than monounsaturated despite the alterations in fatty acid or triacylglycerol molecular species composition of the olive oil induced by drought or irrigation all parameters were well within the limits imposed by ec legislation 2568 91 5 conclusion within the context of global warming climate change and increasing water scarcity rain fed olive trees in southern mediterranean arid areas may lose the potential yield and oil quality as observed during our study in southern tunisia these declines could be reduced by irrigation with saline water but did not reach the levels observed with tap water irrigation after long drought period potential yield for rainfed trees was partially recovered but did not extend the same level for irrigated trees with saline and tap water the growth followed the same trend of yield olive trees were able to cope with water and salt stresses however they were not able to totally recover their productive performance after long drought period during severe drought period irrigation with saline water reduced the drought impact by increasing the potential yield by 50 but remained under that with tap water which reached 85 however after long drought period irrigation with saline water reduced this gap but was 50 as a recovery capacity of productive performance under that tap water while reduction was 15 moreover rainfed trees recovered only 48 of yield efficiency as a reduction of 39 in potential yield after long drought period which remained under that tap water reducing only 14 of potential yield efficiency due to drought furthermore under high evaporative demand and low availability of good quality water irrigation with saline water is becoming a common practice fatty acids and triacylglycerols are also influenced by climatic variations but the behavior of the studied trees submitted to rain fed fi and tw in relation to climatic conditions is different despite these observed variations and the use of saline water the oils produced were of excellent quality the use of low quality water ec 7 5 ds m 1 for irrigation was necessary to improve the situation achieve good yield and ensure sustainability of the system in terms of water productivity and oil quality with 2 31 kg m3 of water as an average of gain water irrigation productivity to resist water scarcity the application of irrigation produced more olives per unit of water where rainfall is negligible total water productivity varied on average around 1 64 kg m3 of water for saline water regime ec 7 5 ds m 1 thus suggests that the allocation of low quality water resources should be shifted to more efficient practice the applicability of the irrigation with saline water to mitigate drought is effective indeed saline water improved the vegetative growth and yield and did not affect oil quality moreover accumulation of the salts in the soil was limited by efficient leaching in the light textured soil in arid climate however long term studies are necessary to evaluate the sustainability of this practice declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

9505,the increase water demand for irrigation is leading to the use of low quality water resources the combined impact of drought and salinity on olive production sustainability yield quality growth soil salinity and soil water conditions in arid areas has been little investigated this study s purpose was conducted to investigate the effects of the monitoring of saline water irrigation on soil properties and olive trees cv chemlali grown in an arid region of tunisia sfax on the potential yield growth and quality of the resultant virgin olive oil in comparison to rain fed conditions it is also intended to compare olive productive performance during a severe drought with and without irrigation and to assess recovering capacities after long driest period three irrigation levels were considered i full irrigation 100 etc with saline water 7 5 ds m 1 fi ii full irrigation with same amount of water than the fi applied with tap water 2 46 ds m 1 tw and iii rain fed conditions dry the results have showed that irrigation with saline water maintained the soils permeability induced the distribution of salts outside the root zone additionally it has maintained an adequate hydration of the rhizosphere through continuous and efficient leaching of salts to deep horizons after drought period the increase of the yield of rain fed trees indicated 50 of recovery as compared to saline water irrigation with saline water reduced this gap due to drought impact but it was 50 under that tap water while reduction was 15 as a reduction capacity of potential yield hence drought and salt stress alter the olive tree capacity and potential yield in an irreversible way if their severity is very intense as salinity increased there was a desirable sink in measured total phenols and flavonoids levels and a rise of oleic and linoleic acids as compared to rainfed conditions for the triglycerides composition triolein ooo was present in very large quantity in three oils with a high content for fi 23 94 saline water treatment did not affect free acidity peroxide value k232 k270 chlorophyll carotenoids in contrast to rain fed treatment which was decreased olive trees permanently lost less than half of their potential yield during drought without irrigation irrigation with saline water seems to ensure sustainable monitoring olive yield and oil quality keywords olea europaea irrigation saline water drought soil potential production yield quality 1 introduction water scarcity and the current and predicted decrease of water resources in the mediterranean ecosystems are leading to the urgent need to improve water productivity in the arid and semi arid regions ghrab et al 2013 2014 trabelsi et al 2019 climate change is likely to increase of irrigation demand masmoudi et al 2010 trabelsi et al 2019 indeed models estimate an increase of temperature and a reduction of rainfall thus evaporative demand will increase while natural water supply will decrease this will lead to the shift from rainfed to irrigated production systems irrigation is one of the most effective agricultural practices conditioning yield and fruit quality ghrab et al 2014 drip irrigation is fully used for applying water to olive trees due to the drought conditions in mediterranean areas however one can notice the development of intensive orchard using poor water quality abdel latef and chaoxing 2014 trabelsi et al 2019 irrigation with low water quality or rising water tables has different impacts on soils irrigation increases agricultural productivity and affects soil properties and may increase soil fertility but can reduce it as well the most investigated positive effects of soil irrigation are associated to increased soil moisture and the organic matter contents aidarov 1985 oriola 2005 nikolskii gavrilov et al 2014 negative effects of soil irrigation are usually related to using poor quality water salinity sodicity or soil contamination as well as soil erosion salinity is the presence of salt in the land surface in soil or rocks or dissolution in water in our rivers or groundwater saline water is also produced from several industries desalination oil and gas etc and has high concentration of several ions such as na k cl panagopoulos 2021 2022 that may affect the physicochemical property of soil and cause deleterious effect on plant growth and productivity gomez bellot et al 2015 nicolas et al 2018 there are different recommendations for reducing the damages of soil and plant to prevent or reclaim soil salinity and sodicity of irrigated lands aidarov 1985 alguacil del mar et al 2012 nikolskii gavrilov 2014 irrigation affected positively olive trees lavee et al 1990 goldhamer et al 1994 patumi et al 1999 moriana et al 2003 ghrab et al 2013 2014 trabelsi et al 2019 indeed irrigation increases yield and fruit characteristics when climate suffer a lack of water supply during severe drought period trabelsi et al 2019 reported that rain fed conditions led to very low production 5 76 12 4 kg tree as compared to control fi 100 etc with saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 and tap water 100 etc with tap water treatments with a higher production 16 6 75 kg tree for fi and 10 8 6 kg tree for tw irrigation with saline water produced a significant improvement of cumulated yield during nine years from 2003 to 2011 in comparison to rain fed conditions in spite of the low quality of irrigation water 6 7 ds m 1 with 116 and 176 kg tree 1 for rain fed and control full irrigation respectively ghrab et al 2013 2014 full irrigation induced an increase of 48 of cumulative yield in comparison to rain fed conditions melgar et al 2008 however melgar et al 2009 found no differences in annual or cumulated yield due to irrigation with moderate saline water for olive tree under field conditions ghrab et al 2013 2014 reported that after nine years of plantation olive yield and fruit quality were not affected by irrigation with saline water the same trends as the yield also appeared on fresh fruit weight it increased with the water supply and ranged between 0 62 and 1 33 g this is a characteristic of a typical small fruit of cv chemlali irrigation also affected fruit water content rain fed olive trees exhibited lower water content in fresh olive fruits whereas irrigation at different levels induced the highest fruit water content 59 as compared to rain fed conditions 40 4 ghrab et al 2013 2014 irrigation increased fresh weight chartzoulakis et al 1992 conde innamorato et al 2022 volume mesocarp to endocarp ratio chlorophyll content and mesocarp water content it also decreased firmness and sugar content of the fruit goldhamer et al 1994 conde innamorato et al 2022 water stress could decrease the fruit oil content lavee and wodner 1991 conde innamorato et al 2022 or increase it moriana et al 2003 2012 lavee et al 2007 iniesta et al 2009 arbizu milagro et al 2022 ghrab et al 2014 and arbizu milagro et al 2022 reported that fruit oil content decreased with applied irrigation and increased with water stress during the study period moreover free oil acidity k232 k270 and oleic acid increased slightly with irrigation applied as compared to rain fed conditions however the contents of chlorophyll carotenoids and phenols lowered significantly with irrigation and decreased the oil stability as well differing effect of irrigation on triglyceride accumulation and fatty acid composition was obtained by lavee and wodner 1991 conde innamorato et al 2022 and arbizu milagro et al 2022 nevertheless other authors reported that oil content fatty acid composition sugar or acid contents were not affected by irrigation patumi et al 1999 costagli et al 2003 magliulo et al 2003 d andria et al 2004 ghrab et al 2014 caruso et al 2014 moreover polyphenols content could be reduced under water deficit conditions inglese et al 1996 ismail et al 1997 caruso et al 2014 while the results of other field trials indicated a reduction in phenols with increasing amount of applied water patumi et al 1999 stefanoudaki et al 2001 d andria et al 2008 ghrab et al 2014 the irrigation regimes had little or no effect on free acidity peroxide value or fatty acid composition of olive oil stefanoudaki et al 2001 ghrab et al 2014 while the concentrations of phenols were negatively correlated with predawn water potential servili et al 2007 ghrab et al 2013 2014 conde innamorato et al 2022 water resources in tunisia are characterized by problems of quantity and quality the experimentation was conducted in sfax region southern tunisia to evaluate the combined effect of water and salt stresses on olive trees submitted to different regimes and soil properties to the best of our knowledge this was not assessed in arid climate during long drought 11 months defined using spi standardized precipitation index to estimate meteorological drought mckee et al 1993 1995 in field conditions the second novelty of this study is the evaluation of temporary and permanent damages caused to the olive tree productive performance and the relationships between yield fruits characteristics and oil quality due to salinity and water scarcity during severe drought period several authors studied the combined effect of water supply and saline water on olive oil quality dettori et al 1989 patumi et al 2002 ghrab et al 2013 2014 but to the best of our knowledge the assessment of this combined effect under long drought and the efficacy in drought mitigation was not achieved on the other hand pannelli et al 1990 arbizu milagro et al 2022 and conde innamorato et al 2022 stressed that oil quality is strictly dependent on the cultivar environment interaction and more specifically on the nature of fruit ripening besides ghrab et al 2014 and zhang et al 2022 observed that the olive ripening and oil quality seemed to be affected by soil quality and plant nutrition salvador et al 2003 and nieves cirado et al 2004 reported that the chemical composition of virgin olive oil is influenced by genetic and environmental factors i e edaphic characteristics accordingly prolonged drought and salinity conditions would likely affect productive potential in addition to deleterious effects on fruits characteristics oil quality and soil properties this was not assessed before with the application of various treatments rain fed saline water and tap water in same experimentation under an arid climate the aims of this work are therefore to study the issues and impacts of severe drought and salinity on olive production quantitatively and qualitatively with the changes in growing conditions created by the different regimes and to determine some interaction between parameters yield efficiency fruits characteristics and oil quality moreover it focused on the assessment of the impacts of severe water stress in field conditions on olive trees behavior and performance of yield recovery and the efficacy of irrigation with saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 to mitigate it 2 materials and methods 2 1 orchard site and irrigation treatments the experiment was conducted in an orchard at the olive institute in the region of sfax 34 43 n 10

having similar olive trees in potential yield and canopy the fruits of these trees were used for oil quality analysis for fruit pomological characteristics three replicate trees per treatment were sampled 50 olives per tree at each sampling date 2 1 2 determination of irrigation water supply annual reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated using penman monteith equation using daily data from a nearby automatic weather station ranged between 1076 40 1085 2 and 1114 10 mm for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively table 2 the annual crop evapotranspiration etc was estimated using fao method

experimental years 2015 2016 2017 from march to november every year 2 2 spi determination standardized precipitation index spi was calculated monthly from october 2015 to january 2017 to estimate meteorological drought mckee et al 1993 1995 spi aims to describe the major events of different types of drought observed in our study table 4 it is calculated by fitting historical precipitation data one of the significant advantages of this index is that it can be calculated for different timescales to monitor meteorological droughts with respect to severity duration onset extent and end actual research was based on the calculation of standardized precipitation index spi on a rainfall time series of 27 years from 1980 to 2017 the main input parameter is the monthly rainfall in mm to provide a more representative month as possible of the variable climatic conditions the spi index is calculated as described by soro et al 2014 spi pi pm s with pi the annual rainfall of the year i pm the average rainfall of the series on the timescale considered s standard deviation of the series on the timescale considered 2 3 physical and chemical analyses of soil samples the study plot is characterized by a deep sandy loamy soil 49 7 sand 7 clay 43 3 silt up to the depth of 140 cm soil water holding capacity was 5 5 field capacity and wilting point of 8 8 and 3 3 respectively ghrab et al 2013 for depths between 140 and 220 cm the texture becomes light sandy loam characterized by a sand content varying between 33 and 48 between 5 and 7 clay and between 45 and 60 silt the soil of the study plot is fairly homogeneous over the entire profile from 0 to 220 cm in depth ghrab et al 2013 as a result any difference that will be observed excludes any influence of the soil factor especially with the absence of fertilization and phytosanitary treatments soil characteristics were determined in 2014 samples were taken from tree root zone using soil auger up to 2 2 m in depth distant 1 m from relative to the drip lines and 2 m from the tree rows for each sampling point 11 samples were obtained at 0 2 m intervals three replications were taken per treatment during a study

by the mixture of 5 g soil and 100 ml 1 n ammonium acetate solution for 1 h of incubation on a rotary shaker the homogenate was filtered and the exchangeable na content was determined using a flame emission photometry jenway pfp7 bibby scientific limited staffordshire uk salinity distribution through the 2 2 m soil depth was characterized in relation to irrigation treatments in the presence of ground water table below 2 5 m 2 4 annual growth at the end of the experimentation 2017 growth was measured at bud break and until the end of the growth season pre dormancy stage eight current year and healthy shoots were selected from three trees of each treatment placed at different directions around the canopy and were tagged when trees were in dormancy as described by trabelsi et al 2019 the lengths of all apical and axillary shoots were measured from march 2017 to october 2017 and the annual growth was determined 2 5 olive yield efficiency yield per tree was measured at harvest on 10 trees per irrigation treatment olive fruits were harvested by hand in december each year 2015 and 2017 a representative sample of olives per tree and three trees per plot was taken during the optimal

the fruit number in that group hermoso et al 2001 fruit weight was measured in g the stone was then removed pulp and stone were weighed separately in g the ratio pulp stone was determined water content was estimated from the difference between fresh and dry mass and expressed as a percentage of wet weight agar et al 1998 briefly fifty olives from each replicate were transferred into a petri dish weighed and placed in an oven at 105 c until a constant mass was reached that is until all water was removed from the samples to measure dried samples and determine oil content although the oil was extracted from the dried samples the oil content of the olive fruits was calculated per percent of dry weight dw by nuclear magnetic resonance nmr using an oxford analyser oxford analytical instruments ltd oxford uk three samples of 50 olive fruits were used per treatment 2 7 olive oil extraction and oil quality analysis representative olive fruits were handpicked from ten trees of different treatments and brought to the laboratory for oil extraction using oil mill able to handle sample of 2 kg of olives the oil obtained was separated by decantation 2 7 1 oil mechanical extraction process oil extraction was performed using a lab scale system whereby the fruits were crushed by a hammer mill the resulting olive paste malaxed at 25 c for 40 60 min and the oil separated by centrifugation and decantation then the oil samples were filtered transferred into amber glass bottles and stored in the dark at 4 c until analysis servili et al 2 7 2 oil quality indices and photosynthetic pigments contents olive oil was extracted using a laboratory scale olive mill and analytical determinations were focused on oil acidity oleic acid and peroxide index ip meq o2 kg were measured following the analytical method as described in the european regulation 1991 the method is based on an iodometric titration with sodium thiosulphate solution which measures the iodine produced from potassium iodide by the peroxides present in the oil in a stopper conical flask 2 g oil sample was mixed with chloroform 10 ml glacial acetic acid 15 ml and fresh saturated aqueous potassium iodide solution 1 ml the flask was shaken vigorously for 1 min and then kept in the dark for 15 min in the next step 70 ml distilled water was mixed thoroughly with the solution that was titrated against 0 01 n sodium thiosulphate solution until the yellow color had almost disappeared about 10 drops of soluble starch indicator 0 2 solution was then added the titration was continued until the blue color disappeared one blank reagent without sample was also prepared free acidity given as percent of oleic acid was determined by titration of a solution of oil sample 5 g dissolved in 30 ml of ethanol 90 with phenolphthalein as an indicator reported by wolf 1968 k232 and k270 extinction coefficients were calculated from uv absorption at 232 and 270 nm respectively with a uv spectrophotometer jenway 6405 uv vis using 1 solution of oil 0 1 g in 10 ml cyclohexane chlorophyll and carotenoids content total phenols fatty acid composition were performed in accordance to iupac 1979 and the european official methods ue 1989 2003 modifying ecc 2568 91 the chlorophyll fraction mg kg at 670 630 and 710 nm using the specific extinction values and the carotenoid compounds mg kg at 470 nm were determined from the absorption spectrum of 3 g each oil sample dissolved in 10 ml cyclohexane as described by minguez mosquera et al 1991 saponification index is mg koh g oil which indicates the ratio of hydrophilic group and was defined as the milligrammes of potassium hydroxide koh required to saponify 1 g of fat wolff 1968 for this 1 3 g of olive oil and 50 ml of alcoholic koh 0 5 n in the presence of pumice stones in were mixed in a flask surmounted by a reflux condenser the mixture is boiled for one hour the koh reacts with the released fatty acids to form soap then 20 ml of distilled water were added to stop the reaction then the content of this flask was titrated with a solution of hydrochloric acid hcl 0 5 n by adding 2 3 drops of phenolphthalein until the color disappeared one blank reagent without sample was also prepared under the same conditions 2 7 3 total phenols and flavonoids contents total phenols content was determined using folin ciocalteu s colorimetric method phenolic compounds extraction was achieved by dissolving 2 5 g of olive oil in 5 ml hexane and 10 ml of a water methanol mixture 60 40 v v then the mixture was shaken for 3 min folin ciocalteu reagent 125 μl and distilled water were added to the extracts to have a final volume of 3 ml 1 25 ml of solution of sodium bicarbonate 7 w v and the distilled water were added the mixture was incubated for 1 h in the dark the absorbance was measured at 760 nm and expressed as parts per million ppm of gallic acid per kilogram of oil singleton and rossi 1965 the total flavonoids content was determined following the procedure described by bahorun et al 1996 practically the aluminum trichloride alcl3 method is used to quantify the flavonoids in phenolic extracts 1 ml of each extract was added to a solution of alcl3 2 in methanol the mixture was vigorously stirred and the absorbance at 430 nm was read after 15 min of incubation using a spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu kyoto japan the results are expressed in milligrams of quercetin equivalent per kilogram of oil extract meq quercetin kg in parallel the same procedure was applied to standard solutions 0 10 20 30 40 50 µg ml 2 7 4 determination of dpph free radical scavenging activity the scavenging effect of the free radical dpph 1 1 diphenyl 2 picrylhydrazyl which is used to replace the free radicals produced by the cells in response to external or internal stresses was measured according to the protocol described by bersuder et al 1998 briefly a volume of 500 μl of each oil sample was mixed with 500 μl hexane and 125 μl 0 02 dpph in hexane the mixture was shaken and incubated in the dark each extract solution of sample before adding dpph was used as a blank after 60 min the absorbance was measured at 517 nm using a spectrophotometer the dpph radical scavenging activity was calculated as follows radical scavenging activity dpph acontrol ablank asample acontrol 100 where ablank and asample are the absorbance of blank and sample respectively acontrol is the absorbance of control the capacity of free radical scavenging is expressed by ic50 µg ml value which represents the concentration required to decrease 50 of initial dpph radical the ic50 value is defined as the amount of antioxidant reagent necessary to inhibit dpph radical formation by 50 el hajji et al 2006 the synthetic antioxidant reagent bht was used as a positive control 2 7 5 fatty acid composition the fatty acid composition was determined after the preparation of methyl esters of oil samples according to salvador et al 2001 by vigorous shaking of a solution of 0 2 g oil in 3 ml hexane with 0 4 ml of 2 n metanolic potash quantitative analysis was carried out by capillary gas chromatography using a shimadzu gc 17a shimadzu kyoto japan chromatograph equipped with fid detector a fused silica column 30 m length x 0 25 mm id coated with sgl 1000 phase was used the temperature was fixed at 230 180 and 250 c respectively for injector column and detector nitrogen was used as carrier gas with a flow through the column of 1 ml min at a pressure of 0 6 bars while the air and the hydrogen pressures were respectively 1 5 and 0 8 bar an injection volume of 1 μl was used peaks were identified by comparing their retention times with those of authentic reference compounds the fatty acid composition was expressed as relative percentages of each fatty acid calculated considering the internal normalization of the chromatographic peak area 2 7 6 hplc analysis of triacylglycerols the determination of triacylglycerol composition was carried out according to the method described in eec 2568 91 a 30 μl aliquot of a 30 w v olive oil solution in acetone were fractionated by a shimadzu lc 6 ce hplc system nakagyo ku koyoto japan connected to two lc 10 ce shimadzu liquid chromatography pumps and a refractive index detector 10a the isocratic separation was carried out using an ods c18 reverse

was made by comparison to retention times of triacylglycerols from reference chromatograms obtained from standard soybean oil and pure olive oil separated under the same conditions as reported by the official eec method 20 the relative percentage composition was calculated using labsolutions software triacylglycerols in olive oils were separated according to the equivalent carbon number ecn defined as cn 2n where cn is the total acyl carbon number and n is the number of double bonds of fatty acids this gave fractions of ecn42 ecn52 containing the different molecular species calculated according to the ec regulation 2568 91 method 20 2 8 data analysis one way anova was applied on collected data using spss 13 0 for windows spss inc chicago il usa means were compared using the duncan test and significance was set at p 0 05 the pca was carried out using the statistical analysis system sas studio 3 4 software sas to examine multivariate relationship and to explain most of the variance in the data while reducing the number of variable to groups of individuals based on the principal component scores 3 results the climate at the experimental site is basically an arid mediterranean type the environmental conditions in the study area were characterized by a severe water deficit the experimental period was characterized by two years on 2015 and 2017 alternated with one year off 2016 3 1 drought occurrence the drought occurred when a succession of three dry months were registered as described by trabelsi et al 2019 using spi index standardized precipitation index was used to identify drought occurrence determine length and severity of drought this index is widely used in climatic analyzes dealing with drought mckee et al 1993 1995 soro et al 2014 thus drought conditions are accepted when the spi was below 1 and ended when the spi became positive spi indicated a long dry period from october 2015 to august 2016 indeed it ranged between 1 and 0 for nine months indicating moderate drought while the drought was severe for two months on 2015 such as december 1 and march 1 06 fig 1 after that dry period september 2016 was classified as moderately wet with spi of 0 63 followed by 68 8 mm of rain a moderately dry month and then one moderately wet november and one extremely wet december 2016 with spi of 2 79 based on these results the drought period was from october 2015 to august 2016 for this reason two periods were identified and used for the evaluation of potential yield these two periods were the beginning of october 2015 to august 2016 that corresponded to the last month of a long drought and the end of october 2016 that corresponded to the end of drought and after this long period of drought by re watering 68 8 mm of rainfall in september 2016 and 56 5 mm in october november 2017 before the second harvest 2017 3 2 soil characteristics the characteristics of the soil collected from the different treatments were determined at the beginning and the end of the experimental period soil moisture content smc showed the same trend for the two periods considered table 5 and table 6 soil moisture increased with the use of irrigation at the different depths for the soil electrical conductivity and before the application of irrigation the lowest values of ec were recorded at the surface 0 20 cm about 2 ds m 1 and increased at depths the same ec distribution profile was observed for all treatments and both dates irrigation with saline water showed high ec for a long period three years and had induced a significant increase in the soil ec in comparison to the treatment irrigated with tap water the na and cl contents were significantly higher in rain fed treatment 1570 mg kg na 2506 30 mg kg cl as compared to fi and tw the irrigation of soil with tap water had significantly reduced both the na and cl contents as compared to saline water table 6 3 3 vegetative potential annual growth the annual growth focused on spring and autumn elongation of vegetative shoots in 2017 irrigated trees showed an improvement in height and number of axillary shoots in comparison with rain fed trees the annual growth varied according to the water regime applied indeed it was higher in olive trees irrigated under tap water tw followed by saline water fi with respective values of 1 84 and 0 74 cm by the end of experimentation 2017 as compared to rain fed 0 22 cm irrigation with tap water has shown the best vegetative potential however all differences observed in 2017 were not significant 3 4 olive yield and water productivity olive production kg ha showed a clear increase with irrigation as compared to rain fed treatment during study 2015 2016 2017 table 7 in fact the overall average yield of olives from rain fed trees was around 2575 kg ha while it was 10 468 77 kg ha for fi and 10 968 75 kg ha for tw during three years table 7 for all treatments the first crop season 2015 was marked by a referential olive yield the yield variation could be due to the alternate bearing phenomenon characterizing olive tree production or the effects of climatic conditions characterizing the experimental site or the changes in growing conditions created by the different irrigation water water salinity and water scarcity during severe drought period in irrigated treatments the potential yield was different depending on water quality indeed irrigation with saline water reduced the drought impact by increasing the potential yield by 50 but remained under that with tw treatment which reached 85 however after long drought period 2017 the improvement of production was accompanied by 66 recovery capacity of productive performance for rain fed treatment reaching values of 3600 kg ha and the reduction of potential yield rainfed olive trees was 13 while it remained lower than irrigated ones indeed irrigation with saline water reduced the drought impact by increasing the production by66 but the potential yield was 50 and remained under that with tw treatment 15 applied irrigation ia has also stabilized olive production from one year to another the impact of irrigation has gone beyond increasing yield to dramatically improving water productivity the mean of water productivity of irrigation and precipitations twp were improved when the two are used together reaching 1 64 and 1 67 kg m3 of water for fi and tw respectively during the study however the mean of rainwater productivity rwp was 1 75 kg m3 of water moreover the mean of the gain water productivity of irrigation giwp was between 2 31 and 2 42 kg m3 of water for fi and tw respectively olive trees therefore responded positively to the application of irrigation 3 5 olive yield efficiency fruit pomological and technological analysis the yield and fruit quality under different irrigation treatments are reported in table 8 the experimental period was characterized by two on years 2015 and 2017 and one off year 2016 the olive yield efficiency showed a clear increase with applied irrigation water during study period the accumulated yield from 2015 to 2017 showed significant differences among rain fed and irrigated treatments table 8 in 2015 and during drought period the olive yield efficiency in kg of fresh weight per m3 tree volume was significantly higher around 0 70 kg m3 in olive trees irrigated with tw and fi as compared to rainfed ones which reached 0 17 kg m3 indeed irrigation with saline water improved yield significantly by 76 in drought period as compared to rainfed treatment in addition yield efficiency was limited to 61 of 2015 one while irrigation with tap water permitted a yield up to 86 of that of 2015 after long drought period 2017 the improvement of yield efficiency was accompanied by 75 recovery capacity for rain fed treatment reaching lowest values of 0 15 kg m3 tree volume but remained higher than fi treatment by 27 due to salinity besides irrigation with saline water decreased the potential yield by 39 as compared to tap water with 14 after long drought period the maturity index mi as described by hermoso fernandez et al 1991 did not change with the increase in applied water level table 8 indeed the same maturity index of value 7 is observed for all treatments in 2015and 2017 fresh fruit weight increased with the water supply but seemed to be affected by crop load table 8 indeed enhanced fruit size was recorded during 2015 2017 in irrigated trees with fi and tw in comparison with rain fed treatment reaching 0 52 0 76 g during the respective periods during both crop seasons salinity has altered fruit weight in 2015 their values were 0 97 and 1 g in fi and tw treated plants respectively in 2017 these values were 0 63 and 0 97 g in fi and tw treated plants respectively these results showed that the increase was more important under irrigation with tap water furthermore the fruit fresh weight in fi plants was statistically p 0 05 lower than that in tw ones the results relating to the ration pulp stone showed a significant difference between the treatments for the year 2015 where the olives from the fi and tw seemed to be richer in pulp compared to the rainfed ones in 2017 this parameter was the same for all treatments fruit water content was also affected by irrigation trees under rain fed conditions exhibited lower water content in fresh olive fruits whereas different water regimes induced the highest fruit water content table 8 the two irrigation treatments showed almost similar values around 60 in 2015 and 49 in 2017 for which differences were not statistically significant consequently the analysis of oil content estimated as percentage of dry weight dw decreased with irrigation water applied rain fed trees had significantly higher oil content during the entire experimental period table 8 the lowest oil content dw was observed with 100 etc irrigation with tw ec 2 46 ds m 1 around 30 93 dw and the saline water treatment we applied to chemlali olive tended to increase significantly oil content dw reaching 36 42 dw in 2017 therefore the irrigation and the quality of the water used seemed to affect the increasing of the oil content however in drought period 2015 the irrigation treatments did not affect oil accumulation in the chemlali olive tree as no statistically significant differences were observed between total oil content dw of the two treatments p 0 05 it was 47 52 and 48 48 in fi and fw table 8 if we compare the reduction in olive potential yield with that in oil content a more drastic effect of salt stress was found on olive yield 50 than on oil yield which ranged 23 35 3 6 olive oil composition oil acidity k232 k270 chlorophyll and carotenoids contents total phenols flavonoids peroxide and saponification index and dpph ic 50 µg ml were determined during two years 2015 2017 drought and after long period of severe and moderate drought table 9 free oil acidity ranged between 0 34 and 0 53 for the two years 2015 and 2017 irrigation seemed to have no or slight effects on this parameter indeed only the rain fed treatment in drought period 2015 obtained the highest value 0 53 whereas all treatments registered no significant differences in 2017 after long period of drought thus all the oils analyzed and whatever their origin seemed to be classified in the category extra virgin olive oil coi 2013 2015 with a free fatty acid content below 0 8 as oleic acid established by eu legislation for extra virgin olive oil uv absorption characteristics at 232 and 270 nm k232 k270 were in the range assigned by the international olive council coi 2013 2015 for extra virgin olive oil however these specific extinction coefficients at 270 nm and 232 nm of the oils studied had values below the upper limits k270 0 22 and k232 2 50 above which these oils are downgraded from the category extra virgin olive oil k232 k270 were unaffected by irrigation treatments and relatively stable from year to year although some variability for the tw regime for k232 between 2015 and 2017 was observed table 9 the chlorophyll concentrations in the virgin oils showed great variations between 2015 and 2017 these levels remained low in 2015 during drought period similar chlorophyll contents were measured in olive oil from the various treatments however in 2017 after long period of drought variability was observed and the oils were obtained from olive rainfed trees which had the highest values similarly carotenoid contents exhibited high fluctuations over the study period being between 4 7 53 mg kg 6 13 16 mg kg and 7 12 8 mg kg for rain fed fi and tw respectively our results showed that olive oil from irrigated olive trees and especially during drought period 2015 had significantly higher carotenoid contents than for 2017 the lowest content was measured in the rainfed conditions in 2015 the other treatments fi and tw did not generate variability in the carotenoid content of the oils in 2015 after long period of drought in 2017 the carotenoid contents were not influenced by saline irrigation regimes indeed the slight differences in carotenoid compounds between treatments were not significant total phenols contents of olive oils from different treatments were higher in 2017 than in 2015 for both irrigated treatments these compounds seemed to be higher in rainfed treatment in 2015 and 2017 than in irrigated olive trees in fi and tw regimes however the use of saline water ec 7 5 dsm 1 increased phenolic compounds content and did not alter other oil quality parameters the flavonoid contents of the oils obtained from all the treatments were lower in 2017 after long period of drought than in 2015 during drought period the oil obtained from olive rainfed trees had the highest values as compared to treated olive trees with fi and tw where the differences were significant for all treatments during the study analysis of the peroxide index pi which was used to assess the oxidation state of the oil showed fluctuated values between 2 1 meq o2 kg in 2015 during drought period for the tw treatment and 15 75 meq o2 kg in rain fed conditions at the end of the experiment in 2017 after long period of drought these results showed that the values obtained meet the standards of the coi 2013 2015 which recommends a lower peroxide index or equal to 20 meq o2 kg moreover this quality index were influenced by the application of irrigation and the water quality treatment because statistically significant differences were observed between treatments p 0 05 the saponification index si was inversely proportional to the length of the fatty acid chain when the oil is hydrolyzed it gives fatty acids soluble in aqueous alkaline medium glycerol soluble in water and other compounds insoluble in aqueous alkaline medium gunstone no significant variability was observed in oils from all treatments in 2015 and 2017 table 9 these values were slightly higher than those of belarbi et al 2011 on olive oil 162 9 mg koh g this index was not influenced by the year effect harvest or by the type of water treatment applied antioxidant activity was evaluated by the effect of extract samples on dpph radical scavenging activities at all the treatments in 2017 after long period of drought had significantly lower ic50 than 2015 during drought period in rainfed samples dpph radical scavenging ic50 values µg ml 1 were highly significant during the study statistical analysis showed significant differences p 0 05 between the phenolic extracts from the rainfed trees and irrigated ones with fi ec 7 5 ds m 1 as compared to tw ec 2 46 ds m 1 indeed the samples under the tw treatment showed the best anti radical activities therefore the effects of salts and water stresses were highly significant in 2015 and 2017 samples which had a low concentration of dpph radical scavenging ic50 values µg ml 1 were rich in total phenols therefore a higher and effective antioxidant activity for example the phenolic extract of olive oil treated with fi had a low ic50value 43 87 µg ml associated with a high content of total phenols 110 67 mg kg and 51 75 meq quercetine kg of flavonoids in 2015 during drought period accordingly olive oils extracts in 2015 drought period had high total phenols concentrations which associated with a low dpph radical scavenging ic50 values µg ml 1 as compared to 2017 after drought period therefore there is a correlation between the anti radical activity and the content of total phenols in the samples 3 7 fatty acid composition the fatty acid composition of olive oil was only slightly influenced by irrigation but the changes in the individual fractions depended on the growing season table 10 the gc profile of the main fatty acids revealed levels complying with the standards established by the coi 2010 for olive oil a significant increase in oleic acid c18 1 and linoleic acid c18 2 percentages in oils extracted from irrigated trees fi and tw after long drought period in 2017 was observed as compared to rain fed ones table 10 for all treatments the most abundant acid was the oleic one which values that had been recorded in oil obtained from saline water and tap water treated plants statistically higher p 0 05 than those in rainfed ones with acceptable levels established for virgin olive oil 55 56 minor differences were found in the percentage of linoleic c18 2 acids when using irrigation treatments fi and tw and which was higher by 20 than in rain fed in 2017 after drought period in parallel substantial increases of palmitic c16 0 as the main saturated fatty acid were observed in 2017 compared to 2015 for all treatments its proportions varied from 17 to 19 without significant differences p 0 05 moreover changes in the individual fractions depended on the growing season with special marked fatty acid composition was obtained in 2015 independent of irrigation treatments which affected the olive oil composition after long period of drought indeed the oil obtained from irrigated plants with fi was not influenced by the saline water 3 8 relations on yield fruits characteristics and oil quality on olive trees under different treatments and periods the principal component analysis of the collected data revealed three factors which explained 74 75 of the total variance were respectively 31 3 25 2 and 18 16 for factors 1 2 and 3 fig 2 the first factor f1 was formed by the variables the fruit weight g the fruit water content the pulp stone ratio and the oil content dw table 11 therefore this factor reflected the characteristics of fruits the second factor f2 was composed of three acids oleic palmitic and linoleic this factor was related to the quality of olive oil the third factor f3 formed the yield efficiency and the maturity index mi these two variables were related to olive productivity the nature of the correlations between different variables of each group was displayed in table 12 in fact the level of oleic acid was negatively correlated with the level of palmitic and linoleic acids the fruit weight was positively correlated with pulp stone and oil content on the other hand the water content of fruits and the yield efficiency were positively correlated these results summarized the different correlations between parameters that characterized the quality of the fruit oil and production 3 9 composition of triacylglycerols on olive trees under different treatments and periods triacylglycerol composition has been established as a measure for olive oil quality control as well as for the determination of their origin and purity oils from both irrigation and rain fed regimes are characterized by four major triacylglycerol fractions ooo poo ool and plo fig 3 as specified for fatty acids the variation in the proportions of the major triacylglycerols between the two crop seasons 2015 and 2017 is not the same in the three studied treatments but it is important to note that the majority of molecular groups revealed some differences based on the results in table 13 all treatments from the 2015 crop season are characterized by a decrease in the triolein percentage ooo compared to the oil samples from 2017 crop season similary a decrease was observed in the linoleyldiolein ool level in all treatments in 2015 as compared to 2017 on the other hand palmityldiolein poo showed a decrease in the proportion between the two crop seasons for all treatments during 2017 the variation in triacylglycerol molecular species composition due to irrigation followed trends similar to those of the corresponding fatty acids thus molecular species containing linoleate or linolenate oll were decreased in oils from irrigated trees with tw in 2015 and fi in 2017 whereas major species containing oleate but not polyunsaturated fatty acids e g ooo poo were increased the most abundant triacylglycerol species is ooo with percentages of 23 94 and 21 for oils from fi irrigated and non irrigated trees respectively in 2017 after re watering period furthermore the value of δecn42 for both treatments was below the established maximum limit of 0 2 ec legislation 2568 91 4 discussion 4 1 effects of drought and salinity on soil characteristics the quality of the soil collected from the different treatments was determined at the beginning and the end of the experimentation results showed a significance increase in the moisture content smc of irrigated soil as compared to rain fed at the beginning in the end of the experimentation this increase was 17 93 at depth 180 220 cm in comparison to the value recorded in the tw and rain fed treatments saline water did not significantly affect smc for the soil electrical conductivity ec rain fed treatment with high ec and without drainage application for a long period three years had induced a significant increase in the soil ec in comparison to the irrigated treatments fi and tw in rain fed treatment the ec was 10 63 ds m 1 at depth 180 200 cm while it was 5 42 and 3 82dsm 1for fi and tw respectively the high ec observed at depth for the rain fed conditions indicated that the source of soluble salts was not only irrigation with saline water but mainly the salts water table located at 2 5 m of depth indeed the same pattern of the ec distribution was observed for all treatments and both dates the ec decreased on low layers and increased with depth for all treatments this indicated that irrigation with saline water did not change the chemical properties of the soil the soil ec and the na and cl contents were increased in rain fed in comparison to the irrigated soil in fact the na level in the soils was higher and showed differences from upper and mid layers 0 100 cm to 100 220 cm of deeper soil horizons rain fed treatment recorded the highest content during experimentation 6400 mg kg at 180 200 cm however the sodium level in the soils registered no difference from layer 0 20 60 80 cm therefore the raise of na levels in deeper layers is related to leaching by infiltration for irrigated soils the decrease of cl may be due to the downward movement of chloride with water infiltration into deeper layers however choride is highly soluble and remains in the soil solution abyaneh et al 2004 ben mbarek et al 2020 the highest concentration of cl in upper layers is due to water irrigation applied therefore irrigation applied reduced sodium soils values and chloride contents as compared to rain fed water and salt dynamics in the soil depended on applied water and precipitations these results are in agreement with the findings of melgar et al 2009 and ghrab et al 2013 showing that salts were leached by rainfall occurring at the end of the irrigation period which corresponded 68 8 mm of rainfall in september 2016 and 56 5 mm in october november 2017 in our case 4 2 effects of water and salt stresses on olive growth the annual growth that occurred during this cycle of development for the year of 2017 at the end of experimentation was relatively low for all treatments it was lower for the rain fed regime 0 22 cm than fi and tw in 2017 however drought and the use of salt water did not significantly influence growth as compared to tw ec 2 46 ds m 1 in 2017 independently from water quality and water scarcity indeed in 2016 rain fed conditions led to very low shoot growth 0 2 cm as compared to fi and tw treatments saline water irrigation ec 7 5 ds m 1 is significantly slowing p 0 05 the growth rate during severe drought period as compared to tap water treatment tw as described in previous work trabelsi et al 2019 thus irrigation with saline water reduces the drought impact by increasing elongation by 90 but remains lower that with tw by 50 a gradual increase of growth is marked in plants irrigated with saline water fi and tap water tw to reach by the end of the monitoring growth in 2016 9 03 and 9 7 cm respectively after heavy rain 68 8 mm irrigated trees with saline water have more important growth level similar to tw trabelsi et al 2019 the growth rate of rainfed remained weak even after re watering this may be due to the permanent limitation of photosynthetic activity of mature leaves trabelsi et al 2019 and the changes in growing conditions created by the different irrigation water water salinity and water scarcity trabelsi et al 2019 reported that growth and development could be decreased with the increased degree of salinity and duration of imposed saline water irrigation when compared to tap water regime carr et al 2014 approved also similar findings on other species trabelsi et al 2019 and munns 2002 explained that the application of saline water 7 5 ds m 1 ec reduced the ability of plants to take up water as indicated by a significant limitation of transpiration and low leaf water status and this quickly caused reductions in growth rate indeed it also could be explained by the reduction of gas exchange rates gs pn and e trabelsi at al 2019 arbizu milagro et al 2022 and stem specific hydraulic conductivity and contraction due to progressive inability of roots munns 2002 to absorb from the soil the needed water for normal growth caused by water scarcity arbizu milagro et al 2022 or salinity however tounsi mehdi et al 2017 claimed that irrigation with the high salinity water 12 ds m 1 induces growth inhibition in pistachio trees 4 3 effects of water and salt stresses on potential yield and fruit characteristics results showed that the fresh olive yield fruit weight and fruit water content increased with irrigation as previously reported by ghrab et al 2013 2014 conde innamorato et al 2022 arbizu milagro et al 2022 these results are in agreement with previous studies for olive cultivars patumi et al 1999 lavee and wodner 2004 gomez rico et al 2007 stefanoudaki et al 2009 in particular in arid climate characterized by lack of rainfall during the summer fruit mean weight of treatment rain fed was 21 lower than fi in 2015 drought period this yield reduction could be due at the same time to the negative effects on fruit development process via limitation of water availability and also to the alternate bearing phenomenon conde innamorato et al 2022 high temperatures and radiations can affect fruit growth hence olive yield in rain fed treatment therefore according to milella and dettori 1986 ghrab et al 2013 2014 ben ahmed et al 2009 2015 and trabelsi et al 2019 the climatic trends of a particular year can influence the productive response of an olive grove nevertheless the tree performance was related with the changes in growing conditions created by the different irrigation water water salinity and water scarcity full irrigation treatments with tap water resulted in an increase of 75 of cumulative yield efficiency as a recovery of productive performance in comparison to rain fed conditions due to the drought effect and the irrigation with saline water ec 7 5 dsm 1 which reduced the salinity impact by 27 compared to tw ec 2 46 dsm 1 many authors goldhamer et al 1994 moriana et al 2003 ghrab et al 2013 2014 trabelsi et al 2019 conde innamorato et al 2022 arbizu milagro et al 2022 reported positive responses of olive trees to irrigation irrigation with moderate saline water showed no differences in annual or cumulated yield for olive tree under field conditions which also reported by bouaziz 1990 weissbein et al 2008 and melgar et al 2009 however in irrigated treatments the potential yield was different dependently of water quality indeed irrigation with saline water reduced the drought impact by increasing the potential yield by 50 but remained under that with tw treatment which his potential yield reaching 85 during severe drought however after long drought period 2017 water stress persistently affected production indeed the increase of the yield of rain fed trees indicated the improvement which was associated with a gradual recovery of production however this recovery was limited to 66 for rain fed treatment and its reduction of potential yield was 13 while it remained lower than irrigated ones indeed irrigation with saline water reduced the drought impact by increasing the production by 66 but the half potential yield was reduced 50 and remained under that with tw treatment 15 thus drought caused permanent damages to productive capacity in rainfed trees in addition during drought and even after long drought period 2015 2017 olive trees irrigated with fi were able to be as efficient as olive trees treated with tw then drought or salt stress induced decreasing potential yield and even after drought period they were not able to recover their initial performance as 2015 hence drought and salt stresses alter the olive tree capacity and potential in an irreversible way if their severity is very intense it is important to notice that the use of saline water mitigated the impact of drought and didn t affect the production in spite of the low quality however the alleviation of yield efficiency didn t reach full capacity since a part corresponding to 27 was lost due to salinity even after drought period without irrigation olive trees lost permanently around 20 24 of their productive performance during severe drought in 2015 while the potential yield was 61 with the use of saline water and remained lower than irrigation with tap water reaching 86 after long drought period 2017 the improvement of yield efficiency was accompanied by 75 recovery capacity and the use of saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 reduced this gap to 27 on yield efficiency due to salinity indeed irrigation with saline water decreased the potential yield by 39 compared to tap water with 14 after long drought period this can be explained by many basic physiological and biochemical mechanisms attributed to olive trees behavior by water and salt stress intensity which also reported by trabelsi et al 2019 nevertheless the application of irrigation produced more olives per unit of water where rainfall is negligible water productivity varied on average from 1 41 kg m3 of water for the tw regime ec 2 46 ds m 1 to around 2 46 kg m3 for the fi regime ec 7 5 ds m 1 this difference suggests that the allocation of low quality water resources should be shifted to more efficient practice fresh fruit weight showed a significant increase with applied irrigation but seemed to be affected by crop load where big fruit size was recorded in the first referential year of study 2015 in irrigated trees in fact considering our experimental work rain fed olive trees had the lowest fruit weight regardless of the others treatments hannachi et al 2007 reported that fruit weight was low due to typical small fruit of olive tree cv chemlali the application of 100 etc irrigation with saline water increased the fruit weight by 12 compared to the rainfed trees but remained under that with tap water with 30 due to salinity impact the decrease of fruit weight and olive yield under salinity conditions has been reported by klein et al 1994 ben ahmed et al 2009 and trabelsi et al 2019 however bouaziz 1990 did not record any effect of irrigation with brackish water on olive production the increased mean fruit weight recorded during study for both irrigated plants could be due to the decrease of fruit set the same results have been noted in olive cv leccino by gucci et al who have demonstrated that at harvest the fruit fresh weight decreased as crop load increased however such tendency was not apparent for severe deficit irrigated plants similarly wiesman et al 2004 have indicated that the most productive saline treatment 4 2 ds m 1 yielded smaller olives whereas high saline treatment 7 5 dsm 1 with lower yield produced larger olives in terms of both fruit weight and diameter our results corroborated with ghrab et al 2014 gomez rico et al 2007 stefanoudaki et al 2009 conde innamorato et al 2022 and arbizu milagro et al 2022 claimed that fruit size was significantly higher for irrigated trees than rainfed ones while others observed no significant differences in the fresh fruit weight under contrasting watering conditions dabbou et al 2010 significant increase of ratio pulp stone was obtained with irrigated olive trees however using saline water during whole period of experimentation was not significantly different as compared to tap water and indicating that low water quality may not change the pulp stone ratio d andria et al 2004 and lavee et al 2007 reported that irrigated olive trees had higher pulp stone ratio compared to control treatments trees under rain fed conditions gave less water content in fresh olives whereas irrigation induced the highest fruit water content independently of water quality used these results are in agreement with previous reports indicating that irrigation lead to high fruits water content ben gal et al 2011 ghrab et al 2014 conde innamorato et al 2022 arbizu milagro et al 2022 stefanoudaki et al 2009 found that water contents of olive fruits is related to the rainfall before harvest where olive cultivars recover rapidly from the effect of water stress after autumn rain moriana et al 2007 the non significant differences in fruit water contents values between for both treatments fi and tw revealed the role of the active root zone of chemlali olive in upholding a suitable hydration level for its tissues this was more displayed via the comparable fruit water contents values of saline water treated olive trees although not significant in comparison to those of tap water irrigated ones during study period these results are also reported by ben ahmed et al 2009 fruit oil content dw decreased with applied irrigation stressed trees yield significant higher oil content dw during the study period 2015 2017 the application of saline water improved oil content dw in fruits by 12 5 higher than irrigation with tap water contradictory results were previously reported some findings indicated lower oil content for olive trees grown under soil water deficit lavee and wodner 1991 inglese et al 1996 1999 stefanoudaki et al 2009 while other studies claimed that oil content decreased with increased applied water grattan et al 2006 gomez rico et al 2007 in addition some authors reported no difference in oil content between irrigated and non irrigated trees michelakis et al 1994 patumi et al 2002 d andria et al 2004 conde innamorato et al 2022 reported that the oil content in response to irrigation depends on cultivar in fact water restriction conditions did not affect the oil content of olives in arbequina while in frantoio it increased it saline irrigation induces a slight increase of oil content klein et al 1994 gucci and tattini 1997 wiesman et al 2002 2004 this result is consistent with previous findings ghrab et al 2006 2007 2013 2014 aganchich et al 2008 other authors reported an increase in the percentage of oil in conditions of uniform and moderate water stress moriana et al 2003 2012 lavee et al 2007 iniesta et al 2009 hence during the study period significant increase of yield and fruit characteristics and the efficacy of the irrigation with saline water were found in response to impact of irrigation supply which was also approved by melgar et al 2008 and ghrab et al 2014 in contrast with previous studies klein et al 1994 wiesman et al 2004 gucci et al 1997 the high saline treatment we applied to chemlali olive tended to decrease oil content relative to tw treated plants although not significantly so in the case described by wiesman et al 2004 there were clear increases of total oil content by 25 and 10 under 4 2 and 7 5 ds m 1 respectively in comparison to control treatment 1 2 ds m 1 in klein et al 1994 the increase of oil content was observed only in the early years of the high density planted trees treated with moderate saline water ben ahmed et al 2009 reported during both crop season irrigation treatment did not affect oil accumulation in the chemlali olive tree as no statistically significant differences on fruit oil content under tap and saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 around 27 8 30 5 fw in tap water and 25 7 28 3 fw in saline water treated olive trees during experimentation 4 4 effect of water and salt stresses on olive oil composition and quality olive tree cv chemlali produced extra virgin olive oil under irrigation regimes over the experimental period 2015 2017 according to the norms codex stan 33 1989 and eec regulation no 702 2007 eec no 2568 91 no or slight effects on oil acidity seemed to have with irrigation regimes the highest acidity was observed in 2015 during drought period and the lowest values were observed in irrigated olive trees after long drought period in 2017 this quality index was not influenced by water quality treatment because no statistically significant differences were observed between all treatments p 0 05 wiesman et al 2004 reported that free fatty acid level of both olive oil samples was lower than those recorded in barnea olive oil subjected to similar salinity treatments and differences between fw and ss treated plants were not significant these results were also reported by ben ahmed et al 2009 our results had been also reported by ghrab et al 2014 several reports showed that acidity increases with irrigation berenguer et al 2006 gomez rico et al 2007 although acidity seemed to be affected positively by irrigation the acidity level of the olive tree cv chemlali was much below the limits of 0 8 of oleic acid established by european economic community legislation 1991 for high quality oils that is extra virgin olive oil during 2015 the comparison of spectrophotometric absorption characteristics in the uv at 232 and 270 nm k232 and k270 between oils from all treatments showed high fluctuations from year to year the lowest values of k232 k270 were recorded in 2017 after long drought period for all treatments these results had been also reported by ghrab et al 2014 and ben ahmed et al 2009 during study irrigation water supply affects chlorophyll and carotenoids contents differences between the treatments were significant p 0 05 in either season during drought in 2015 as for the chlorophyll contents during both crop seasons the carotenoid contents were influenced by irrigation and depended to the water quality indeed the slight differences in carotenoid compounds between irrigated olive trees were not significant only after long drought period in 2017decreased significantly levels of phenols with irrigation applied during study which is conversed also in previous studies patumi et al 2002 moriana et al 2007 gomez rico et al 2006 servili et al 2007 stefanoudaki et al 2009 benincasa et al 2012 ghrab et al 2014 however dabbou et al 2010 reported an increase of total phenols associated with application of irrigation in arbequina olive cultivar under tunisian conditions caruso et al 2014 reported that irrigation strongly influenced phenolic concentrations olive trees with high water status yielded oils with lower concentrations of total phenols the phenol contents during experimental study 2015 2017 were very low compared to values observed by ben ahmed et al 2009 in the same region which could be attributed to harvest period crop load and procedure of oil extraction though these results were similar to ghrab et al 2014 the content of polyphenols in fruits and in oil increased under water restriction with lesser changes in other oil quality parameters conde innamorato et al 2022 the use of saline water at7 5 ds m 1 and the deficit water reinforced phenol accumulation and did not alter oil quality during drought period the phenolic contents under saline water and rain fed treatments could be involved in the antioxidative mechanisms developed by the olive tree in response to oxidative stress induced by salt stress conditions as suggested by foyer et al in the case of wiesman et al 2004 the higher polyphenol contents recorded in oils of saline irrigated plants has been explained by the acceleration of maturation of the olives which could account for the higher levels of phenols furthermore as it is known salt stress could result in both water deficit and salt accumulation consequently the increase of phenol contents in saline water treated plants might be due to the effects of water deficit on the activation of phenylalanine ammonialyase pal a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of phenolic compounds which is directly involved in the accumulation of polyphenols in the virgin olive oil romero et al 2002 tovar et al ben ahmed et al 2009 the increase of phenolic concentrations under water deficit conditions has been recently reported in cv leccino olive by servili et al 2007 and conde innamorato et al 2022 moreover periods of severe drought conditions could influence phenylalanine ammonialyase activity in olive fruit tovar et al 2002a 2002b ben ahmed et al 2009 and this could be an explanation for the reduced level of phenol concentration in tw treated plants these results are also reported by ben ahmed et al 2009 the higher values of phenolic concentrations recorded in saline water and rainfed olive trees during study testified to the tolerance of the chemlali variety to saline water irrigation and water deficit in addition olive oil obtained from salt stressed and rainfed plants were classified as extra virgin with higher levels of phenolic compounds than that of plants irrigated with tap water besides the significant differences between severe parameters of irrigated and rainfed olive trees between the two crop seasons regardless of treatment confirm the effects of environmental conditions on these characteristics indeed the virgin olive oil quality is dependent not only on saline water level but also on cultivar salt exposure duration and climatic conditions of each environment preliminary results of a study on the effects of environmental conditions on oil quality confirm this statement ben ahmed et al 2009 ghrab et al 2014 moreover flavonoids concentrations decreased significantly p 0 05 with the use of low water quality ec 7 5 ds m 1 saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 registered the lowest values of dpph ic50 in 2015 drought period compared to other regimes besides these oils were characterized by high polyphenol contents thus the antioxidant activity of different treatments may be due in part to the highest concentration of phenols our results showed a correlation between total phenol contents and the dpph radical scavenging activity which was also reported by bouaziz et al 2004 in chemlali cultivar and oueslèti et al 2009 the peroxide index was affected by irrigation treatments indeed the tw regime ec 2 46 ds m 1 showed the lowest one these values always remained within the standard set by legislation 20 meqo2 kg oil which are also higher than our results similar findings are also reported by ouni et al 2011 previous works indicated that irrigation increases the peroxide index berenguer et al 2006 gomez rico et al 2007 d andria et al 2004 and patumi et al 2002 found insignificant changes it could probably be that acidity and peroxide values were highly affected by environmental conditions caruso et al 2014 reported that irrigation had negligible effects on free acidity peroxide value results showed fatty acid composition of olive oil was only slightly influenced by irrigation but changed over the experimental years in the individual fractions similar results are also found by caruso et al 2014 and conde innamorato et al 2022 the effect of saline water induced a slight increase of oleic acid and subsequent decrease of linoleic acid in olive oil which is in agreement with previous results obtained by servili et al 2007 stefanoudaki et al 2009 and ghrab et al 2014 however the linoleic acid content seemed higher in 2017 after drought period by around 20 under tw and fi than in rainfed conditions these results corroborate el antari et al 2003 and ben brahim et al 2016 in fact irrigation with saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 modified qualitatively and quantitatively the lipid composition of olive oils which was also reported by chartzoulakis 2005 the linoleic acid content increased steadily and significantly with high salt concentrations rahmani 1996 patumi et al 2002 reported that no differences were detected in fatty acid composition with different irrigation treatments however other authors found opposite results with higher oleic content for the rain fed regime gomez rico et al 2007 dabbou et al 2010 conde innamorato et al 2022 reported that oleic acid decreased in arbequina and frantoio in the non irrigated treatment these contradictory results revealed strong differences in the response of olive trees to water deficit stefanoudaki et al 2009 significant increase of oleic and linoleic acids were also observed in the same year 2017 after drought period the variability found in the levels of fatty acids affected significantly oil composition conde innamorato et al 2022 observed high levels of linoleic acid in arbequina without irrigation the palmitic acid ranged between 17 72 and 19 65 for stressed trees rain fed reaching the upper limit 20 set by the international olive council mainly moreover oils produced from rainfed trees had the lowest percentages of oleic acid with similar values limit 55 these could be partly explained by the exceptional warm climatic conditions observed during this period characterized by severe drought as described by trabelsi et al 2019 in this same site and period in fact minimum and maximum temperatures in 2015 2016 were above the eight previous year s averages which also had a significant effect on fruit and oil quality that have been reported by ghrab et al 2014 and elloumi et al 2016 moreover climate changes may confuse the concept of specific and constant oil characteristics for the mediterranean region ben gal et al 2011 ghrab et al 2014 only palmitic acid a major saturated fatty acid was unaffected as the amount of water increased nevertheless the oil obtained from high saline water irrigated plants would be nutritionally better than that obtained in the case of tap water irrigated ones the increase of oleic acid and the decrease of palmitic acid concentrations could be due to the triacylglycerol active biosynthesis involving a decrease of relative percentage of palmitic acid content salvador et al 2001 as the palmitic acid is implicated in oleic acid synthesis the triacylglycerol biosynthesis which is more important during late fruit ripening stage as the lipogenesis is more remarkable induces the increase of oleic acid and the decrease of palmitic acid contents on the other hand the higher amounts of linoleic acid recorded in irrigated treated plants and the low level of oleic acid found in the case of chemlali olive oil after long drought period in comparison to other cultivars such as arbequina motilva et al 2000 and cornicabra gomez rico et al 2007 conducted under different irrigation regimes may be due according to sanchez and harwood 2002 to the transformation of oleic acid into linoleic acid by the oleate desaturase activity and or probably the disturbance of the activities of enzymes involved in the oleic acid synthesis chain by salt stress likewise el agaimy et al 1994 focusing on olive oil composition under different saline water levels have shown that oleic acid percentage 66 6 70 6 displayed a slight increase under irrigation with saline water 1800 3600 and 6000 ppm of salts in comparison to the control treatment 320 ppm the slight increase of oleic acid content recorded under saline water treatment has been also noted by wiesman et al 2004 whereas palmitic acid did not show a similar variation in oil samples of both chemlali and barnea olive trees subjected to the same salinity levels although there were differences recorded in fatty acid composition between treatments both olive oil samples showed variability in the normal range expected for virgin olive oils nonetheless the low values of oleic acid concentrations registered in our study if compared to data reported by el agaimy et al 1994 in the case of picual olive could result from the interaction of many factors such as the cultivar stage of fruit maturity salt exposure duration and climatic conditions of each environment these results have been reported also by ben ahmed et al 2009 in comparison between olive trees under saline water treatment ec 7 5 ds m 1 and tap water 4 5 relation between yield fruits characteristics and oil quality of olive trees under different treatments and periods on one hand principal component analysis revealed that the first component was positively affected by the pomological variables of the fruit namely the fruit weight the pulp stone ratio the oil and water contents on the other hand the variables of the acidic composition were related with the second component as an olive oil quality factor the variables correlated with the third component linked rather the production im and yield efficiency therefore we could deduce that mi was negatively correlated with water and oil contents of fruits fruit weight and pulp stone ratio on another side a new positive correlation between yield efficiency and oleic acid has been detected we noted a negative correlation between oleic acid and other palmitic linoleic acids these results summarized the different contributions and correlations between different parameters that characterized the quality of the fruits oil and production for the farmer and the olive grower the oil content and yield efficiency were most important as well as a higher fruit weight was desired but the exporter demanded good oil quality with a higher level of oleic acid and a lower level of palmitic acid from the results obtained it appeared that it was possible to reconcile the two objectives by harvesting at the best maturity index 4 6 effect of water and salt stresses on triacylglycerol molecular species percent total triacylglycerols in olive oils the results showed an effect of climatic variations on the molecular composition of triacylglycerols for all the analyzed treatments as specified for fatty acids the changes in the fractions of the major triacylglycerols between the seasons were not the same in the all treatments but it is important to note that the majority of molecular groups revealed differences the high linoleyldiolein ool level was observed in rain fed treatment similarly palmityldiolein poo did not show an important variation in the proportion between the treatments while irrigated oils with fi and tw are characterized by an increase in the poo proportion during the 2015 2017 crop seasons this different behavior towards climatic conditions could be explained by the genetic factor taking into account the influence of other factors on olive oil s triacylglycerol composition mainly the genetic factor and the maturity stage of olives giuffrè 2013 mansouri et al 2018 our results of triacylglycerols in the analyzed olive oils can be compared to those found in tunisia olive oils by manai djebali et al 2012 ooo 30 46 and poo 19 7 26 3 with italian olive oils ooo 21 70 39 37 poo 18 84 22 01 giuffrè 2013 and with french olive oils ooo 32 63 54 59 and poo 17 22 21 72 ollivier et al 2006 in addition to changes in fatty acid biosynthesis referred to above alterations in the balance of triacylglycerol molecular species could also reflect changes in the activity of enzymes used for triacylglycerol assembly salas et al 2000 stefanoudaki et al 2009 thus irrigation could have resulted in a different balance of isoforms for the lysophosphatidate acyltransferase or diacylglycerol acyltransferase reactions used in triacylglycerol accumulation alternatively the activity of the phospholipid diacylglycerol acyltransferase could have been altered which would have allowed preferential incorporation of oleate into ooo or poo fractions finally membrane species remodeling via a lands type mechanism could be involved harwood 1996 salas et al 2000 stefanoudaki et al 2009 however without definite enzymatic evidence on these possibilities it would seem premature to speculate on the mechanism s involved in general whereas the increase in the amount of overall fatty acid saturation for oils from irrigated fruits might also increase oxidative stability changes in molecular species could alter consumer perception through mouth feel patumi et al 2002 stefanoudaki et al 2009 other research findings garcia et al stefanoudaki et al 2009 have reported the influence of fatty acid composition on taste receptor cells these authors proposed that lipid matrices play a key role in the perception of bitterness in virgin olive oil because polyunsaturated matrices produce milder sensations and are less bitter than monounsaturated despite the alterations in fatty acid or triacylglycerol molecular species composition of the olive oil induced by drought or irrigation all parameters were well within the limits imposed by ec legislation 2568 91 5 conclusion within the context of global warming climate change and increasing water scarcity rain fed olive trees in southern mediterranean arid areas may lose the potential yield and oil quality as observed during our study in southern tunisia these declines could be reduced by irrigation with saline water but did not reach the levels observed with tap water irrigation after long drought period potential yield for rainfed trees was partially recovered but did not extend the same level for irrigated trees with saline and tap water the growth followed the same trend of yield olive trees were able to cope with water and salt stresses however they were not able to totally recover their productive performance after long drought period during severe drought period irrigation with saline water reduced the drought impact by increasing the potential yield by 50 but remained under that with tap water which reached 85 however after long drought period irrigation with saline water reduced this gap but was 50 as a recovery capacity of productive performance under that tap water while reduction was 15 moreover rainfed trees recovered only 48 of yield efficiency as a reduction of 39 in potential yield after long drought period which remained under that tap water reducing only 14 of potential yield efficiency due to drought furthermore under high evaporative demand and low availability of good quality water irrigation with saline water is becoming a common practice fatty acids and triacylglycerols are also influenced by climatic variations but the behavior of the studied trees submitted to rain fed fi and tw in relation to climatic conditions is different despite these observed variations and the use of saline water the oils produced were of excellent quality the use of low quality water ec 7 5 ds m 1 for irrigation was necessary to improve the situation achieve good yield and ensure sustainability of the system in terms of water productivity and oil quality with 2 31 kg m3 of water as an average of gain water irrigation productivity to resist water scarcity the application of irrigation produced more olives per unit of water where rainfall is negligible total water productivity varied on average around 1 64 kg m3 of water for saline water regime ec 7 5 ds m 1 thus suggests that the allocation of low quality water resources should be shifted to more efficient practice the applicability of the irrigation with saline water to mitigate drought is effective indeed saline water improved the vegetative growth and yield and did not affect oil quality moreover accumulation of the salts in the soil was limited by efficient leaching in the light textured soil in arid climate however long term studies are necessary to evaluate the sustainability of this practice declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

ultimately results in photosynthesis inhibition and yield reduction gill and tuteja 2010 drought stress tolerance also called dehydration tolerance is defined as the ability of a plant to resist the reduction of water content and water potential in a cell and for this purpose plants have developed unique and sophisticated mechanisms consisting of physiological biochemical molecular and genetic changes redondo gómez 2013 given that drought stress tolerance is a major goal of many research and breeding programs effective and reliable tools and methods useful in seeking information on the effects of drought stress and high temperatures on the plant are needed techniques based on measuring chlorophyll a fluorescence have become the basis of plant stress research namely the chlorophyll a fluorescence technique has a relatively short history beginning with the work of kautsky and coworkers who found that transferring photosynthetic material from darkness to light increases the yield of chlorophyll a fluorescence over one second kautsky et al 1960 this increase was explained as a consequence of reducing the electron acceptor in the photosynthetic pathways that means that when psii absorbs light and the primary electron acceptor plastoquinones pqs at binding niche quinone a qa accepts the electron it is unable to accept the second electron until it leaves the first to the next electron transporter at binding niche qb during this period the reaction centre is closed at any given time the presence of a certain proportion of closed reaction centres leads to a general decrease in the efficiency of photochemistry and a corresponding increase in fluorescence yield maxwell and johnson 2000 soybean production glycine max l merr has increased significantly in the last 15 years today it is one of the most profitable crops grown worldwide due to its high protein and oil content beneficial phytochemicals and biodiesel production potential faostat 2017 consumption of edible soy products is increasing globally due to proven beneficial effects on human health including lowering cholesterol preventing cancer diabetes and obesity and diseases of the digestive system and kidneys

control and drought treatments remained the same by days of measurement both genotypes had the same vi trend in both treatments fig 3b on the third day of the drought treatment there was a sharp significant increase of vi in both genotypes which continued on the fourth and fifth day of measurement the maximum difference between the two treatments in both genotypes occurred on the fourth day of measurement the difference was 20 46 and 18 29 for os 211 and korana respectively after which it decreased on the fifth day for both genotypes table s4 in the drought treatment in both genotypes after the first day of measurement an increase in tr0 abs was found which was maintained until the last day of measurement still a significant difference of 1 between treatments occurred only on the second day in korana both genotypes in both treatments showed the same rc cs0 trend by day of measurement fig 3d in both genotypes rc cs0 reached its maximum values on the second day in drought exposed plants rc cs0 values differed significantly beginning with the third day of measurements in os 211 while in korana the difference occurred on the first day and then again from the third day the most significant differences between treatments were found on the fifth day of measurement and they were 19 56 for os 211 and 22 28 for korana table s4 in the drought treatment of both genotypes absorption trapping and electron transport flux per rc abs rc tr0 rc and et0 rc remained at the same level until the third day of measurement fig 3e g in contrast di0 rc decreased significantly on the second day of measurement compared to the initial drought measurement in both genotypes fig 3h a significant increase of abs rc occurred on the third day in os 211 12 19 and the second day in korana 3

for mentioned parameters respectively after the third day the difference between control and drought exposed plants for abs rc tr0 rc et0 rc and di0 rc remained significant in both genotypes in os 211 the maximum differences between treatments were achieved on the fifth day of measurement for all parameters per reaction centre except for di0 rc which was noted on the fourth day the increases were 26 66 for abs rc 26 82 for tr0 rc 16 70 for et0 rc and 27 42 for di0 rc in korana the maximum difference for all parameters was also determined on the fifth day of measurement and it was 29 57 for abs rc 28 86 for tr0 rc 27 35 for et0 rc and 33 29 for di0 rc table s4 performance index piabs and its components rc abs tr0 di0 and et0 tr0 et0 were also affected by drought drought conditions caused a decrease in plastoquinone at the qa binding niche reducing rcs per psii antenna chlorophylls rc abs with days of measurement the difference between treatments in both genotypes occurred on the third day of measurement and was maintained until the end of testing the difference between treatments in both genotypes increased with the days of testing thus on the third day of measurement the decrease was 11 07 in os 211 and 15 15 in korana compared to the fifth day when it was 21 15 and 22 94 respectively table s4 tr0 di0 had low initial values in both treatments for both genotypes the increase in the drought treatment occurred on the second day in both genotypes in os 211 the initial low values in drought exposed plants increased on the second day and remained at the same level until the end of measurements with no significant differences between treatments in korana tr0 di0 increased significantly 6 06 on the second day in drought exposed plants for et0 tr0 et0 a difference between genotypes was observed as a result of drought in os 211 et0 tr0 et0 had an increasing trend until the third day after which it dropped significantly for os 211 significant reductions of et0 tr0 et0 in drought exposed plants were confirmed on the fourth 18 83 and fifth 17 60 day of measurement compared to control treatment drought did not affect et0 tr0 et0 in korana in drought piabs increased on the second day in os 211 after which values decreased in both genotypes confirming a significant difference between treatments on the fourth and fifth day in both genotypes this difference was larger in os 211 i e it was 34 09 on the fourth and 34 09 on the fifth day of measurement compared to korana where the differences were 26 and 27 23 table s4 3 3 photosynthetic proteins in general os 211 had a higher relative abundance of d1 protein than korana fig 5a on the first day of measurement the difference between treatments for the relative abundance of d1 protein was 24 10 in os 211 and 27 53 in korana table s4 a stronger decrease in the relative abundance of protein d1 was seen on the fifth day and it was 33 14 and 40 41 in os 211 and korana respectively the drought treatment caused a decrease compared to the control in the relative abundance of rubisco lsu on the first day in os 211 2 87 and an increase in korana 12 40 fig 5b and table s4 the same happened on the fifth day when rubisco lsu decreased by 16 95 and 27 58 in os 211 and korana respectively in general os 211 had a higher relative abundance of cyt f fig 5c the difference between os 211 and korana in the relative abundance of cyt f on the first day in the drought treatment was extremely high the difference between treatments on the first day of measurement was 25 15 in os 211 and 65 91 in korana table s4 cyt f abundance decreased in both genotypes on the fifth day in drought exposed plants compared to control it was 5 61 and 18 01 for os 211 and korana respectively 3 4 yield components analysis of variance of all tested yield components except harvest index was significantly influenced by genotype and treatment genotype treatment interaction was a significant source of variation only for number of internodes table s6 os 211 had higher plant height internode number pod number grain number and grain weight than korana regardless of the treatments fig 6a e the only trait with similar values in both genotypes was the harvest index fig 6f there was no drought effect for internode number in korana and harvest index in both genotypes drought reduced plant height by 4 74 in os 211 and by 5 74 in korana table s4 the internode number decreased by 9 16 in os 211 but it remained the same regardless of the treatment in korana pod number decreased by 15 06 in os 211 and 10 62 in korana while grain number was reduced by 8 83 and 8 27 in os 211 and korana respectively in os 211 grain weight decreased by 15 33 and in korana by 14 57 3 5 correlation analysis correlation coefficients were analysed according to the ranks described in udovičić et al 2007 the results indicated that rwc had a very good to excellent positive significant correlation with chl a b r 0 89 and rc abs r 0 80 and a significant negative correlation with tbars r 0 91 vi r 0 80 abs rc r 0 81 and tr0 rc r 0 81 table s7 a significant moderate to good positive correlation was determined between rwc and rc cs0 r 0 65 and piabs r 0 59 and a significant negative moderate to good correlation was determined between rwc and chl b 0 63 et0 rc r 0 70 and di0 rc r 0 74 at the same time the significant positive very good to excellent correlation was confirmed between temperature during the measurements and tr0 abs r 0 74 tr0 di0 r 0 73 and et0 rc r 0 56 a significant poor positive correlation was confirmed between temperature during the measurements and et0 tr0 et0 r 0 45 and negative with vj r 0 47 4 discussion 4 1 relative water content the rwc in the leaf represents the hydration degree i e the actual water content in relation to the leaf s maximum capacity to retain water at complete turgor the rwc is used for estimating the loss of water from the leaves and because of that can indicate stress caused by drought and high temperatures mullan and pietragalla 2012 rwc in leaves in both genotypes was significantly lower in the drought treatment than in control both genotypes had a sharp drop in the values beginning with the third day of measurement fig 1a as a very good indicator of the water status of the plant rwc is a frequently used parameter in drought stress tolerance studies mutava et al 2015 stated that the reduction in rwc content was greater in drought sensitive soybean genotypes compared to tolerant genotypes which larkunthod et al 2018 confirmed on rice genotypes as well therefore os 211 showed a greater difference in rwc values between treatments than korana except on the fourth day of measurement indicating more pronounced drought susceptibility in typical c3 plants to which soybean belongs the critical water content in the leaf is about 70 below that value drought has an impact on the photochemical activity of the plant which is reflected in the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters kalaji et al 2017 a significant decrease of water below the threshold of 70 was confirmed in this research and by umar and siddiqui 2018 who reported a reduction in rwc values ranging from 37 to 56 in sunflower hybrids exposed to drought salt stress and their combinations in addition they found that rwc had a highly significant correlation with the piabs parameter 0 89 and concluded that the decrease in piabs values was due to a decrease in rwc a moderate to good significant positive association of rwc with piabs r 0 59 was confirmed in this study as well table s7 4 2 lipid peroxidation the lipid peroxidation products tbars concentration was higher in the drought treatment than in control fig 1b guler and pehlivan 2016 obtained elevated malondialdehyde concentrations in two soybean cultivars on the fourth and seventh days of drought exposed antunović dunić et al 2015 have proven a significant increase in tbars concentration in barley seedlings under severe drought stress coupled with high light intensity earlier mentioned rwc decrease as one of the first signs of leaf tissue dehydration coupled with tbars increase as a sure sign of ros accumulation and oxidative stress foyer and noctor 2005 leads to a conclusion that lipid peroxidation occurred in both tested genotypes resulting in a decrease in photosynthetic efficacy manifested through lower piabs rc cs0 and rc abs values in the drought treatment fig 4d table s7 in drought conditions decreased psii activity is associated with oxidative stress and cell membrane damage caused by increased lipid peroxidation benhassaine kesri et al 2002 tbars increase coupled with rwc and the photosynthetic pigment content decrease was found in festuca arundinacea and poa pratensis subjected to prolonged water deficit jiang and huang 2001 this study also confirmed that rwc and chl a b decreased with increasing tbars concentration in soybean table s7 4 3 photosynthetic pigments the primary pigments in light absorbing systems are chl a and chl b and their balance contributes to the maintenance of homoeostasis within the cell huner et al 1998 equilibrium in the content and chlorophyll ratio in the chloroplast membrane is an important prerequisite for the proper functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus anderson et al 2008 ross can in addition to causing lipid peroxidation lead to photosynthetic pigments damage shah et al 2019 under stress an increase in lipid peroxidation of the plants may cause chl degradation karimpour 2019 an increase in chl content in drought points to the reorganisation of photosynthetic pigments to better cope with stressful conditions in this research the light harvesting complex was adjusted under the tested conditions by increasing the content of chl a and b under the drought treatment which was confirmed by a moderately good correlation of tbars and chl b r 0 69 and a very good to the excellent negative correlation of tbars and chl a b r 0 86 more pronounced changes by days in drought exposed plants i e higher chl a and b contents were observed in korana compared to os 211 a significant increase of chl b in the drought treatment occurred on the second day to the measurement end in os 211 and on the third and fourth day in korana indicating the reorganisation of photosynthetic pigments to cope with stressful conditions also a sharp increase in chl a and b on the fourth day of measurement in korana indicates good functionality of the photosynthetic apparatus during this period which was confirmed by shin et al 2021 on lettuce chowdhury et al 2017 found a decrease in chl a and b content in soybean genotypes and their ratio values in vegetative flowering and pod development since the reaction centres of both photosystems psi and psii lack chl b the chl a b reflects changes in the size of the complex antennas evans 1988 and a reduced chl a b is a reliable sign of an increase in psii complex antennas lepeduš et al 2009 chl a and b and chl a b results can conclude that korana reacted to drought by a more significant increase of pigments than os 211 which helped mitigate the negative effects of stressful conditions 4 4 chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters the increase in vj values in drought exposed plants which occurred only in os 211 indicates that qa reoxidation was limited causing a decrease in electron transfer strasser et al 2004 the accumulation of reduced qa and the inability to further transfer electrons to qb is the probable cause of the increase in vi that was greater from the third day of drought exposed plants compared to control in both genotypes in this study fig 3a b franić et al 2017 also found increased vj and vi values on zea mays lines exposed to drought stress they stated that the accumulation of reduced qa is the reason for the electron transfer inhibition which may negatively impact the efficiency of dark photosynthesis reactions kalaji et al 2014 difficult reoxidation of qa can be associated with very good significant negative correlation coefficients of vi with rwc r 0 80 and chl a b r 0 80 and a very good significant positive correlation of vi with tbars r 0 84 and moderate correlation with chl a r 0 61 according to these results vi can be considered a more sensitive parameter to drought and oxidative stress than vj and can be used as a parameter for drought detection although tr0 abs is one of the most commonly used parameters of chlorophyll a fluorescence in studies of the stressful environmental influence on photosynthetic activity correlations indicate this parameter is insensitive to rwc reduction and tbars increase in leaves and therefore should not be used to monitor early symptoms of drought stress in soybean as previously suggested by ohashi et al 2006 also tsimilli michael and strasser 2008 confirmed that tr0 abs could be quite insensitive to change although it is often used as a fluorescence parameter by which the occurrence and extent of physiological changes in plants are estimated this study showed a significant tr0 abs increase in drought exposed plants only on the second day of the experiment compared to the control treatment in korana in os 211 the drought treatment did not affect tr0 abs values furthermore tr0 abs values which were approximately 0 83 indicate that drought did not impair the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus rc cs0 a parameter that describes the concentration of active psii reaction centres per excited surface strasser et al 2004 decreased in this study with an increasing degree of dehydration meaning that it is highly dependent on rwc in leaves this is confirmed by a significant positive correlation between these two parameters a similar decrease in rc cs0 in five stages of development and two years of the study was shown by fghire et al 2015 who investigated the impact of drought stress on quinoa the same authors also noted an increase in the drought treatment in abs rc tr0 rc and di0 rc such results indicate that abs rc and tr0 rc increase in drought conditions due to the inactivation of a number of psii reaction centres gomes et al 2012 and that the di0 rc increases due to the high dissipation of inactive reaction centres strasser et al 2004 at the same time there was an increase of et0 rc which wang et al 2012 reported earlier in the tested genotypes damage to the photosynthetic apparatus except for higher tbars values was also confirmed by the increased values of vi abs rc tr0 rc et0 rc and di0 rc proven by correlation coefficient furthermore the correlation in this study confirmed the excellent negative association of rc cs0 with abs tr0 et0 and di0 per rc the most sensitive and comprehensive parameter of measuring chlorophyll a fluorescence in research on the effects of stressors on plants is piabs which provides quantitative information on plants general condition and vitality piabs is a product of three independent parameters rc abs tr0 di0 and et0 tr0 et0 the impact of stress on any of the parameters that make up piabs will be visible in its values making it more sensitive than any of the listed parameters individually strasser et al 2004 in this study drought significantly affected piabs as evidenced by lower piabs values in the drought treatment compared to control fig 4d similarly živčák et al 2008 found that piabs in winter wheat decreased during prolonged post flowering drought stress while umar and siddiqui 2018 found a significant reduction in piabs in the combined salt and drought stress on all sunflower hybrids on the second day of measurement in both genotypes in the drought treatment compared to control an increase in piabs occurred followed by a sharp decrease in values beginning with the fourth day fig 4a d the initial increase in value indicates the defensive response of plants to the initial lack of water an increase in piabs values in conditions of mild to moderate water deficiency was also noted by markulj kulundžić et al 2016 who found that piabs values were significantly higher for some sunflower hybrids in the drought treatment decreased rc abs under stress deficient water conditions which was detected from the third day of measurement may mean that psii reaction centres have been deactivated and photoinhibition occurred as confirmed by franić et al 2017 who also obtained lower values of this parameter in the drought treatment on zea mays lines on the second day of measurement tr0 di0 in korana was higher in drought exposed plants than control fig 4b contrary to the findings of viljevac et al 2013 who reported a decrease in tr0 di0 in drought conditions according to the correlation coefficient piabs confirmed a positive correlation with rwc r 0 59 tr0 abs r 0 54 rc cs0 r 0 72 and a negative correlation with tbars r 0 56 vj r 0 80 vi r 0 49 abs rc r 0 64 tr0 rc r 0 59 and di0 rc r 0 85 versus tr0 abs which had a positive correlation with et0 rc r 0 46 tr0 di0 r 0 99 and et0 tr0 et0 r 0 62 and negative with vj r 0 63 this confirms the current knowledge about the greater informativeness and functionality of piabs in relation to tr0 abs fghire et al 2015 and in research preference should be given to the results of piabs the majority of the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters suggested plants initiated a defence mechanism to water deficiency i e there was an initial adjustment to drought on the first and second day of measurement followed by drastic changes in electron flow in photosystem ii such a trend was noticed by kovačević et al 2013 as well furthermore according to the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameter most sensitive to drought i e piabs lack of water had a lesser effect on korana than os 211 4 5 photosynthetic proteins the main role of core psii proteins namely d1 and d2 is to facilitate charge separation and transfer the electrons to electron acceptors in the electron transport chain d1 protein s qb binding site is crucial for electron transport through psii faraloni and torzillo 2010 even though psii is resistant to moderate water deficiency yordanov et al 2003 in conditions of prolonged drought stress electron transfer through psii is inhibited chakir and jensen 1999 giardi et al 1996 found that prolonged exposure to drought stress affects photosynthesis at the psii level and causes a significant decrease in the psii core proteins and degradation of the d1 protein the mechanism of this inhibition is not yet fully understood zlatev and lidon 2012 but several in vivo studies have confirmed that water deficiency damages the oxygen evolving complex skotnica et al 2000 and psii reaction centres associated with d1 protein degradation he et al 1995 damage to the d1 protein can to some extent be an indicator of the occurrence of chronic photoinhibition due to the inactivation of psii reaction centres rintamäki et al 1994 several authors noted that drought stress could halve the number of active reaction centres masojidek et al 1991 meyer and de kouchkovsky 1993 the results in this study were consistent with previous findings i e d1 protein was degraded as a result of drought in both genotypes but korana had noticeably lower d1 abundance compared to os 211 fig 5a the degradation of d1 protein in the psii core proteins under drought stress is likely to be accompanied by a reorganisation of the light harvesting antenna complex because the remaining psii core proteins are still functional and tr0 abs as well as electron transport remain high giardi et al 1997 furthermore phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of psii protein play an important role in responding to environmental stresses vener 2007 prolonged drought stress has been shown to increase the extent of phosphorylation of the psii core proteins d1 d2 cp43 and lhcii in peas giardi et al 1996 the high level of psii phosphorylation facilitates the bending of large photosynthetic membranes thereby reciprocating the lateral mobility of membrane proteins and ensuring sustained photosynthetic activity in plants fristedt et al 2009 the decrease in the rate of photosynthesis under the influence of drought stress is often explained by decreased internal co2 concentrations that cause a limited reduction on the acceptor side of rubisco photosynthetic protein cornic et al 1992 its direct inhibition zlatev and lidon 2012 or the inhibition of atp synthase nogués and baker 2000 in this study the abundance of rubisco large subunits lsu protein decreased more under the influence of drought stress in korana than os 211 fig 5b the level of the rubisco in plant leaves is controlled by the rate of its synthesis and degradation some researchers suggest that the reduction in rubisco abundance and its activity is related to the severity of water stress and depends on the studied species bota et al 2004 perdomo et al 2017 for example rubisco abundance decreased under the influence of drought in rice and corn but not in wheat at the same time the initial and total rubisco activity increased perdomo et al 2017 on the other hand some authors attributed the reduction in rubisco activity to a decrease in rubisco abundance bota et al 2004 galmés et al 2013 rubisco s short term response to drought stress has not been fully elucidated as different studies yield conflicting results while giménez et al 1992 and gunasekera and berkowitz 1993 found very little drought impact on rubisco in sunflower and tobacco majumdar et al 1991 consider the loss of rubisco activity to be a rapid and very early indicator of drought stress in soybeans furthermore several studies have confirmed that the accelerated decrease in photosynthesis intensity under the influence of drought stress was accompanied by a decrease in rubisco activity bota et al 2004 maximum rubp carboxylation rate rubp regeneration rate and quantum efficiency psii in higher plants zhou et al 2007 in contrast webber et al 1994 claim that rubisco is relatively stable in dry conditions with a life cycle lasting several days pelloux et al 2001 also observed an increase in rubisco abundance in drought stressed aleppo pine leaves and riccardi et al 2004 found that an increase in the relative amount of rubisco may be a direct consequence of a decrease in leaf area growth rather than a direct consequence of drought stress according to a study by flexas et al 2006 rubisco did not restrict photosynthesis until it encountered severe or prolonged drought stress contrary to this study galmés et al 2013 suggested that low chloroplastic co2 concentrations in drought conditions may induce rubisco deactivation in some mediterranean species in this study cytochrome f protein levels were lower in the drought treatment than in control on the first day of measurement but they were higher on the last day of the measurement fig 5c protection of the psii and psi photochemistry in dry conditions occurs by adjusting the energy distribution and activating alternative electron transfer pathways therefore induction of cyclic electron transfer around psi is a characteristic response of plants to stressful water scarcity conditions zivcak et al 2014 the main functions of cyclic electron transfer include increasing the transmembrane proton gradient and non photochemical quenching joliot and johnson 2011 which ultimately protects psi and psii from photoinhibition huang et al 2015 therefore higher levels of cytochrome f protein on the last day of drought when soybean leaf dehydration was at its highest may be due to an increased cyclic electron transfer which in conditions of limited co2 availability serves as the final electron acceptor and therefore as a protective mechanism against oxidative stress zulfugarov et al 2010 os 211 had a higher abundance of cyt f protein rubisco lsu and d1 but also lower differences between treatments compared to korana fig 3a c which indicates less degradation of these proteins in os 211 under conditions of stress caused by lack of water 4 6 yield components drought significantly affected all yield components except harvest index fig 6 confirmed by the variance analysis table s6 the decrease in grain weight is mainly due to the increased abortion of pods which affects the number of pods and grains while the grain remains small and sparse srebrić and perić 2014 this was confirmed by sionit and kramer 1977 who found that drought stress in the early stage of pod formation r3 affected the reduction in total pod number number of grains per pod and grain size the same was true in this study as both genotypes had lower pod and grain numbers in the drought treatment generally os 211 had higher values of all yield components except the harvest index in both control and drought exposed plants despite the better agronomic performance of os 211 the results of this study indicate less impact of drought conditions on korana than on os 211 through no impact on internode number less impact on the pod and grain number and smaller grain weight difference this leads to the conclusion that korana is better at protecting and maintaining photosynthetic activity during water scarcity mullan and pietragalla 2012 i e it is more tolerant to drought induced stress such adaptations delay metabolic damage and leaf senescence and improve the transfer of assimilates to the grain directly impacting grain yield leport et al 1999 this can also be supported by the higher content of chlorophyll and rwc which is consistent with the research of sehgal et al 2017 on lentils in conclusion in this study drought conditions were confirmed by the leaf s rwc being below 70 and tbars values having a linear increase in drought exposed plants in both genotypes pigment content chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters and protein abundance confirmed the same the greatest changes were observed from the third day of measurement for all tested parameters except for proteins in which the changes were measured on the fifth day according to the correlation analysis for rwc and tbars the effect of drought was prevalent for chl b chl a b vi rc cs0 abs rc tr0 rc et0 rc di0 rc rc abs and piabs meaning these parameters are good indicators of drought stress and can be used in similar studies in the selection of genotypes confirming chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters as sufficient evidence of drought stress on plants enables easier and faster selection of materials increasing the efficiency of breeding programmes among tested materials korana had lower sensitivity to drought and smaller reduction of yield components in drought exposed plants than os 211 indicating a better response of its defence mechanism to the resulting oxidative stress caused by lack of water given the results future research should focus on studying the tested parameters in other soybean growth stages furthermore the research would benefit from additional treatment in which plants recovery from drought would be studied the methods tested and confirmed in this research could be used for screening large numbers of

weather changes keywords chlorophyll a fluorescence water glicine max proteins pigments 1 introduction changing weather conditions have a major impact on plants due to their sessile lifestyle they are continuously subjected to potential stressors that threaten their survival due to prolonged exposure to stress claeys and inze 2013 abiotic stressors include extreme physical chemical and environmental conditions such as drought temperature extremes soil salinity ultraviolet radiation heavy metals nutrient deficiencies air pollution herbicides gill and tuteja 2010 environmental conditions substances and organisms that adversely affect plant growth development and metabolism significantly reduce agricultural production globally raza et al 2019 lack of available water leading to drought stress is common in areas with irregular rainfall and limited irrigation systems the majority of cultivated crops are relatively sensitive to even mild forms of drought stress while the combined common impact of drought stress and high temperatures have a much stronger effect on the yield of many crops than the impact of individual stresses rollins et al 2013 lack of water and high temperatures in the critical stages of soybean development is a growing global problem in soybean cultivation wei et al 2019 argue that soybean yields can be reduced by more than 50 in dry conditions or drought leading to significant financial losses to farmers and growers in europe soybean is mostly produced in the rainfed agricultural systems which are already facing more frequent severe and longer lasting droughts as well as increases in average temperatures faostat 2021 in addition european countries import 95 of the annual demand for soybean causing an enormous trade deficit dima 2016 to stabilise the yield and shift the sources of supply to european grown soybean stable and adaptable local cultivars must be created by breeding breeding for drought stress tolerance requires a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying stress response and determining good stress indicators in specific germplasm drought causes various changes in plant cell metabolism that after a certain time are manifested by physiological changes in the organism s growth development and functions the primary effect of stress caused by water deficiency is stomatal closure resulting in a carbon dioxide co2 concentration decrease barickman et al 2021 even before this is seen in the leaf s relative water content rwc insufficient amounts of co2 disrupt the process of photosynthesis and carbohydrates synthesis which leads to oxidative stress oxidative stress then causes a decrease in the content of photosynthetic pigments in the leaf chlorophyll a and b carotenoids lipids peroxidation nucleotides degradation and significant damage to the oxygen evolving complex kawakami et al 2009 as well as the protein denaturation by reactive oxygen species ros raja et al 2017 these changes lead to the inactivation of the reaction centre and a decrease in the efficiency of photosystem ii psii zhang et al 2011 and the photosynthetic protein rubisco bota et al 2004 which ultimately results in photosynthesis inhibition and yield reduction gill and tuteja 2010 drought stress tolerance also called dehydration tolerance is defined as the ability of a plant to resist the reduction of water content and water potential in a cell and for this purpose plants have developed unique and sophisticated mechanisms consisting of physiological biochemical molecular and genetic changes redondo gómez 2013 given that drought stress tolerance is a major goal of many research and breeding programs effective and reliable tools and methods useful in seeking information on the effects of drought stress and high temperatures on the plant are needed techniques based on measuring chlorophyll a fluorescence have become the basis of plant stress research namely the chlorophyll a fluorescence technique has a relatively short history beginning with the work of kautsky and coworkers who found that transferring photosynthetic material from darkness to light increases the yield of chlorophyll a fluorescence over one second kautsky et al 1960 this increase was explained as a consequence of reducing the electron acceptor in the photosynthetic pathways that means that when psii absorbs light and the primary electron acceptor plastoquinones pqs at binding niche quinone a qa accepts the electron it is unable to accept the second electron until it leaves the first to the next electron transporter at binding niche qb during this period the reaction centre is closed at any given time the presence of a certain proportion of closed reaction centres leads to a general decrease in the efficiency of photochemistry and a corresponding increase in fluorescence yield maxwell and johnson 2000 soybean production glycine max l merr has increased significantly in the last 15 years

the drought treatment occurred on the second day in both genotypes in os 211 the initial low values in drought exposed plants increased on the second day and remained at the same level until the end of measurements with no significant differences between treatments in korana tr0 di0 increased significantly 6 06 on the second day in drought exposed plants for et0 tr0 et0 a difference between genotypes was observed as a result of drought in os 211 et0 tr0 et0 had an increasing trend until the third day after which it dropped significantly for os 211 significant reductions of et0 tr0 et0 in drought exposed plants were confirmed on the fourth 18 83 and fifth 17 60 day of measurement compared to control treatment drought did not affect et0 tr0 et0 in korana in drought piabs increased on the second day in os 211 after which values decreased in both genotypes confirming a significant difference between treatments on the fourth and fifth day in both genotypes this difference was larger in os 211 i e it was 34 09 on the fourth and 34 09 on the fifth day of measurement compared to korana where the differences were 26 and 27 23 table s4 3 3 photosynthetic proteins in general os 211 had a higher relative abundance of d1 protein than korana fig 5a on the first day of measurement the difference between treatments for the relative abundance of d1 protein was 24 10 in os 211 and 27 53 in korana table s4 a stronger decrease in the relative abundance of protein d1 was seen on the fifth day and it was 33 14 and 40 41 in os 211 and korana respectively the drought treatment caused a decrease compared to the control in the relative abundance of rubisco lsu on the first day in os 211 2 87 and an increase in korana 12 40 fig 5b and table s4 the same happened on the fifth day when rubisco lsu decreased by 16 95 and 27 58 in os 211 and korana respectively in general os 211 had a higher relative abundance of cyt f fig 5c the difference between os 211 and korana in the relative abundance of cyt f on the first day in the drought treatment was extremely high the difference between treatments on the first day of measurement was 25 15 in os 211 and 65 91 in korana table s4 cyt f abundance decreased in both genotypes on the fifth day in drought exposed plants compared to control it was 5 61 and 18 01 for os 211 and korana respectively 3 4 yield components analysis of variance of all tested yield components except harvest index was significantly influenced by genotype and treatment genotype treatment interaction was a significant source of variation only for number of internodes table s6 os 211 had higher plant height internode number pod number grain number and grain weight than korana regardless of the treatments fig 6a e the only trait with similar values in both genotypes was the harvest index fig 6f there was no drought effect for internode number in korana and harvest index in both genotypes drought reduced plant height by 4 74 in os 211 and by 5 74 in korana table s4 the internode number decreased by 9 16 in os 211 but it remained the same regardless of the treatment in korana pod number decreased by 15 06 in os 211 and 10 62 in korana while grain number was reduced by 8 83 and 8 27 in os 211 and korana respectively in os 211 grain weight decreased by 15 33 and in korana by 14 57 3 5 correlation analysis correlation coefficients were analysed according to the ranks described in udovičić et al 2007 the results indicated that rwc had a very good to excellent positive significant correlation with chl a b r 0 89 and rc abs r 0 80 and a significant negative correlation with tbars r 0 91 vi r 0 80 abs rc r 0 81 and tr0 rc r 0 81 table s7 a significant moderate to good positive correlation was determined between rwc and rc cs0 r 0 65 and piabs r 0 59 and a significant negative moderate to good correlation was determined between rwc and chl b 0 63 et0 rc r 0 70 and di0 rc r 0 74 at the same time the significant positive very good to excellent correlation was confirmed between temperature during the measurements and tr0 abs r 0 74 tr0 di0 r 0 73 and et0 rc r 0 56 a significant poor positive correlation was confirmed between temperature during the measurements and et0 tr0 et0 r 0 45 and negative with vj r 0 47 4 discussion 4 1 relative water content the rwc in the leaf represents the hydration degree i e the actual water content in relation to the leaf s maximum capacity to retain water at complete turgor the rwc is used for estimating the loss of water from the leaves and because of that can indicate stress caused by drought and high temperatures mullan and pietragalla 2012 rwc in leaves in both genotypes was significantly lower in the drought treatment than in control both genotypes had a sharp drop in the values beginning with the third day of measurement fig 1a as a very good indicator of the water status of the plant rwc is a frequently used parameter in drought stress tolerance studies mutava et al 2015 stated that the reduction in rwc content was greater in drought sensitive soybean genotypes compared to tolerant genotypes which larkunthod et al 2018 confirmed on rice genotypes as well therefore os 211 showed a greater difference in rwc values between treatments than korana except on the fourth day of measurement indicating more pronounced drought susceptibility in typical c3 plants to which soybean belongs the critical water content in the leaf is about 70 below that value drought has an impact on the photochemical activity of the plant which is reflected in the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters kalaji et al 2017 a significant decrease of water below the threshold of 70 was confirmed in this research and by umar and siddiqui 2018 who reported a reduction in rwc values ranging from 37 to 56 in sunflower hybrids exposed to drought salt stress and their combinations in addition they found that rwc had a highly significant correlation with the piabs parameter 0 89 and concluded that the decrease in piabs values was due to a decrease in rwc a moderate to good significant positive association of rwc with piabs r 0 59 was confirmed in this study as well table s7 4 2 lipid peroxidation the lipid peroxidation products tbars concentration was higher in the drought treatment than in control fig 1b guler and pehlivan 2016 obtained elevated malondialdehyde concentrations in two soybean cultivars on the fourth and seventh days of drought exposed antunović dunić et al 2015 have proven a significant increase in tbars concentration in barley seedlings under severe drought stress coupled with high light intensity earlier mentioned rwc decrease as one of the first signs of leaf tissue dehydration coupled with tbars increase as a sure sign of ros accumulation and oxidative stress foyer and noctor 2005 leads to a conclusion that lipid peroxidation occurred in both tested genotypes resulting in a decrease in photosynthetic efficacy manifested through lower piabs rc cs0 and rc abs values in the drought treatment fig 4d table s7 in drought conditions decreased psii activity is associated with oxidative stress and cell membrane damage caused by increased lipid peroxidation benhassaine kesri et al 2002 tbars increase coupled with rwc and the photosynthetic pigment content decrease was found in festuca arundinacea and poa pratensis subjected to prolonged water deficit jiang and huang 2001 this study also confirmed that rwc and chl a b decreased with increasing tbars concentration in soybean table s7 4 3 photosynthetic pigments the primary pigments in light absorbing systems are chl a and chl b and their balance contributes to the maintenance of homoeostasis within the cell huner et al 1998 equilibrium in the content and chlorophyll ratio in the chloroplast membrane is an important prerequisite for the proper functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus anderson et al 2008 ross can in addition to causing lipid peroxidation lead to photosynthetic pigments damage shah et al 2019 under stress an increase in lipid peroxidation of the plants may cause chl degradation karimpour 2019 an increase in chl content in drought points to the reorganisation of photosynthetic pigments to better cope with stressful conditions in this research the light harvesting complex was adjusted under the tested conditions by increasing the content of chl a and b under the drought treatment which was confirmed by a moderately good correlation of tbars and chl b r 0 69 and a very good to the excellent negative correlation of tbars and chl a b r 0 86 more pronounced changes by days in drought exposed plants i e higher chl a and b contents were observed in korana compared to os 211 a significant increase of chl b in the drought treatment occurred on the second day to the measurement end in os 211 and on the third and fourth day in korana indicating the reorganisation of photosynthetic pigments to cope with stressful conditions also a sharp increase in chl a and b on the fourth day of measurement in korana indicates good functionality of the photosynthetic apparatus during this period which was confirmed by shin et al 2021 on lettuce chowdhury et al 2017 found a decrease in chl a and b content in soybean genotypes and their ratio values in vegetative flowering and pod development since the reaction centres of both photosystems psi and psii lack chl b the chl a b reflects changes in the size of the complex antennas evans 1988 and a reduced chl a b is a reliable sign of an increase in psii complex antennas lepeduš et al 2009 chl a and b and chl a b results can conclude that korana reacted to drought by a more significant increase of pigments than os 211 which helped mitigate the negative effects of stressful conditions 4 4 chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters the increase in vj values in drought exposed plants which occurred only in os 211 indicates that qa reoxidation was limited causing a decrease in electron transfer strasser et al 2004 the accumulation of reduced qa and the inability to further transfer electrons to qb is the probable cause of the increase in vi that was greater from the third day of drought exposed plants compared to control in both genotypes in this study fig 3a b franić et al 2017 also found increased vj and vi values on zea mays lines exposed to drought stress they stated that the accumulation of reduced qa is the reason for the electron transfer inhibition which may negatively impact the efficiency of dark photosynthesis reactions kalaji et al 2014 difficult reoxidation of qa can be associated with very good significant negative correlation coefficients of vi with rwc r 0 80 and chl a b r 0 80 and a very good significant positive correlation of vi with tbars r 0 84 and moderate correlation with chl a r 0 61 according to these results vi can be considered a more sensitive parameter to drought and oxidative stress than vj and can be used as a parameter for drought detection although tr0 abs is one of the most commonly used parameters of chlorophyll a fluorescence in studies of the stressful environmental influence on photosynthetic activity correlations indicate this parameter is insensitive to rwc reduction and tbars increase in leaves and therefore should not be used to monitor early symptoms of drought stress in soybean as previously suggested by ohashi et al 2006 also tsimilli michael and strasser 2008 confirmed that tr0 abs could be quite insensitive to change although it is often used as a fluorescence parameter by which the occurrence and extent of physiological changes in plants are estimated this study showed a significant tr0 abs increase in drought exposed plants only on the second day of the experiment compared to the control treatment in korana in os 211 the drought treatment did not affect tr0 abs values furthermore tr0 abs values which were approximately 0 83 indicate that drought did not impair the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus rc cs0 a parameter that describes the concentration of active psii reaction centres per excited surface strasser et al 2004 decreased in this study with an increasing degree of dehydration meaning that it is highly dependent on rwc in leaves this is confirmed by a significant positive correlation between these two parameters a similar decrease in rc cs0 in five stages of development and two years of the study was shown by fghire et al 2015 who investigated the impact of drought stress on quinoa the same authors also noted an increase in the drought treatment in abs rc tr0 rc and di0 rc such results indicate that abs rc and tr0 rc increase in drought conditions due to the inactivation of a number of psii reaction centres gomes et al 2012 and that the di0 rc increases due to the high dissipation of inactive reaction centres strasser et al 2004 at the same time there was an increase of et0 rc which wang et al 2012 reported earlier in the tested genotypes damage to the photosynthetic apparatus except for higher tbars values was also confirmed by the increased values of vi abs rc tr0 rc et0 rc and di0 rc proven by correlation coefficient furthermore the correlation in this study confirmed the excellent negative association of rc cs0 with abs tr0 et0 and di0 per rc the most sensitive and comprehensive parameter of measuring chlorophyll a fluorescence in research on the effects of stressors on plants is piabs which provides quantitative information on plants general condition and vitality piabs is a product of three independent parameters rc abs tr0 di0 and et0 tr0 et0 the impact of stress on any of the parameters that make up piabs will be visible in its values making it more sensitive than any of the listed parameters individually strasser et al 2004 in this study drought significantly affected piabs as evidenced by lower piabs values in the drought treatment compared to control fig 4d similarly živčák et al 2008 found that piabs in winter wheat decreased during prolonged post flowering drought stress while umar and siddiqui 2018 found a significant reduction in piabs in the combined salt and drought stress on all sunflower hybrids on the second day of measurement in both genotypes in the drought treatment compared to control an increase in piabs occurred followed by a sharp decrease in values beginning with the fourth day fig 4a d the initial increase in value indicates the defensive response of plants to the initial lack of water an increase in piabs values in conditions of mild to moderate water deficiency was also noted by markulj kulundžić et al 2016 who found that piabs values were significantly higher for some sunflower hybrids in the drought treatment decreased rc abs under stress deficient water conditions which was detected from the third day of measurement may mean that psii reaction centres have been deactivated and photoinhibition occurred as confirmed by franić et al 2017 who also obtained lower values of this parameter in the drought treatment on zea mays lines on the second day of measurement tr0 di0 in korana was higher in drought exposed plants than control fig 4b contrary to the findings of viljevac et al 2013 who reported a decrease in tr0 di0 in drought conditions according to the correlation coefficient piabs confirmed a positive correlation with rwc r 0 59 tr0 abs r 0 54 rc cs0 r 0 72 and a negative correlation with tbars r 0 56 vj r 0 80 vi r 0 49 abs rc r 0 64 tr0 rc r 0 59 and di0 rc r 0 85 versus tr0 abs which had a positive correlation with et0 rc r 0 46 tr0 di0 r 0 99 and et0 tr0 et0 r 0 62 and negative with vj r 0 63 this confirms the current knowledge about the greater informativeness and functionality of piabs in relation to tr0 abs fghire et al 2015 and in research preference should be given to the results of piabs the majority of the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters suggested plants initiated a defence mechanism to water deficiency i e there was an initial adjustment to drought on the first and second day of measurement followed by drastic changes in electron flow in photosystem ii such a trend was noticed by kovačević et al 2013 as well furthermore according to the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameter most sensitive to drought i e piabs lack of water had a lesser effect on korana than os 211 4 5 photosynthetic proteins the main role of core psii proteins namely d1 and d2 is to facilitate charge separation and transfer the electrons to electron acceptors in the electron transport chain d1 protein s qb binding site is crucial for electron transport through psii faraloni and torzillo 2010 even though psii is resistant to moderate water deficiency yordanov et al 2003 in conditions of prolonged drought stress electron transfer through psii is inhibited chakir and jensen 1999 giardi et al 1996 found that prolonged exposure to drought stress affects photosynthesis at the psii level and causes a significant decrease in the psii core proteins and degradation of the d1 protein the mechanism of this inhibition is not yet fully understood zlatev and lidon 2012 but several in vivo studies have confirmed that water deficiency damages the oxygen evolving complex skotnica et al 2000 and psii reaction centres associated with d1 protein degradation he et al 1995 damage to the d1 protein can to some extent be an indicator of the occurrence of chronic photoinhibition due to the inactivation of psii reaction centres rintamäki et al 1994 several authors noted that drought stress could halve the number of active reaction centres masojidek et al 1991 meyer and de kouchkovsky 1993 the results in this study were consistent with previous findings i e d1 protein was degraded as a result of drought in both genotypes but korana had noticeably lower d1 abundance compared to os 211 fig 5a the degradation of d1 protein in the psii core proteins under drought stress is likely to be accompanied by a reorganisation of the light harvesting antenna complex because the remaining psii core proteins are still functional and tr0 abs as well as electron transport remain high giardi et al 1997 furthermore phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of psii protein play an important role in responding to environmental stresses vener 2007 prolonged drought stress has been shown to increase the extent of phosphorylation of the psii core proteins d1 d2 cp43 and lhcii in peas giardi et al 1996 the high level of psii phosphorylation facilitates the bending of large photosynthetic membranes thereby reciprocating the lateral mobility of membrane proteins and ensuring sustained photosynthetic activity in plants fristedt et al 2009 the decrease in the rate of photosynthesis under the influence of drought stress is often explained by decreased internal co2 concentrations that cause a limited reduction on the acceptor side of rubisco photosynthetic protein cornic et al 1992 its direct inhibition zlatev and lidon 2012 or the inhibition of atp synthase nogués and baker 2000 in this study the abundance of rubisco large subunits lsu protein decreased more under the influence of drought stress in korana than os 211 fig 5b the level of the rubisco in plant leaves is controlled by the rate of its synthesis and degradation some researchers suggest that the reduction in rubisco abundance and its activity is related to the severity of water stress and depends on the studied species bota et al 2004 perdomo et al 2017 for example rubisco abundance decreased under the influence of drought in rice and corn but not in wheat at the same time the initial and total rubisco activity increased perdomo et al 2017 on the other hand some authors attributed the reduction in rubisco activity to a decrease in rubisco abundance bota et al 2004 galmés et al 2013 rubisco s short term response to drought stress has not been fully elucidated as different studies yield conflicting results while giménez et al 1992 and gunasekera and berkowitz 1993 found very little drought impact on rubisco in sunflower and tobacco majumdar et al 1991 consider the loss of rubisco activity to be a rapid and very early indicator of drought stress in soybeans furthermore several studies have confirmed that the accelerated decrease in photosynthesis intensity under the influence of drought stress was accompanied by a decrease in rubisco activity bota et al 2004 maximum rubp carboxylation rate rubp regeneration rate and quantum efficiency psii in higher plants zhou et al 2007 in contrast webber et al 1994 claim that rubisco is relatively stable in dry conditions with a life cycle lasting several days pelloux et al 2001 also observed an increase in rubisco abundance in drought stressed aleppo pine leaves and riccardi et al 2004 found that an increase in the relative amount of rubisco may be a direct consequence of a decrease in leaf area growth rather than a direct consequence of drought stress according to a study by flexas et al 2006 rubisco did not restrict photosynthesis until it encountered severe or prolonged drought stress contrary to this study galmés et al 2013 suggested that low chloroplastic co2 concentrations in drought conditions may induce rubisco deactivation in some mediterranean species in this study cytochrome f protein levels were lower in the drought treatment than in control on the first day of measurement but they were higher on the last day of the measurement fig 5c protection of the psii and psi photochemistry in dry conditions occurs by adjusting the energy distribution and activating alternative electron transfer pathways therefore induction of cyclic electron transfer around psi is a characteristic response of plants to stressful water scarcity conditions zivcak et al 2014 the main functions of cyclic electron transfer include increasing the transmembrane proton gradient and non photochemical quenching joliot and johnson 2011 which ultimately protects psi and psii from photoinhibition huang et al 2015 therefore higher levels of cytochrome f protein on the last day of drought when soybean leaf dehydration was at its highest may be due to an increased cyclic electron transfer which in conditions of limited co2 availability serves as the final electron acceptor and therefore as a protective mechanism against oxidative stress zulfugarov et al 2010 os 211 had a higher abundance of cyt f protein rubisco lsu and d1 but also lower differences between treatments compared to korana fig 3a c which indicates less degradation of these proteins in os 211 under conditions of stress caused by lack of water 4 6 yield components drought significantly affected all yield components except harvest index fig 6 confirmed by the variance analysis table s6 the decrease in grain weight is mainly due to the increased abortion of pods which affects the number of pods and grains while the grain remains small and sparse srebrić and perić 2014 this was confirmed by sionit and kramer 1977 who found that drought stress in the early stage of pod formation r3 affected the reduction in total pod number number of grains per pod and grain size the same was true in this study as both genotypes had lower pod and grain numbers in the drought treatment generally os 211 had higher values of all yield components except the harvest index in both control and drought exposed plants despite the better agronomic performance of os 211 the results of this study indicate less impact of drought conditions on korana than on os 211 through no impact on internode number less impact on the pod and grain number and smaller grain weight difference this leads to the conclusion that korana is better at protecting and maintaining photosynthetic activity during water scarcity mullan and pietragalla 2012 i e it is more tolerant to drought induced stress such adaptations delay metabolic damage and leaf senescence and improve the transfer of assimilates to the grain directly impacting grain yield leport et al 1999 this can also be supported by the higher content of chlorophyll and rwc which is consistent with the research of sehgal et al 2017 on lentils in conclusion in this study drought conditions were confirmed by the leaf s rwc being below 70 and tbars values having a linear increase in drought exposed plants in both genotypes pigment content chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters and protein abundance confirmed the same the greatest changes were observed from the third day of measurement for all tested parameters except for proteins in which the changes were measured on the fifth day according to the correlation analysis for rwc and tbars the effect of drought was prevalent for chl b chl a b vi rc cs0 abs rc tr0 rc et0 rc di0 rc rc abs and piabs meaning these parameters are good indicators of drought stress and can be used in similar studies in the selection of genotypes confirming chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters as sufficient evidence of drought stress on plants enables easier and faster selection of materials increasing the efficiency of breeding programmes among tested materials korana had lower sensitivity to drought and smaller reduction of yield components in drought exposed plants than os 211 indicating a better response of its defence mechanism to the resulting oxidative stress caused by lack of water given the results future research should focus on studying the tested parameters in other soybean growth stages furthermore the research would benefit from additional treatment in which plants recovery from drought would be studied the methods tested and confirmed in this research could be used for screening large numbers of genotypes to determine in the soybean breeding programs aiming to select superior genotypes adaptable to weather changes funding this research was funded by the ministry of science education and

water and nitrogen n are the two main factors limiting crops productivity cossani and sadras 2018 the availability and acquisition of water and nitrogen are the resources that define the limits of

conductance water and nitrogen stress significantly reduced et and kn in 2017 as well as agb and yield in both years while only water stress significantly affected tkw in 2016 as well as wp c and hi in both years fig 1 two years results showed that mid treatment had the highest wp c and hi fig 1f and g drought reduced g s as exacerbated by nitrogen limitation during the reproductive and maturation stages figs 2 and s3 g s of fhn fln and midhn treatments were higher than other treatments followed by modhn midln modln sdhn and sdln treatments fig 2e there was a strong couple between maize canopy and aero environment with the average 1 ω values being all greater than 0 5 fig 3 drought and nitrogen limitation increased the value of 1 ω with the sdln treatment being the highest followed by sdhn modln modhn midln midhn fln and fhn treatments suggesting the dominance of g s on transpiration was exacerbated by drought and nitrogen stress fig 3e 3 2 the responses of stomatal conductance to swc and vpd under water and nitrogen stress fig 4 showed the co regulation of swc and vpd on g s in the hn and ln treatments based on the contour charts fig 4b and d the whole regimes of the hn and ln treatments were co regulated where g s was higher with the increased swc water supply and decreased vpd atmospheric evaporative demand the co regulation pattern indicated that g s was not determined by a single factor even if the water supply was sufficient maize stomata might be closed due to excessive atmospheric evaporative demand while stomata still kept opening due to the low atmospheric evaporative demand under the condition of water restriction different nitrogen applications altered the pattern of the co regulated regimes of g s response to swc and vpd fig 4b and d specifically when the water supply was sufficient g s was more dominated by vpd in the hn treatment than the ln treatment and g s of the hn treatment was higher than that of the ln treatment at the identical swc or vpd fig 4e suggesting that nitrogen stress had significant adverse effects on stomatal development 3 3 the relationships between yield and et with stomatal conductance pca revealed the multiple correlated relationships between g s with both growth and yield traits with the first two trait axes accounting for 89 2 of the total traits variance in eight treatments fig 5 pc1 explained 73 7 of total variation and had a positive association with traits like g s t r et agb yield tkw kn and hi thus pc1 tended to represent the traits of yield and water use alternatively pc2 explained 15 5 of total variation and was positively and negatively associated with wp c and swc respectively five treatments fhn fln midhn midln modhn were separated from those with high scoring in the pc1 according to the pca and ca figs 5 and s4 g s t r agb yield tkw kn et and hi were positively correlated with each other the correlations between g s with et and agb as well as between et and agb were markedly high fig 6 when et and agb were above 487 95 mm and 32 8 mg ha 1 respectively there was a slight negative effect of et and agb on yield while below this threshold yield was more sensitive to the decline of et and agb fig 7a and b yield was also significantly positively related to hi fig 7c wp c was significant positively and negatively correlated with et below and above 486 40 mm respectively whereas there was no significant relationship with yield fig 8 4 discussion although drought and nitrogen limiting crop productivity have been well described physiological mechanisms of crop responses to water and nitrogen stress remain elucidated we examined the variations of g s yield et and wp c of maize and analyzed the relationships between g s with both swc and vpd and between g s with yield et and wp c under different water and nitrogen conditions we found that drought reduced g s as exacerbated by nitrogen stress fig 2 transpiration was dominated by stomatal conductance and this dominance was intensified by drought and nitrogen stress fig 3 the coordination of g s by swc and vpd was affected by nitrogen supply fig 4 yield was indirectly coordinated by g s through both et and agb and directly by hi but excessive water consumption did not result in higher yield instead reduced water productivity under different water and nitrogen stress figs 6 8 4 1 coordination of stomatal conductance by swc and vpd is affected by nitrogen supply a larger 1 ω represents a stronger coupling relationship between maize canopy and aero environment jiao et al 2018 the value of 1 ω closing to 1 0 means that evapotranspiration or transpiration is controlled by vpd and 1 ω approaching 0 represents that evapotranspiration or transpiration is controlled by r n jia et al 2016 tian et al 2017 in this study we found that the average value of 1 ω of each treatment in the reproductive and maturation stages of maize were between 0 523 and 0 654 where the value was significantly increased by drought and nitrogen stress fig 3 these results are attributed to the inhibited canopy development and the increased coupling of leaf and aero environment indicating that the aerodynamically rough surface under drought and nitrogen stress induces further turbulent transfer and air with high vpd is transferred more effectively to the leaf transpiring surface resulting in well coupling of transpiration with ambient air the reduced g s in conjunction with leaf water potential relative water content and leaf hydraulic conductance resists excessive water loss and avoids dangerous xylem tension under stress blackman et al 2009 gleason et al 2019 henry et al 2019 meinzer et al 2009 indeed we found that maize g s declined continuously in response to the reduced soil available water fig 4b d and e this is probably because roots have difficulty extracting enough water from arid soils to meet the plant s carbon metabolism and assimilation demands leading to reduced water potential and cell turgor which decrease the g s blackman et al 2009 tardieu et al 2018 to maintain moisture plants produce hormone signals e g aba and h2o2 and osmotic substances e g proline and glycine betaine for hydraulic and osmotic adjustment and induce stomata closure to reduce transpiration and maintain turgor buckley 2019 foreman et al 2003 gupta et al 2020 wang et al 2017 as long as the stressed plant has not reached the wilting water state or the turgor loss point the stomata would reopen after rewatering and the hydraulic conductivity and gas exchange would be recovered blackman et al 2009 li et al 2016 miyashita et al 2005 of course the role of vpd cannot be ignored even if the swc reaches the wilting point plants keep transpiring in low vpd conditions zhang et al 2021 our results proved that although grown in low soil moisture maize stomata still increased with reduced vpd while plants might not undergo water stress when swc and vpd were relatively low fig 4b d and e g s in specific swc and vpd conditions under ln treatment were lower than hn treatment suggesting that nitrogen limitation in the growing season leaded to lower maximum stomatal conductance g smax or g s fig 4e this is probably because the long term insufficient nitrogen supply causes irreversible damage to plant nutrient tissues and cells and negatively affects the stomatal development e g stomatal density and stomatal size and thus reduces the g smax and g s franks et al 2009 gleason et al 2021 2017 this long term acclimation is generally considered to be irreversible 4 2 stomatal conductance drives variations of yield and et and might be used as a physiological indicator to schedule precision irrigation and fertilization limited nitrogen and drought have been the leading causes of crop yield reduction leng and hall 2019 yuan et al 2019 but the physiological bases are not fully understood zhang et al 2017 the high correlation between g s and crop production leads to the complex relationship mentioned above g s drove agb through et under the two nitrogen treatments fig 6 as water in the root zone is transmitted through the xylem to the stomata to drive transpiration and photosynthesis for carbon assimilation gleason et al 2021 2017 this is also proved by the absolute dominance of stomata on leaf transpiration fig 3 and the overwhelming proportion of transpiration in et ding et al 2013 g s throughout the day supports the accumulation of maize daily net biomass and the increase in it and photosynthesis tends to produce more water absorption and convert it into more biomass condon et al 2004 gleason et al 2021 long et al 2015 the conversion of more water consumption into higher agb for high yield and wp c was limited to a certain threshold beyond which yield stagnated and water productivity decreased figs 7 and 8a as a result mid treatment had the highest wp c because it maximizes water productivity fig 1f which might be that mild water deficit enhances roots to absorb water from the root zone soil more efficiently to meet growth demands chai et al 2015 also due to water transport more efficiently to the stoma to drive more efficient photosynthesis biomass and yield can be maintained or increased gleason et al 2021 2017 when suffering from severe drought deficit and nitrogen stress maize yield formation was directly limited by reducing et and agb and indirectly by g s the coordination relationship between g s and grain yield proves the rationality of screening high yield genotypes or agronomic managements through g s high throughput phenotyping and stress diagnosis techniques such as infrared thermometry and the crop water stress index have been widely proposed and applied to guide crop irrigation under stress briglia et al 2019 gu et al 2021 han et al 2018 a plant centric supply demand dynamic sdd irrigation scheme was proposed based on co regulated pattern and model simulations for current and future climate conditions contributing to sustainable water use and bringing benefits zhang et al 2021 however proposing a dynamic soil moisture management threshold that varies with vpd is an urgent and challenging task and validation of simulation results also requires time and cost for further discussion this study provides a more physiologically based indicator g s to schedule precision irrigation and fertilization 5 conclusions water deficit reduced stomatal conductance as intensified by nitrogen stress stomatal conductance was co regulated by both soil water content and vapor pressure deficit while it was more dominated by vapor pressure deficit in the high nitrogen treatment when faced with sufficient water supply than the low nitrogen treatment moreover transpiration was dominated by stomatal conductance which was affected by drought and nitrogen stress yield was regulated by stomatal conductance via water use and aboveground biomass and harvest index under water and nitrogen stress while excessive water consumption did not result in higher yield but reduced water productivity field management optimization

water and nitrogen n are the two main factors limiting crops productivity cossani and sadras 2018 the availability and acquisition of water and nitrogen are the resources that define the limits of crop grain yields foley et al 2011 current yield trends are insufficient to meet the double food demand by 2050 ray et al 2013 crop yield loss due to drought is an increasing threat to agriculture worldwide lobell et al 2020 also yield increases are closely dependent on nitrogen accumulation an essential and quantitative component of seeds sinclair et al 2019 nitrogen acquisition is

essential for new cell formation sadras et al 2016 vegetative development and growth depend on the plant s acquisition of new nitrogen as internal reserve pools are relatively small and able to sustain only slow growth for brief periods of several days cossani and sadras 2019 during reproductive development limited nitrogen supply would increase flower abortion diminish seed set and decrease seed growth ciampitti and vyn 2012 lemaire et al 2021 however physiological mechanisms of crop responses to water and nitrogen stress remain to be elucidated leaf transpiration is tightly connected with crop productivity as it executes photosynthesis to assimilate organic matter through the stomata of leaves at the same time pieruschka et al 2010 transpiration accounts for about 85 of the evapotranspiration in maize fields with soil surface mulched by the plastic film ding et al 2013 stomatal conductance g s has a direct impact on transpiration since the strong coupling between the crop canopy and the atmosphere nakai et al 2013 sobenko et al 2018 trepekli et al 2016 however few studies have quantified the effect of g s on leaf transpiration for maize growing in different water and nitrogen conditions in the field stomatal conductance is regulated by balancing soil water supply and atmospheric evaporative demand for plants in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac system atmospheric drought drives plants to diffuse moisture through stomata and the soil moisture is used to meet this demand of plants in this passive process kimm et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 severe soil

maturation stages figs 2 and s3 g s of fhn fln and midhn treatments were higher than other treatments followed by modhn midln modln sdhn and sdln treatments fig 2e there was a strong couple between maize canopy and aero environment with the average 1 ω values being all greater than 0 5 fig 3 drought and nitrogen limitation increased the value of 1 ω with the sdln treatment being the highest followed by sdhn modln modhn midln midhn fln and fhn treatments suggesting the dominance of g s on transpiration was exacerbated by drought and nitrogen stress fig 3e 3 2 the responses of stomatal conductance to swc and vpd under water and nitrogen stress fig 4 showed the co regulation of swc and vpd on g s in the hn and ln treatments based on the contour charts fig 4b and d the whole regimes of the hn and ln treatments were co regulated where g s was higher with the increased swc water supply and decreased vpd atmospheric evaporative demand the co regulation pattern indicated that g s was not determined by a single factor even if the water supply was sufficient maize stomata might be closed due to excessive atmospheric evaporative demand while stomata still kept opening due to the low atmospheric evaporative demand under the condition of water restriction different nitrogen applications altered the pattern of the co regulated regimes of g s response to swc and vpd fig 4b and d specifically when the water supply was sufficient g s was more dominated by vpd in the hn treatment than the ln treatment and g s of the hn treatment was higher than that of the ln treatment at the identical swc or vpd fig 4e suggesting that nitrogen stress had significant adverse effects on stomatal development 3 3 the relationships between yield and et with stomatal conductance pca revealed the multiple correlated relationships between g s with both growth and yield traits with the first two trait axes accounting for 89 2 of the total traits variance in eight treatments fig 5 pc1 explained 73 7 of total variation and had a positive association with traits like g s t r et agb yield tkw kn and hi thus pc1 tended to represent the traits of yield and water use alternatively pc2 explained 15 5 of total variation and was positively and negatively associated with wp c and swc respectively five treatments fhn fln midhn midln modhn were separated from those with high scoring in the pc1 according to the pca and ca figs 5 and s4 g s t r agb yield tkw kn et and hi were positively correlated with each other the correlations between g s with et and agb as well as between et and agb were markedly high fig 6 when et and agb were above 487 95 mm and 32 8 mg ha 1 respectively there was a slight negative effect of et and agb on yield while below this threshold yield was more sensitive to the decline of et and agb fig 7a and b yield was also significantly positively related to hi fig 7c wp c was significant positively and negatively correlated with et below and above 486 40 mm respectively whereas there was no significant relationship with yield fig 8 4 discussion although drought and nitrogen limiting crop productivity have been well described physiological mechanisms of crop responses to water and nitrogen stress remain elucidated we examined the variations of g s yield et and wp c of maize and analyzed the relationships between g s with both swc and vpd and between g s with yield et and wp c under different water and nitrogen conditions we found that drought reduced g s as exacerbated by nitrogen stress fig 2 transpiration was dominated by stomatal conductance and this dominance was intensified by drought and nitrogen stress fig 3 the coordination of g s by swc and vpd was affected by nitrogen supply fig 4 yield was indirectly coordinated by g s through both et and agb and directly by hi but excessive water consumption did not result in higher yield instead reduced water productivity under different water and nitrogen stress figs 6 8 4 1 coordination of stomatal conductance by swc and vpd is affected by nitrogen supply a larger 1 ω represents a stronger coupling relationship between maize canopy and aero environment jiao et al 2018 the value of 1 ω closing to 1 0 means that evapotranspiration or transpiration is controlled by vpd and 1 ω approaching 0 represents that evapotranspiration or transpiration is controlled by r n jia et al 2016 tian et al 2017 in this study we found that the average value of 1 ω of each treatment in the reproductive and maturation stages of maize were between 0 523 and 0 654 where the value was significantly increased by drought and nitrogen stress fig 3 these results are attributed to the inhibited canopy development and the increased coupling of leaf and aero environment indicating that the aerodynamically rough surface under drought and nitrogen stress induces further turbulent transfer and air with high vpd is transferred more effectively to the leaf transpiring surface resulting in well coupling of transpiration with ambient air the reduced g s in conjunction with leaf water potential relative water content and leaf hydraulic conductance resists excessive water loss and avoids dangerous xylem tension under stress blackman et al 2009 gleason et al 2019 henry et al 2019 meinzer et al 2009 indeed we found that maize g s declined continuously in response to the reduced soil available water fig 4b d and e this is probably because roots have difficulty extracting enough water from arid soils to meet the plant s carbon metabolism and assimilation demands leading to reduced water potential and cell turgor which decrease the g s blackman et al 2009 tardieu et al 2018 to maintain moisture plants produce hormone signals e g aba and h2o2 and osmotic substances e g proline and glycine betaine for hydraulic and osmotic adjustment and induce stomata closure to reduce transpiration and maintain turgor buckley 2019 foreman et al 2003 gupta et al 2020 wang et al 2017 as long as the stressed plant has not reached the wilting water state or the turgor loss point the stomata would reopen after rewatering and the hydraulic conductivity and gas exchange would be recovered blackman et al 2009 li et al 2016 miyashita et al 2005 of course the role of vpd cannot be ignored even if the swc reaches the wilting point plants keep transpiring in low vpd conditions zhang et al 2021 our results proved that although grown in low soil moisture maize stomata still increased with reduced vpd while plants might not undergo water stress when swc and vpd were relatively low fig 4b d and e g s in specific swc and vpd conditions under ln treatment were lower than hn treatment suggesting that nitrogen limitation in the growing season leaded to lower maximum stomatal conductance g smax or g s fig 4e this is probably because the long term insufficient nitrogen supply causes irreversible damage to plant nutrient tissues and cells and negatively affects the stomatal development e g stomatal density and stomatal size and thus reduces the g smax and g s franks et al 2009 gleason et al 2021 2017 this long term acclimation is generally considered to be irreversible 4 2 stomatal conductance drives variations of yield and et and might be used as a physiological indicator to schedule precision irrigation and fertilization limited nitrogen and drought have been the leading causes of crop yield reduction leng and hall 2019 yuan et al 2019 but the physiological bases are not fully understood zhang et al 2017 the high correlation between g s and crop production leads to the complex relationship mentioned above g s drove agb through et under the two nitrogen treatments fig 6 as water in the root zone is transmitted through the xylem to the stomata to drive transpiration and photosynthesis for carbon assimilation gleason et al 2021 2017 this is also proved by the absolute dominance of stomata on leaf transpiration fig 3 and the overwhelming proportion of transpiration in et ding et al 2013 g s throughout the day supports the accumulation of maize daily net biomass and the increase in it and photosynthesis tends to produce more water absorption and convert it into more biomass condon et al 2004 gleason et al 2021 long et al 2015 the conversion of more water consumption into higher agb for high yield and wp c was limited to a certain threshold beyond which yield stagnated and water productivity decreased figs 7 and 8a as a result mid treatment had the highest wp c because it maximizes water productivity fig 1f which might be that mild water deficit enhances roots to absorb water from the root zone soil more efficiently to meet growth demands chai et al 2015 also due to water transport more efficiently to the stoma to drive more efficient photosynthesis biomass and yield can be maintained or increased gleason et al 2021 2017 when suffering from severe drought deficit and nitrogen stress maize yield formation was directly limited by reducing et and agb and indirectly by g s the coordination relationship between g s and grain yield proves the rationality of screening high yield genotypes or agronomic managements through g s high throughput phenotyping and stress diagnosis techniques such as infrared thermometry and the crop water stress index have been widely proposed and applied to guide crop irrigation under stress briglia et al 2019 gu et al 2021 han et al 2018 a plant centric supply demand dynamic sdd irrigation scheme was proposed based on co regulated pattern and model simulations for current and future climate conditions contributing to sustainable water use and bringing benefits zhang et al 2021 however proposing a dynamic soil moisture management threshold that varies with vpd is an urgent and challenging task and validation of simulation results also requires time and cost for further discussion this study provides a more physiologically based indicator g s to schedule precision irrigation and fertilization 5 conclusions water deficit reduced stomatal conductance as intensified by nitrogen stress stomatal conductance was co regulated by both soil water content and vapor pressure deficit while it was more dominated by vapor pressure deficit in the high nitrogen treatment when faced with sufficient water supply than the low nitrogen treatment moreover transpiration was dominated by stomatal conductance which was affected by drought and nitrogen stress yield was regulated by stomatal conductance via water use and aboveground biomass and harvest index under water and nitrogen stress while excessive water consumption did not result in higher yield but reduced water productivity field management optimization

9508,drought is the leading cause of low and unstable wheat yield in dryland the field experiment was performed from 2009 to 2017 in the eastern part of loess plateau china to study the effect of tillage deep ploughing dp and no tillage nt and seasonal variation in precipitation on soil moisture and root traits and grain yield of wheat in dry seasons soil water content root length surface density rlsd and root diameter peaked at 60 cm depth but in the normal wet seasons peaked at 40 cm depth the reduction of rlsd at anthesis by drought was 44 under nt and 29 with dp while the reduction in above ground dry weight was 67 under nt and 56 under dp more soil water was depleted from the deep soil layer 80 100 cm depth than that in the shallow layer 20 60 cm depth from jointing in the dry seasons and from anthesis in the normal wet seasons the higher amount of effective in seasonal rainfall in the dry seasons increased rlsd at anthesis by 44 with nt and 21 with dp and increased grain yield by 24 1 under nt and 14 2 under dp the average grain yield in the dry seasons was 28 41 lower than in the normal wet seasons the average water use efficiency wue in the dry seasons was 42 54 lower than that in the normal wet seasons wue with dp was 32 higher than that with nt in the dry seasons while it was 15 higher than that with nt in the normal wet seasons the average contribution rates of soil water content at sowing to grain yield under dp and nt were 23 25 in the dry seasons and 52 53 in the normal wet seasons thus deep ploughing in summer fallow should be adopted for high water storage and yield stability keyword seasonal variation of rainfall winter wheat soil water content root growth distribution grain yield 1 introduction driven by a growing world population demand for cereal production is predicted to increase by 30 to 50 in 2050 relative to 2005 alexandratos and zhu 2012 wheat triticum aestivum l is the third most grown crop globally and feeds about 30 of the world s population winter wheat is one of the main food crops in the arid area of the loess plateau accounting for 44 of the total cultivated land area in the northwestern china and plays an important role in food security xue et al 2019 precipitation in the arid area of the loess plateau is the sole water source for wheat production the average annual rainfall is 501 6 mm over the last 30 years and approximately 55 275 mm occurs in summer fallow from july to september and evaporation in summer fallow is large approximately 45 225 mm of annual precipitation occurs during the winter wheat growth period inadequate and variable rainfall often results in inadequate soil water at sowing leading to drought stress in the growing period this is the main factor that results in low and unstable winter wheat yield du et al 2015 therefore it is essential to use water saving practices to efficiently store rain water in soil and to meet the demand for the growth and development of winter wheat shao et al 2011 several tillage techniques have been used in summer fallow for rain harvesting in rain fed regions of china wang et al 2016 long term practice of no tillage and shallow tillage has resulted in the formation of hardpan and subsoil compaction which restrict root penetration and reduced water and nutrient uptake from deep soil layers deep tillage and subsoiling could break the compacted layers underneath the plough layer decrease soil bulk density 0 40 cm soil layer effectively retain rainwater in soil and increase soil water content in the wheat field compared with no or reduced tillage leading to the increase in grain yield of wheat by 31 in the loess plateau jin et al 2007 temesgen et al 2009 wang et al 2012 subsoiling is another effective technique of tillage to increase soil water storage in summer fallow and water use efficiency of winter wheat wang et al 2004 wang et al 2014 sang et al 2016 our long term study in the loess plateau showed that deep ploughing and subsoiling in summer fallow mitigates soil compaction by loosening shallow soil and breaking plough pan and increased the soil water storage at 0 300 cm layers by 8 sun et al 2018 xue et al 2019 in the dryland of wheat production wheat yield has been found to be linearly correlated to the soil water content at planting musick et al 1994 water storage during summer fallow also plays a major role in yield production in the dryland of the loess plateau zhang et al 2008 wang shangguan 2015 furthermore rainfall during the critical growth stages of wheat plays an important role in yield production as well for instance rainfall in the prewintering and jointing stages has been shown to be essential for strong growth of winter wheat hatfield and christian 2018 rainfall before anthesis is critical for high yield while precipitation after anthesis shows a low impact on yield li et al 2019 the growth and yield of wheat depend on the absorption of water and nutrients through the root system while the limiting water condition restricts root growth and nutrients uptake spedding et al 2004 zhang et al 2014 root growth could be improved by modifying physical conditions and moisture content of soil by tillage practices costa et al 2010 dusserre et al 2012 therefore a proper tillage practice can increase soil water retention and water storage capacity and thus improve root growth lampurlanés et al 2001 tillage can increase the length of finer roots leading to the larger absorption area of roots karunatilake et al 2000 however there has been no long term study on effects of deep ploughing in summer fallow on soil water storage and growth and distribution of winter wheat roots in the soil profile conventional techniques for root study are destructive and need to excavate roots from the field extract roots from soil and quantify roots by scanning and image analysis gregory et al 2009 it is time consuming and tedious now non destructive techniques such as minirhizotron are available minirhizotron allows rapid dynamic measurements of root growth in field chen et al 2020 as the effects of deep ploughing on root growth and distribution of winter wheat are largely unknown we studied the effects of deep ploughing in summer fallow on soil moisture at sowing and during the growth of winter wheat and the effects of deep ploughing on root growth and distribution of winter wheat over eight years by using minirhizotron our objectives were 1 to examine effects of deep tillage on soil water content at sowing and during plant growth in dry and normal wet seasons 2 to assess effects of deep tillage on growth and distribution of roots in 0 100 cm depth during plant growth in dry and normal wet seasons 3 to evaluate in season rainfall on growth and distribution of roots in 0 100 cm depth in the dry seasons and 4 to evaluate effects of deep ploughing on yield and water use efficiency in dry and normal wet seasons and the contributions of soil water content at sowing to yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and experimental design field experiment was carried out at research farm 34 35 n 110 15 e of shanxi agriculture university in wenxi shanxi province of china from july 2009 to june 2017 the experimental site is semi arid area of loess plateau the altitude of wenxi experimental site is 784 m the average temperature is 14 3 c and average annual precipitation was 516 mm from 1980 to 2017 the soil table 1 at site was classified as calcareous cinnamon soil according to the classification defined by international soil science society isss precipitation data was obtained from meteorological station of wenxi agriculture and rural department located near the experimental field fig 1 eight seasons from 2009 to 2017 are classified into two groups based on the amount of rainfall in summer fallow fig 1 the classification was based on the 30 year average of rainfall 275 mm the season is classified as a dry season when rainfall in summer fallow is below 15 of the 30 year average and a wet season when rainfall is above 15 of 30 year average wu et al 2008 as shown in fig 1 the four seasons 2009 10 2012 13 2015 16 and 2016 17 had summer fallow rainfall at least 18 6 below the 30 year average and therefore are classified as dry seasons whereas the remaining three years 2010 11 2013 14 and 2014 15 had summer fallow rainfall from 5 85 to 14 47 above the 30 year average are classified as normal seasons the rainfall in summer fallow of 2011 12 was 48 16 above the 30 year average an is classified as a wet year when the soil water content of eight years at five growth stages were plotted the four dry years form one group while the three normal years and one wet year form another group supplementary fig 1 which is consistent with the classification of eight cropping years based on the precipitation in summer fallow fig 1 as rainfall after anthesis shows little impact on the growth of winter wheat and yield in the region li et al 2019 the amount of rainfall from sowing to anthesis is considered as effective in season rainfall the dry and normal wet years were further divided on the base of rainfall from sowing to anthesis effective in season rainfall two of the four dry seasons had the effective in season rainfall of 67 mm sf171gp67 in 2012 13 and 111 mm sf173gp111 in 2009 10 which is lower than the 30 year average rainfall from sowing to anthesis whereas the other two years sf165gp190 in 2016 17 and s95g169 in 2015 16 had the normal in season rainfall of 190 and 169 mm respectively for the four normal wet seasons the effective in season rainfall was 186 mm sf460g186 in 2011 12 68 sf402gp68 2010 11 127 mm s284g127 in 2013 14 and 134 mm s366g134 in 2014 15 respectively in each cropping season the stubble of 20 30 cm was left in the field after harvesting previous winter wheat in early june to reduce water evaporation two tillage practices were carried out before summer fallow i e no tillage nt and deep ploughing dp as described by sun et al 2018 three blocks of land next to each other were used for three tillage treatments nt dp and subsoiling and three tillage practices were rotated every three years in each block each block of land consisted of three replicates subsoiling was not included in the present study plot size was 6 m 50 m fig 2 the dp treatment was carried out with ploughing machine wheat stubble and a half of organic fertilizer 1500 kg ha 1 were ploughed to 25 30 cm depth to increase soil organic carbon no organic fertilizer was added in no tillage in the beginning of summer fallow in the end of august rotary tillage and land leveling were conducted for dp and nt to conserve soil water and prepare the land of planting before sowing the other half of organic matter fertilizer 1500 kg ha 1 was applied to the dp treatment the half of organic matter fertilizer was applied at the beginning of summer fallow and the full amount of organic matter fertilizer 3000 kg ha 1 was applied for the nt treatment inorganic fertilizers of n fertilizer 150 kg n ha 1 as urea which contains 46 n of 150 kg p ha 1 as triple super phosphate 16 p2o5 and 75 kg k ha 1 as potassium chloride 50 k2o were spread uniformly and tilled in the top soil layer of 15 cm winter wheat seeds cultivar yunhan 20410 were sown in early october by drilling sowing using a planting machine and harvested in early june of the following year the seeding rate was 90 kg ha 1 dates and details for winter wheat tillage sowing pesticide is shown in table 2 herbicides and insecticides were applied once in spring one spray for controlling three problems was also applied at anthesis stage which was a combination of pesticides fungicides plant growth regulators and micro fertilizer to prevent diseases insects and premature plant aging no irrigation was applied during the whole experiment 2 2 soil water content measurements gravimetric soil moisture gsw was determined from 100 cm depth after every 20 cm at sowing prewintering jointing anthesis and maturity three random soil samples were taken from each plot between plant rows using an auger 3 cm in diameter 20 cm soil samples were put into the aluminum boxes weighed for fresh weight fw and dried in an oven at 105 for 72 h for dry weight dw gsw for a given layer was calculated as follows gsw fw dw dw 100 2 3 roots measurements two holes were drilled with an auger 7 cm diameter at a 45 angle from horizontal in the middle of two rows for each plot after the land preparation and then minirhizotron tubes were inserted in the holes fig 2 the above ground part of each tube was covered with insulation foil to prevent light and heat image were taken at 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil depths at prewintering jointing anthesis and maturity root imaging was performed with the minirhizotron scanning using ci 600 root scanner cid bio science camas wa usa at 300 dpi root images were processed using the smart root software winrhizo tron for the measurement of root length and root diameter 2 4 plant dry weight and grain yield plant material was sampled at prewintering jointing anthesis and maturity table 3 from each plot an area of 1 m2 was harvested by cutting plants at the ground level harvested plants were dried at 75 c for 48 h and weighted at maturity plants of 5 m2 were harvested from each plot for grain yield 2 5 water use efficiency wue wue kg ha 1mm 1 was calculated as follows wue y et y is grain yield kg ha 1 and et p δsws et mm is total evapotranspiration calculated over the whole growing season sowing to maturity p mm is the amount of precipitation in the whole experimental year and δsws mm is the difference in the soil water storage between the beginning and the end of the season 2 6 statistical analyses significant differences were calculated using analysis of variance anova and least significant differences lsd 3 results 3 1 effects of rainfall variation in summer fallow and the growing period of winter wheat on soil water content the average soil water content in 0 100 cm depth at sowing was 19 2 in nt and 22 6 in dp in the dry seasons and 35 7 in nt and 37 5 in dp in the normal wet seasons fig 3 the soil water content in the normal wet seasons at sowing was at least 15 higher than that of nt or dp in the dry seasons in comparison between two tillage practices the soil water content under dp was 1 8 higher than that of nt for the normal wet seasons while in the dry seasons the average soil water content under dp was 3 4 higher than at nt these results indicate that precipitation in summer fallow promotes the recovery of soil water in dryland leading to the increase in the soil water content at sowing deep ploughing results in the higher soil water content than no tillage especially in dry seasons the average soil water content in both dry and normal wet seasons gradually decreased with the progress of plant development stage the average soil water content from sowing to the prewintering stage was reduced by 1 2 in nt and 2 0 in dp in the dry seasons but it was reduced by 4 5 in nt and 3 9 in dp in the four normal wet seasons fig 3 at anthesis the average soil water content reduced by 14 3 in nt and 14 9 in dp in the normal wet seasons but it was reduced by 6 9 in nt and 8 1 in dp in the dry seasons the average soil water content in the normal wet seasons at anthesis was at least 8 2 higher than that of nt or dp in the dry seasons fig 3 these results show that the difference in soil water consumption between dp and nt is small at prewintering and anthesis stages for both dry and normal wet years the low level of soil water consumption is found at the prewintering stage in both dry and normal wet years but soil water consumption in the normal wet years at anthesis is almost doubled relative to that in the dry years the rainfall in growing season affected soil water content the higher effective in season rainfall i e growth season rainfall excluding rainfall after anthesis in 2015 16 than in 2012 13 led to the significantly 2 1 higher soil water content of 0 100 cm depth at the prewintering stage in nt than that in 2012 13 fig 4a similarly the higher effective in season rainfall in the 2016 17 led to the significantly higher soil water content at prewintering jointing anthesis and maturity in both dp and nt than that in the2009 10 season at anthesis the higher in season rainfall in 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons led to the significantly higher soil water content in nt than that in 2012 13 and 2009 10 seasons while the higher in season rainfall in the 2016 17season led to the significantly higher content of soil water at 0 100 cm depth in dp than that in the 2009 10 season these results indicate that in the dry seasons the in season rainfall could reduce the depletion in soil water content depending on growth stages and tillage practices in wet normal years the difference in soil water content was less affected by in season rainfall fig 4b although the in season rainfall in 2013 14 was less in 2014 15 and 2010 11 these results indicate that the in season rainfall is beneficial in the dry seasons for the improvement of soil water status in both nt and dp treatments whereas in the normal wet seasons the in season rainfall shows little benefit soil water distribution in 0 100 cm depth at 20 cm intervals was determined at five growth stages in the dry and normal wet seasons table 3 the soil water content was gradually increased from 20 cm to 60 cm depth in the dry seasons and from 20 cm to 40 cm in the normal wet seasons and then decreased with the depth in addition the reduction of soil water content in different depths varied with growth stages the soil water content from jointing to anthesis showed 2 and 2 8 reduction with nt and 2 7 and 3 9 with dp in the dry seasons while in the normal wet season showed 6 4 and 6 8 reduction with nt and 6 9 and 7 1 with dp at 20 60 and 80 100 cm depth respectively the soil water content in the dry seasons from anthesis to maturity showed 2 4 and 3 5 reduction at 20 60 and 80 100 cm depth with nt respectively and 3 1 and 4 1 with dp fig 5 in comparison the soil water content in the normal wet seasons from anthesis to maturity was reduced by 3 0 and 7 6 in 20 60 cm and 80 100 cm depth with nt respectively and 2 6 and 7 3 with dp these results indicate that more soil water was depleted from the deep soil layer 80 100 cm depth than that in the shallow layer 20 60 cm depth from jointing to anthesis and anthesis to maturity in the dry season and from anthesis to maturity in the normal wet seasons 3 2 effects of rainfall variation in summer fallow and the growing period of winter wheat on above ground growth the average above ground dry weight in the dry seasons at prewintering was 21 and 42 less than that in the normal wet seasons under nt and dp respectively fig 6a the substantial reduction in above ground dry weight at anthesis due to the lower rainfall in summer fallow was 33 with nt and 45 with dp the average above ground dry weight in dp and was 15 34 higher in the dry years than that in nt across all growth stages and 53 172 higher in the normal wet years than that in nt across all growth stages in the dry seasons the low rainfall in summer fallow reduced above ground dry weight at anthesis by 67 with nt and by 56 with dp these results indicate that the amount of rainfall significantly affects the accumulation of above ground dry weight and reduction of dry matter can be appropriately reduced by dp especially in the dry seasons the higher effective in season rainfall in the dry seasons increased the above ground dry weight fig 6b above ground dry weight across all four growth stages in both nt and dp was significantly higher in 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons with 169 and 190 mm in season rainfall relative to 67 and 111 mm in 2012 13 and 2009 10 seasons the above ground dry weight at anthesis in 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons was 24 27 higher than that in 2012 13 and 2009 10 seasons with nt whereas the above ground dry weight in 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons was 13 15 higher than that in 2012 13 and 2009 10 seasons with dp these results indicate that the higher amount of effective in seasonal rainfall in the dry seasons is valuable leading to the increase in the above ground dry weight 3 3 effects of rainfall variation in summer fallow and the growing period of winter wheat on root length surface density the average root length surface density rlsd at the normal wet seasons was higher than the dry seasons at all growth stages fig 6c at the prewintering stage rlsd at the normal wet seasons was 2 5 fold and 1 8 fold higher than the dry seasons with nt and dp respectively the reduction of rlsd at anthesis by drought was 44 with nt and 29 with dp which was much lower than the reduction in above ground dry weight fig 6c these results indicate that the low rainfall in summer fallow promotes root growth relative to shoot growth the average root length surface density rlsd under dp at all growth stages were 29 42 and 17 24 higher than that under nt in the dry and normal wet seasons respectively these results show that dp can greatly reduce the reduction rate of rlsd relative to nt the higher in season rainfall of 169 mm in 2015 16 and 190 mm in 2016 17 significantly increased the rlsd relative to that in 2012 13 and 2009 10 seasons with the in season rainfall of 67 and 111 mm under both nt and dp fig 6d at anthesis the average rlsd in 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons was 43 7 higher than that in 2012 13 and 2009 10 seasons under nt and 20 8 higher under dp these results indicate that the higher amount of effective in seasonal rainfall increase rlsd at anthesis furthermore the distribution of rlsd in 0 100 depth at 20 cm intervals was examined at four growth stages in the dry fig 7a d and normal wet seasons fig 7e h at all growth stages rlsd in both tillage practices gradually increased with soil depth reached the peak at 60 cm in dry seasons and at 40 cm depth in the normal wet seasons and then decreased gradually in comparison between two tillage practices dp significantly increased rlsd relative to nt at all depths and growth stages thus low rainfall in summer fallow promotes roots growth in deeper layers relative to the normal wet seasons from the prewintering stage onwards and rlsd with dp in the dry seasons was much higher than that in the normal wet seasons the root abundance in terms of rlsd decreases to 50 in the depth below 60 cm in the dry seasons or below 40 cm in the normal wet seasons these results show that the roots in summer fallow with low rainfall grow 20 cm deeper relative to those with normal rainfall from the prewintering stage onwards 3 4 effects of rainfall variation in summer fallow and the growing period of winter wheat on root diameter the average root diameter in 0 100 cm depth increased with plant growth and peaked at anthesis in both tillage practices and in both dry and normal wet seasons fig 6e at all growth stages the root diameter in the dry seasons was higher than the wet normal seasons the average root diameter in the dry seasons under dp was consistently higher than at nt in all growth stages but in the normal wet seasons the difference between dp and nt was not significant these results indicate that the less rainfall in summer fallow increases root diameter under both tillage practices across all growth stages and the dp treatment has larger root diameter than the nt in the dry seasons the higher effective in season rainfall in the dry seasons significantly increased root diameter fig 6f root diameters were higher in the seasons 2015 16 and 2016 17 with higher in season rainfall 169 and 190 mm than the seasons 2012 13 and 2009 10 with less rainfall 67 and 111 mm across four growth stages under both nt and dp the higher amount of effective in seasonal rainfall increased the root diameter in both nt and dp treatments in the years with low summer fallow rainfall and the increase in root diameter was higher at dp than at nt in the dry seasons root diameters in both tillage practices increased from 20 cm depth to 60 cm depth and then decreased at 80 cm to 100 cm depth fig 8a d whereas in the normal wet seasons root diameter increased from 20 cm to 40 cm depth and then gradually decreased fig 8e h two tillage practices in the normal wet seasons had a similar root diameter across four growth stages however in the four dry seasons the significantly larger root diameter was observed at dp than nt across all soil depths these results indicate that the dp treatment could increase root diameter at the 0 60 cm soil depth in the dry season 3 5 effects of rainfall variation in summer fallow and the growing period of winter wheat on grain yield wue and contributions to grain yield the average grain yield in the dry seasons was 41 and 28 lower than that in the normal wet seasons under nt and dp respectively fig 9a in comparison to nt the average grain yield with dp was 1 06 ha 1 higher in the dry seasons and 0 69 t ha 1 higher in the normal wet seasons the higher effective in season rainfall in two of the four dry seasons 169 mm in 2015 16 and 190 mm in 2016 17 significantly increased the grain yield than that in the dry seasons with less in season rainfall 67 mm in 2012 13 and 111 mm in 2009 10 fig 9b the average grain yield in the two seasons with 169 190 mm rainfall was 24 higher than that with 67 111 mm under nt and 14 under dp these results indicate that in dp could reduce the yield losses caused by less summer fallow rainfall and the higher amount of effective in seasonal rainfall in the dry seasons could further narrow the gap the average wue in the dry seasons was 54 and 42 lower than the normal wet seasons under nt and dp respectively fig 9c in comparison to nt the average wue with dp was 32 higher in the dry seasons and 15 higher in the normal wet seasons the higher effective in season rainfall in two dry seasons 169 mm in 2015 16 and 190 mm in 2016 17 significantly increased wue relative to in the two dry seasons with less effective in season rainfall 67 mm in 2012 13 and 111 mm in 2009 10 fig 9d the average wue in the two seasons with 169 190 mm rainfall was 22 5 lower than that with 67 111 mm under nt and 29 8 under dp these results indicate that dp could increase wue compared with nt in both dry and normal wet seasons whereas the higher amount of effective in seasonal rainfall in the dry seasons improving wue is season dependent the average contribution rate of soil water content at sowing to grain yield under nt and dp was 23 and 25 in the dry seasons 52 and 53 in the normal wet seasons respectively fig 9e the average contribution rate of soil water content under dp at sowing to grain yield was similar to that under nt in both dry and normal wet seasons fig 9e the higher effective in season rainfall in two dry seasons 169 mm in 2015 16 and 190 mm in 2016 17 significantly reduced the contribution rate of soil water content at sowing to grain yield relative to that the two dry seasons with less in season rainfall 67 mm in 2012 13 and 111 mm in 2009 10 fig 9e the average contribution rate of soil water content at sowing to grain yield in the two seasons with 169 190 mm rainfall was 6 6 lower than that with 67 111 mm under nt and 8 3 under dp these results indicate that the soil water content at sowing can contribute as much as 50 to grain yield in the normal wet seasons and approximately 25 in the dry seasons the higher effective in season rainfall could increase the contribution rate of soil water content at sowing to grain yield 4 discussion 4 1 rainfall in summer fallow plays a vital role in soil water recovery and yield production in the dryland of the loess plateau china in the loess plateau water consumption during the wheat growth period is around 450 mm liu et al 2002 but the average annual rainfall is 278 mm fig 1 and insufficient for wheat growth and development the soil water accumulation before sowing plays an important role in crop yield wang et al 2018 studies have shown that 47 of wheat yield is dependent on soil storage before sowing huang et al 2003 the current study showed that the average precipitation in the growth season of dryland wheat in the recent 30 years was 158 mm and the range of rainfall in the summer fallow period of eight seasons was 95 460 mm fig 1 the average grain yield with nt and dp in the four normal wet seasons was 38 5 and 44 8 higher than in the four dry seasons respectively it shows that the rainfall in the summer fallow period plays an essential role in soil water recovery before sowing the low rainfall in summer fallow reduces the soil water content at sowing and reduced grain yield of dryland wheat which is consistent with previous research sun et al 2018 xue et al 2019 4 2 root systems grow deeper and thicker in response to drought roots of winter wheat sense changes in soil water content under arid environment and respond by changing metabolic activities and growth of underground and above ground parts of the plant chaves et al 2003 root diameter and root length of winter wheat highly depend on water li et al 2001 the amount of soil water absorbed by plant roots not only depends on the physical characteristics of soil but also soil water has greater influence on the growth features and distribution of roots yang et al 2006 in the current study we found that the root distribution of 0 100 cm was consistent with the water content in the soil the low rainfall in summer fallow promotes roots growth by 20 cm deeper than that in the normal wet seasons as early as the prewintering stage similar studies have shown that most wheat s roots systems are concentrated in the upper 40 cm soil layer and play an important role in water uptake while the depletion of water in the upper soil layer leads to the maximum growth of roots in subsoil xue et al 2003 zhang et al 2004 root distribution mainly occurs in the upper soil profile where the root length surface density rlsd was greater zhang et al 2009 and about 80 of the rlsd was accumulated in the 40 cm topsoil depth under high moisture conditions yuhong et al 2014 under limiting water plants have thicker and fewer roots in the upper layer of soil and more roots in the deeper layer of soil albasha et al 2015 with the progress of plant development soil water content reduces the reduction of soil water in the four normal wet seasons at both prewintering and anthesis stages were higher than that in the four dry seasons fig 3 the average rlsd in the normal wet seasons was 1 8 2 5 fold higher at the prewintering stage and 56 71 higher at anthesis than that in the dry seasons fig 6c in contrast the average root diameter showed an opposite trend root diameter was higher in the dry seasons than in the normal wet seasons at prewintering and anthesis stages fig 6e the lower rainfall in summer fallow reduced the soil water and rlsd but increased rd in very dry years root growth becomes limited due to the deprived water in the deepest horizons of water hindering the development of the root system verónica et al 2010 araki et al 2012 in addition our results showed that in the dry seasons the reduction of soil water in 80 100 cm depth was 0 8 1 2 higher from jointing to anthesis 1 0 1 1 from anthesis to maturity than that in 0 60 cm depth fig 5c e in the normal wet seasons soil water consumption from jointing to anthesis was similar between 0 40 cm depth and 60 100 cm depth however the water consumption was 4 6 4 7 more from anthesis to maturity this shows that with the lower summer fallow rainfall the higher soil water consumption in the deep layer of 80 100 cm proceeds from the jointing stage onwards araki et al 2012 report that water scarcity affects root distribution our results showed that the reduction of rlsd at anthesis by drought was 29 44 which was much lower than that in above ground dry weight 56 67 these results indicate that the low rainfall in summer fallow promotes root growth relative to shoot growth it is essential to use water saving practices to efficiently store soil water in the summer fallow period however the efficient utilization of rainfall during the growing period is also important to attain higher crop productivity shao et al 2011 the precipitation at the key growth stages of wheat i e prewintering jointing and anthesis is closely related to the formation of three yield components especially in the early and mid growth stages verónica et al 2010 show that the key growth stage for developing an optimal root system is tillering which is strongly dependent on the rainfall even though other later growth stages receive little rainfall the root system can develop normally in the current study the lower amount of effective in season rainfall in the two dry seasons reduced soil water content of 0 100 cm from the prewintering stages onwards leading to reduce rlsd by 21 44 and rd by 0 03 0 04 mm at anthesis as a result the above ground dry weight was decreased by 13 27 and grain yield by 14 24 this shows that the less effective precipitation during the growth period impairs wheat growth and reduction of above ground dry weight is higher than that in rlsd a similar result is reported by ali et al 2018 who that the less rainfall 125 mm decreases root length ratios and grain yield compared to the higher rainfall 200 mm and 275 mm especially root length ratios 4 3 deep ploughing conserves soil water in summer fallow and increase root growth and yield production deep ploughing in summer fallow significantly increased winter wheat yields especially in the seasons with the lower summer fallow rainfall four of the eight seasons were low in rainfall showing 50 probability of a dry season thereby measures to harvest rainfall in the soil during the summer fallow period such as deep ploughing could reduce yield losses by improving the storage of soil water for wheat consumption wang et al 2012 ren et al 2019 xue et al 2019 the average soil water content with dp at sowing was 1 8 higher than that with nt the soil water distribution of 0 100 cm showed that the soil layer with the highest soil water content at all growth stages was the same between dp and nt in both dry and normal wet seasons but the reduction of the soil water content of 0 60 cm and 80 100 cm with dp were more than with nt in the four dry seasons our previous study shows that dp improves water retention by removing subsoil compaction and storing water in the subsoil layer which could be utilized during the vegetative stages of wheat plants sun et al 2018 our results also showed that the average grain yield with dp in the four dry seasons increased by 41 4 compared with nt which was higher than that in the normal wet seasons 16 0 a similar trend was observed for wue the average wue with dp increased by 32 compared with nt in the four dry seasons and it was higher in the four normal wet seasons 15 however the contribution of soil water at sowing to grain yield under dp was only slightly higher than that under nt in both dry and normal wet seasons furthermore the average rlsd at all growth stages was higher with dp than with nt in both dry and normal wet seasons and the average above ground dry weight with dp was 15 172 higher than that with nt across all growth stages in addition the reduction of rlsd at anthesis by drought with dp 29 was less than that with nt 44 in contrast the reduction of above ground dry weight at anthesis with dp 56 in the lower rainfall seasons was less than that with nt 67 these results indicate that deep ploughing in summer fallow increases soil water content at sowing which is important for improving plant water consumption and yield 5 conclusion low and variable rainfall limits grain yield of winter wheat in dryland areas deep ploughing in summer fallow increased rainfall storage at sowing contributing to 23 25 grain yield in the dry seasons and 52 53 in the normal wet seasons roots grew 20 cm deeper in the dry seasons than in the normal wet seasons in the dry seasons more soil water was depleted from 80 100 cm depth than from 20 60 cm depth from the jointing stage onwards dp increased soil water content in 0 100 depth until anthesis in the dry seasons relative to nt dp significantly increased rlsd relative to nt at all depths and growth stages leading to 41 yield increase in the dry seasons and 16 in the normal seasons therefore deep ploughing in summer fallow should be adopted for improving rainwater storage and yield

9508,drought is the leading cause of low and unstable wheat yield in dryland the field experiment was performed from 2009 to 2017 in the eastern part of loess plateau china to study the effect of tillage deep ploughing dp and no tillage nt and seasonal variation in precipitation on soil moisture and root traits and grain yield of wheat in dry seasons soil water content root length surface density rlsd and root diameter peaked at 60 cm depth but in the normal wet seasons peaked at 40 cm depth the reduction of rlsd at anthesis by drought was 44 under nt and 29 with dp while the reduction in above ground dry weight was 67 under nt and 56 under dp more soil water was depleted from the deep soil layer 80 100 cm depth than that in the shallow layer 20 60 cm depth from jointing in the dry seasons and from anthesis in the normal wet seasons the higher amount of effective in seasonal rainfall in the dry seasons increased rlsd at anthesis by 44 with nt and 21 with dp and increased grain yield by 24 1 under nt and 14 2 under dp the average grain yield in the dry seasons was 28 41 lower than in the normal wet seasons the average water use efficiency wue in the dry seasons was 42 54 lower than that in the normal wet seasons wue with dp was 32 higher than that with nt in the dry seasons while it was 15 higher than that with nt in the normal wet seasons the average contribution rates of soil water content at sowing to grain yield under dp and nt were 23 25 in the dry seasons and 52 53 in the normal wet seasons thus deep ploughing in summer fallow should be adopted for high water storage and yield stability keyword seasonal variation of rainfall winter wheat soil water content root growth distribution grain yield 1 introduction driven by a growing world population demand for cereal production is predicted to increase by 30 to 50 in 2050 relative to 2005 alexandratos and zhu 2012 wheat triticum aestivum l is the third most grown crop globally and feeds about 30 of the world s population winter wheat is one of the main food crops in the arid area of the loess plateau accounting for 44 of the total cultivated land area in the northwestern china and plays an important role in food security xue et al 2019 precipitation in the arid area of the loess plateau is the sole water source for wheat production the average annual rainfall is 501 6 mm over the last 30 years and approximately 55 275 mm occurs in summer fallow from july to september and evaporation in summer fallow is large approximately 45 225 mm of annual precipitation occurs during the winter wheat growth period inadequate and variable rainfall often results in inadequate soil water at sowing leading to drought stress in the growing period this is the main factor that results in low and unstable winter wheat yield du et al 2015 therefore it is essential to use water saving practices to efficiently store rain water in soil and to meet the demand for the growth and development of winter wheat shao et al 2011 several tillage techniques have been used in summer fallow for rain harvesting in rain fed regions of china wang et al 2016 long term practice of no tillage and shallow tillage has resulted in the formation of hardpan and subsoil compaction which restrict root penetration and reduced water and nutrient uptake from deep soil layers deep tillage and subsoiling could break the compacted layers underneath the plough layer decrease soil bulk density 0 40 cm soil layer effectively retain rainwater in soil and increase soil water content in the wheat field compared with no or reduced tillage leading to the increase in grain yield of wheat by 31 in the loess plateau jin et al 2007 temesgen et al 2009 wang et al 2012 subsoiling is another effective technique of tillage to increase soil water storage in summer fallow and water use efficiency of winter wheat wang et al 2004 wang et al 2014 sang et al 2016 our long term study in the loess plateau showed that deep ploughing and subsoiling in summer fallow mitigates soil compaction by loosening shallow soil and breaking plough pan and increased the soil water storage at 0 300 cm layers by 8 sun et al 2018 xue et al 2019 in the dryland of wheat production wheat yield has been found to be linearly correlated to the soil water content at planting musick et al 1994 water storage during summer fallow also plays a major role in yield production in the dryland of the loess plateau zhang et al 2008 wang shangguan 2015 furthermore rainfall during the critical growth stages of wheat plays an important role in yield production as well for instance rainfall in the prewintering and jointing stages has been shown to be essential for strong growth of winter wheat hatfield and christian 2018 rainfall before anthesis is critical for high yield while precipitation after anthesis shows a low impact on yield li et al 2019 the growth and yield of wheat depend on the absorption of water and nutrients through the root system while the limiting water condition restricts root growth and nutrients uptake spedding et al 2004 zhang et al 2014 root growth could be improved by modifying physical conditions and moisture content of soil by tillage practices costa et al 2010 dusserre et al 2012 therefore a proper tillage practice can increase soil water retention and water storage capacity and thus improve root growth lampurlanés et al 2001 tillage can increase the length of finer roots leading to the larger absorption area of roots karunatilake et al 2000 however there has been no long term study on effects of deep ploughing in summer fallow on soil water storage and growth and distribution of winter wheat roots in the soil profile conventional techniques for root study are destructive and need to excavate roots from the field extract roots from soil and quantify roots by scanning and image analysis gregory et al 2009 it is time consuming and tedious now non destructive techniques such as minirhizotron are available minirhizotron allows rapid dynamic measurements of root growth in field chen et al 2020 as the effects of deep ploughing on root growth and distribution of winter wheat are largely unknown we studied the effects of deep ploughing in summer fallow on soil moisture at sowing and during the growth of winter wheat and the effects of deep ploughing on root growth and distribution of winter wheat over eight years by using minirhizotron our objectives were 1 to examine effects of deep tillage on soil water content at sowing and during plant growth in dry and normal wet seasons 2 to assess effects of deep tillage on growth and distribution of roots in 0 100 cm depth during plant growth in dry and normal wet seasons 3 to evaluate in season rainfall on growth and distribution of roots in 0 100 cm depth in the dry seasons and 4 to evaluate effects of deep ploughing on yield and water use efficiency in dry and normal wet seasons and the contributions of soil water content at sowing to yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and experimental design field experiment was carried out at research farm 34 35 n 110 15 e of shanxi agriculture university in wenxi shanxi province of china from july 2009 to june 2017 the experimental site is semi arid area of loess plateau the altitude of wenxi experimental site is 784 m the average temperature is 14 3 c and average annual precipitation was 516 mm from 1980 to 2017 the soil table 1 at site was classified as calcareous cinnamon soil according to the classification defined by international soil science society isss precipitation data was obtained from meteorological station of wenxi agriculture and rural department located near the experimental field fig 1 eight seasons from 2009 to 2017 are classified into two groups based on the amount of rainfall in summer fallow fig 1 the classification was based on the 30 year average of rainfall 275 mm the season is classified as a dry season when rainfall in summer fallow is below 15 of the 30 year average and a wet season when rainfall is above 15 of 30 year average wu et al 2008 as shown in fig 1 the four seasons 2009 10 2012 13 2015 16 and 2016 17 had summer fallow rainfall at least 18 6 below the 30 year average and therefore are classified as dry seasons whereas the remaining three years 2010 11 2013 14 and 2014 15 had summer fallow rainfall from 5 85 to 14 47 above the 30 year average are classified as normal seasons the rainfall in summer fallow of 2011 12 was 48 16 above the 30 year average an is classified as a wet year when the soil water content of eight years at five growth stages were plotted the four dry years form one group while the three normal years and one wet year form another group supplementary fig 1 which is consistent with the classification of eight cropping years based on the precipitation in summer fallow fig 1 as rainfall after anthesis shows little impact on the growth of winter wheat and yield in the region li et al 2019 the amount of rainfall from sowing to anthesis is considered as effective in season rainfall the dry and normal wet years were further divided on the base of rainfall from sowing to anthesis effective in season rainfall two of the four dry seasons had the effective in season rainfall of 67 mm sf171gp67 in 2012 13 and 111 mm sf173gp111 in 2009 10 which is lower than the 30 year average rainfall from sowing to anthesis whereas the other two years sf165gp190 in 2016 17 and s95g169 in 2015 16 had the normal in season rainfall of 190 and 169 mm respectively for the four normal wet seasons the effective in season rainfall was 186 mm sf460g186 in 2011 12 68 sf402gp68 2010 11 127 mm s284g127 in 2013 14 and 134 mm s366g134 in 2014 15 respectively in each cropping season the stubble of 20 30 cm was left in the field after harvesting previous winter wheat in early june to reduce water evaporation two tillage practices were carried out before summer fallow i e no tillage nt and deep ploughing dp as described by sun et al 2018 three blocks of land next to each other were used for three tillage treatments nt dp and subsoiling and three tillage practices were rotated every three years in each block each block of land consisted of three replicates subsoiling was not included in the present study plot size was 6 m 50 m fig 2 the dp treatment was carried out with ploughing machine wheat stubble and a half of organic fertilizer 1500 kg ha 1 were ploughed to 25 30 cm depth to increase soil organic carbon no organic fertilizer was added in no tillage in the beginning of summer fallow in the end of august rotary tillage and land leveling were conducted for dp and nt to conserve soil water and prepare the land of planting before sowing the other half of organic matter fertilizer 1500 kg ha 1 was applied to the dp treatment the half of organic matter fertilizer was applied at the beginning of summer fallow and the full amount of organic matter fertilizer 3000 kg ha 1 was applied for the nt treatment inorganic fertilizers of n fertilizer 150 kg n ha 1 as urea which contains 46 n of 150 kg p ha 1 as triple super phosphate 16 p2o5 and 75 kg k ha 1 as potassium chloride 50 k2o were spread uniformly and tilled in the top soil layer of 15 cm winter wheat seeds cultivar yunhan 20410 were sown in early october by drilling sowing using a planting machine and harvested in early june of the following year the seeding rate was 90 kg ha 1 dates and details for winter wheat tillage sowing pesticide is shown in table 2 herbicides and insecticides were applied once in spring one spray for controlling three problems was also applied at anthesis stage which was a combination of pesticides fungicides plant growth regulators and micro fertilizer to prevent diseases insects and premature plant aging no irrigation was applied during the whole experiment 2 2 soil water content measurements gravimetric soil moisture gsw was determined from 100 cm depth after every 20 cm at sowing prewintering jointing anthesis and maturity three random soil samples were taken from each plot between plant rows using an auger 3 cm in diameter 20 cm soil samples were put into the aluminum boxes weighed for fresh weight fw and dried in an oven at 105 for 72 h for dry weight dw gsw for a given layer was calculated as follows gsw fw dw dw 100 2 3 roots measurements two holes were drilled with an auger 7 cm diameter at a 45 angle from horizontal in the middle of two rows for each plot after the land preparation and then minirhizotron tubes were inserted in the holes fig 2 the above ground part of each tube was covered with insulation foil to prevent light and heat image were taken at 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil depths at prewintering jointing anthesis and maturity root imaging was performed with the minirhizotron scanning using ci 600 root scanner cid bio science camas wa usa at 300 dpi root images were processed using the smart root software winrhizo tron for the measurement of root length and root diameter 2 4 plant dry weight and grain yield plant material was sampled at prewintering jointing anthesis and maturity table 3 from each plot an area of 1 m2 was harvested by cutting plants at the ground level harvested plants were dried at 75 c for 48 h and weighted at maturity plants of 5 m2 were harvested from each plot for grain yield 2 5 water use efficiency wue wue kg ha 1mm 1 was calculated as follows wue y et y is grain yield kg ha 1 and et p δsws et mm is total evapotranspiration calculated over the whole growing season sowing to maturity p mm is the amount of precipitation in the whole experimental year and δsws mm is the difference in the soil water storage between the beginning and the end of the season 2 6 statistical analyses significant differences were calculated using analysis of variance anova and least significant differences lsd 3 results 3 1 effects of rainfall variation in summer fallow and the growing period of winter wheat on soil water content the average soil water content in 0 100 cm depth at sowing was 19 2 in nt and 22 6 in dp in the dry seasons and 35 7 in nt and 37 5 in dp in the normal wet seasons fig 3 the soil water content in the normal wet seasons at sowing was at least 15 higher than that of nt or dp in the dry seasons in comparison between two tillage practices the soil water content under dp was 1 8 higher than that of nt for the normal wet seasons while in the dry seasons the average soil water content under dp was 3 4 higher than at nt these results indicate that precipitation in summer fallow promotes the recovery of soil water in dryland leading to the increase in the soil water content at sowing deep ploughing results in the higher soil water content than no tillage especially in dry seasons the average soil water content in both dry and normal wet seasons gradually decreased with the progress of plant development stage the average soil water content from sowing to the prewintering stage was reduced by 1 2 in nt and 2 0 in dp in the dry seasons but it was reduced by 4 5 in nt and 3 9 in dp in the four normal wet seasons fig 3 at anthesis the average soil water content reduced by 14 3 in nt and 14 9 in dp in the normal wet seasons but it was reduced by 6 9 in nt and 8 1 in dp in the dry seasons the average soil water content in the normal wet seasons at anthesis was at least 8 2 higher than that of nt or dp in the dry seasons fig 3 these results show that the difference in soil water consumption between dp and nt is small at prewintering and anthesis stages for both dry and normal wet years the low level of soil water consumption is found at the prewintering stage in both dry and normal wet years but soil water consumption in the normal wet years at anthesis is almost doubled relative to that in the dry years the rainfall in growing season affected soil water content the higher effective in season rainfall i e growth season rainfall excluding rainfall after anthesis in 2015 16 than in 2012 13 led to the significantly 2 1 higher soil water content of 0 100 cm depth at the prewintering stage in nt than that in 2012 13 fig 4a similarly the higher effective in season rainfall in the 2016 17 led to the significantly higher soil water content at prewintering jointing anthesis and maturity in both dp and nt than that in the2009 10 season at anthesis the higher in season rainfall in 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons led to the significantly higher soil water content in nt than that in 2012 13 and 2009 10 seasons while the higher in season rainfall in the 2016 17season led to the significantly higher content of soil water at 0 100 cm depth in dp than that in the 2009 10 season these results indicate that in the dry seasons the in season rainfall could reduce the depletion in soil water content depending on growth stages and tillage practices in wet normal years the difference in soil water content was less affected by in season rainfall fig 4b although the in season rainfall in 2013 14 was less in 2014 15 and 2010 11 these results indicate that the in season rainfall is beneficial in the dry seasons for the improvement of soil water status in both nt and dp treatments whereas in the normal wet seasons the in season rainfall shows little benefit soil water distribution in 0 100 cm depth at 20 cm intervals was determined at five growth stages in the dry and normal wet seasons table 3 the soil water content was gradually increased from 20 cm to 60 cm depth in the dry seasons and from 20 cm to 40 cm in the normal wet seasons and then decreased with the depth in addition the reduction of soil water content in different depths varied with growth stages the soil water content from jointing to anthesis showed 2 and 2 8 reduction with nt and 2 7 and 3 9 with dp in the dry seasons while in the normal wet season showed 6 4 and 6 8 reduction with nt and 6 9 and 7 1 with dp at 20 60 and 80 100 cm depth respectively the soil water content in the dry seasons from anthesis to maturity showed 2 4 and 3 5 reduction at 20 60 and 80 100 cm depth with nt respectively and 3 1 and 4 1 with dp fig 5 in comparison the soil water content in the normal wet seasons from anthesis to maturity was reduced by 3 0 and 7 6 in 20 60 cm and 80 100 cm depth with nt respectively and 2 6 and 7 3 with dp these results indicate that more soil water was depleted from the deep soil layer 80 100 cm depth than that in the shallow layer 20 60 cm depth from jointing to anthesis and anthesis to maturity in the dry season and from anthesis to maturity in the normal wet seasons 3 2 effects of rainfall variation in summer fallow and the growing period of winter wheat on above ground growth the average above ground dry weight in the dry seasons at prewintering was 21 and 42 less than that in the normal wet seasons under nt and dp respectively fig 6a the substantial reduction in above ground dry weight at anthesis due to the lower rainfall in summer fallow was 33 with nt and 45 with dp the average above ground dry weight in dp and was 15 34 higher in the dry years than that in nt across all growth stages and 53 172 higher in the normal wet years than that in nt across all growth stages in the dry seasons the low rainfall in summer fallow reduced above ground dry weight at anthesis by 67 with nt and by 56 with dp these results indicate that the amount of rainfall significantly affects the accumulation of above ground dry weight and reduction of dry matter can be appropriately reduced by dp especially in the dry seasons the higher effective in season rainfall in the dry seasons increased the above ground dry weight fig 6b above ground dry weight across all four growth stages in both nt and dp was significantly higher in 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons with 169 and 190 mm in season rainfall relative to 67 and 111 mm in 2012 13 and 2009 10 seasons the above ground dry weight at anthesis in 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons was 24 27 higher than that in 2012 13 and 2009 10 seasons with nt whereas the above ground dry weight in 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons was 13 15 higher than that in 2012 13 and 2009 10 seasons with dp these results indicate that the higher amount of effective in seasonal rainfall in the dry seasons is valuable leading to the increase in the above ground dry weight 3 3 effects of rainfall variation in summer fallow and the growing period of winter wheat on root length surface density the average root length surface density rlsd at the normal wet seasons was higher than the dry seasons at all growth stages fig 6c at the prewintering stage rlsd at the normal wet seasons was 2 5 fold and 1 8 fold higher than the dry seasons with nt and dp respectively the reduction of rlsd at anthesis by drought was 44 with nt and 29 with dp which was much lower than the reduction in above ground dry weight fig 6c these results indicate that the low rainfall in summer fallow promotes root growth relative to shoot growth the average root length surface density rlsd under dp at all growth stages were 29 42 and 17 24 higher than that under nt in the dry and normal wet seasons respectively these results show that dp can greatly reduce the reduction rate of rlsd relative to nt the higher in season rainfall of 169 mm in 2015 16 and 190 mm in 2016 17 significantly increased the rlsd relative to that in 2012 13 and 2009 10 seasons with the in season rainfall of 67 and 111 mm under both nt and dp fig 6d at anthesis the average rlsd in 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons was 43 7 higher than that in 2012 13 and 2009 10 seasons under nt and 20 8 higher under dp these results indicate that the higher amount of effective in seasonal rainfall increase rlsd at anthesis furthermore the distribution of rlsd in 0 100 depth at 20 cm intervals was examined at four growth stages in the dry fig 7a d and normal wet seasons fig 7e h at all growth stages rlsd in both tillage practices gradually increased with soil depth reached the peak at 60 cm in dry seasons and at 40 cm depth in the normal wet seasons and then decreased gradually in comparison between two tillage practices dp significantly increased rlsd relative to nt at all depths and growth stages thus low rainfall in summer fallow promotes roots growth in deeper layers relative to the normal wet seasons from the prewintering stage onwards and rlsd with dp in the dry seasons was much higher than that in the normal wet seasons the root abundance in terms of rlsd decreases to 50 in the depth below 60 cm in the dry seasons or below 40 cm in the normal wet seasons these results show that the roots in summer fallow with low rainfall grow 20 cm deeper relative to those with normal rainfall from the prewintering stage onwards 3 4 effects of rainfall variation in summer fallow and the growing period of winter wheat on root diameter the average root diameter in 0 100 cm depth increased with plant growth and peaked at anthesis in both tillage practices and in both dry and normal wet seasons fig 6e at all growth stages the root diameter in the dry seasons was higher than the wet normal seasons the average root diameter in the dry seasons under dp was consistently higher than at nt in all growth stages but in the normal wet seasons the difference between dp and nt was not significant these results indicate that the less rainfall in summer fallow increases root diameter under both tillage practices across all growth stages and the dp treatment has larger root diameter than the nt in the dry seasons the higher effective in season rainfall in the dry seasons significantly increased root diameter fig 6f root diameters were higher in the seasons 2015 16 and 2016 17 with higher in season rainfall 169 and 190 mm than the seasons 2012 13 and 2009 10 with less rainfall 67 and 111 mm across four growth stages under both nt and dp the higher amount of effective in seasonal rainfall increased the root diameter in both nt and dp treatments in the years with low summer fallow rainfall and the increase in root diameter was higher at dp than at nt in the dry seasons root diameters in both tillage practices increased from 20 cm depth to 60 cm depth and then decreased at 80 cm to 100 cm depth fig 8a d whereas in the normal wet seasons root diameter increased from 20 cm to 40 cm depth and then gradually decreased fig 8e h two tillage practices in the normal wet seasons had a similar root diameter across four growth stages however in the four dry seasons the significantly larger root diameter was observed at dp than nt across all soil depths these results indicate that the dp treatment could increase root diameter at the 0 60 cm soil depth in the dry season 3 5 effects of rainfall variation in summer fallow and the growing period of winter wheat on grain yield wue and contributions to grain yield the average grain yield in the dry seasons was 41 and 28 lower than that in the normal wet seasons under nt and dp respectively fig 9a in comparison to nt the average grain yield with dp was 1 06 ha 1 higher in the dry seasons and 0 69 t ha 1 higher in the normal wet seasons the higher effective in season rainfall in two of the four dry seasons 169 mm in 2015 16 and 190 mm in 2016 17 significantly increased the grain yield than that in the dry seasons with less in season rainfall 67 mm in 2012 13 and 111 mm in 2009 10 fig 9b the average grain yield in the two seasons with 169 190 mm rainfall was 24 higher than that with 67 111 mm under nt and 14 under dp these results indicate that in dp could reduce the yield losses caused by less summer fallow rainfall and the higher amount of effective in seasonal rainfall in the dry seasons could further narrow the gap the average wue in the dry seasons was 54 and 42 lower than the normal wet seasons under nt and dp respectively fig 9c in comparison to nt the average wue with dp was 32 higher in the dry seasons and 15 higher in the normal wet seasons the higher effective in season rainfall in two dry seasons 169 mm in 2015 16 and 190 mm in 2016 17 significantly increased wue relative to in the two dry seasons with less effective in season rainfall 67 mm in 2012 13 and 111 mm in 2009 10 fig 9d the average wue in the two seasons with 169 190 mm rainfall was 22 5 lower than that with 67 111 mm under nt and 29 8 under dp these results indicate that dp could increase wue compared with nt in both dry and normal wet seasons whereas the higher amount of effective in seasonal rainfall in the dry seasons improving wue is season dependent the average contribution rate of soil water content at sowing to grain yield under nt and dp was 23 and 25 in the dry seasons 52 and 53 in the normal wet seasons respectively fig 9e the average contribution rate of soil water content under dp at sowing to grain yield was similar to that under nt in both dry and normal wet seasons fig 9e the higher effective in season rainfall in two dry seasons 169 mm in 2015 16 and 190 mm in 2016 17 significantly reduced the contribution rate of soil water content at sowing to grain yield relative to that the two dry seasons with less in season rainfall 67 mm in 2012 13 and 111 mm in 2009 10 fig 9e the average contribution rate of soil water content at sowing to grain yield in the two seasons with 169 190 mm rainfall was 6 6 lower than that with 67 111 mm under nt and 8 3 under dp these results indicate that the soil water content at sowing can contribute as much as 50 to grain yield in the normal wet seasons and approximately 25 in the dry seasons the higher effective in season rainfall could increase the contribution rate of soil water content at sowing to grain yield 4 discussion 4 1 rainfall in summer fallow plays a vital role in soil water recovery and yield production in the dryland of the loess plateau china in the loess plateau water consumption during the wheat growth period is around 450 mm liu et al 2002 but the average annual rainfall is 278 mm fig 1 and insufficient for wheat growth and development the soil water accumulation before sowing plays an important role in crop yield wang et al 2018 studies have shown that 47 of wheat yield is dependent on soil storage before sowing huang et al 2003 the current study showed that the average precipitation in the growth season of dryland wheat in the recent 30 years was 158 mm and the range of rainfall in the summer fallow period of eight seasons was 95 460 mm fig 1 the average grain yield with nt and dp in the four normal wet seasons was 38 5 and 44 8 higher than in the four dry seasons respectively it shows that the rainfall in the summer fallow period plays an essential role in soil water recovery before sowing the low rainfall in summer fallow reduces the soil water content at sowing and reduced grain yield of dryland wheat which is consistent with previous research sun et al 2018 xue et al 2019 4 2 root systems grow deeper and thicker in response to drought roots of winter wheat sense changes in soil water content under arid environment and respond by changing metabolic activities and growth of underground and above ground parts of the plant chaves et al 2003 root diameter and root length of winter wheat highly depend on water li et al 2001 the amount of soil water absorbed by plant roots not only depends on the physical characteristics of soil but also soil water has greater influence on the growth features and distribution of roots yang et al 2006 in the current study we found that the root distribution of 0 100 cm was consistent with the water content in the soil the low rainfall in summer fallow promotes roots growth by 20 cm deeper than that in the normal wet seasons as early as the prewintering stage similar studies have shown that most wheat s roots systems are concentrated in the upper 40 cm soil layer and play an important role in water uptake while the depletion of water in the upper soil layer leads to the maximum growth of roots in subsoil xue et al 2003 zhang et al 2004 root distribution mainly occurs in the upper soil profile where the root length surface density rlsd was greater zhang et al 2009 and about 80 of the rlsd was accumulated in the 40 cm topsoil depth under high moisture conditions yuhong et al 2014 under limiting water plants have thicker and fewer roots in the upper layer of soil and more roots in the deeper layer of soil albasha et al 2015 with the progress of plant development soil water content reduces the reduction of soil water in the four normal wet seasons at both prewintering and anthesis stages were higher than that in the four dry seasons fig 3 the average rlsd in the normal wet seasons was 1 8 2 5 fold higher at the prewintering stage and 56 71 higher at anthesis than that in the dry seasons fig 6c in contrast the average root diameter showed an opposite trend root diameter was higher in the dry seasons than in the normal wet seasons at prewintering and anthesis stages fig 6e the lower rainfall in summer fallow reduced the soil water and rlsd but increased rd in very dry years root growth becomes limited due to the deprived water in the deepest horizons of water hindering the development of the root system verónica et al 2010 araki et al 2012 in addition our results showed that in the dry seasons the reduction of soil water in 80 100 cm depth was 0 8 1 2 higher from jointing to anthesis 1 0 1 1 from anthesis to maturity than that in 0 60 cm depth fig 5c e in the normal wet seasons soil water consumption from jointing to anthesis was similar between 0 40 cm depth and 60 100 cm depth however the water consumption was 4 6 4 7 more from anthesis to maturity this shows that with the lower summer fallow rainfall the higher soil water consumption in the deep layer of 80 100 cm proceeds from the jointing stage onwards araki et al 2012 report that water scarcity affects root distribution our results showed that the reduction of rlsd at anthesis by drought was 29 44 which was much lower than that in above ground dry weight 56 67 these results indicate that the low rainfall in summer fallow promotes root growth relative to shoot growth it is essential to use water saving practices to efficiently store soil water in the summer fallow period however the efficient utilization of rainfall during the growing period is also important to attain higher crop productivity shao et al 2011 the precipitation at the key growth stages of wheat i e prewintering jointing and anthesis is closely related to the formation of three yield components especially in the early and mid growth stages verónica et al 2010 show that the key growth stage for developing an optimal root system is tillering which is strongly dependent on the rainfall even though other later growth stages receive little rainfall the root system can develop normally in the current study the lower amount of effective in season rainfall in the two dry seasons reduced soil water content of 0 100 cm from the prewintering stages onwards leading to reduce rlsd by 21 44 and rd by 0 03 0 04 mm at anthesis as a result the above ground dry weight was decreased by 13 27 and grain yield by 14 24 this shows that the less effective precipitation during the growth period impairs wheat growth and reduction of above ground dry weight is higher than that in rlsd a similar result is reported by ali et al 2018 who that the less rainfall 125 mm decreases root length ratios and grain yield compared to the higher rainfall 200 mm and 275 mm especially root length ratios 4 3 deep ploughing conserves soil water in summer fallow and increase root growth and yield production deep ploughing in summer fallow significantly increased winter wheat yields especially in the seasons with the lower summer fallow rainfall four of the eight seasons were low in rainfall showing 50 probability of a dry season thereby measures to harvest rainfall in the soil during the summer fallow period such as deep ploughing could reduce yield losses by improving the storage of soil water for wheat consumption wang et al 2012 ren et al 2019 xue et al 2019 the average soil water content with dp at sowing was 1 8 higher than that with nt the soil water distribution of 0 100 cm showed that the soil layer with the highest soil water content at all growth stages was the same between dp and nt in both dry and normal wet seasons but the reduction of the soil water content of 0 60 cm and 80 100 cm with dp were more than with nt in the four dry seasons our previous study shows that dp improves water retention by removing subsoil compaction and storing water in the subsoil layer which could be utilized during the vegetative stages of wheat plants sun et al 2018 our results also showed that the average grain yield with dp in the four dry seasons increased by 41 4 compared with nt which was higher than that in the normal wet seasons 16 0 a similar trend was observed for wue the average wue with dp increased by 32 compared with nt in the four dry seasons and it was higher in the four normal wet seasons 15 however the contribution of soil water at sowing to grain yield under dp was only slightly higher than that under nt in both dry and normal wet seasons furthermore the average rlsd at all growth stages was higher with dp than with nt in both dry and normal wet seasons and the average above ground dry weight with dp was 15 172 higher than that with nt across all growth stages in addition the reduction of rlsd at anthesis by drought with dp 29 was less than that with nt 44 in contrast the reduction of above ground dry weight at anthesis with dp 56 in the lower rainfall seasons was less than that with nt 67 these results indicate that deep ploughing in summer fallow increases soil water content at sowing which is important for improving plant water consumption and yield 5 conclusion low and variable rainfall limits grain yield of winter wheat in dryland areas deep ploughing in summer fallow increased rainfall storage at sowing contributing to 23 25 grain yield in the dry seasons and 52 53 in the normal wet seasons roots grew 20 cm deeper in the dry seasons than in the normal wet seasons in the dry seasons more soil water was depleted from 80 100 cm depth than from 20 60 cm depth from the jointing stage onwards dp increased soil water content in 0 100 depth until anthesis in the dry seasons relative to nt dp significantly increased rlsd relative to nt at all depths and growth stages leading to 41 yield increase in the dry seasons and 16 in the normal seasons therefore deep ploughing in summer fallow should be adopted for improving rainwater storage and yield

9509,the ridge furrow plastic mulching system has been reported to increase crop yield and water nitrogen use efficiency in semi arid and semi humid regions but the effects of plant density nitrogen n

density nitrogen rate supplemental irrigation soybean yield loess plateau of china 1 introduction the loess plateau of china is a typical rainfed farming region accounting for one third of china s arable land and it is an important crop wheat maize soybean sorghum etc production area in china fang et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 the lack of water resources high evaporation rate and poor soil fertility greatly restrict the development of agriculture on the loess plateau the ridge furrow plastic mulching system can effectively improve soil hydrothermal conditions which has been widely used to promote crop yield and water use efficiency in this region mainly on maize and wheat qiang et al 2022 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2021 xu et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 2021 recently it has been also applied for improving soybean productivity wang et al 2021b liao et al 2022 jo et al 2022 soybean glycine max l is a widely consumed food and one of the five most important crops in the world serving as a source of food for human consumption animal feed and edible oils faostat 2020 china is currently the largest soybean consumer and importer in the world wang and wei 2021 however the seed yield of soybean per unit area is still low compared with that in developed countries e g the united states soybean is a leguminous crop that requires sufficient water supply during the growth period to achieve high yield buezo et al 2019 maia et al 2017 xiong et al 2021 water stress is one of the main limiting factors for soybean growth and production in the world including the loess plateau of china xiong et al 2021 studies have shown that water stress especially during the critical stage of soybean can lead to the reduction in soybean yield by 24 50 he et al 2017a gebre and earl 2020 supplemental irrigation is likely to increase soybean yield but the effect of supplemental irrigation on soybean growth and seed yield especially under ridge furrow plastic mulching has not been well explored he et al 2020 the sensitivity of soybean to water stress is closely related to the growth stage and the short term water shortage during the vegetative growth stage of soybean usually does not significantly reduce soybean yield xiong et al 2021 previous studies have shown that drought at the seedling stage of soybean could promote deep rooting which was beneficial to the growth and development of soybean but it would increase the water demand at the flowering podding stage xiong et al 2021 soybean is more susceptible to water stress at the reproductive stage xu et al 2018 and water stress at the flowering podding stage will seriously affect soybean yield nakagawa et al 2018 nitrogen n plays an important role in plant growth which is critical for high seed yield by improving the leaf area biomass grain filling rate and translocation of stem non structural carbohydrates maia et al 2017 high yielding crops require large amounts of nitrogen to achieve best yields however the linear increase in nitrogen fertilizer input does not significantly increase crop yield on the contrary it can lead to a decline in nitrogen use efficiency the excessive nitrogen fertilization in farmlands has a lot of negative effects on the global environment which is not conducive to the sustainability agricultural production guo et al 2021 soybean can provide nitrogen for its growth through root biological nitrogen fixation and it is an important source of soil nitrogen xiu et al 2021 it is possible that soybean does not require a great application amount of nitrogen thanks to the symbiosis of soybean with nodule bacteria bradyrhizobium japonicum present in the root nodules assimilating atmospheric nitrogen jańczak pieniążek et al 2021 increasing plant density is also one of the key management measures to increase soybean yield buezo et al 2019 xu et al 2021b soybean yield can be enhanced by increasing plant density within a certain range xu et al 2021a found that higher plant density significantly increased canopy light interception and dry matter accumulation during soybean growth thereby increasing soybean productivity however there are few studies on the combined effect of nitrogen fertilization and plant density on soybean production on the loess plateau especially under ridge furrow plastic mulching although the ridge furrow plastic mulching system has been reported to enhance soybean yield to a certain extent it is unlikely to meet the huge gap between crop demand and water supply on the loess plateau of china due to the scarce rainfall and uneven seasonal rainfall distribution zheng et al 2021 previous studies have mainly focused on the independent effect of ridge furrow plastic mulching system liao et al 2022 or supplemental irrigation jha et al 2018 on soybean growth and yield however the combined effects of supplemental irrigation along with other agronomic practices e g plant density and n rate on the seed yield of soybean under ridge furrow plastic mulching are poorly understood we hypothesized that the supplemental irrigation at the flowering podding stage combined with increased plant density and reduced n input could increase soybean yield while minimizing the environmental impact under ridge furrow plastic mulching the objective of this study was thus to explore the effects of plant density n rate and supplemental irrigation on chlorophyll photosynthesis aboveground root growth evapotranspiration seed yield and water nitrogen use efficiency of soybean under ridge furrow plastic mulching on the loess plateau of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description field experiments were conducted during two continuous soybean growing seasons in 2019 and 2020 at the key laboratory

effects on soybean growth the growth and development of soybean are the results of the coordination and mutual promotion of the morphological functions of the aboveground and underground parts leaf area lai and aboveground biomass agb reached their maximum at the r6 stage and then decreased this was because the leaf biomass increased due to the development of new leaves and the increase of the original leaves the rapid growth of leaves and stems made agb accumulate rapidly at the early stage and then lai dropped sharply at the later stage due to leaf fall and senescence the biomass of the pods began to increase sharply at the reproductive and development stages of the pods but the photosynthesis decreased due to leaf senescence and withering and agb decreased at the same time increasing plant density may increase soybean yield but it may also cause water and fertilizer stresses change plant morphology and development and increase the inter species competition du et al 2021 sigua et al 2018 found that low nitrogen treatment reduced leaf development and duration compared with high nitrogen treatment thereby reducing radiation interception supplemental irrigation had a significant growth compensation effect at high plant density when the stress was relieved the external morphology of the plant such as leaf area and dry matter growth rate would increase shortly and rapidly and reduce the degree of aging roots are the main water and fertilizer absorption organs and soybean growth and nutrients absorption mainly depend on the growth and development of the root system root system architecture rsa determined the ability of crops to absorb and transport nutrients and water wang et al 2019 the root tip was the most active part of the root system it was not enough for crops to rely on the main root system to actively find the nutrients needed for crop growth in this study supplemental irrigation not only increased total root length density trld total root surface area density trsd total root volume density trvd and total average root diameter tard in the 0 60 cm soil layer but also promoted root growth in deep soil layers this indicated that root hairs were susceptible to soil moisture he et al 2017a and the formation of root hairs greatly increased the nutrient absorption area of the root system meanwhile the increase of available nitrogen concentration directly increased root density by stimulating growth near the nitrogen application area thereby balancing the important relationship between nutrient supply and soil nitrogen absorption radzka et al 2021 this study found that the density of the upper root system was high which was not only related to the distribution characteristics of the soybean root system but also the increase of shallow soil moisture and temperature from the ridge furrow plastic mulching which was beneficial to the accumulation of aboveground biomass and the coordinated development of root and shoot zhang et al 2021a roots were densely distributed in the shallow soil 0 30 cm which helped root growth and thus facilitated nutrients absorption zhou and feng 2020 zhang et al 2015 the root shoot ratio rsr in 2020 was significantly higher than that in 2019 which was likely due to the higher solar radiation in 2019 light promoted leaf photosynthesis and photosynthetic products were preferentially distributed to the upper part of the aboveground plant during leaf elongation thereby affecting rsr gundel et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 although the seasonal precipitation in 2020 was greater than that in 2019 the rainfall after supplemental irrigation was only 32 mm in 2020 but it was 246 mm in 2019 therefore soybean may have experienced water stress at the late growth stage in 2020 when soybean reached the r2 r3 stage the growth advantage provided by the previous n application and the compensation effect by supplemental irrigation was transformed into the root growth which further greatly promoted the growth of the aboveground part the developmental response of plants to water stress was to promote root growth and inhibit shoot growth leading to an increase in rsr xu et al 2013 4 2 plant density nitrogen rate and supplemental irrigation effects on leaf physiology photosynthetic pigments are of great significance to the solar energy capture of leaf photosynthesis yang et al 2017 supplemental irrigation at the r2 r3 stage significantly increased the chlorophyll content of soybean leaves which was beneficial to the reproductive growth of soybean after the r2 r3 stage that was because water stress significantly reduced the chlorophyll content of soybean leaves dong et al 2019 but supplemental irrigation alleviated this stress thereby increasing the chlorophyll content carotenoids play an important role in protecting the photosynthetic reaction center from auto oxidation especially under abiotic stress conditions hussain et al 2019 so the increase of carotenoids significantly increased the photosynthetic efficiency of soybean n rate mainly affected the delay of leaf senescence which in turn affected the content of leaf photosynthetic pigment and then affected its photosynthetic rate which has been confirmed by cano ruiz et al 2020 in this study there was a significant difference in chla chlb between the two plant densities which may be due to the changes in the organization of the light interception component and the electron transport component yao et al 2017 the decrease in photosynthesis in this study was partly due to the decrease in intercellular co2 concentration ci and the increase in stomatal restriction ls single leaf photosynthetic rate decreased significantly with the increase of plant density and the effect of plant density on transpiration rate tr was also significant that was because higher plant density was more likely to cause water stress which promoted the closure of leaf stomata and the loss of water dispersion thereby reducing stomatal conductance gsw of soybean leaves increasing ls and stomata closure was the main limiting factor for photosynthesis on the other hand the lack of nitrogen and water would affect leaf expansion and photosynthesis which was because water and nitrogen were the main factors controlling plant growth and lack of nitrogen and water would reduce gsw thereby inhibiting carbon assimilation the first process affected by water deficit was the leaf development and expansion water deficit may further induce nitrogen deficiency thereby limiting photosynthesis sigua et al 2018 the photosynthetic rate largely depended on the content of ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase and chlorophyll content both of which were linearly related to the leaf nitrogen content sigua et al 2018 chlorophyll fluorescence detection was currently a widely used method for physiological and ecological detection of plant photosynthesis performance and stress research higher maximal psii quantum yield fv fm indicated that the photosynthetic performance of the leaves was better in this study increasing n rate and decreasing plant density increased the photosynthetic pigments pn and tr of individual leaves which led to an increase in effective psii quantum yield φpsii and coefficient of photochemical quenching qp associated with drought damaged photochemical processes zhang et al 2015 harmless dissipation of excess energy under water stress was often accompanied by a decrease in non photochemical quenching npq guo et al 2022 furthermore the reduction of operating efficiency in photosystem ⅱ psii and variable chlorophyll fluorescence decrease ratio rfd suggested that high photosynthesis was always dependent on the number of electrons passing through psii hussain et al 2019 increasing plant density decreased φpsii and qp of individual leaves but increased the relative energy excess at the psii level exc this indicated that the psii flux absorbed less energy for the photochemical process and this part of the energy was converted into non photochemical energy loss or non photochemical quenching this study showed that increasing the chlorophyll content improved chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and leaf photosynthesis capacity 4 3 plant density nitrogen rate and supplemental irrigation effects on seed yield harvest index and soybean water consumption soybean yield was a function of yield components plant density effective pod number number of seeds per pod and one hundred seeds weight which were mainly affected by environmental conditions management measures and cultivars he et al 2017b this study showed that the water consumption strength of soybeans at the reproductive growth stage cs2 was 2 3 times that at the vegetative growth stage cs1 this indicated that the ability of soybean to maintain water absorption and extract water from deep soils during the critical growth stage was the key to stable and high yield when the surface soil moisture was depleted under drought conditions the greater proportion of deep roots may help increase yield and the higher proportion of plant roots under water stress more biomass than plant roots without water stress could be effective for preventing damage caused by water stress lopez et al 2019 higher chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate were closely related to water and n fertilizer at the same time the change of chlorophyll content significantly affected the photosynthetic efficiency of soybean the increase in yield may be related to the improved soybean root growth and increased nutrient absorption hussain et al 2019 meanwhile studies have shown that high plant density high fertilizer rate and supplemental irrigation could significantly increase soybean population yield because these factors can increase lai and subsequently light energy interception mandal et al 2009 both high fertilizer and supplemental irrigation increased the photosynthetic pigment content to increase the photosynthetic rate although high density reduced the photosynthetic rate of a single plant of soybean it significantly increased population yield which indicated that the increase in population number could compensate for the decrease in yield per plant due to the increase in plant density meng et al 2021 the increase in soybean yield was mainly related to aboveground biomass and harvest index futakuchi et al 2021 rainfed soybean yield was lower because it reduced biomass and harvest index which was consistent with the finding of sigua et al 2018 4 4 plant density nitrogen rate and supplemental irrigation effects on water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency in arid and semi arid regions water use efficiency wue is highly important for water administration and management el shirbeny et al 2021 soybean yield was increased by increasing plant density thereby significantly increasing water use efficiency of seed yield wues water use efficiency of biomass yield wueb precipitation and irrigation water use efficiency piue irrigation water use efficiency iue instantaneous water use efficiency of soybean leaf wueleaf and leaf equivalent water thickness ewtleaf which was consistent with the results of wei et al 2018 it was also found that supplemental irrigation only increased wues wueb and piue at high plant density d32 which was not completely consistent with previous studies zhang et al 2021b this may be due to that the sufficient precipitation during the growth period of soybean in 2019 and 2020 weakened the compensation effect of supplemental irrigation wei et al 2018 found that the impact on wue tended to decrease with the increase of seasonal precipitation amount fertilization can increase wue mainly due to the increase in seed yield and fertilization affected root and canopy structure of soybean wang et al 2022 these results of this study indicated that water stress may have direct and indirect effects on soybean nitrogen absorption sigua et al 2018 ewtleaf was closely related to soil moisture supplemental irrigation increases soil moisture thereby improving ewtleaf nitrogen partial factor productivity npfp was also affected by water and n fertilizer it was found that the impact of n fertilization on npfp was greater than the impact of plant density and supplemental irrigation which was similar to the finding of wu et al 2015 crop yield usually shows a significant response to nitrogen application however increasing nitrogen fertilizer input would also reduce nitrogen use efficiency li et al 2019 which was consistent with the results of this study nitrogen absorption obviously depended on two key processes water flow from the soil to the root system and rhizosphere ion diffusion flux nitrogen rate plant density and supplemental irrigation all had significant effects on nitrogen absorption and npfp 4 5 relationship among soybean traits the root system was the foundation of plant growth and a strong root system can provide plants with sufficient nutrients and water the ability of the root system to develop soil resources determines crop yield water use efficiency nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency laimax agbmax some leaf physiological indexes and root indexes and gy had a close relationship this also further showed that the long and deep root system would help to better absorb nutrients and water gu et al 2018 the change of soil water content and nutrients would affect root growth and its spatial distribution which in turn affected growth and physiology of the aboveground part soybean leaf physiological characteristics delaying leaf senescence etc zheng et al 2021 and ultimately affected gy and water nitrogen use efficiency the study of zhang et al 2021a showed that some agricultural practices improved crop root morphology balanced soil resource development and shoot development thereby increasing grain yield which was consistent with the results of this study there was a strong correlation between the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of soybean leaves and aboveground biomass and yield which was similar to the finding of guo et al 2022 there were closely relationships among individual plant indexes but the individual plant indexes measured at maturity had little relationship with group yield which indicated that some group indicators should be further considered in future studies pedró et al 2012 5 conclusions through a two year field experiment the effects of supplemental irrigation at the flowering podding stage

to promote crop yield and water use efficiency in this region mainly on maize and wheat qiang et al 2022 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2021 xu et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 2021 recently it has been also applied for improving soybean productivity wang et al 2021b liao et al 2022 jo et al 2022 soybean glycine max l is a widely consumed food and one of the five most important crops in the world serving as a source of food for human consumption animal feed and edible oils faostat 2020 china is currently the largest soybean consumer and importer in the world wang and wei 2021 however the seed yield of soybean per unit area is still low compared with that in developed countries e g the united states soybean is a leguminous crop that requires sufficient water supply during the growth period to achieve high yield buezo et al 2019 maia et al 2017 xiong et al 2021 water stress is one of the main limiting factors for soybean growth and production in the world including the loess plateau of china xiong et al 2021 studies have shown that water stress especially during the critical stage of soybean can lead to the reduction in soybean yield by 24 50 he et al 2017a gebre and earl 2020 supplemental irrigation is likely to increase soybean yield but the effect of supplemental irrigation on soybean growth and seed yield especially under ridge furrow plastic mulching has not been well explored he et al 2020 the sensitivity of soybean to water stress is closely related to the growth stage and the short term water shortage during the vegetative growth stage of soybean usually does not significantly reduce soybean yield xiong et al 2021 previous studies have shown that drought at the seedling stage of soybean could promote deep rooting which was beneficial to the growth and development of soybean but it would increase the water demand at the flowering podding stage xiong et al 2021 soybean is more susceptible to water stress at the reproductive stage xu et al 2018 and water stress at the flowering podding stage will seriously affect soybean yield nakagawa et al 2018 nitrogen n plays an important role in plant growth which is critical for high seed yield by improving the leaf area biomass grain filling rate and translocation of stem non structural carbohydrates maia et al 2017 high yielding crops require large amounts of nitrogen to achieve best yields however the linear increase in nitrogen fertilizer input does not significantly increase crop yield on the contrary it can lead to a decline in nitrogen use efficiency the excessive nitrogen fertilization in farmlands has a lot of negative effects on the global environment which is not conducive to the sustainability agricultural production guo et al 2021 soybean can provide nitrogen for its growth through root biological nitrogen fixation and it is an important source of soil nitrogen xiu et al 2021 it is possible that soybean does not require a great application amount of nitrogen thanks to the symbiosis of soybean with nodule bacteria bradyrhizobium japonicum present in the root nodules assimilating atmospheric nitrogen jańczak pieniążek et al 2021 increasing plant density is also one of the key management measures to increase soybean yield buezo et al 2019 xu et al 2021b soybean yield can be enhanced by increasing plant density within a certain range xu et al 2021a found that higher plant density significantly increased canopy light interception and dry matter accumulation during soybean growth thereby increasing soybean productivity however there are few studies on the combined effect of nitrogen fertilization and plant density on soybean production on the loess plateau especially under ridge furrow plastic mulching although the ridge furrow plastic mulching system has been reported to enhance soybean yield to a certain extent it is unlikely to meet the huge gap between crop demand and water supply on the loess plateau of china due to the scarce rainfall and uneven seasonal rainfall distribution zheng et al 2021 previous studies have mainly focused on the independent effect of ridge furrow plastic mulching system liao et al 2022 or supplemental irrigation jha et al 2018 on soybean growth and yield however the combined effects of supplemental irrigation along with other agronomic practices e g plant density and n rate on the seed yield of soybean under ridge furrow plastic mulching are poorly understood we hypothesized that the supplemental irrigation at the flowering podding stage combined with increased plant density and reduced n input could increase soybean yield while minimizing the environmental impact under ridge furrow plastic mulching the objective of this study was thus to explore the effects of plant density n rate and supplemental irrigation on chlorophyll photosynthesis aboveground root growth evapotranspiration seed yield and water nitrogen use efficiency of soybean under ridge furrow plastic mulching on the

effects on soybean growth the growth and development of soybean are the results of the coordination and mutual promotion of the morphological functions of the aboveground and underground parts leaf area lai and aboveground biomass agb reached their maximum at the r6 stage and then decreased this was because the leaf biomass increased due to the development of new leaves and the increase of the original leaves the rapid growth of leaves and stems made agb accumulate rapidly at the early stage and then lai dropped sharply at the later stage due to leaf fall and senescence the biomass of the pods began to increase sharply at the reproductive and development stages of the pods but the photosynthesis decreased due to leaf senescence and withering and agb decreased at the same time increasing plant density may increase soybean yield but it may also cause water and fertilizer stresses change plant morphology and development and increase the inter species competition du et al 2021 sigua et al 2018 found that low nitrogen treatment reduced leaf development and duration compared with high nitrogen treatment thereby reducing radiation interception supplemental irrigation had a significant growth compensation effect at high plant density when the stress was relieved the external morphology of the plant such as leaf area and dry matter growth rate would increase shortly and rapidly and reduce the degree of aging roots are the main water and fertilizer absorption organs and soybean growth and nutrients absorption mainly depend on the growth and development of the root system root system architecture rsa determined the ability of crops to absorb and transport nutrients and water wang et al 2019 the root tip was the most active part of the root system it was not enough for crops to rely on the main root system to actively find the nutrients needed for crop growth in this study supplemental irrigation not only increased total root length density trld total root surface area density trsd total root volume density trvd and total average root diameter tard in the 0 60 cm soil layer but also promoted root growth in deep soil layers this indicated that root hairs were susceptible to soil moisture he et al 2017a and the formation of root hairs greatly increased the nutrient absorption area of the root system meanwhile the increase of available nitrogen concentration directly increased root density by stimulating growth near the nitrogen application area thereby balancing the important relationship between nutrient supply and soil nitrogen absorption radzka et al 2021 this study found that the density of the upper root system was high which was not only related to the distribution characteristics of the soybean root system but also the increase of shallow soil moisture and temperature from the ridge furrow plastic mulching which was beneficial to the accumulation of aboveground biomass and the coordinated development of root and shoot zhang et al 2021a roots were densely distributed in the shallow soil 0 30 cm which helped root growth and thus facilitated nutrients absorption zhou and feng 2020 zhang et al 2015 the root shoot ratio rsr in 2020 was significantly higher than that in 2019 which was likely due to the higher solar radiation in 2019 light promoted leaf photosynthesis and photosynthetic products were preferentially distributed to the upper part of the aboveground plant during leaf elongation thereby affecting rsr gundel et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 although the seasonal precipitation in 2020 was greater than that in 2019 the rainfall after supplemental irrigation was only 32 mm in 2020 but it was 246 mm in 2019 therefore soybean may have experienced water stress at the late growth stage in 2020 when soybean reached the r2 r3 stage the growth advantage provided by the previous n application and the compensation effect by supplemental irrigation was transformed into the root growth which further greatly promoted the growth of the aboveground part the developmental response of plants to water stress was to promote root growth and inhibit shoot growth leading to an increase in rsr xu et al 2013 4 2 plant density nitrogen rate and supplemental irrigation effects on leaf physiology photosynthetic pigments are of great significance to the solar energy capture of leaf photosynthesis yang et al 2017 supplemental irrigation at the r2 r3 stage significantly increased the chlorophyll content of soybean leaves which was beneficial to the reproductive growth of soybean after the r2 r3 stage that was because water stress significantly reduced the chlorophyll content of soybean leaves dong et al 2019 but supplemental irrigation alleviated this stress thereby increasing the chlorophyll content carotenoids play an important role in protecting the photosynthetic reaction center from auto oxidation especially under abiotic stress conditions hussain et al 2019 so the increase of carotenoids significantly increased the photosynthetic efficiency of soybean n rate mainly affected the delay of leaf senescence which in turn affected the content of leaf photosynthetic pigment and then affected its photosynthetic rate which has been confirmed by cano ruiz et al 2020 in this study there was a significant difference in chla chlb between the two plant densities which may be due to the changes in the organization of the light interception component and the electron transport component yao et al 2017 the decrease in photosynthesis in this study was partly due to the decrease in intercellular co2 concentration ci and the increase in stomatal restriction ls single leaf photosynthetic rate decreased significantly with the increase of plant density and the effect of plant density on transpiration rate tr was also significant that was because higher plant density was more likely to cause water stress which promoted the closure of leaf stomata and the loss of water dispersion thereby reducing stomatal conductance gsw of soybean leaves increasing ls and stomata closure was the main limiting factor for photosynthesis on the other hand the lack of nitrogen and water would affect leaf expansion and photosynthesis which was because water and nitrogen were the main factors controlling plant growth and lack of nitrogen and water would reduce gsw thereby inhibiting carbon assimilation the first process affected by water deficit was the leaf development and expansion water deficit may further induce nitrogen deficiency thereby limiting photosynthesis sigua et al 2018 the photosynthetic rate largely depended on the content of ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase and chlorophyll content both of which were linearly related to the leaf nitrogen content sigua et al 2018 chlorophyll fluorescence detection was currently a widely used method for physiological and ecological detection of plant photosynthesis performance and stress research higher maximal psii quantum yield fv fm indicated that the photosynthetic performance of the leaves was better in this study increasing n rate and decreasing plant density increased the photosynthetic pigments pn and tr of individual leaves which led to an increase in effective psii quantum yield φpsii and coefficient of photochemical quenching qp associated with drought damaged photochemical processes zhang et al 2015 harmless dissipation of excess energy under water stress was often accompanied by a decrease in non photochemical quenching npq guo et al 2022 furthermore the reduction of operating efficiency in photosystem ⅱ psii and variable chlorophyll fluorescence decrease ratio rfd suggested that high photosynthesis was always dependent on the number of electrons passing through psii hussain et al 2019 increasing plant density decreased φpsii and qp of individual leaves but increased the relative energy excess at the psii level exc this indicated that the psii flux absorbed less energy for the photochemical process and this part of the energy was converted into non photochemical energy loss or non photochemical quenching this study showed that increasing the chlorophyll content improved chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and leaf photosynthesis capacity 4 3 plant density nitrogen rate and supplemental irrigation effects on seed yield harvest index and soybean water consumption soybean yield was a function of yield components plant density effective pod number number of seeds per pod and one hundred seeds weight which were mainly affected by environmental conditions management measures and cultivars he et al 2017b this study showed that the water consumption strength of soybeans at the reproductive growth stage cs2 was 2 3 times that at the vegetative growth stage cs1 this indicated that the ability of soybean to maintain water absorption and extract water from deep soils during the critical growth stage was the key to stable and high yield when the surface soil moisture was depleted under drought conditions the greater proportion of deep roots may help increase yield and the higher proportion of plant roots under water stress more biomass than plant roots without water stress could be effective for preventing damage caused by water stress lopez et al 2019 higher chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate were closely related to water and n fertilizer at the same time the change of chlorophyll content significantly affected the photosynthetic efficiency of soybean the increase in yield may be related to the improved soybean root growth and increased nutrient absorption hussain et al 2019 meanwhile studies have shown that high plant density high fertilizer rate and supplemental irrigation could significantly increase soybean population yield because these factors can increase lai and subsequently light energy interception mandal et al 2009 both high fertilizer and supplemental irrigation increased the photosynthetic pigment content to increase the photosynthetic rate although high density reduced the photosynthetic rate of a single plant of soybean it significantly increased population yield which indicated that the increase in population number could compensate for the decrease in yield per plant due to the increase in plant density meng et al 2021 the increase in soybean yield was mainly related to aboveground biomass and harvest index futakuchi et al 2021 rainfed soybean yield was lower because it reduced biomass and harvest index which was consistent with the finding of sigua et al 2018 4 4 plant density nitrogen rate and supplemental irrigation effects on water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency in arid and semi arid regions water use efficiency wue is highly important for water administration and management el shirbeny et al 2021 soybean yield was increased by increasing plant density thereby significantly increasing water use efficiency of seed yield wues water use efficiency of biomass yield wueb precipitation and irrigation water use efficiency piue irrigation water use efficiency iue instantaneous water use efficiency of soybean leaf wueleaf and leaf equivalent water thickness ewtleaf which was consistent with the results of wei et al 2018 it was also found that supplemental irrigation only increased wues wueb and piue at high plant density d32 which was not completely consistent with previous studies zhang et al 2021b this may be due to that the sufficient precipitation during the growth period of soybean in 2019 and 2020 weakened the compensation effect of supplemental irrigation wei et al 2018 found that the impact on wue tended to decrease with the increase of seasonal precipitation amount fertilization can increase wue mainly due to the increase in seed yield and fertilization affected root and canopy structure of soybean wang et al 2022 these results of this study indicated that water stress may have direct and indirect effects on soybean nitrogen absorption sigua et al 2018 ewtleaf was closely related to soil moisture supplemental irrigation increases soil moisture thereby improving ewtleaf nitrogen partial factor productivity npfp was also affected by water and n fertilizer it was found that the impact of n fertilization on npfp was greater than the impact of plant density and supplemental irrigation which was similar to the finding of wu et al 2015 crop yield usually shows a significant response to nitrogen application however increasing nitrogen fertilizer input would also reduce nitrogen use efficiency li et al 2019 which was consistent with the results of this study nitrogen absorption obviously depended on two key processes water flow from the soil to the root system and rhizosphere ion diffusion flux nitrogen rate plant density and supplemental irrigation all had significant effects on nitrogen absorption and npfp 4 5 relationship among soybean traits the root system was the foundation of plant growth and a strong root system can provide plants with sufficient nutrients and water the ability of the root system to develop soil resources determines crop yield water use efficiency nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency laimax agbmax some leaf physiological indexes and root indexes and gy had a close relationship this also further showed that the long and deep root system would help to better absorb nutrients and water gu et al 2018 the change of soil water content and nutrients would affect root growth and its spatial distribution which in turn affected growth and physiology of the aboveground part soybean leaf physiological characteristics delaying leaf senescence etc zheng et al 2021 and ultimately affected gy and water nitrogen use efficiency the study of zhang et al 2021a showed that some agricultural practices improved crop root morphology balanced soil resource development and shoot development thereby increasing grain yield which was consistent with the results of this study there was a strong correlation between the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of soybean leaves and aboveground biomass and yield which was similar to the finding of guo et al 2022 there were closely relationships among individual plant indexes but the individual plant indexes measured at maturity had little relationship with group yield which indicated that some group indicators should be further considered in future studies pedró et al 2012 5 conclusions through a two year field experiment the effects of supplemental irrigation at the flowering podding stage combined with plant density and nitrogen rate on the growth of the aboveground root system leaf physiology seed yield and water nitrogen use efficiency of soybean under ridge furrow plastic mulching on the loess plateau of china were explored compared with low plant density d16 high plant density d32 increased leaf area index by 31 9 and aboveground biomass by 59 4 and promoted soybean root growth thereby increasing seed yield by 27 4 water use efficiency of seed yield by 27 9 and n partial factor productivity by 26 6 compared with low nitrogen rate n30 high nitrogen rate n60 increased leaf area index by 11 5 aboveground biomass by 10 3 promoted root growth and increased leaf photosynthetic rate thereby increasing seed yield by 8 9 and water use efficiency of seed yield by 8 2 compared with rainfed w0 supplemental irrigation w30 increased leaf area index by 4 7 aboveground biomass by 11 0 promoted root growth and increased leaf photosynthetic rate thereby increasing seed yield by 4 7 and n partial factor productivity by 4 0 compared with d32n30w30 d32n60w30 increased both seed yield and wues by 8 5 but it reduced npfp by 45 5 with 100 higher n input the results indicated that the application of supplemental irrigation of 30 mm at the flowering podding stage combined with increased plant density 320 000 plants ha 1 and reduced n input 30 kg n ha 1 could increase soybean yield while minimizing the environmental impact under ridge furrow plastic mulching on the loess plateau of china however the effects of other supplementary irrigation amounts irrigation stages plant densities and n rates on soybean growth yield need to be further explored in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
