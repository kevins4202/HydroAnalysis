10690,alternative water sources for crop production need to be identified in order to meet increasing food demand under climate change scenario however unconventional water source can contain micropollutants like endocrine disruptors and pharmaceuticals due to their persistence after the most common wastewater treatments rice is the staple food of more than half of the world s population

oryza sativa l and their presence in the grain we also investigated the possible interactions of biofertilizer based on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf with the pollutants to evaluate if their use affected the grain pollutants content due to irrigation with polluted water the results show that the polluted solution has caused an increase in rice yield 51 and growth the interaction between the

variance anova mean comparisons were performed according to the fisher s lsd test 3 results the results of preliminar germination and imbibition trials showed that there were significant differences among the three genotypes where red thai was the most sensitive in presence of micropolluttants and the only one that showed a significant seed germination reduction compared to control table 4 considering genotypes response using pollutant mix solution seed germination and mean germination time were not significantly different instead red thai had a significant reduction in epicotyl and radical dry weight than other genotypes 3 1 polluting solution 3 1 1 osmotic pressure as expected the measure of osmotic pressure showed that the polluted solutions had the same osmotic pressure of water used for irrigation 0 110 osmo kg 1 for h2o and 0 111 osmo kg 1 for polluted solutions therefore polluted solution at the studied concentrations did not affect the roots ability to absorb water from soil 3 1 2 yield the grain yield kg m 2 was significantly p 0 01 influenced by the polluting treatment whereas was not significantly changed by amf inoculation the mixed ibuprofen caffeine polluted solution on average of treatments promoted the yield of rice 51 fig 1 as the following two yield components the number of panicles m 2 122 and 193 in the control and polluted treatments respectively and the culms number per plants 5 and 9 in the control and polluted treatments respectively 3 1 3 height and total plant biomass other parameters beyond the yield and its components were positively influenced by the mixed ibuprofen caffeine solution plants irrigated with the mix showed an increase of 10 3 in height fig 2 and a total dry plant biomass roots leaves shoots greater than 40 5 compared to the plants irrigated with water p 0 01 fig 3 3 2 mycorrhizal inoculation the shoots number per plant and total dry biomass plant fig 4 were significantly negatively related to amf glomus aggregatum inoculum 22 5 and 33 respectively on the contrary the 1000 seeds weight was 20 higher p 0 01 in the the amf inoculation treatment fig 5 3 3 fluorescence values the maximal photochemical efficiency fv fm ratio is the most common parameter used in fluorescence it is inversely proportional to damage in the psii reaction centres farquhar et al 1989 fv fm ratio was significantly influenced by the three treatments polluting amf inoculation and measure data 27 july 21 august 9 september the highest values p 0 05 were measured in july both in control 0 77 and amf y polluted plants 0 76 while the significantly lower fv fm value was observed in amf y plants 0 69 the same trend was observed in august whereas in september only amf y polluted plants had markedly different behavior compared to other treatments showing a positive trend 0 78 the minimum value was referred to amf y plants 0 73 the amf y polluted plants had a higher photochemical efficiency compared to control 0 76 of 2 6 p 0 05 we also studied the variations of fv f0 ratio that expresses the basal quantum yield this ratio is much more sensitive for assessing fluorescence levels as recommended by lichtenthaler and buschmann 1984 in july the minimum fv f0 value was observed in the amf y plants 2 23 instead the maximum value was detected in control 3 38 and in amf y polluted plants 3 18 the amf y plants treatment had caused a reduction of the basal quantum yield of 51 5 compared to control and 42 6 compared to amf y pollued plants treatment p 0 05 in august the basal quantum yield was not significantly different among treatments with an average value of 3 34 in september fv f0 values started to decrease following a constant trend the only exception is the amf y polluted plants treatment which showed an increase in the basal quantum yield up to the maximum value of 3 58 whereas the other treatments showed an average basal quantum yield fv f0 of 2 97 3 4 chromatography lc esi ms ms analysis an ibuprofen and caffeine translocation in polluted rice grain has been observed caffeine analysis showed absorption rate in a range between the basal level of 52 ng g 1 control and 1060 ng g 1 of amf n polluted plants caffeine accumulation was significantly p 0 01 higher 8 8 times in the grains harvested from amf n polluted plants than amf y polluted plants fig 6 as regards ibuprofen the results showed no interactions between the four treatments the ibuprofen concentration found in the grains of polluted plants was 119 3 ng g 1 while in the unpolluted plants no absorption occurred fig 7 based on the experimental conditions about 1 09 g m 2 of ibuprofen were distribuited and 0 07 of this pharmaceutical was recovered in the grain 4 discussion the results of this study are very interesting if we consider that today in asia the average per capita consumption of rice exceeds 110 kg year 1 muthayya et al 2014 while in europe consumption is estimated between 5 4 8 8 kg capita year ferrero 2007 considering the rice grains micropollutants concentrations under our experimental conditions it can estimate that could be yearly assimilated per capita 13 mg of caffeine and 1 15 mg of ibuprofen with the greater consumption of rice asia and 2 19 mg of caffeine and 0 18 mg of ibuprofen in europe these results should be considered taking into account their complexity and potential effects on human health 4 1 yield height and total plant biomass we observed that the polluting solution stimulated the growth and the yield of the rice there are very few studies that analyzes the micro pollutant effects on crops our results agree with pietrini et al 2015 who observed that ibuprofen stimulated the growth 12 of aquatic plant lemna gibba l and with pomati et al 2004 who report that ibuprofen 1 1000 μg l 1 stimulated the growth of synechocystis sp our results for caffeine instead are opposed to the study conducted by smyth 1992 the authors observed that caffeine 2 5 mm inhibited growth of oryza sativa shoots by 50 and that also coffea arabica l had the same behavior if exposed to high concentrations of caffeine the similarities concerning growth inhibition suggested that the ability to synthesize caffeine was not an important factor in the physiological response to a high concentration of this molecule smyth 1992 4 2 mycorrhizal fungi inoculum the results showed that the studied amf inoculum inhibited the development of rice negatively influencing the number of shoots and total plant biomass but favoring the 1000 seed weight these results are supported by previous studies since raimam et al 2007 reported that the use of the amf glomus clarum inhibited the growth of rice some authors suggested that amf removed photosynthates depressing the growth of the host plant de souza moreira and siqueira 2002 also herdler et al 2008 had observed that amf biofertilizer based on glomus intraradices inhibited the growth of rice analyzing the content of c the researchers observed that the symbiosis caused a significant decrease of organic carbon 1 compared to the control in the shoots also the content of n was negatively influenced by g intraradices 2 2 mycorrhiza reduced total root length by 13 herdler et al 2008 4 3 fluorescence values photochemical efficiency values showed seasonal variability with a normal decrease during the month of september end of the rice growing cycle but the amf polluting treatment had modified this natural trend emphasizing the reactivity of the plant to common doses of solar radiation in the ultraviolet and visible range on the contrary the polluting treatment and the amf treatment showed a negatively trend compared to control that highlighted the stress induced by the micropollutants and by the g aggregatum the explanation of this reduction in photochemical efficiency could be due to the enzymatic degradation of carotenoid pigments as reported by hajkova and kummerova 2014 in his study the researchers studied the paracetamol effects analgesic antipyretic drug on the growth of lemna minor l and observed a significant reduction in photosynthetic pigments content and decrease of the relative chlorophyll fluorescence hajkova and kummerova 2014 4 4 chromatography lc esi ms ms analysis the reduction of caffeine absorption rates as a consequence of g aggregatum confirm that am fungi improve plant tolerance through specific mechanisms depending on the kind of stress involved numerous studies report how amf improves the crops tolerance to certain types of pollution phenolic compounds or heavy metals it is possible that caffeine was metabolized by g aggregatum thus limiting the translocation of the drug in rice grain instead in the case of ibuprofen the amf polluting treatment in the graph represented in polluted plants the pollutant was absorbed and translocated inside the rice grains however the concentration of absorbed ibuprofen was less than six orders of magnitude this suggests that the molecule was either degraded by the enzymatic activity of amf or that it has been metabolized and consequently followed a different metabolic pathway in the rice plant in fact in literature it was reported that 81 of the ibuprofen absorbed by arabidopsis thaliana was metabolized and oxidized into isobutyl chain compounds marsik et al 2017 the caffeine level in rice grains was greater of 88 than ibuprofen the higher percentage of caffeine absorption compared to ibuprofen without considering the different initial concentrations can be explained if we consider the nature of the molecule it is a natural alkaloid with a chemical structure very similar to adenosine this structure allows caffeine to find preferential ways to move inside cellular compartments and occupy them fisone et al 2004 5 conclusions at the studied conditions polluted irrigation water ibuprofen caffeine stimulates growth and yield of rice while the amf treatment inhibits plant growth rice inoculation with g aggregatum revealed that there was a reduction in the grain s caffeine content amf treatment did not interact with the absorption of ibuprofen which was absorbed and translocated in rice grains at the concentration of 119 3 ng g 1 for these reasons the use of amf should be suggested when irrigation water is rich in caffeine considering the use of polluted low quality water for rice irrigation a possible presence of ppcps in the trophic chain have to be detected however this is the first study reporting the presence of exogenous caffeine and ibuprofen in rice grain and conclusions are based on the data obtained in pots trial during only one crop season at one location in view of this further studies are needed to define the possible agronomical environmental and human health risk effects of these pollutants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

measurement table 3 summarizes the selected precursor ion and fragments ions used in the analysis esi mode and appropriate collision energy 2 7 statistical analysis data were subjected to analysis of variance anova mean comparisons were performed according to the fisher s lsd test 3 results the results of preliminar germination and imbibition trials showed that there were significant differences among the three genotypes where red thai was the most sensitive in presence of micropolluttants and the only one that showed a significant seed germination reduction compared to control table 4 considering genotypes response using pollutant mix solution seed germination and mean germination time were not significantly different instead red thai had a significant reduction in epicotyl and radical dry weight than other genotypes 3 1 polluting solution 3 1 1 osmotic pressure as expected the measure of osmotic pressure showed that the polluted solutions had the same osmotic pressure of water used for irrigation 0 110 osmo kg 1 for h2o and 0 111 osmo kg 1 for polluted solutions therefore polluted solution at the studied concentrations did not affect the roots ability to absorb water from soil 3 1 2 yield the grain yield kg m 2 was significantly p 0 01 influenced by the polluting treatment whereas was not significantly changed by amf inoculation the mixed ibuprofen caffeine polluted solution on average of treatments promoted the yield of rice 51 fig 1 as the following two yield components the number of panicles m 2 122 and 193 in the control and polluted treatments respectively and the culms number per plants 5 and 9 in the control and polluted treatments respectively 3 1 3 height and total plant biomass other parameters beyond the yield and its components were positively influenced by the mixed ibuprofen caffeine solution plants irrigated with the mix showed an increase of 10 3 in height fig 2 and a total dry plant biomass roots leaves shoots greater than 40 5 compared to the plants irrigated with water p 0 01 fig 3 3 2 mycorrhizal inoculation the shoots number per plant and total dry biomass plant fig 4 were significantly negatively related to amf glomus aggregatum inoculum 22 5 and 33 respectively on the contrary the 1000 seeds weight was 20 higher p 0 01 in the the amf inoculation treatment fig 5 3 3 fluorescence values the maximal photochemical efficiency fv fm ratio is the most common parameter used in fluorescence it is inversely proportional to damage in the psii reaction centres farquhar et al 1989 fv fm ratio was significantly influenced by the three treatments polluting amf inoculation and measure data 27 july 21 august 9 september the highest values p 0 05 were measured in july both in control 0 77 and amf y polluted plants 0 76 while the significantly lower fv fm value was observed in amf y plants 0 69 the same trend was observed in august whereas in september only amf y polluted plants had markedly different behavior compared to other treatments showing a positive trend 0 78 the minimum value was referred to amf y plants 0 73 the amf y polluted plants had a higher photochemical efficiency compared to control 0 76 of 2 6 p 0 05 we also studied the variations of fv f0 ratio that expresses the basal quantum yield this ratio is much more sensitive for assessing fluorescence levels as recommended by lichtenthaler and buschmann 1984 in july the minimum fv f0 value was observed in the amf y plants 2 23 instead the maximum value was detected in control 3 38 and in amf y polluted plants 3 18 the amf y plants treatment had caused a reduction of the basal quantum yield of 51 5 compared to control and 42 6 compared to amf y pollued plants treatment p 0 05 in august the basal quantum yield was not significantly different among treatments with an average value of 3 34 in september fv f0 values started to decrease following a constant trend the only exception is the amf y polluted plants treatment which showed an increase in the basal quantum yield up to the maximum value of 3 58 whereas the other treatments showed an average basal quantum yield fv f0 of 2 97 3 4 chromatography lc esi ms ms analysis an ibuprofen and caffeine translocation in polluted rice grain has been observed caffeine analysis showed absorption rate in a range between the basal level of 52 ng g 1 control and 1060 ng g 1 of amf n polluted plants caffeine accumulation was significantly p 0 01 higher 8 8 times in the grains harvested from amf n polluted plants than amf y polluted plants fig 6 as regards ibuprofen the results showed no interactions between the four treatments the ibuprofen concentration found in the grains of polluted plants was 119 3 ng g 1 while in the unpolluted plants no absorption occurred fig 7 based on the experimental conditions about 1 09 g m 2 of ibuprofen were distribuited and 0 07 of this pharmaceutical was recovered in the grain 4 discussion the results of this study are very interesting if we consider that today in asia the average per capita consumption of rice exceeds 110 kg year 1 muthayya et al 2014 while in europe consumption is estimated between 5 4 8 8 kg capita year ferrero 2007 considering the rice grains micropollutants concentrations under our experimental conditions it can estimate that could be yearly assimilated per capita 13 mg of caffeine and 1 15 mg of ibuprofen with the greater consumption of rice asia and 2 19 mg of caffeine and 0 18 mg of ibuprofen in europe these results should be considered taking into account their complexity and potential effects on human health 4 1 yield height and total plant biomass we observed that the polluting solution stimulated the growth and the yield of the rice there are very few studies that analyzes the micro pollutant effects on crops our results agree with pietrini et al 2015 who observed that ibuprofen stimulated the growth 12 of aquatic plant lemna gibba l and with pomati et al 2004 who report that ibuprofen 1 1000 μg l 1 stimulated the growth of synechocystis sp our results for caffeine instead are opposed to the study conducted by smyth 1992 the authors observed that caffeine 2 5 mm inhibited growth of oryza sativa shoots by 50 and that also coffea arabica l had the same behavior if exposed to high concentrations of caffeine the similarities concerning growth inhibition suggested that the ability to synthesize caffeine was not an important factor in the physiological response to a high concentration of this molecule smyth 1992 4 2 mycorrhizal fungi inoculum the results showed that the studied amf inoculum inhibited the development of rice negatively influencing the number of shoots and total plant biomass but favoring the 1000 seed weight these results are supported by previous studies since raimam et al 2007 reported that the use of the amf glomus clarum inhibited the growth of rice some authors suggested that amf removed photosynthates depressing the growth of the host plant de souza moreira and siqueira 2002 also herdler et al 2008 had observed that amf biofertilizer based on glomus intraradices inhibited the growth of rice analyzing the content of c the researchers observed that the symbiosis caused a significant decrease of organic carbon 1 compared to the control in the shoots also the content of n was negatively influenced by g intraradices 2 2 mycorrhiza reduced total root length by 13 herdler et al 2008 4 3 fluorescence values photochemical efficiency values showed seasonal variability with a normal decrease during the month of september end of the rice growing cycle but the amf polluting treatment had modified this natural trend emphasizing the reactivity of the plant to common doses of solar radiation in the ultraviolet and visible range on the contrary the polluting treatment and the amf treatment showed a negatively trend compared to control that highlighted the stress induced by the micropollutants and by the g aggregatum the explanation of this reduction in photochemical efficiency could be due to the enzymatic degradation of carotenoid pigments as reported by hajkova and kummerova 2014 in his study the researchers studied the paracetamol effects analgesic antipyretic drug on the growth of lemna minor l and observed a significant reduction in photosynthetic pigments content and decrease of the relative chlorophyll fluorescence hajkova and kummerova 2014 4 4 chromatography lc esi ms ms analysis the reduction of caffeine absorption rates as a consequence of g aggregatum confirm that am fungi improve plant tolerance through specific mechanisms depending on the kind of stress involved numerous studies report how amf improves the crops tolerance to certain types of pollution phenolic compounds or heavy metals it is possible that caffeine was metabolized by g aggregatum thus limiting the translocation of the drug in rice grain instead in the case of ibuprofen the amf polluting treatment in the graph represented in polluted plants the pollutant was absorbed and translocated inside the rice grains however the concentration of absorbed ibuprofen was less than six orders of magnitude this suggests that the molecule was either degraded by the enzymatic activity of amf or that it has been metabolized and consequently followed a different metabolic pathway in the rice plant in fact in literature it was reported that 81 of the ibuprofen absorbed by arabidopsis thaliana was metabolized and oxidized into isobutyl chain compounds marsik et al 2017 the caffeine level in rice grains was greater of 88 than ibuprofen the higher percentage of caffeine absorption compared to ibuprofen without considering the different initial concentrations can be explained if we consider the nature of the molecule it is a natural alkaloid with a chemical structure very similar to adenosine this structure allows caffeine to find preferential ways to move inside cellular compartments and occupy them fisone et al 2004 5 conclusions at the studied conditions polluted irrigation water ibuprofen caffeine stimulates growth and yield of rice while the amf treatment inhibits plant growth rice inoculation with g aggregatum revealed that there was a reduction in the grain s caffeine content amf treatment did not interact with the absorption of ibuprofen which was absorbed and translocated in rice grains at the concentration of 119 3 ng g 1 for these reasons the use of amf should be suggested when irrigation water is rich in caffeine considering the use of polluted low quality water for rice irrigation a possible presence of ppcps in the trophic chain have to be detected however this is the first study reporting the presence of exogenous caffeine and ibuprofen in rice grain and conclusions are based on the data obtained in pots trial during only one crop season at one location in view of this further studies are needed to define the possible

10691,irrigation and fertilizer management are essential for sustainable development of agriculture in the arid and semiarid regions in order to obtain high yield production over irrigation and fertilization are frequently conducted by the farmer which results in a series of environmental problems in particular in the shallow groundwater areas in this paper two year field experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of irrigation and fertilization regimes on grain yield water and nitrogen productivity of mulching cultivated maize zea mays l in the hetao irrigation district of china two irrigation methods i e drip and border irrigation with different schedules were manipulated in silt loam soil the border irrigation included two three different water levels and drip irrigation was triggered by a tensiometer located at a depth of 25 cm with different matric potentials 15 25 and 35 kpa three different nitrogen fertilization levels 350 250 and 150 kg ha 1 were applied under drip irrigation controlled by the matric potential of 25 kpa soil water storage variation indicated that the active root zone concentrated at a depth of 35 60 cm in the border irrigated plots and 25 45 cm in the drip irrigated plots around 16 of irrigated water 71 out of 450 mm and 18 of supplied nitrogen fertilizer 64 out of 350 kg ha 1 were percolated into deeper zone for the farmer s irrigation and fertilization schedules border irrigation water reduced from 450 to 315 mm could decrease the deep percolation without yield reduction almost no deep percolation was detected in drip irrigation for three different matric potential controls the highest yield water and nitrogen productivity obtained from the drip irrigated plots triggered by matric potential of 15 kpa considering yield water and nitrogen productivity environmental factors and farmer s net profit drip irrigation at the matric potential of 15 kpa with 250 kg ha 1 nitrogen fertilizer or border irrigation of 315 mm is recommended for mulching cultivated maize in silt loam soil in the hetao irrigation district the nitrogen fertilizer schedule in border irrigation is desirable for optimal application keywords drip irrigation border irrigation crop water productivity partial factor productivity of nitrogen 1 introduction maize zea mays l is one of the main field crops throughout the world global maize production was around 1 1 1012 kg in 2016 yang et al 2017 china is one of the top three the other two countries are us and brazil maize production and consumption countries which produced approximately 2 6 1011 kg and consumed 2 3 1011 kg in 2017 the maize cultivated area in china was around 4 2 107 ha with a wide variation of climate and geography statistics 2018 the hetao irrigation district hid the third largest irrigation district in china is one of the major maize production regions the maize planting area was around 2 6 105 ha in the hid which accounted for 35 6 of the crop planting area around 7 3 105 ha in 2017 the annual maize production in the hid is around 3 0 109 kg the hid is located in the arid and semiarid region of china with a temperate continental climate condition the annual precipitation is around 160 mm but the annual potential evaporation is around 2300 mm feng et al 2005 ren et al 2016 the large gap between the precipitation and evaporation implies that irrigation is essential for maize production and agriculture development currently water used for irrigation in the hid is mainly diverted from the yellow river annual 4 4 109 m3 and the irrigation method is basin irrigation for most areas the irrigation depth is 400 500 mm during the maize growing season and 220 260 mm for post harvest autumn irrigation liu et al 2016 due to a large amount of water from irrigation groundwater is shallow and the depth of water table varies from 0 5 to 3 m during the growing season zhang et al 2017b in addition excessive fertilizer is frequently supplied to obtain high yield production the average supplied nitrogen fertilizer is around 350 kg ha 1 in the hid the use efficiency of nitrogen is reported to be only 35 in the hid du et al 2011 thus a large fraction of fertilizer is leached into the drainage ditches and groundwater the drainage water flows to the downstream of the hid and is pumped into the wuliangsuhai lake which results in a series of environmental problems such as eutrophication and swamping guo et al 2015 therefore proper irrigation and fertilization regimes are desired for improving water fertilizer productivity and the sustainable development of agriculture and ecology in the hid diversely effective water and fertilizer use strategies and techniques have been proposed for maize production such as mulching cultivation reduced irrigation and drip irrigation mulching with polypropylene film or crop residue is widely used for the field and cash crops due to the benefit of increasing soil accumulated temperature reducing soil evaporation and hindering weed growth chakraborty et al 2010 romic et al 2003 zhang et al 2017a 2012 the mulching cultivation is frequently combined with basin irrigation in the hid where the cultivation pattern of maize is narrow wide alternation model maize is usually sowed inside the mulched plastic film these types of cultivation and irrigation may limit the availability of water and fertilizer to plants thus reducing the water fertilizer productivity drip irrigation provides the required quantity of water directly to the root zone of plants drip irrigation can minimize the surface runoff and deep percolation thus promoting water and fertilizer use efficiencies singandhupe et al 2003 drip irrigation with film mulching which combines the advantages of mulching cultivation and drip irrigation becomes widely accepted in the arid and cold regions of china wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 the application of drip irrigation with film mulching is mainly for cash crops vázquez et al 2006 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2017b and partially for maize and other cereals zhang et al 2018 proper irrigation scheduling frequency duration of watering and quantity of water is an important aspect of irrigation water management irrigation schedule of maize may be estimated through the reference crop evapotranspiration soil moisture and potential and pan evaporation cavero et al 2008 lv et al 2011 reddy et al 1983 soil water content or matric potential is frequently used as the criterion for triggering irrigation soil matric potential is a realistic criterion for irrigation scheduling as it constitutes the force with which water is held by soil matrix and measures soil water availability to the crop optimum soil matric potential can build a favorable water and nutrition environment for plant previous research showed that high yield of maize could be obtained when soil matric potential in the plow layer 15 cm was maintained below 33 3 kpa in sandy loam soil rhoads and stanley 1973 kang et al 2010 found that soil matric potential above 20 kpa at a depth of 20 cm could be used as an indicator for maize irrigation subsurface drip irrigation in silt soil under the temperate semi humid monsoon climate a large amount of research on drip irrigation scheduling was conducted in the north of china kang et al 2004 wan et al 2010 yuan et al 2001 where the authors established the drip irrigation schedule using soil matric potential at a depth of 20 cm for different crops and soils irrigation schedule design should consider the variation of soil climate and crop species therefore it is essential to investigate drip irrigation management for the specific crop in different regions in the last few decades reduced irrigation has been proposed with consideration of water productivity in water scarcity regions igbadun et al 2008 mbagwu and osuigwe 1985 mbagwu and osuigwe 1985 reported that irrigation 75 of field capacity every day may provide desirable growth environment for maize in sandy loam soil and maize suffered from water stress when it was irrigated 50 and 25 of field capacity at a daily interval kang et al 2000 found that the yield of maize was not significantly reduced when the plant suffered from water stress 67 full irrigation at the seeding stage for loamy soil in the loess plateau of china but it reduced by 30 when water stress happened at the stem elongation stage wang et al 2017 found that water use efficiency of maize enhanced by 5 in moderate water stress 60 of soil water holding capacity in sandy loam soil under the humid tropical savannah climate compared with full irrigation 100 of soil water holding capacity el wahed and ali 2013 found that irrigation at 85 of crop evapotranspiration with 20 t ha 1 farmyard manure mulching could obtain the same maize yield as 100 crop evapotranspiration in sandy soil under drip irrigation while grain yield and irrigation water use efficiency for irrigation at 70 of crop evapotranspiration reduced by 68 and 18 respectively therefore the impact of reduced irrigation on the yield and water productivity varies with soil climate and growth stage of maize in addition to irrigation fertilization is another critical factor to ensure high crop production fertilizer in particular nitrogen is frequently excessively supplied by the farmer aiming at high yield burney et al 2010 huang et al 2001 sylvester bradley and kindred 2009 xu et al 2017 the annual nitrogen fertilizer application reaches 600 kg ha 1 in some area of china and around 45 50 of nitrogen fertilizer is detected to be leached into groundwater ju et al 2004 in the hid nitrogen use efficiency is extremely low 35 resulting from the low efficient basin irrigation and excessive fertilization thus non point source pollution is serious and the sustainability of agriculture and ecology is threatened therefore to achieve the green and sustainable maize production as well as agriculture development it is essential to understand the effect of irrigation and fertilization regimes on grain yield water and nitrogen use efficiency of maize and propose proper irrigation and fertilization regimes in the hid despite a large amount of research conducted on the effect of irrigation and fertilization regimes on crop production in the last few decades he et al 2018 miyauchi et al 2012 tiwari et al 2003 wang et al 2011 the optimum irrigation and fertilization differs with the crop soil and climate the purposes of this paper are 1 to investigate the impact of irrigation and fertilization regimes on soil water conditions and growth of maize in silt loam 2 to quantify the fate of nitrogen under different irrigation and fertilization regimes in the arid region 3 to analyze water nitrogen productivity under different irrigation and fertilization regimes and propose a proper application strategy for maize production in the hid 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description field experiments were conducted at the fenzidi experimental station in the hid of inner mongolia in 2016 and 2017 latitude 41 09 n longitude

of maize are presented in table 1 the daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated through the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 soil at a depth of 0 100 cm was sampled and analyzed using the mastersizer 2000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer texture analysis indicated that soil at a depth of 0 70 cm was silt loam and loam in 70 100 cm according to the us textural classification triangle table 2 presents the detailed physical and chemical properties of soil in the study site groundwater depth varied from 0 7 to 2 3 m in the growing season which was influenced by the irrigation of surrounding farms fig 2 the test maize zea mays l was the cultivar zeyu no 19 which was widely planted in the hid the maize was sowed on may 15th and harvested on september 26th in two experimental years the planting pattern for maize was wide narrow rows with a width of 70 and 50 cm fig 3 the wide row was mulched with polypropylene film with a breadth of 90 cm the maize seedlings were sowed close to the border of wide rows with plant spacing of 30 cm the planting density was 67 500 plants per hectare 2 2 irrigation and fertilization treatment two irrigation methods i e drip irrigation and border irrigation with different schedules were implemented in 2016 and 2017 respectively the irrigation depth for border irrigation was 450 and 315 mm in 2016 and 450 315 and 180 mm in 2017 table 3 the amount of irrigation was measured by the water meter in each treatment the irrigation depth of 450 mm irrigation 3 4 times in growing season was commonly supplied by local farmer three irrigation events at the jointing tasseling and milking stages were usually adopted the irrigation depth was about 150 mm each time the timing for border irrigation was consistent with that of the local farmer drip irrigation was triggered by a tensiometer located at a depth of 25 cm with three different matric potentials 15 25 and 35 kpa the detailed irrigation schedule of each

depth of 0 60 cm and 90 concentrated in the 0 40 cm nicoullaud et al 1994 thus irrigation design rooting depth was set to be 20 cm in the seeding stage and 40 cm in the other stages the seasonal irrigation depth of each treatment is tabulated in table 3 three nitrogen fertilization levels including 350 250 and 150 kg ha 1 were applied for the drip irrigation treatments triggered by matric potential of 25 kpa 250 kg ha 1 nitrogen fertilizer was supplied for the other drip irrigation treatments table 3 the nitrogen fertilization for each border irrigated plot was 350 kg ha 1 which was referred to the farmer fertilization prior to seeding was consisted of 135 kg ha 1 of phosphorus fertilizer diammonium phosphate p 50 and 60 kg ha 1 potassium fertilizer potassium oxide k 50 for all treatments the nitrogen fertilizer supplied prior to seeding and supplemental in different growing stages is presented in table 3 the nitrogen fertilizer was dissolved in water and transported to root zone fertigation in drip irrigated plots for the plots with border irrigation nitrogen fertilizer was uniformly spread between the polypropylene films prior to each irrigation event and then dissolved into irrigated water the experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replicates to minimize the influence of spatial heterogeneity each plot had a size of 96 m2 4 8 m 20 m 2 3 measurements leaf area index lai of maize was measured by the ceptometer accupar l80 decagon devices pullman wa three plants were cut off in each plot to measure the aboveground biomass accumulation prior to harvest the plants were first dried at 105 c for 1 h to inactivate enzyme and then dried to constant weight at 75 c thirty plants were sampled in each plot to evaluate the yield as well as its components including the traits of ears per hectare kernels per ear ear weight grain yield per plant and the 100 kernel weight of maize the grains with water content of 14 were considered as the standard yield of maize soil water content was measured by the gravimetric method soil samples were collected using an auger every 10 cm for the 20 cm upper soil and every 20 cm from 20 to 100 cm in the middle of wide and narrow rows soil was sampled every 7 days in 2016 and 10 days in 2017 three replicates were taken for each treatment soil solution was extracted from the mixture of soil and 2 mol l 1 kcl solution at a ratio of 1 5 the available nitrogen ammonium and nitrate in the soil were measured within 48 h using a continuous flow analyzer auto analyzer 3 seal analytical inc german the deep percolated soil solution was collected using a steel bucket with a diameter of 40 cm called leakage bucket the bucket was composed of a 100 cm cylinder and a 20 cm conical shape container in the bottom the 100 cm cylinder of bucket was filled with soil at the same bulk density as in the field and the conical part was emptied to collect the percolated soil solution fig 3 percolated solution was pumped after each irrigation and precipitation event and the volume of water as well as the concentration of inorganic nitrogen was measured 2 4 calculation and data analysis the actual

characteristics curve eq 5 both k θ and soil water characteristics curve were regressed using the soil particles distribution table 2 by the retc the vertical water flux was estimated daily using measured and interpolated data there was no great variation for soil water content in soil layer of 70 90 cm because of less rainfall and the controlled irrigation depths thus soil water content

the benefits the benefits are calculated from the current price and grain yield data were statistically analyzed by one way anova using the spss 20 0 spss inc chicago usa least significant difference lsd was used to test the differences among experimental treatments at a significant level of p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil moisture fig 5 illustrates the change of water storage in soil profile during the growing season different irrigation and fertilization regimes have different impacts on the variation of soil water storage the change of soil moisture mainly concentrated at a depth of 35 60 cm in all plots of border irrigation there was no evident difference in the change of water storage for different irrigation depth in contrast variation of soil moisture was mainly at a depth of 25 45 cm for all plots of drip irrigation the change of soil water storage in drip irrigated plots varied with trigger matric potential i e the plots with high trigger matric potential had less variation of soil water storage the impact of nitrogen fertilizer on the change of water storage varied with the quantity of fertilizer supplied for the identical irrigation regime the plots of 250 kg ha 1 nitrogen obtained the relatively small variation around 70 mm while there was no clear difference in the plots of 150 and 350 kg ha 1 nitrogen treatments around 100 mm the change of soil water storage is the balance of irrigation precipitation evaporation percolation and root uptake etc soil moisture affects the distribution of roots and root distribution influences water uptake as well as water distribution soil in the upper zone was always dry in plots of border irrigation due to the large gap between two irrigation events so roots extracted water in the deeper soil in contrast water content was higher in the upper zone in the drip irrigated plots thus roots took water from the upper zone of soil therefore the depth of water storage variation was higher in the drip irrigated plots than the border irrigated ones 3 2 soil nitrogen leaching and residue fig 6 shows soil water and inorganic nitrogen cumulated leakage of 1 m soil horizon during the whole growing season for different treatments without exception the cumulative leakage of nitrogen in the plots of border irrigation was much larger than those of drip irrigation the cumulative percolation in plots of border irrigation varied from 35 to 71 mm the largest irrigation depth of 450 mm refers to the farmer s irrigation had around 70 mm deep percolation which accounted for 15 6 of irrigated water the reduced irrigation 315 and 180 mm plots had percolation of 55 and 35 mm which accounted for 17 4 and 19 4 of irrigation respectively the deep percolation of drip irrigation was only a few millimeters during the whole growing season and there was no significant p 0 05 difference among treatments thus deep percolation was trivial and could be neglected in the drip irrigated plots soil nitrogen was leached out of root zone with soil water percolation the no3 n accounted for more than 96 and dominated the content of inorganic nitrogen in the soil solution the nh4 n was less mobile because it was strongly adsorbed by the clay due to its positive charge thus the leaching of nh4 n could be ignored the cumulative leakage of no3 n increased with the increase in irrigation depth fig 6b the cumulative leakage of no3 n in the border irrigation treatments was in the range of 21 to 64 kg ha 1 the largest cumulative leakage of no3 n was observed in 450 mm irrigation plots which accounted for 18 of the nitrogen fertilization cumulative leakage of no3 n in reduced irrigation 315 and 180 mm plots was around 50 and 21 kg ha 1 which accounted for 14 and 6 of the nitrogen fertilization respectively in contrast the cumulative leakage of no3 n was only 0 2 0 4 kg ha 1 in the drip irrigated plots which could be neglected hence drip irrigation can effectively minimize the leakage of nitrogen and reduce the risk of groundwater pollution the no3 n residue in soil post harvest of maize is shown in fig 7 panels a c show the residual no3 n in soil covered by polypropylene film and panels d f display the residual no3 n in inter row in general the residual no3 n accounted for more than 85 of the inorganic nitrogen in the soil profile thus only the variation of no3 n in soil profile was analyzed initial soil nitrogen was around 22 5 mg kg 1 and almost uniformly distributed in soil profile for border irrigated plots there was no evident difference in no3 n resident in the film covered area for different irrigation treatments the residual no3 n decreased with soil depth in the inter row area the average soil no3 n at a depth of 0 40 cm in the non mulching area was around 95 mg kg 1 which was much larger than that in the film covered area around 20 mg kg 1 in contrast soil no3 n in the mulching area was higher than that in non mulching area for the drip irrigated plots in vertical profile soil no3 n reduced with depth in the mulching area but in the area without film soil no3 n was almost uniformly distributed similar to the initial condition the impact of nitrogen fertilizer on concentration of soil no3 n increased with the supplemental rate under the identical irrigation condition matric potential of 25 kpa the distribution of soil nitrogen was similar for two experimental years 3 3 plant growth and biomass production the leaf area index was used as an indicator to evaluate the growth of maize fig 8 shows the lai of maize under different irrigation and fertilization regimes the lai steadily increased before milking stage and then reduced at the maturity stage for all treatments there was no evident difference in lai prior to tasseling stage for the border irrigated plots relatively larger lai was detected in the plots with larger irrigation depth for the drip irrigated plots the lai slightly varied with irrigation depth and frequency as well as fertilizer applied the larger lai was detected in higher matric potential treatments under the same nitrogen fertilization condition after tasseling stage for the identical irrigation condition matric potential of 25 kpa the lai increased with nitrogen fertilizer application the decrease of lai was delayed around 10 days in 2016 due to the larger rainfall in august table 1 the dry aboveground biomass in the late maturity stage is presented in fig 9 dry aboveground biomass varied with yearly irrigation depth under border irrigation condition in general large dry aboveground biomass obtained from the plots of high irrigation depth for drip irrigation the plots with high matric potential had significant larger dry biomass p 0 05 the maximum dry aboveground biomass was around 510 and 470 g per plant in 2016 and 2017 respectively no significant difference p 0 05 in dry aboveground biomass was found between the 250 and 350 kg ha 1 nitrogen treatments under the same irrigation condition matric potential of 25 kpa the difference of biomass between experimental years may be attributed to the variation of climate 3 4 grain yield water and fertilizer productivity grain yield of maize was significantly influenced by the matric potential controlled in the drip irrigation table 4 the grain yield ranged from 13 3 to 15 5 t ha 1 in 2016 and 10 6 to 13 0 t ha 1 in 2017 respectively the highest grain yield obtained in the plots triggered by matric potential of 15 kpa table 5 presents the traits of yield components for different irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer treatments the kernel per ear ear weight and grain yield per plant increased with matric potential but there was no significant difference in ears per hectare and 100 kernel weight for border irrigation grain yield varied with quantity of irrigation the grain yield of 450 and 315 mm irrigation depth treatments increased by around 17 compared with 180 mm it indicated that the treatment of 180 mm was deficient in irrigation and the plant suffered from water stress to certain extent but no significant difference was observed between 450 and 315 mm treatment plots which suggested that the treatment of 450 mm was over irrigated the influence of yield components the kernel per ear ear weight grain yield per plant and 100 kernel weight was consistent with the grain yield for the identical drip irrigation treatment matric potential of 25 kpa grain yield slightly increased with application rate of nitrogen fertilizer the kernel per ear grain yield per plant and 100 kernel weight increased with the increase in nitrogen fertilizer but the amount of ears per hectare was not significantly influenced the cwpet of maize generally increased with trigger matric potential under the drip irrigation table 4 significant differences p 0 05 were found in cwpet between two experimental years the maximum cwpet of drip irrigated plots was 3 47 and 3 44 kg m 3 in 2016 and 2017 respectively the cwpirrig was generally inversely correlated to trigger matric potential the maximum cwpirrig of maize was 6 65 and 7 20 kg m 3 in 2016 and 2017 respectively for the border irrigated plots the cwpet and cwpirrig decreased with increase in water amount for identical drip irrigation the effects of nitrogen fertilizer on cwpet and cwpirrig varied with the experimental years the pfpn of maize generally increased with the increase in irrigation quantity for both drip and border irrigation table 4 the maximum pfpn was 62 1 and 52 1 kg kg 1 for drip irrigated plots and 41 9 and 36 4 kg kg 1 for border irrigated plots in 2016 and 2017 respectively however over irrigation would not significantly improve the pfpn for border irrigated plots the pfpn varied with the rate of nitrogen fertilizer i e the higher pfpn was obtained in the lower nitrogen fertilization plots the pfpn of 150 kg ha 1 nitrogen treatment increased by 113 and 107 compared with 350 kg ha 1 nitrogen treatment low nitrogen fertilization improved pfpn but reduced grain yield thus only proper fertilization can promote both yield and fertilizer use efficiency 4 discussion the agro ecosystem in the arid and semiarid region is vulnerable due to the scarcity of water resource and soil salinity excessive irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer are frequently applied by the farmer in order to obtain high yield production thus a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer either remains in the soil profile or leaches into groundwater or drainage ditches which has the potential to result in a series of environmental problems such as the desertification and degradation of farmland pollution of groundwater in the shallow groundwater region and eutrophication and swamping of wetland in the downstream of catchment border irrigation is widely used in the hid the average irrigation depth is 110 150 mm each time which is much larger than the storage of soil and crop requirement the measured deep percolation was around 70 mm accounting for 16 of total irrigation which resulted in the rise of groundwater table the depth is less than 1 m fig 2 while the deep percolation of soil water in plots irrigated 315 and 180 mm reduced by 22 5 and 50 7 compared with the irrigation plots of 450 mm the planting area of maize is around 2 8 105 ha in the hid so approximately 2 0 108 m3 water around 5 of total diversion from the yellow river is lost every year through deep percolation in maize field under border irrigation it is noted that this estimation is just a rough calculation without consideration of soil spatial heterogeneity and the reuse of percolated water deep percolation is correlated with ponding time of irrigation water and generally long pounding time results in high deep percolation bethune et al 2008 in contrast little deep percolation around 0 6 was observed during the growing season in drip irrigated plots where the maximum irrigation design rooting depth was 40 cm fig 6 the results agree with the findings of kang et al 2012 who have measured the deep percolation under different matric potential controlled drip irrigation and found that the proportion of deep percolation is small for all treatments range from 0 4 to 3 4 nitrogen is leached out of the root zone with deep percolation the variation tendency of nitrogen leakage is consistent with deep percolation of soil solution fig 6 the result agrees with earlier studies conducted by gheysari et al 2009 and jia et al 2014 who have found that the nitrogen leakage increases due to the large amount of irrigation under the same application rate of nitrogen fertilizer nitrogen leakage is an important factor for non point source pollution in shallow groundwater area the average nitrogen fertilizer application is around 350 kg ha 1 in the hid the measured leakage of nitrogen is around 64 kg ha 1 in growing season under the border irrigation of 450 mm fig 6 which indicates that 18 of supplied nitrogen is leached out of root zone so the estimated annual leaching of nitrogen is 1 8 107 kg from the maize field on the basis of planting area as groundwater table is shallow the nitrogen is directly leached into the groundwater and drainage ditches it is noted that the leaching of nitrogen is estimated from the leakage bucket where the reuse of leached soil solution through capillary rise is not considered the drainage water with nitrogen flows to the downstream of the hid and is pumped into the wuliangsuhai lake the largest freshwater lake in the yellow river basin the measured input of nitrogen to the lake is 2 7 106 kg annually liu et al 2007 and the total nitrogen from agricultural sector accounts for 51 of the total load guo et al 2015 input of nitrogen causes the eutrophication and swamping of wuliangsuhai lake reduction of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization is one of the effective ways to reduce the risk of eutrophication and swamping of wuliangsuhai lake the leaching of nitrogen 50 and 21 kg ha 1 reduces by 20 and 67 when irrigation depth decreases from 450 mm to 315 and 180 mm respectively thus the annual nitrogen leaching from maize field can reduce by 4 0 106 kg if the reduced irrigation 315 mm is carried out instead of traditional border irrigation almost no deep percolation is observed from the drip irrigated plots triggered by different matric potential which has demonstrated the reduction of non point source pollution risk in addition to the impact on the environment plant growth and yield are great concern to the grower irrigation is the main driving factor affecting water and nutrient dynamics in the root zone the distribution of soil water determines root distribution and inversely the root development influences on water and nutrient uptake which translates into biomass lai and grain yield guan et al 2014 kang et al 2000 drip irrigation can keep more water and nutrients in the root zone therefore more available water and nutrients are absorbed by maize plants and increase crop yield however plant growth is affected by many factors including soil moisture nitrogen content aeration and temperature optimal soil matric potential can create favorable soil water fertilizer gas conditions and promote crop growth in contrast a large amount of water and fertilizer is leached out of root zone in border irrigation that may cause water and nutrients stress and eventually reduce yield in addition the large gap between two irrigation events may result in water stress of plants and inhibit growth and yield production water and fertilizer productivities are critical indicators to evaluate water and fertilizer management in crop systems water productivity is used to characterize the relationship between crop production and water consumption crop water productivity of drip irrigation treatments is much higher than that of border irrigated plots table 4 drip irrigation enhances crop water productivity through the reduction of irrigation depth and the decrease in deep percolation in addition irrigation water is directly delivered to the root zone through drip irrigation tape and this can lead to an increase in crop water productivity in contrast in border irrigated plots over irrigation causes water percolation thus reducing crop water productivity table 4 drip irrigation with mulching significantly enhances partial factor productivity of nitrogen the improvement of partial factor productivity of nitrogen may result from three aspects delivering the nitrogen directly to the root zone and reducing leakage fig 5 establishing a proper soil and water environment and promoting nitrogen uptake reducing the nitrogen loss by mulching in contrast nitrogen is leached out of root zone due to over irrigation thus reducing the partial factor productivity of nitrogen in the border irrigated plots partial factor productivity of nitrogen decreases with nitrogen fertilizer supply under the drip irrigation triggered by matric potential of 25 kpa numerous research demonstrated that reduction of nitrogen application could improve nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency while excessive nitrogen application would reduce nitrogen use efficiency singh et al 1998 wang et al 2016 even though a relatively appropriate irrigation and nitrogen fertilization strategy can be proposed with consideration of yield water and fertilizer productivity and environment impact the net profit is the main concerned issue to the farmer here we analyzed the cost and benefit of maize planting under different irrigation and fertilization regimes the highest net profit for drip irrigated plots obtained from the plots triggered by matric potential of 15 kpa and nitrogen fertilizer application of 250 kg ha 1 for border irrigation the highest net profit obtained in 315 mm irrigation depth treatment with 350 kg ha 1 nitrogen fertilizer therefore comprehensively considering yield water and nitrogen productivity economic benefit and environment factors drip irrigation with film mulching triggered by matric potential of 15 kpa and 250 kg ha 1 nitrogen fertilization is considered an acceptable irrigation and fertilization strategy for maize planting in silt loam soil of the hid if drip irrigation is not available border irrigation of 315 mm is recommended according to the experiments unfortunately we didn t conduct border with different fertilization treatment so the recommendation for fertilization regime is desirable for the future research under different border irrigation schedules 5 conclusion two year field experiments were conducted in the hid to investigate the effects of irrigation and fertilization regimes on grain yield water and nitrogen productivity of mulching cultivated maize border and drip irrigation with different irrigation and fertilization schedules have been studied in silt loam soil the traditional border irrigation causes a large amount of deep percolation and nitrogen leaching during the maize growing season groundwater has high risk to be polluted under the current irrigation and fertilization regimes implemented by the farmer the irrigation and fertilizer application strategy need to be improved to maintain sustainable agriculture and ecology development drip irrigation can effectively decrease deep percolation and nitrogen leaching thus promote water and nitrogen use efficiency if drip irrigation is available soil matric potential based irrigation trigger value 15 kpa at a depth of 25 cm and 250 kg ha 1nitrogen fertilizer are recommended for maize cultivation if drip irrigation is not available border irrigation with water quantity of 315 mm is recommended for mulching cultivated maize in silt loam in the hid the nitrogen fertilizer schedule in border irrigation is desirable

10691,irrigation and fertilizer management are essential for sustainable development of agriculture in the arid and semiarid regions in order to obtain high yield production over irrigation and fertilization are frequently conducted by the farmer which results in a series of environmental problems in particular in the shallow groundwater areas in this paper two year field experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of irrigation and fertilization regimes on grain yield water and nitrogen productivity of mulching cultivated maize zea mays l in the hetao irrigation district of china two irrigation methods i e drip and border irrigation with different schedules were manipulated in silt loam soil the border irrigation included two three different water levels and drip irrigation was triggered by a tensiometer located at a depth of 25 cm with different matric potentials 15 25 and 35 kpa three different nitrogen fertilization levels 350 250 and 150 kg ha 1 were applied under drip irrigation controlled by the matric potential of 25 kpa soil water storage variation indicated that the active root zone concentrated at a depth of 35 60 cm in the border irrigated plots and 25 45 cm in the drip irrigated plots around 16 of irrigated water 71 out of 450 mm and 18 of supplied nitrogen fertilizer 64 out of 350 kg ha 1 were percolated into deeper zone for the farmer s irrigation and fertilization schedules border irrigation water reduced from 450 to 315 mm could decrease the deep percolation without yield reduction almost no deep percolation was detected in drip irrigation for three different matric potential controls the highest yield water and nitrogen productivity obtained from the drip irrigated plots triggered by matric potential of 15 kpa considering yield water and nitrogen productivity environmental factors and farmer s net profit drip irrigation at the matric potential of 15 kpa with 250 kg ha 1 nitrogen fertilizer or border irrigation of 315 mm is recommended for mulching cultivated maize in silt loam soil in the hetao irrigation district the nitrogen fertilizer schedule in border irrigation is desirable for optimal application keywords drip irrigation border irrigation crop water productivity partial factor productivity of nitrogen 1 introduction maize zea mays l is one of the main field crops throughout the world global maize production was around 1 1 1012 kg in 2016 yang et al 2017 china is one of the top three the other two countries are us and brazil maize production and consumption countries which produced approximately 2 6 1011 kg and consumed 2 3 1011 kg in 2017 the maize cultivated area in china was around 4 2 107 ha with a wide variation of climate and geography statistics 2018 the hetao irrigation district hid the third largest irrigation district in china is one of the major maize production regions the maize planting area was around 2 6 105 ha in the hid which accounted for 35 6 of the crop planting area around 7 3 105 ha in 2017 the annual maize production in the hid is around 3 0 109 kg the hid is located in the arid and semiarid region of china with a temperate continental climate condition the annual precipitation is around 160 mm but the annual potential evaporation is around 2300 mm feng et al 2005 ren et al 2016 the large gap between the precipitation and evaporation implies that irrigation is essential for maize production and agriculture development currently water used for irrigation in the hid is mainly diverted from the yellow river annual 4 4 109 m3 and the irrigation method is basin irrigation for most areas the irrigation depth is 400 500 mm during the maize growing season and 220 260 mm for post harvest autumn irrigation liu et al 2016 due to a large amount of water from irrigation groundwater is shallow and the depth of water table varies from 0 5 to 3 m during the growing season zhang et al 2017b in addition excessive fertilizer is frequently supplied to obtain high yield production the average supplied nitrogen fertilizer is around 350 kg ha 1 in the hid the use efficiency of nitrogen is reported to be only 35 in the hid du et al 2011 thus a large fraction of fertilizer is leached into the drainage ditches and groundwater the drainage water flows to the downstream of the hid and is pumped into the wuliangsuhai lake which results in a series of environmental problems such as eutrophication and swamping guo et al 2015 therefore proper irrigation and fertilization regimes are desired for improving water fertilizer productivity and the sustainable development of agriculture and ecology in the hid diversely effective water and fertilizer use strategies and techniques have been proposed for maize production such as mulching cultivation reduced irrigation and drip irrigation mulching with polypropylene film or crop residue is widely used for the field and cash crops due to the benefit of increasing soil accumulated temperature reducing soil evaporation and hindering weed growth chakraborty et al 2010 romic et al 2003 zhang et al 2017a 2012 the mulching cultivation is frequently combined with basin irrigation in the hid where the cultivation pattern of maize is narrow wide alternation model maize is usually sowed inside the mulched plastic film these types of cultivation and irrigation may limit the availability of water and fertilizer to plants thus reducing the water fertilizer productivity drip irrigation provides the required quantity of water directly to the root zone of plants drip irrigation can minimize the surface runoff and deep percolation thus promoting water and fertilizer use efficiencies singandhupe et al 2003 drip irrigation with film mulching which combines the advantages of mulching cultivation and drip irrigation becomes widely accepted in the arid and cold regions of china wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 the application of drip irrigation with film mulching is mainly for cash crops vázquez et al 2006 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2017b and partially for maize and other cereals zhang et al 2018 proper irrigation scheduling frequency duration of watering and quantity of water is an important aspect of irrigation water management irrigation schedule of maize may be estimated through the reference crop evapotranspiration soil moisture and potential and pan evaporation cavero et al 2008 lv et al 2011 reddy et al 1983 soil water content or matric potential is frequently used as the criterion for triggering irrigation soil matric potential is a realistic criterion for irrigation scheduling as it constitutes the force with which water is held by soil matrix and measures soil water availability to the crop optimum soil matric potential can build a favorable water and nutrition environment for plant previous research showed that high yield of maize could be obtained when soil matric potential in the plow layer 15 cm was maintained below 33 3 kpa in sandy loam soil rhoads and stanley 1973 kang et al 2010 found that soil matric potential above 20 kpa at a depth of 20 cm could be used as an indicator for maize irrigation subsurface drip irrigation in silt soil under the temperate semi humid monsoon climate a large amount of research on drip irrigation scheduling was conducted in the north of china kang et al 2004 wan et al 2010 yuan et al 2001 where the authors established the drip irrigation schedule using soil matric potential at a depth of 20 cm for different crops and soils irrigation schedule design should consider the variation of soil climate and crop species therefore it is essential to investigate drip irrigation management for the specific crop in different regions in the last few decades reduced irrigation has been proposed with consideration of water productivity in water scarcity regions igbadun et al 2008 mbagwu and osuigwe 1985 mbagwu and osuigwe 1985 reported that irrigation 75 of field capacity every day may provide desirable growth environment for maize in sandy loam soil and maize suffered from water stress when it was irrigated 50 and 25 of field capacity at a daily interval kang et al 2000 found that the yield of maize was not significantly reduced when the plant suffered from water stress 67 full irrigation at the seeding stage for loamy soil in the loess plateau of china but it reduced by 30 when water stress happened at the stem elongation stage wang et al 2017 found that water use efficiency of maize enhanced by 5 in moderate water stress 60 of soil water holding capacity in sandy loam soil under the humid tropical savannah climate compared with full irrigation 100 of soil water holding capacity el wahed and ali 2013 found that irrigation at 85 of crop evapotranspiration with 20 t ha 1 farmyard manure mulching could obtain the same maize yield as 100 crop evapotranspiration in sandy soil under drip irrigation while grain yield and irrigation water use efficiency for irrigation at 70 of crop evapotranspiration reduced by 68 and 18 respectively therefore the impact of reduced irrigation on the yield and water productivity varies with soil climate and growth stage of maize in addition to irrigation fertilization is another critical factor to ensure high crop production fertilizer in particular nitrogen is frequently excessively supplied by the farmer aiming at high yield burney et al 2010 huang et al 2001 sylvester bradley and kindred 2009 xu et al 2017 the annual nitrogen fertilizer application reaches 600 kg ha 1 in some area of china and around 45 50 of nitrogen fertilizer is detected to be leached into groundwater ju et al 2004 in the hid nitrogen use efficiency is extremely low 35 resulting from the low efficient basin irrigation and excessive fertilization thus non point source pollution is serious and the sustainability of agriculture and ecology is threatened therefore to achieve the green and sustainable maize production as well as agriculture development it is essential to understand the effect of irrigation and fertilization regimes on grain yield water and nitrogen use efficiency of maize and propose proper irrigation and fertilization regimes in the hid despite a large amount of research conducted on the effect of irrigation and fertilization regimes on crop production in the last few decades he et al 2018 miyauchi et al 2012 tiwari et al 2003 wang et al 2011 the optimum irrigation and fertilization differs with the crop soil and climate the purposes of this paper are 1 to investigate the impact of irrigation and fertilization regimes on soil water conditions and growth of maize in silt loam 2 to quantify the fate of nitrogen under different irrigation and fertilization regimes in the arid region 3 to analyze water nitrogen productivity under different irrigation and fertilization regimes and propose a proper application strategy for maize production in the hid 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description field experiments were conducted at the fenzidi experimental station in the hid of inner mongolia in 2016 and 2017 latitude 41 09 n longitude 107 39 e altitude 1031 m fig 1 climate condition in the study area is semi arid temperate continental climate characterized by low rainfall and high evaporation annual rainfall is around 160 mm with marked seasonality and the potential evaporation is 2300 mm the mean annual temperature is 6 8 c and the annual total sunshine duration is 3230 h monthly meteorological data during the growing season of maize are presented in table 1 the daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated through the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 soil at a depth of 0 100 cm was sampled and analyzed using the mastersizer 2000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer texture analysis indicated that soil at a depth of 0 70 cm was silt loam and loam in 70 100 cm according to the us textural classification triangle table 2 presents the detailed physical and chemical properties of soil in the study site groundwater depth varied from 0 7 to 2 3 m in the growing season which was influenced by the irrigation of surrounding farms fig 2 the test maize zea mays l was the cultivar zeyu no 19 which was widely planted in the hid the maize was sowed on may 15th and harvested on september 26th in two experimental years the planting pattern for maize was wide narrow rows with a width of 70 and 50 cm fig 3 the wide row was mulched with polypropylene film with a breadth of 90 cm the maize seedlings were sowed close to the border of wide rows with plant spacing of 30 cm the planting density was 67 500 plants per hectare 2 2 irrigation and fertilization treatment two irrigation methods i e drip irrigation and border irrigation with different schedules were implemented in 2016 and 2017 respectively the irrigation depth for border irrigation was 450 and 315 mm in 2016 and 450 315 and 180 mm in 2017 table 3 the amount of irrigation was measured by the water meter in each treatment the irrigation depth of 450 mm irrigation 3 4 times in growing season was commonly supplied by local farmer three irrigation events at the jointing tasseling and milking stages were usually adopted the irrigation depth was about 150 mm each time the timing for border irrigation was consistent with that of the local farmer drip irrigation was triggered by a tensiometer located at a depth of 25 cm with three different matric potentials 15 25 and 35 kpa the detailed irrigation schedule of each treatment is shown in fig 4 the irrigation depth i mm for each drip irrigation event was calculated by 1 i a h 0 95 θ fc θ mp ρ η where a is the experimental plot area m2 h is the irrigation design

wetting ratio is 0 65 η is the irrigation water use efficiency of drip irrigation 0 95 according to the technical code for micro irrigation engineering roots of maize are mainly distributed at the depth of 0 60 cm and 90 concentrated in the 0 40 cm nicoullaud et al 1994 thus irrigation design rooting depth was set to be 20 cm in the seeding stage and 40 cm in the other stages the seasonal irrigation depth of each treatment is tabulated in table 3 three nitrogen fertilization levels including 350 250 and 150 kg ha 1 were applied for the drip irrigation treatments triggered by matric potential of 25 kpa 250 kg ha 1 nitrogen fertilizer was supplied for the other drip irrigation treatments table 3 the nitrogen fertilization for each border irrigated plot was 350 kg ha 1 which was referred to the farmer fertilization prior to seeding was consisted of 135 kg ha 1 of phosphorus fertilizer diammonium phosphate p 50 and 60 kg ha 1 potassium fertilizer potassium oxide k 50 for all treatments the nitrogen fertilizer supplied prior to seeding and supplemental in different growing stages is presented in table 3 the nitrogen fertilizer was dissolved in water and transported to root zone fertigation in drip irrigated plots for the plots with border irrigation nitrogen fertilizer was uniformly spread between the polypropylene films prior to each irrigation event and then dissolved into irrigated water the experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replicates to minimize the influence of spatial heterogeneity each plot had a size of 96 m2 4 8 m 20 m 2 3 measurements leaf area index lai of maize was measured by the ceptometer accupar l80 decagon devices pullman wa three plants were cut off in each plot to measure the aboveground biomass accumulation prior to harvest the plants were first dried at 105 c for 1 h to inactivate enzyme and then dried to constant weight at 75 c thirty plants were sampled in each plot to evaluate the yield as well as its components including the traits of ears per hectare kernels per ear ear weight grain yield per plant and the 100 kernel weight of maize the grains with water content of 14 were considered as the standard yield of maize soil water content was measured by the gravimetric method soil samples were collected using an auger every 10 cm for the 20 cm upper soil and every 20 cm from 20 to 100 cm in the middle of wide and narrow rows soil was sampled every 7 days in 2016 and 10 days in 2017 three replicates were taken for each treatment soil solution was extracted from the mixture of soil and 2 mol l 1 kcl solution at a ratio of 1 5 the available nitrogen ammonium and nitrate in the soil were measured within 48 h using a continuous flow analyzer auto analyzer 3 seal analytical inc german the deep percolated soil solution was collected using a steel bucket with a diameter of 40 cm called leakage bucket the bucket was composed of a 100 cm cylinder and a 20 cm conical shape container in the bottom the 100 cm cylinder of bucket was filled with soil at the same bulk density as in the field and the conical part was emptied to collect the percolated soil solution fig 3 percolated solution was pumped after each irrigation and precipitation event and the volume of water as well as the concentration of inorganic nitrogen was measured 2 4 calculation and data analysis the actual

characteristics curve eq 5 both k θ and soil water characteristics curve were regressed using the soil particles distribution table 2 by the retc the vertical water flux was estimated daily using measured and interpolated data there was no great variation for soil water content in soil layer of 70 90 cm because of less rainfall and the controlled irrigation depths thus soil water content

the benefits the benefits are calculated from the current price and grain yield data were statistically analyzed by one way anova using the spss 20 0 spss inc chicago usa least significant difference lsd was used to test the differences among experimental treatments at a significant level of p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil moisture fig 5 illustrates the change of water storage in soil profile during the growing season different irrigation and fertilization regimes have different impacts on the variation of soil water storage the change of soil moisture mainly concentrated at a depth of 35 60 cm in all plots of border irrigation there was no evident difference in the change of water storage for different irrigation depth in contrast variation of soil moisture was mainly at a depth of 25 45 cm for all plots of drip irrigation the change of soil water storage in drip irrigated plots varied with trigger matric potential i e the plots with high trigger matric potential had less variation of soil water storage the impact of nitrogen fertilizer on the change of water storage varied with the quantity of fertilizer supplied for the identical irrigation regime the plots of 250 kg ha 1 nitrogen obtained the relatively small variation around 70 mm while there was no clear difference in the plots of 150 and 350 kg ha 1 nitrogen treatments around 100 mm the change of soil water storage is the balance of irrigation precipitation evaporation percolation and root uptake etc soil moisture affects the distribution of roots and root distribution influences water uptake as well as water distribution soil in the upper zone was always dry in plots of border irrigation due to the large gap between two irrigation events so roots extracted water in the deeper soil in contrast water content was higher in the upper zone in the drip irrigated plots thus roots took water from the upper zone of soil therefore the depth of water storage variation was higher in the drip irrigated plots than the border irrigated ones 3 2 soil nitrogen leaching and residue fig 6 shows soil water and inorganic nitrogen cumulated leakage of 1 m soil horizon during the whole growing season for different treatments without exception the cumulative leakage of nitrogen in the plots of border irrigation was much larger than those of drip irrigation the cumulative percolation in plots of border irrigation varied from 35 to 71 mm the largest irrigation depth of 450 mm refers to the farmer s irrigation had around 70 mm deep percolation which accounted for 15 6 of irrigated water the reduced irrigation 315 and 180 mm plots had percolation of 55 and 35 mm which accounted for 17 4 and 19 4 of irrigation respectively the deep percolation of drip irrigation was only a few millimeters during the whole growing season and there was no significant p 0 05 difference among treatments thus deep percolation was trivial and could be neglected in the drip irrigated plots soil nitrogen was leached out of root zone with soil water percolation the no3 n accounted for more than 96 and dominated the content of inorganic nitrogen in the soil solution the nh4 n was less mobile because it was strongly adsorbed by the clay due to its positive charge thus the leaching of nh4 n could be ignored the cumulative leakage of no3 n increased with the increase in irrigation depth fig 6b the cumulative leakage of no3 n in the border irrigation treatments was in the range of 21 to 64 kg ha 1 the largest cumulative leakage of no3 n was observed in 450 mm irrigation plots which accounted for 18 of the nitrogen fertilization cumulative leakage of no3 n in reduced irrigation 315 and 180 mm plots was around 50 and 21 kg ha 1 which accounted for 14 and 6 of the nitrogen fertilization respectively in contrast the cumulative leakage of no3 n was only 0 2 0 4 kg ha 1 in the drip irrigated plots which could be neglected hence drip irrigation can effectively minimize the leakage of nitrogen and reduce the risk of groundwater pollution the no3 n residue in soil post harvest of maize is shown in fig 7 panels a c show the residual no3 n in soil covered by polypropylene film and panels d f display the residual no3 n in inter row in general the residual no3 n accounted for more than 85 of the inorganic nitrogen in the soil profile thus only the variation of no3 n in soil profile was analyzed initial soil nitrogen was around 22 5 mg kg 1 and almost uniformly distributed in soil profile for border irrigated plots there was no evident difference in no3 n resident in the film covered area for different irrigation treatments the residual no3 n decreased with soil depth in the inter row area the average soil no3 n at a depth of 0 40 cm in the non mulching area was around 95 mg kg 1 which was much larger than that in the film covered area around 20 mg kg 1 in contrast soil no3 n in the mulching area was higher than that in non mulching area for the drip irrigated plots in vertical profile soil no3 n reduced with depth in the mulching area but in the area without film soil no3 n was almost uniformly distributed similar to the initial condition the impact of nitrogen fertilizer on concentration of soil no3 n increased with the supplemental rate under the identical irrigation condition matric potential of 25 kpa the distribution of soil nitrogen was similar for two experimental years 3 3 plant growth and biomass production the leaf area index was used as an indicator to evaluate the growth of maize fig 8 shows the lai of maize under different irrigation and fertilization regimes the lai steadily increased before milking stage and then reduced at the maturity stage for all treatments there was no evident difference in lai prior to tasseling stage for the border irrigated plots relatively larger lai was detected in the plots with larger irrigation depth for the drip irrigated plots the lai slightly varied with irrigation depth and frequency as well as fertilizer applied the larger lai was detected in higher matric potential treatments under the same nitrogen fertilization condition after tasseling stage for the identical irrigation condition matric potential of 25 kpa the lai increased with nitrogen fertilizer application the decrease of lai was delayed around 10 days in 2016 due to the larger rainfall in august table 1 the dry aboveground biomass in the late maturity stage is presented in fig 9 dry aboveground biomass varied with yearly irrigation depth under border irrigation condition in general large dry aboveground biomass obtained from the plots of high irrigation depth for drip irrigation the plots with high matric potential had significant larger dry biomass p 0 05 the maximum dry aboveground biomass was around 510 and 470 g per plant in 2016 and 2017 respectively no significant difference p 0 05 in dry aboveground biomass was found between the 250 and 350 kg ha 1 nitrogen treatments under the same irrigation condition matric potential of 25 kpa the difference of biomass between experimental years may be attributed to the variation of climate 3 4 grain yield water and fertilizer productivity grain yield of maize was significantly influenced by the matric potential controlled in the drip irrigation table 4 the grain yield ranged from 13 3 to 15 5 t ha 1 in 2016 and 10 6 to 13 0 t ha 1 in 2017 respectively the highest grain yield obtained in the plots triggered by matric potential of 15 kpa table 5 presents the traits of yield components for different irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer treatments the kernel per ear ear weight and grain yield per plant increased with matric potential but there was no significant difference in ears per hectare and 100 kernel weight for border irrigation grain yield varied with quantity of irrigation the grain yield of 450 and 315 mm irrigation depth treatments increased by around 17 compared with 180 mm it indicated that the treatment of 180 mm was deficient in irrigation and the plant suffered from water stress to certain extent but no significant difference was observed between 450 and 315 mm treatment plots which suggested that the treatment of 450 mm was over irrigated the influence of yield components the kernel per ear ear weight grain yield per plant and 100 kernel weight was consistent with the grain yield for the identical drip irrigation treatment matric potential of 25 kpa grain yield slightly increased with application rate of nitrogen fertilizer the kernel per ear grain yield per plant and 100 kernel weight increased with the increase in nitrogen fertilizer but the amount of ears per hectare was not significantly influenced the cwpet of maize generally increased with trigger matric potential under the drip irrigation table 4 significant differences p 0 05 were found in cwpet between two experimental years the maximum cwpet of drip irrigated plots was 3 47 and 3 44 kg m 3 in 2016 and 2017 respectively the cwpirrig was generally inversely correlated to trigger matric potential the maximum cwpirrig of maize was 6 65 and 7 20 kg m 3 in 2016 and 2017 respectively for the border irrigated plots the cwpet and cwpirrig decreased with increase in water amount for identical drip irrigation the effects of nitrogen fertilizer on cwpet and cwpirrig varied with the experimental years the pfpn of maize generally increased with the increase in irrigation quantity for both drip and border irrigation table 4 the maximum pfpn was 62 1 and 52 1 kg kg 1 for drip irrigated plots and 41 9 and 36 4 kg kg 1 for border irrigated plots in 2016 and 2017 respectively however over irrigation would not significantly improve the pfpn for border irrigated plots the pfpn varied with the rate of nitrogen fertilizer i e the higher pfpn was obtained in the lower nitrogen fertilization plots the pfpn of 150 kg ha 1 nitrogen treatment increased by 113 and 107 compared with 350 kg ha 1 nitrogen treatment low nitrogen fertilization improved pfpn but reduced grain yield thus only proper fertilization can promote both yield and fertilizer use efficiency 4 discussion the agro ecosystem in the arid and semiarid region is vulnerable due to the scarcity of water resource and soil salinity excessive irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer are frequently applied by the farmer in order to obtain high yield production thus a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer either remains in the soil profile or leaches into groundwater or drainage ditches which has the potential to result in a series of environmental problems such as the desertification and degradation of farmland pollution of groundwater in the shallow groundwater region and eutrophication and swamping of wetland in the downstream of catchment border irrigation is widely used in the hid the average irrigation depth is 110 150 mm each time which is much larger than the storage of soil and crop requirement the measured deep percolation was around 70 mm accounting for 16 of total irrigation which resulted in the rise of groundwater table the depth is less than 1 m fig 2 while the deep percolation of soil water in plots irrigated 315 and 180 mm reduced by 22 5 and 50 7 compared with the irrigation plots of 450 mm the planting area of maize is around 2 8 105 ha in the hid so approximately 2 0 108 m3 water around 5 of total diversion from the yellow river is lost every year through deep percolation in maize field under border irrigation it is noted that this estimation is just a rough calculation without consideration of soil spatial heterogeneity and the reuse of percolated water deep percolation is correlated with ponding time of irrigation water and generally long pounding time results in high deep percolation bethune et al 2008 in contrast little deep percolation around 0 6 was observed during the growing season in drip irrigated plots where the maximum irrigation design rooting depth was 40 cm fig 6 the results agree with the findings of kang et al 2012 who have measured the deep percolation under different matric potential controlled drip irrigation and found that the proportion of deep percolation is small for all treatments range from 0 4 to 3 4 nitrogen is leached out of the root zone with deep percolation the variation tendency of nitrogen leakage is consistent with deep percolation of soil solution fig 6 the result agrees with earlier studies conducted by gheysari et al 2009 and jia et al 2014 who have found that the nitrogen leakage increases due to the large amount of irrigation under the same application rate of nitrogen fertilizer nitrogen leakage is an important factor for non point source pollution in shallow groundwater area the average nitrogen fertilizer application is around 350 kg ha 1 in the hid the measured leakage of nitrogen is around 64 kg ha 1 in growing season under the border irrigation of 450 mm fig 6 which indicates that 18 of supplied nitrogen is leached out of root zone so the estimated annual leaching of nitrogen is 1 8 107 kg from the maize field on the basis of planting area as groundwater table is shallow the nitrogen is directly leached into the groundwater and drainage ditches it is noted that the leaching of nitrogen is estimated from the leakage bucket where the reuse of leached soil solution through capillary rise is not considered the drainage water with nitrogen flows to the downstream of the hid and is pumped into the wuliangsuhai lake the largest freshwater lake in the yellow river basin the measured input of nitrogen to the lake is 2 7 106 kg annually liu et al 2007 and the total nitrogen from agricultural sector accounts for 51 of the total load guo et al 2015 input of nitrogen causes the eutrophication and swamping of wuliangsuhai lake reduction of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization is one of the effective ways to reduce the risk of eutrophication and swamping of wuliangsuhai lake the leaching of nitrogen 50 and 21 kg ha 1 reduces by 20 and 67 when irrigation depth decreases from 450 mm to 315 and 180 mm respectively thus the annual nitrogen leaching from maize field can reduce by 4 0 106 kg if the reduced irrigation 315 mm is carried out instead of traditional border irrigation almost no deep percolation is observed from the drip irrigated plots triggered by different matric potential which has demonstrated the reduction of non point source pollution risk in addition to the impact on the environment plant growth and yield are great concern to the grower irrigation is the main driving factor affecting water and nutrient dynamics in the root zone the distribution of soil water determines root distribution and inversely the root development influences on water and nutrient uptake which translates into biomass lai and grain yield guan et al 2014 kang et al 2000 drip irrigation can keep more water and nutrients in the root zone therefore more available water and nutrients are absorbed by maize plants and increase crop yield however plant growth is affected by many factors including soil moisture nitrogen content aeration and temperature optimal soil matric potential can create favorable soil water fertilizer gas conditions and promote crop growth in contrast a large amount of water and fertilizer is leached out of root zone in border irrigation that may cause water and nutrients stress and eventually reduce yield in addition the large gap between two irrigation events may result in water stress of plants and inhibit growth and yield production water and fertilizer productivities are critical indicators to evaluate water and fertilizer management in crop systems water productivity is used to characterize the relationship between crop production and water consumption crop water productivity of drip irrigation treatments is much higher than that of border irrigated plots table 4 drip irrigation enhances crop water productivity through the reduction of irrigation depth and the decrease in deep percolation in addition irrigation water is directly delivered to the root zone through drip irrigation tape and this can lead to an increase in crop water productivity in contrast in border irrigated plots over irrigation causes water percolation thus reducing crop water productivity table 4 drip irrigation with mulching significantly enhances partial factor productivity of nitrogen the improvement of partial factor productivity of nitrogen may result from three aspects delivering the nitrogen directly to the root zone and reducing leakage fig 5 establishing a proper soil and water environment and promoting nitrogen uptake reducing the nitrogen loss by mulching in contrast nitrogen is leached out of root zone due to over irrigation thus reducing the partial factor productivity of nitrogen in the border irrigated plots partial factor productivity of nitrogen decreases with nitrogen fertilizer supply under the drip irrigation triggered by matric potential of 25 kpa numerous research demonstrated that reduction of nitrogen application could improve nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency while excessive nitrogen application would reduce nitrogen use efficiency singh et al 1998 wang et al 2016 even though a relatively appropriate irrigation and nitrogen fertilization strategy can be proposed with consideration of yield water and fertilizer productivity and environment impact the net profit is the main concerned issue to the farmer here we analyzed the cost and benefit of maize planting under different irrigation and fertilization regimes the highest net profit for drip irrigated plots obtained from the plots triggered by matric potential of 15 kpa and nitrogen fertilizer application of 250 kg ha 1 for border irrigation the highest net profit obtained in 315 mm irrigation depth treatment with 350 kg ha 1 nitrogen fertilizer therefore comprehensively considering yield water and nitrogen productivity economic benefit and environment factors drip irrigation with film mulching triggered by matric potential of 15 kpa and 250 kg ha 1 nitrogen fertilization is considered an acceptable irrigation and fertilization strategy for maize planting in silt loam soil of the hid if drip irrigation is not available border irrigation of 315 mm is recommended according to the experiments unfortunately we didn t conduct border with different fertilization treatment so the recommendation for fertilization regime is desirable for the future research under different border irrigation schedules 5 conclusion two year field experiments were conducted in the hid to investigate the effects of irrigation and fertilization regimes on grain yield water and nitrogen productivity of mulching cultivated maize border and drip irrigation with different irrigation and fertilization schedules have been studied in silt loam soil the traditional border irrigation causes a large amount of deep percolation and nitrogen leaching during the maize growing season groundwater has high risk to be polluted under the current irrigation and fertilization regimes implemented by the farmer the irrigation and fertilizer application strategy need to be improved to maintain sustainable agriculture and ecology development drip irrigation can effectively decrease deep percolation and nitrogen leaching thus promote water and nitrogen use efficiency if drip irrigation is available soil matric potential based irrigation trigger value 15 kpa at a depth of 25 cm and 250 kg ha 1nitrogen fertilizer are recommended for maize cultivation if drip irrigation is not available border irrigation with water quantity of 315 mm is recommended for mulching cultivated maize in silt loam in the hid the nitrogen fertilizer schedule in border irrigation is desirable

10692,determining the timing of supplementary irrigation in water limited conditions is one approach to reducing drought damage increasing water productivity and improving the yield of dryland canola selenium spraying may be an appropriate strategy for increasing crop tolerance to drought stress the aim of this research was to evaluate supplementary irrigation and selenium spraying on the yield and water productivity of two canola cultivars under subtropical dryland conditions the experiment was a split factorial in a randomized complete block design with three replications conducted during 2016 2018 at gachsaran agricultural research station iran the main factors consisted of irrigation regimes no irrigation i1 supplementary irrigation at flowering stage i2 grain filling i3 and flowering grain filling i4 and a sub factor comprising hyola 401 water stress tolerant and delgan less tolerant to water stress cultivars and selenium spaying from the source of sodium selenate na2seo4 zero s0 1 5 s1 and 3 s2 mg l 1 results showed that the application of supplementary irrigation increased the yield yield components oil percentage harvest index and water productivity selenium spraying increased the weight of 1000 seeds and grain yield grain yield was increased from 802 kg ha 1 in s0 and i1 treatment up to 2274 kg ha 1 in s2 and i4 the delgan and hyola harvest index rose from 19 94 and 22 1 in i1 to 29 13 and 26 99 in i4 respectively the highest oil percentage 37 6 was observed in the i4 regime the highest water productivity 0 67 kg m 3 was obtained from i4 and s2 treatments and the lowest water productivity 0 34 kg m 3 was seen in i1 and s0 treatments generally the results showed that high yielding canola production can be achieved through supplementary irrigation in two stages flowering and grain filling stages and by applying 1 5 mg l 1 selenium foliar application in subtropical dryland conditions keywords dryland farming flowering irrigation regimes selenium water stress 1 introduction canola brassica napus l is the second most important source of edible oil in the world fao 2017 the area under cultivation of canola in the world is approximately 35 million hectares the average grain yield is 2194 kg ha 1 and the total production is around 76 million tons the area under cultivation of canola in iran is almost 70 thousand hectares the average grain yield is 1825 kg ha 1 and the total production is 128 thousand tons fao 2017 dryland cultivation is possible in the subtropical regions of iran with an average rainfall of at least 300 mm since almost 90 of the regions in iran are considered as arid and semi arid bannayan et al 2010 canola is an appropriate alternative for cultivation in semi arid areas owing to its high water consumption efficacy and relative tolerance to drought stress albarrak 2006 the growth period of this plant coincides with rainfall late in fall winter and early spring in the late growth stage however there is a water shortage and a sharp rise in temperature therefore the adoption of a suitable cultivation management for an optimum use of the existing water and the resultant reduction in the impact of drought stress will augment the production of dryland canola most arid and semi arid regions of iran with a moderately warm climate get relatively proper rainfalls in march april and may hence canola meeting certain degrees of water requirement at the ﬂowering and seed ﬁlling stages moreover water deficiency in these stages reduces the yield and yield components of canola furthermore for a sustainable production of canola and improvement in its economic performance it is necessary to consider proper strategies such as supplementary irrigation in dryland areas especially in late fall drought stress leads to lower yields due to insufficient rainfall throughout spring dogan et al 2011 in canola drought stress has an adverse effect on the balance of the source and sink of photosynthetic materials further decreasing the yield and grain yield components accordingly canola is highly susceptible to drought stress during flowering and grain filling dogan et al 2011 one way to reduce drought damage in dryland conditions is supplementary irrigation in addition to rainfall supplementary irrigation increases the yield and yield components in canola taylor et al 1991 in research to determine the effect of water stress on canola with irrigation treatments from 0 to 359 mm a significant difference was observed regarding canola yield and yield components between no irrigation and supplementary irrigation bañuelos et al 2002 pavlista et al 2016 showed that canola cultivar hyola 357 required 180 and 230 mm of water consumption by rainfall or irrigation for a maximum biological yield and plant height in that study the highest grain yield was obtained by consuming 430 mm of water 273 mm of which was provided by rainfall the water use of canola has been investigated in certain agro environmental conditions hergert et al 2016 gu et al 2017 pavlista et al 2016 lenssen et al 2012 hunsaker et al 2013 hu et al 2015 george et al 2018 zeleke et al 2014 dogan et al 2011 reported that the amount of irrigation water under semi dry climatic conditions should not be less than 250 mm moreover each level of supplementary irrigation significantly increased plant height 1000grain weight biomass and yield depending on the environmental conditions and the water management strategy in their study the canola grain yield was approximately 4 t ha 1 and the total biomass was 18 t ha 1 with full irrigation noteworthy irrigation during rapid growth stages had a significant effect on the yield and yield components of canola cultivars introduced for dryland conditions this effect was more pronounced during the years of low rainfall hence the importance of supplementary irrigation in canola for an improved economic performance dogan et al 2011 sinaki et al 2007 reported that dehydration stress during flowering to ripening reduced the grain yield and number of pods per plant in canola however the number of seeds per pod was not affected by stress water productivity is an essential measurement to determine plant productivity under water limited conditions katerji et al 2008 the atmospheric demand is significantly higher in dryer climates where the plant needs to transpire more water to produce a unit of dry matter research on maize showed that water use efficiency increased with the reduction in water consumption hao et al 2015 in different studies various compounds have been considered to reduce the effects of water stress on plants selenium has been introduced as a useful element for plant growth because it is able to protect plants against the adverse effects of stress further reported are the myriad beneficial effects of selenium application on plant growth seed germination photosynthesis respiration and tolerance to stresses such as salinity heat cold optical radiation and drought feng et al 2013 selenium plays many roles with regards to plants one of which is of an antioxidant nature by preventing the formation of active oxygen species selenium participates in intracellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress caused by drought paciolla et al 2011 owing to its antioxidant properties selenium can positively influence plant growth and development particularly in stressed environments nawaz et al 2015 in many studies a direct relationship has been reported between dry matter production and selenium application and selenium has been observed to increase resistance to drought stress boldrin et al 2013 wu et al 2016 hasanuzzaman et al 2017 seppänen et al 2018 ulhassan et al 2019 furthermore selenium treated rice plants had higher water use efficiency higher net photosynthesis and stronger antioxidant systems andrade et al 2018 there is limited information on dryland canola response to the number and timings of supplementary irrigation and simultaneously selenium application in the sub tropical regions of iran therefore the present experiment was designed to determine the quantitative and qualitative yield and water productivity of two canola cultivars by supplementary irrigation with selenium spraying under dryland conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and climatic conditions this research was carried out in two cultivation years during 2016 2018 at gachsaran agricultural research station a subtropical region in southern iran with 710 meter height from the sea the station is located at 50 50 e and 30 17 n the average rainfall and temperature of 30 years are 375 mm and 23 7 c respectively rainfall occurs mainly in the middle of fall the whole winter and early spring this region has a sub tropical and semi arid climate with hot and dry summers and low annual rainfall prior to planting a compound soil surface 0 30 cm sample was gathered exposed to air to dry passed through a 2 mm sieve and sent to the laboratory the physicochemical characteristics of the soil are presented in table 1 supplementary irrigation was done by using of surface irrigation method irrigation water was applied to all plots via pump outlet and plastic pipes and a water meter was used to measure the applied water water analytical results are shown in table 2 fig 1 shows the average monthly rainfall and temperature of the experimental site during the two growth seasons of canola in each year from december 2016 to may 2017 and 2018 calculated by the data provided by the national meteorological organization iran 2 2 experimental design the experiment was performed as split factorial in a randomized complete block design with three replications irrigation regimes were the main plots with four levels no irrigation i1 supplementary irrigation at flowering stage i2 supplementary irrigation at grain filling stage i3 and supplementary irrigation at flowering stage grain filling i4 cultivars hyola 401 and delgan and selenium treatments of sodium selenate na2seo4 at three levels without selenium s0 1 5 s1 and 3 s2 mg l 1 were subplots in a factorial design 2 3 crop management the farm utilized for the experiment was fallowed for a year prior to each year of the experiment based on the soil analysis results 75 kg ha 1 nitrogen fertilizer from urea fertilizer and 50 kg ha 1phosphorus from triple superphosphate were applied all the phosphate fertilizers and half of the nitrogen fertilizers were applied prior to cultivating with the rest of the nitrogen fertilizer applied at the beginning of stem elongation sowing was carried out on december 15 and 17 of 2016 and 2017 respectively hyola 401 canadian origin and delgan iranian origin were used hyola 401 is a two zero spring type and drought tolerant cultivar and delgan is a two zero spring growth type which is less tolerant to drought both cultivars are adapted to fall seeding in warm areas each subplot was comprised of eight five meter rows with a spacing of 25 cm the distances between replications the main plots and the subplots were 3 2 and 0 5 m respectively the amount of seed based on 1000 grain weight was calculated at 6 kg ha 1 and seeds were sowed at a depth of 2 3 cm thinning was done at the 2 4 leaf stage and plant density was adjusted to 80 plant m 2 canola was harvested on may 25 2017 and may 27 2018 2 4 selenium spray the sprayer was manually calibrated to determine the amount of water used to cover the entire planted area sodium selenate na2seo4 solutions were then prepared based on soluble selenium levels of 1 5 and 3 mg l 1 for solvent adhesion to the plant an emulsifier maxfer cor was used and the solution spraying was performed at 8 10 am leaf spraying with selenium was done once based on the descriptive method provided by the canola council of canada 2016 on stem elongation 2 5 supplementary irrigation the gravimetric method was employed for the determination of irrigation amounts using soil moisture measurements as needed from the depth of root development in the center of each plot an electronic pump and a surface method were used for the irrigation of the experimental ﬁeld plots to supply the required water in supplementary irrigation soil samples were prepared from the roots development depth 0 6 m in the experimental plots one day prior to irrigation the samples were weighed and dried in an oven for 24 h at a temperature of 105 c surface runoff was not evident during the years of experiment and regarding the irrigation water calculation method drainage was considered negligible the amount of water used for each plot was calculated using eq 1 katerji et al 2008 1 ig θfc θ ρ d a 100 ie where ig is irrigation requirement m3 θfc is soil moisture content at the field capacity point θ is soil moisture content during sampling ρ is soil bulk density kg m 3 d is root development depth 0 6 m a is plot area m2 and ie is irrigation efficiency considered as 0 65 sepaskhah 2003 the amount of water used in each trial plot was sufficient to reach field capacity and recorded through supplementary irrigation with an electric pump and the water meter installed at the water inlet the supplementary irrigation by growth stages were applied according to the descriptive method of canola council of canada 2016 in stages 60 flowering and 70 during the grain filling 2 6 yield and yield component measurements at physiological maturity 20 plants were randomly selected from each plot and the number of pods per plant and grains in the pod was measured four samples of 250 grains in each experimental plot were weighed to determine 1000 seed weight following physiological maturity 3 m2 of the middle rows were harvested and after drying on farm four days grains were threshed and grain yield was determined at 12 moisture harvest index was calculated from the ratio of grain yield to total dry weight biological yield multiplied by 100 ten 10 g samples were randomly taken from each treatment and grain oil percentage was determined using a soxhlet extractor machine oil yield was calculated from the product of grain oil percentage and grain yield 2 7 calculation of water productivity water productivity was calculated from the ratio of grain yield to the amount of consumed water irrigation water and rainfall based on eq 2 howell 1994 2 wp y wi where wp is water productivity y kg is grain yield and wi m3 is the amount of consumed water total irrigation and rainfall the amount of water entering the test soil was calculated by the rainfall data of the national meteorological organization iran 2 8 statistical analysis the bartlett test and the data normality test were performed prior to statistical analysis and means were compared based on the mentioned pretests the analysis of variance on the two year data was performed using glm sas sas 9 1 3 sas institute inc cary nc usa in all signiﬁcant interactions the slicing and the mean comparisons were made based on the l s means procedure of the sas program the main effects mean values were compared using lsd test and all the charts were drawn using excel software 3 results there was a slight difference in weather conditions between the two years of canola growth season in the first year rain distribution was better early in the season while in the second year it was better at the end of the growth season in the first year of the experiment 2016 17 the average of minimum monthly temperature was more than the second year 2017 18 yet the average of maximum monthly temperature was less in the second year of experiment from december to may the average of minimum and maximum monthly temperatures was 0 35 c less and 0 62 c more than the first year fig 1 respectively in the first year during the canola growth season the average minimum and maximum relative humidity was 29 7 and 77 4 and in the second year it was 30 3 and 78 1 respectively in each year of experiment about 336 8 mm of water total rainfall and supplementary irrigation was consumed during 2016 17 236 8 and 100 mm and in 2017 18 176 8 and 160 mm were provided by rain and supplementary irrigation respectively the rainfall in each year of experiment was less than the average long term rainfall rainfall in the second year the early and mid seasons was lower and the weather was warmer compared with the first year nonetheless during the late growth season rainfall was higher than the first year specifically in march april and may fig 1 dogan et al 2011 utilized 225 and 250 mm of water for full the irrigation of canola farm in turkey during the two planting seasons respectively which was lower than the amount of water consumed in this experiment 3 1 number of pods per plant the interactions of year with selenium and year with irrigation were significant concerning the number of pods per plant table 3 in both years selenium increased the number of pods on the plant the number of pods per plant in 2016 17 with s1 and s2 was 7 3 and 9 5 higher than s0 respectively also in 2017 18 the number of pods per plant in s1 and s2 was 4 5 and 6 1 higher than s0 respectively the number of pods in hyola 401 cultivar was 6 7 and 11 8 higher than delgan cultivar during the years 2016 17 and 2017 18 respectively fig 2 the triple interaction of irrigation varieties and selenium significantly affected the number of pods per plant table 3 in all irrigation regimes selenium increased the number of pods per plant in delgan cultivar however it did not affect the hyola 401 cultivar and the number of pods in delgan cultivar was higher than the hyola 401 cultivar in regime i2 in contrast to i1 the number of pods in the hyola 401 cultivar was higher than the delgan cultivar at this level of irrigation there was a significant difference between the levels of selenium regarding the number of pods per plant moreover at level i3 selenium increased the number of pods per plant in both hyola 401 and delgan cultivars however there was a significant difference between the levels of selenium as far as the number of pods per plant is concerned although no significant difference was observed between the s0 and s1 about delgan and s1 and s2 for hyola 401 in i4 regime selenium levels increased the pods per plant in both cultivars and a significant difference was found in number of pods per plant in the irrigation regimes of i2 and i4 the number of pods per plant was more than i1 and i3 this number was higher in hyola 401 cultivar in supplementary irrigation regimes while it was lower than delgan cultivar in dryland conditions fig 3 3 2 weight of 1000 seeds the interaction between irrigation and cultivars as well as the effect of selenium on 1000 seed weight was significant table 3 however no significant difference was seen among the i1 regimes for 1000 seed weight but in i2 and i3 the 1000 seed weight of hyola 401 cultivar was 4 6 and 9 3 higher than delgan cultivar respectively unlikely the 1000 seed weight of delgan cultivar was 2 8 higher than that of hyola as concerns i4 cultivar the highest 1000 seed weight 3 3 g was in i3 for the hyola cultivar while the lowest 2 33 g was identified in the delgan cultivar in i2 fig 4 a higher selenium concentrations increased 1000 seed weight the average weight of 1000 seeds varied from 2 3 g in s0 to 6 2 g in s2 the 1000 seed weight in s2 and s1 was 13 and 8 7 higher than s0 respectively the 1000 seed weight in s2 was 4 higher than s1 fig 4b 3 3 grain yield the interactions between irrigation and selenium and irrigation and cultivars had a significant influence on the grain yield table 3 at all levels of irrigation selenium application increased the grain yield in both concentrations compared to selenium free treatment but no difference was observed between the two selenium application treatments grain yield followed the order of i4 i2 i3 i1 in i4 the grain yield of delgan cultivar compared to hyola cultivar was more than other irrigation treatments in general grain yield in all supplementary irrigations was higher compared with that of dryland level however the increase in the yield pertaining to supplementary irrigation was higher in treatment with two supplementary irrigations at the flowering and grain filling stages the interaction between irrigation and selenium showed that the grain yield rose from 802 kg ha 1 in s0 and i1 to 2274 kg ha 1 in s2 and i4 fig 5 under dryland conditions and one supplementary irrigation treatment hyola cultivar was superior to delgan cultivar in terms of grain yield in two irrigation conditions the yield of both cultivars increased with delgan cultivar becoming more superior in i4 the grain yield of delgan cultivar 2424 kg ha 1 was 8 2 times more than its yield 850 kg ha 1 in i1 furthermore the grain yield of hyola 2058 kg ha 1 was 2 3 times more than its yield 911 kg ha 1 in i1 fig 5b 3 4 dry matter yield the interactions between irrigation and selenium and irrigation and cultivar had a significant impact on dry matter yield table 3 the dry matter yield was significantly increased by selenium spraying only in i1 and i3 regimes while it was irrelevant in other irrigation regimes concerning i3 the dry matter yield in s2 and s1 were 12 and 10 higher than s0 respectively moreover in the supplementary irrigation regime at the grain filling stage the dry matter yield in s2 and s1 was 3 2 and 2 4 higher than s0 respectively fig 6 a the interaction between irrigation and cultivar showed that the dry matter yield of the cultivars was different under different irrigation regimes regarding i1 and i4 delgan was superior but in the other two treatments hyola had a higher dry matter yield with twice supplementary irrigation in i4 compared to non irrigation in i1 the dry matter yield of delgan and hyola cultivars increased by 95 and 85 respectively fig 6b in general supplementary irrigation increased the dry matter yield compared to complete dryland conditions although the increase in dry matter yield was the highest in supplementary irrigation at flowering and grain filling stages fig 6a and 6b 3 5 harvest index the interaction between irrigation and cultivar and the effect of selenium on harvest index were significant table 4 with regards to i1 i2 and i3 regimes the harvest index of hyola 401 was 10 8 2 5 and 2 4 higher than delgan cultivar in i4 delgan harvest index was 8 more than hyola 401 harvest index increased with supplementary irrigation i4 compared with one supplementary irrigation i2 regime after non irrigation and one irrigation regimes the harvest index of hyola cultivar was lower than delgan cultivar and with two supplementary irrigations the harvest index decreased delgan harvest index rose from 19 94 in i1 to 29 13 in i4 and hyola harvest index increased from 22 1 in i1 to 26 99 in i4 showing increases of 9 19 and 4 89 respectively fig 7 a the effect of selenium on harvest index was significant but negligible and there was no significant difference between s1 and s2 treatments the harvest index in s1 and s2 was 0 51 and 0 63 higher than s0 respectively fig 7b 3 6 grain oil percentage the effects of selenium cultivar and irrigation regimes on grain oil percentage were significant table 4 selenium had a minimal effect on grain oil percentage and there was no significant difference between the amount of grain oil percentage in s1 and s2 treatments however the amount of grain oil percentage in s2 treatment 35 40 was 1 higher than s0 treatment 34 39 fig 8 a the grain oil percentage of hyola cultivar 35 53 was 1 3 higher than that of delgan cultivar 34 18 fig 8b the highest percentage of grain oil content was obtained from two supplementary irrigations the grain oil percentage produced by one supplementary irrigation treatment was higher than non irrigation treatment no significant difference was observed between i2 and i3 treatments as far as grain oil percentage is concerned fig 8c 3 7 oil yield the interaction between irrigation and cultivars and the effect of selenium on oil yield were meaningful table 4 supplementary irrigation regimes increased the oil yield of cultivars compared to non irrigation as concerns i1 i2 and i3 regimes the oil yield of hyola 401 cultivar was 22 18 and 8 higher than delgan cultivar however in i4 delgan oil yield was 14 higher than that of hyola 401 the highest oil yield was found in i4 where delgan cultivar oil yield 798 kg ha 1 was 3 times more than its yield 264 kg ha 1 in i1 and the oil yield of hyola cultivar 788 kg ha 1 was 2 6 times more than its yield 300 kg ha 1 in i1 fig 9 a application of selenium increased the oil yield from 515 kg ha 1 s0 to 544 s1 and 560 kg ha 1 s2 oil yield in s2 and s1 was 8 7 and 5 6 higher than s0 respectively furthermore s2 yielded 2 9 more oil compared with s1 fig 9b 3 8 water productivity the interactions between irrigation and selenium and irrigation and cultivar significantly affected water productivity table 4 at all levels of irrigation the selenium applied at both concentrations increased water productivity compared to no selenium supplementary irrigation resulted in higher water use efficiency compared to dryland production however water productivity was higher in the supplementary irrigation at the flowering stage and grain filling compared to other irrigation levels for i1 i2 and i3 the water productivity of hyola 401 was 1 6 1 4 and 1 1 higher than delgan in i4 however delgan water productivity rising from 0 37 kg m 3 in i1 to 0 72 kg m 3 was 1 2 higher than that of hyola 401 increasing from 0 38 kg m 3 in i1 to 0 61 kg m 3 which shows the increase of 0 94 and 60 53 respectively fig 10 b 4 discussion end of season water deficit stress is a prevalent environmental factor impacting the growth and yield of dryland canola production in sub tropical and semi arid climates of southern iran the timing and number of supplementary irrigations are two critical factors conducive to improving the growth yield and water productivity under limited water conditions in addition there is not enough information on the response of dryland canola to selenium application in the subtropical regions of southern iran the main novelty of the present study is that it assessed the effect of the interaction between selenium foliar application and supplementary irrigation on the yield and water productivity of dryland canola in the subtropical regions of iran 4 1 number of pods per plant application of selenium concentrations increased the number of pods per plant similarly hashem et al 2013 reported that spraying with 2 5 and 5 mg l 1 selenium increased canola growth in the present study in the supplementary irrigation regimes the number of pods per plant in both cultivars was increased by selenium an element which seems to play a role in increasing the number of fertile pods and absorbing water and other nutrient elements reduced number of pods per plant due to water stress has been reported by some researchers bañuelos et al 2002 dogan et al 2011 pavlista et al 2016 in our study supplementary irrigation increased the number of pods per plant more so in the hyola 401 cultivar compared with the delgan cultivar which may be due to the increase in the number of reproductive buds seemingly the hyola 401 cultivar has reduced number of pods per plant under non irrigation probably because it is less able to distribute photosynthetic material between the pods in the present study under dryland conditions the number of pods per plant was reduced probably due to the shortened flowering period lack of fertility in certain flowers and reduced production of photosynthetic materials for transfer to fresh pods sinaki et al 2007 reported that the lack of moisture at the flowering stage reduced the number of pods per plant in canola because of stunted flowering 4 2 weight of 1000 grains the 1000 grain weight of cultivars increased by supplementary irrigations which is not in line with the results of dogan 2019 who reported that increasing water consumption in supplementary irrigation treatment did not affect the 1000 grain weight in i3 treatment without irrigation at flowering stage fewer fertile grains were formed in the pods in comparison to i2 during irrigation in i3 more photosynthetic materials were stored in these grains hence the increase in the weight of 1000 grains in contrast with irrigation in i2 more fertile grains were formed in the plant pods however non irrigation in i3 resulted in not enough photosynthetic materials available for storage in the grains hence the lower weight of the formed grains fig 4a in the current study the average weight of 1000 grains in hyola was higher than delgan cultivar which could be due to the differences in genetic characteristics and resource management earlier ripening hyola cultivar probably reduces life span to escape drought stress and its 1000 grain weight was less than delgan cultivar because of the shortened grain filling period the 1000 grain weight of delgan cultivar with two irrigations at the flowering stage and grain filling increased compared to hyola cultivar it seems that delgan cultivar had more water absorption and the transfer of more photosynthetic materials to the grains at the flowering stage longer growth period and supplementary irrigation at the filling stage can further help this increase on the other hand supplementary irrigation seems to be effective in increasing the flowering period the average weight of 1000 grain increased by 8 7 following selenium application probably owing to the stimulation in root growth soil moisture and water absorption kápolna et al 2009 stated that selenium can adjust the water status of the plant under dehydration conditions and its protective effect is created by increased water absorption capacity in the root some researchers boldrin et al 2013 scharf et al 2015 have reported that the use of selenium increases the absorption and transfer of nutrients through the plant resulting in enhanced production of photosynthetic products and their transfer to grains 4 3 grain yield in the present study a significant increase in yield of canola was noted by selenium application however application of selenium resulted in much higher grain yield under dryland than supplementary irrigations conditions in i1 and i4 treatments the grain yields in s2 and s1 were 16 and 13 and 3 5 and 1 higher than s0 respectively fig 5a which is consistent with some researchers results kápolna et al 2009 radic et al 2015 who reported that selenium exhibited its effects more clearly under water shortage than normal conditions se increased 1000 seed weight and number of seeds per pod resulted in rising grain yield grain yield of two canola cultivars was significantly influenced by supplemental irrigation supplemental irrigation significantly affected rapeseed yield hergert et al 2016 which is similar to the present study to achieve the maximum grain yield in dryland canola irrigation is essential during the end season hence the increase in grain yield was seen with all supplementary irrigations in the current research fig 5a this is consistent with the findings of george et al 2018 regarding canola and gajić et al 2018 with regards to soybeans where irrigation regimes significantly affected the grain yield also dogan et al 2011 showed a positive and strong correlation between irrigation treatments and grain yield in addition rashidi et al 2012 reported that the reason for seed yield reduction in canola cultivars could be ascribed to the studied stress level and its effect on certain yield components such as flowers per plant and seed weight in this experiment grain yield increase via supplementary irrigation was associated with the number of pods per plant and 1000 grain weight given the significant differences in grain yield components in one time and two time supplementary irrigations one time irrigation at a particular stage of canola growth was not able to store the maximum photosynthetic material in the grain therefore canola yield can be increased through applying two irrigations at flowering and grain filling stages which increases the yield components some results taylor et al 1991 pavlista et al 2016 george et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 further confirm that rainfall is not sufficient for the growth and production of canola thus canola requires supplementary irrigation to achieve acceptable yields also majnooni heris et al 2014 reported that the grain yield of canola was 1790 kg ha 1 using 500 mm of water in this regard faraji et al 2009 observed 2567 kg ha 1 of canola grain yield obtained using flood irrigation which was 500 kg grain more than dryland canola cultivation reduced grain yield growth and biomass of wheat plants exposed to water constraints have been reported by nawaz et al 2015 dogan 2019 further observed that increasing the amount of water in supplementary irrigation augmented the yield and biomass of vetch bean some reports show that the most sensitive stages of canola to water stress are flowering and grain filling periods tesfamariam et al 2010 dogan et al 2011 it seems that delgan cultivar compared with hyola cultivar is not favorable for the end season drought stress conditions this is due to the more grain yield of delgan cultivar in the two stages of irrigation and grain yield reduction in complete dryland and one time supplementary irrigation as expected the hyola cultivar had more grain yield than the delgan cultivar under stress conditions fig 5b 4 4 dry matter yield dry matter yield is the plant overall above ground weight and is affected by grain yield and its components compared with dryland conditions supplementary irrigations increased the dry matter yield by 1 6 2 4 times in one and two irrigations fig 6a and 6b similar results pertaining to irrigation effects on dry matter yield were reported by dogan et al 2011 and jha et al 2018 two times supplementary irrigation increased delgan dry matter yield 8 36 more than hyola 401 indicating the ability of delgan to use the irrigation water more effectively to accumulate dry matter selenium had slightly a little effect on dry matter yield especially in the dryland and also the one supplementary irrigation at grain filling stage se can affect plant growth and development by its effects on the plant antioxidant defense especially in drought affected environments nawaz et al 2015 4 5 harvest index the harvest index shows the partitioning efficiency of photo assimilates to the grains in this experiment the harvest index increased more by two supplementary irrigations compared with one indicating that canola experienced a stress condition even with the one supplementary irrigation in general higher harvest index values were reached with higher irrigation and a statistical difference occurred in i1 and i4 treatments the supplementary irrigation increased the initiation of the lateral branch increasing the number of pods per plant and grain per pod all of which increased the harvest index reduction in canola harvest index has been reported in certain studies faraji et al 2009 dogan et al 2011 sinaki et al 2007 se increased harvest index slightly compared with no se supply indicating that se can affect grain yield more than dry matter yield it can be documented from fig 5 and fig 6 that application of se can increased the yield component more than the yield of stem and leave due to the efficient partitioning of the assimilates to the reproductive organs 4 6 grain oil percentage and oil yield grain oil percentage showed an extremely wide range during this experiment and was significantly influenced by supplementary irrigation the highest amount of grain oil percentage was obtained from i4 supplementary irrigation regime fig 8c which is in accordance with pavlista et al 2016 who reported that the highest amount of oil was obtained from full irrigation with 430 mm water in the current study none of the supplementary irrigation regimes produced more than 40 grain oil which is similar to the results of hergert et al 2016 they reported that in lincoln usa spring canola grain oil increased from 30 no irrigation to 50 full irrigation less than the 40 in dryland farms in iran canola oil was reported in the range of 35 45 motlagh et al 2012 and 41 1 43 4 safavi fard et al 2018 which does not match with the results of this research the range of oil was 36 40 in south africa tesfamariam et al 2010 and 32 44 in the west of nebraska usa pavlista et al 2016 in a nebraska study canola seed oil percentage was significantly higher under irrigation than under rainfed conditions 34 8 and 32 3 respectively 158 170 mm seasonal rainfall pavlista et al 2016 in another study done in nebraska the oil content of rapeseed increased with irrigation during drier years which had no impact when the precipitation was above average hergert et al 2016 in a canadian study the growth season precipitation ranged from 136 mm to 457 mm providing enough moisture for oil biosynthesis in oilseed crops hossain et al 2019 these results indicate that the level of oil concentration may depend on crop species and growth environments including water temperature and nutrient availability in the present study precipitation and supplementary irrigation affected the seed oil percentage fig 8c grain oil yield calculated by multiplying the grain oil percentage by grain yield canola grain oil yield was significantly higher p 0 001 under supplementary irrigation regimes and selenium spraying compared to dryland conditions fig 9a similarly the results obtained by sinaki et al 2007 showed that drought stress at the end of the growth season reduced the yield of canola grain oil lower oil yield in low irrigation water availability than normal irrigation has been previously observed in canola cultivars rashidi et al 2012 however safavi fard et al 2018 stated that grain oil percentage of rapeseed cultivars was not significantly reduced by drought stress at the early canola growth season during budding and flowering rainfall was higher in the first year but at the end of the growth season grain filling it was higher in the second year of experiment unlike the results of hergert et al 2016 there was no significant difference between the oil contents of the experimental years due to the relatively stable conditions of the climate se slightly increased grain oil percentage 1 in s2 compared with s1 however its effect on the grain oil yield is more notable indicating that grain yield is more affected by selenium than grain oil percentage 4 7 water productivity in regions with appropriate rainfall supplementary irrigation does not play an essential role in water productivity compared to dry areas however by supplementary irrigation applied to dryland areas both yield and water productivity may significantly increase the results indicated that by applying supplementary irrigation water productivity increased compared to dryland condition with the highest water productivity 0 67 kg m 3 belonging to i4 and s2 treatments and the lowest 0 34 kg m 3 observed in i1 and s0 treatments this finding is in agreement with the results of jha et al 2018 and contrary to the findings of hao et al 2014 water productivity with supplementary irrigation was 29 1 and 27 6 higher than i1 over the two growth seasons respectively in the present study water use was different among oilseed cultivars which is in contrast to lenssen et al 2012 water productivity of delgan in i4 was more than hyola but as far as i2 i3 and i1 regimes are concerned hyola water productivity was higher fig 10b these results are consistent with zhang et al 2019 who reported that supplementary irrigation at full flowering and stemming stage increased water use efficiency the results reported in the present research are in general agreement with those reported on canola in other regions gu et al 2018 pavlista et al 2016 lenssen et al 2012 hu et al 2015 zeleke et al 2014 reducing the yield and the subsequent decrease in the water productivity of canola is due to the sensitivity to water deficiency from the start of flowering to the end of grain filling in dryland conditions the results showed that two time supplementary irrigations during flowering and grain filling and spraying selenium at stem elongation stage resulted in the highest efficiency of water use and canola performance accordingly canola production management should be performed during flowering and grain filling periods and along with rainfall the required water must be supplied by supplementary irrigation se application compared with no se increased the water productivity in all irrigation regimes water productivity increment by se is well documented in dryland condition indicating the ameliorative effect of se consumption in drought stress condition 5 conclusion the results of this study showed that supplementary irrigation and selenium spraying increased the yield yield components oil percentage and water productivity of two canola cultivars under dryland conditions during the two experimental years with one supplementary irrigation at flowering or grain filling stage i2 and i3 cultivar hyola 401 was superior to delgan however two supplementary irrigations during the flowering and grain filling stages i4 showed delgan was superior to the hyola cultivar our results suggest that hyola has more water productivity than delgan therefore drought tolerant hyola variety is recommended for low rainfall areas selenium spraying increases the yield of the two cultivars supplementary irrigation and selenium spraying show the same trend in increasing the most evaluated traits of canola cultivars in the present experiment therefore it is recommended that the two supplementary irrigations during the flowering and grain filling stages and selenium spraying with a concentration of 1 5 mg l 1 be applied in the subtropical regions of southern iran the present study showed that canola production is economically possible under dryland conditions 802 931 kg ha 1 in southern iran nevertheless to economically grow and produce canola in the years with rainfall below the long term means it is necessary to select the adapted cultivar and apply two supplementary irrigations along with selenium spraying 1 5 mg l 1 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

10692,determining the timing of supplementary irrigation in water limited conditions is one approach to reducing drought damage increasing water productivity and improving the yield of dryland canola selenium spraying may be an appropriate strategy for increasing crop tolerance to drought stress the aim of this research was to evaluate supplementary irrigation and selenium spraying on the yield and water productivity of two canola cultivars under subtropical dryland conditions the experiment was a split factorial in a randomized complete block design with three replications conducted during 2016 2018 at gachsaran agricultural research station iran the main factors consisted of irrigation regimes no irrigation i1 supplementary irrigation at flowering stage i2 grain filling i3 and flowering grain filling i4 and a sub factor comprising hyola 401 water stress tolerant and delgan less tolerant to water stress cultivars and selenium spaying from the source of sodium selenate na2seo4 zero s0 1 5 s1 and 3 s2 mg l 1 results showed that the application of supplementary irrigation increased the yield yield components oil percentage harvest index and water productivity selenium spraying increased the weight of 1000 seeds and grain yield grain yield was increased from 802 kg ha 1 in s0 and i1 treatment up to 2274 kg ha 1 in s2 and i4 the delgan and hyola harvest index rose from 19 94 and 22 1 in i1 to 29 13 and 26 99 in i4 respectively the highest oil percentage 37 6 was observed in the i4 regime the highest water productivity 0 67 kg m 3 was obtained from i4 and s2 treatments and the lowest water productivity 0 34 kg m 3 was seen in i1 and s0 treatments generally the results showed that high yielding canola production can be achieved through supplementary irrigation in two stages flowering and grain filling stages and by applying 1 5 mg l 1 selenium foliar application in subtropical dryland conditions keywords dryland farming flowering irrigation regimes selenium water stress 1 introduction canola brassica napus l is the second most important source of edible oil in the world fao 2017 the area under cultivation of canola in the world is approximately 35 million hectares the average grain yield is 2194 kg ha 1 and the total production is around 76 million tons the area under cultivation of canola in iran is almost 70 thousand hectares the average grain yield is 1825 kg ha 1 and the total production is 128 thousand tons fao 2017 dryland cultivation is possible in the subtropical regions of iran with an average rainfall of at least 300 mm since almost 90 of the regions in iran are considered as arid and semi arid bannayan et al 2010 canola is an appropriate alternative for cultivation in semi arid areas owing to its high water consumption efficacy and relative tolerance to drought stress albarrak 2006 the growth period of this plant coincides with rainfall late in fall winter and early spring in the late growth stage however there is a water shortage and a sharp rise in temperature therefore the adoption of a suitable cultivation management for an optimum use of the existing water and the resultant reduction in the impact of drought stress will augment the production of dryland canola most arid and semi arid regions of iran with a moderately warm climate get relatively proper rainfalls in march april and may hence canola meeting certain degrees of water requirement at the ﬂowering and seed ﬁlling stages moreover water deficiency in these stages reduces the yield and yield components of canola furthermore for a sustainable production of canola and improvement in its economic performance it is necessary to consider proper strategies such as supplementary irrigation in dryland areas especially in late fall drought stress leads to lower yields due to insufficient rainfall throughout spring dogan et al 2011 in canola drought stress has an adverse effect on the balance of the source and sink of photosynthetic materials further decreasing the yield and grain yield components accordingly canola is highly susceptible to drought stress during flowering and grain filling dogan et al 2011 one way to reduce drought damage in dryland conditions is supplementary irrigation in addition to rainfall supplementary irrigation increases the yield and yield components in canola taylor et al 1991 in research to determine the effect of water stress on canola with irrigation treatments from 0 to 359 mm a significant difference was observed regarding canola yield and yield components between no irrigation and supplementary irrigation bañuelos et al 2002 pavlista et al 2016 showed that canola cultivar hyola 357 required 180 and 230 mm of water consumption by rainfall or irrigation for a maximum biological yield and plant height in that study the highest grain yield was obtained by consuming 430 mm of water 273 mm of which was provided by rainfall the water use of canola has been investigated in certain agro environmental conditions hergert et al 2016 gu et al 2017 pavlista et al 2016 lenssen et al 2012 hunsaker et al 2013 hu et al 2015 george et al 2018 zeleke et al 2014 dogan et al 2011 reported that the amount of irrigation water under semi dry climatic conditions should not be less than 250 mm moreover each level of supplementary irrigation significantly increased plant height 1000grain weight biomass and yield depending on the environmental conditions and the water management strategy in their study the canola grain yield was approximately 4 t ha 1 and the total biomass was 18 t ha 1 with full irrigation noteworthy irrigation during rapid growth stages had a significant effect on the yield and yield components of canola cultivars introduced for dryland conditions this effect was more pronounced during the years of low rainfall hence the importance of supplementary irrigation in canola for an improved economic performance dogan et al 2011 sinaki et al 2007 reported that dehydration stress during flowering to ripening reduced the grain yield and number of pods per plant in canola however the number of seeds per pod was not affected by stress water productivity is an essential measurement to determine plant productivity under water limited conditions katerji et al 2008 the atmospheric demand is significantly higher in dryer climates where the plant needs to transpire more water to produce a unit of dry matter research on maize showed that water use efficiency increased with the reduction in water consumption hao et al 2015 in different studies various compounds have been considered to reduce the effects of water stress on plants selenium has been introduced as a useful element for plant growth because it is able to protect plants against the adverse effects of stress further reported are the myriad beneficial effects of selenium application on plant growth seed germination photosynthesis respiration and tolerance to stresses such as salinity heat cold optical radiation and drought feng et al 2013 selenium plays many roles with regards to plants one of which is of an antioxidant nature by preventing the formation of active oxygen species selenium participates in intracellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress caused by drought paciolla et al 2011 owing to its antioxidant properties selenium can positively influence plant growth and development particularly in stressed environments nawaz et al 2015 in many studies a direct relationship has been reported between dry matter production and selenium application and selenium has been observed to increase resistance to drought stress boldrin et al 2013 wu et al 2016 hasanuzzaman et al 2017 seppänen et al 2018 ulhassan et al 2019 furthermore selenium treated rice plants had higher water use efficiency higher net photosynthesis and stronger antioxidant systems andrade et al 2018 there is limited information on dryland canola response to the number and timings of supplementary irrigation and simultaneously selenium application in the sub tropical regions of iran therefore the present experiment was designed to determine the quantitative and qualitative yield and water productivity of two canola cultivars by supplementary irrigation with selenium spraying under dryland conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and climatic conditions this research was carried out in two cultivation years during 2016 2018 at gachsaran agricultural research station a subtropical region in southern iran with 710 meter height from the sea the station is located at 50 50 e and 30 17 n the average rainfall and temperature of 30 years are 375 mm and 23 7 c respectively rainfall occurs mainly in the middle of fall the whole winter and early spring this region has a sub tropical and semi arid climate with hot and dry summers and low annual rainfall prior to planting a compound soil surface 0 30 cm sample was gathered exposed to air to dry passed through a 2 mm sieve and sent to the laboratory the physicochemical characteristics of the soil are presented in table 1 supplementary irrigation was done by using of surface irrigation method irrigation water was applied to all plots via pump outlet and plastic pipes and a water meter was used to measure the applied water water analytical results are shown in table 2 fig 1 shows the average monthly rainfall and temperature of the experimental site during the two growth seasons of canola in each year from december 2016 to may 2017 and 2018 calculated by the data provided by the national meteorological organization iran 2 2 experimental design the experiment was performed as split factorial in a randomized complete block design with three replications irrigation regimes were the main plots with four levels no irrigation i1 supplementary irrigation at flowering stage i2 supplementary irrigation at grain filling stage i3 and supplementary irrigation at flowering stage grain filling i4 cultivars hyola 401 and delgan and selenium treatments of sodium selenate na2seo4 at three levels without selenium s0 1 5 s1 and 3 s2 mg l

cultivating with the rest of the nitrogen fertilizer applied at the beginning of stem elongation sowing was carried out on december 15 and 17 of 2016 and 2017 respectively hyola 401 canadian origin and delgan iranian origin were used hyola 401 is a two zero spring type and drought tolerant cultivar and delgan is a two zero spring growth type which is less tolerant to drought both cultivars are adapted to fall seeding in warm areas each subplot was comprised of eight five meter rows with a spacing of 25 cm the distances between replications the main plots and the subplots were 3 2 and 0 5 m respectively the amount of seed based on 1000 grain weight was calculated at 6 kg ha 1 and seeds were sowed at a depth of 2 3 cm thinning was done at the 2 4 leaf stage and plant density was adjusted to 80 plant m 2 canola was harvested on may 25 2017 and may 27 2018 2 4 selenium spray the sprayer was manually calibrated to determine the amount of water used to cover the entire planted area sodium selenate na2seo4 solutions were then prepared based on soluble selenium levels of 1 5 and 3 mg l 1 for solvent adhesion to the plant an emulsifier maxfer cor was used and the solution spraying was performed at 8 10 am leaf spraying with selenium was done once based on the descriptive method provided by the canola council of canada 2016 on stem elongation 2 5 supplementary irrigation the gravimetric method was employed for the determination of irrigation amounts using soil moisture measurements as needed from the depth of root development in the center of each plot an electronic pump and a surface method were used for the irrigation of the experimental ﬁeld plots to supply the required water in supplementary irrigation soil samples were prepared from the roots development depth 0 6 m in the experimental plots one day prior to irrigation the samples were weighed and dried in an oven for 24 h at a temperature of 105 c surface runoff was not evident during the years of experiment and regarding the irrigation water calculation method drainage was considered negligible the amount of water used for each plot was calculated using eq 1 katerji et al 2008 1 ig θfc θ ρ d a 100 ie where ig is irrigation requirement m3 θfc is soil moisture content at the field capacity point θ is soil moisture content during sampling ρ is soil bulk density kg m 3 d is root development depth 0 6 m a is plot area m2 and ie is irrigation efficiency considered as 0 65 sepaskhah 2003 the amount of water used in each trial plot was sufficient to reach field capacity and recorded through supplementary irrigation with an electric pump and the water meter installed at the water inlet the supplementary irrigation by growth stages were applied according to the descriptive method of canola council of canada 2016 in stages 60 flowering and 70 during the grain filling 2 6 yield and yield component measurements at physiological maturity 20 plants were randomly selected from each plot and the number of pods per plant and grains in the pod was measured four samples of 250 grains in each experimental plot were weighed to determine 1000 seed weight following physiological maturity 3 m2 of the middle rows were harvested and after drying on farm four days grains were threshed and grain yield was determined at 12 moisture harvest index was calculated from the ratio of grain yield to total dry weight biological yield multiplied by 100 ten 10 g samples were randomly taken from each treatment and grain oil percentage was determined using a soxhlet extractor machine oil yield was calculated from the product of grain oil percentage and grain yield 2 7 calculation of water productivity water productivity was calculated from the ratio of grain yield to the amount of consumed water irrigation water and rainfall based on eq 2 howell 1994 2 wp y wi where wp is water productivity y kg is grain yield and wi m3 is the amount of consumed water total irrigation and rainfall the amount of water entering the test soil was calculated by the rainfall data of the national meteorological organization iran 2 8 statistical analysis the bartlett test and the data normality test were performed prior to statistical analysis and means were compared based on the mentioned pretests the analysis of variance on the two year data was performed using glm sas sas 9 1 3 sas institute inc cary nc usa in all signiﬁcant interactions the slicing and the mean comparisons were made based on the l s means procedure of the sas program the main effects mean values were compared using lsd test and all the charts were drawn using excel software 3 results there was a slight difference in weather conditions between the two years of canola growth season in the first year rain distribution was better early in the season while in the second year it was better at the end of the growth season in the first year of the experiment 2016 17 the average of minimum monthly temperature was more than the second year 2017 18 yet the average of maximum monthly temperature was less in the second year of experiment from december to may the average of minimum and maximum monthly temperatures was 0 35 c less and 0 62 c more than the first year fig 1 respectively in the first year during the canola growth season the average minimum and maximum relative humidity was 29 7 and 77 4 and in the second year it was 30 3 and 78 1 respectively in each year of experiment about 336 8 mm of water total rainfall and supplementary irrigation was consumed during 2016 17 236 8 and 100 mm and in 2017 18 176 8 and 160 mm were provided by rain and supplementary irrigation respectively the rainfall in each year of experiment was less than the average long term rainfall rainfall in the second year the early and mid seasons was lower and the weather was warmer compared with the first year nonetheless during the late growth season rainfall was higher than the first year specifically in march april and may fig 1 dogan et al 2011 utilized 225 and 250 mm of water for full the irrigation of canola farm in turkey during the two planting seasons respectively which was lower than the amount of water consumed in this experiment 3 1 number of pods per plant the interactions of year with selenium and year with irrigation were significant concerning the number of pods per plant table 3 in both years selenium increased the number of pods on the plant the number of pods per plant in 2016 17 with s1 and s2 was 7 3 and 9 5 higher than s0 respectively also in 2017 18 the number of pods per plant in s1 and s2 was 4 5 and 6 1 higher than s0 respectively the number of pods in hyola 401 cultivar was 6 7 and 11 8 higher than delgan cultivar during the years 2016 17 and 2017 18 respectively fig 2 the triple interaction of irrigation varieties and selenium significantly affected the number of pods per plant table 3 in all irrigation regimes selenium increased the number of pods per plant in delgan cultivar however it did not affect the hyola 401 cultivar and the number of pods in delgan cultivar was higher than the hyola 401 cultivar in regime i2 in contrast to i1 the number of pods in the hyola 401 cultivar was higher than the delgan cultivar at this level of irrigation there was a significant difference between the levels of selenium regarding the number of pods per plant moreover at level i3 selenium increased the number of pods per plant in both hyola 401 and delgan cultivars however there was a significant difference between the levels of selenium as far as the number of pods per plant is concerned although no significant difference was observed between the s0 and s1 about delgan and s1 and s2 for hyola 401 in i4 regime selenium levels increased the pods per plant in both cultivars and a significant difference was found in number of pods per plant in the irrigation regimes of i2 and i4 the number of pods per plant was more than i1 and i3 this number was higher in hyola 401 cultivar in supplementary irrigation regimes while it was lower than delgan cultivar in dryland conditions fig 3 3 2 weight of 1000 seeds the interaction between irrigation and cultivars as well as the effect of selenium on 1000 seed weight was significant table 3 however no significant difference was seen among the i1 regimes for 1000 seed weight but in i2 and i3 the 1000 seed weight of hyola 401 cultivar was 4 6 and 9 3 higher than delgan cultivar respectively unlikely the 1000 seed weight of delgan cultivar was 2 8 higher than that of hyola as concerns i4 cultivar the highest 1000 seed weight 3 3 g was in i3 for the hyola cultivar while the lowest 2 33 g was identified in the delgan cultivar in i2 fig 4 a higher selenium concentrations increased 1000 seed weight the average weight of 1000 seeds varied from 2 3 g in s0 to 6 2 g in s2 the 1000 seed weight in s2 and s1 was 13 and 8 7 higher than s0 respectively the 1000 seed weight in s2 was 4 higher than s1 fig 4b 3 3 grain yield the interactions between irrigation and selenium and irrigation and cultivars had a significant influence on the grain yield table 3 at all levels of irrigation selenium application increased the grain yield in both concentrations compared to selenium free treatment but no difference was observed between the two selenium application treatments grain yield followed the order of i4 i2 i3 i1 in i4 the grain yield of delgan cultivar compared to hyola cultivar was more than other irrigation treatments in general grain yield in all supplementary irrigations was higher compared with that of dryland level however the increase in the yield pertaining to supplementary irrigation was higher in treatment with two supplementary irrigations at the flowering and grain filling stages the interaction between irrigation and selenium showed that the grain yield rose from 802 kg ha 1 in s0 and i1 to 2274 kg ha 1 in s2 and i4 fig 5 under dryland conditions and one supplementary irrigation treatment hyola cultivar was superior to delgan cultivar in terms of grain yield in two irrigation conditions the yield of both cultivars increased with delgan cultivar becoming more superior in i4 the grain yield of delgan cultivar 2424 kg ha 1 was 8 2 times more than its yield 850 kg ha 1 in i1 furthermore the grain yield of hyola 2058 kg ha 1 was 2 3 times more than its yield 911 kg ha 1 in i1 fig 5b 3 4 dry matter yield the interactions between irrigation and selenium and irrigation and cultivar had a significant impact on dry matter yield table 3 the dry matter yield was significantly increased by selenium spraying only in i1 and i3 regimes while it was irrelevant in other irrigation regimes concerning i3 the dry matter yield in s2 and s1 were 12 and 10 higher than s0 respectively moreover in the supplementary irrigation regime at the grain filling stage the dry matter yield in s2 and s1 was 3 2 and 2 4 higher than s0 respectively fig 6 a the interaction between irrigation and cultivar showed that the dry matter yield of the cultivars was different under different irrigation regimes regarding i1 and i4 delgan was superior but in the other two treatments hyola had a higher dry matter yield with twice supplementary irrigation in i4 compared to non irrigation in i1 the dry matter yield of delgan and hyola cultivars increased by 95 and 85 respectively fig 6b in general supplementary irrigation increased the dry matter yield compared to complete dryland conditions although the increase in dry matter yield was the highest in supplementary irrigation at flowering and grain filling stages fig 6a and 6b 3 5 harvest index the interaction between irrigation and cultivar and the effect of selenium on harvest index were significant table 4 with regards to i1 i2 and i3 regimes the harvest index of hyola 401 was 10 8 2 5 and 2 4 higher than delgan cultivar in i4 delgan harvest index was 8 more than hyola 401 harvest index increased with supplementary irrigation i4 compared with one supplementary irrigation i2 regime after non irrigation and one irrigation regimes the harvest index of hyola cultivar was lower than delgan cultivar and with two supplementary irrigations the harvest index decreased delgan harvest index rose from 19 94 in i1 to 29 13 in i4 and hyola harvest index increased from 22 1 in i1 to 26 99 in i4 showing increases of 9 19 and 4 89 respectively fig 7 a the effect of selenium on harvest index was significant but negligible and there was no significant difference between s1 and s2 treatments the harvest index in s1 and s2 was 0 51 and 0 63 higher than s0 respectively fig 7b 3 6 grain oil percentage the effects of selenium cultivar and irrigation regimes on grain oil percentage were significant table 4 selenium had a minimal effect on grain oil percentage and there was no significant difference between the amount of grain oil percentage in s1 and s2 treatments however the amount of grain oil percentage in s2 treatment 35 40 was 1 higher than s0 treatment 34 39 fig 8 a the grain oil percentage of hyola cultivar 35 53 was 1 3 higher than that of delgan cultivar 34 18 fig 8b the highest percentage of grain oil content was obtained from two supplementary irrigations the grain oil percentage produced by one supplementary irrigation treatment was higher than non irrigation treatment no significant difference was observed between i2 and i3 treatments as far as grain oil percentage is concerned fig 8c 3 7 oil yield the interaction between irrigation and cultivars and the effect of selenium on oil yield were meaningful table 4 supplementary irrigation regimes increased the oil yield of cultivars compared to non irrigation as concerns i1 i2 and i3 regimes the oil yield of hyola 401 cultivar was 22 18 and 8 higher than delgan cultivar however in i4 delgan oil yield was 14 higher than that of hyola 401 the highest oil yield was found in i4 where delgan cultivar oil yield 798 kg ha 1 was 3 times more than its yield 264 kg ha 1 in i1 and the oil yield of hyola cultivar 788 kg ha 1 was 2 6 times more than its yield 300 kg ha 1 in i1 fig 9 a application of selenium increased the oil yield from 515 kg ha 1 s0 to 544 s1 and 560 kg ha 1 s2 oil yield in s2 and s1 was 8 7 and 5 6 higher than s0 respectively furthermore s2 yielded 2 9 more oil compared with s1 fig 9b 3 8 water productivity the interactions between irrigation and selenium and irrigation and cultivar significantly affected water productivity table 4 at all levels of irrigation the selenium applied at both concentrations increased water productivity compared to no selenium supplementary irrigation resulted in higher water use efficiency compared to dryland production however water productivity was higher in the supplementary irrigation at the flowering stage and grain filling compared to other irrigation levels for i1 i2 and i3 the water productivity of hyola 401 was 1 6 1 4 and 1 1 higher than delgan in i4 however delgan water productivity rising from 0 37 kg m 3 in i1 to 0 72 kg m 3 was 1 2 higher than that of hyola 401 increasing from 0 38 kg m 3 in i1 to 0 61 kg m 3 which shows the increase of 0 94 and 60 53 respectively fig 10 b 4 discussion end of season water deficit stress is a prevalent environmental factor impacting the growth and yield of dryland canola production in sub tropical and semi arid climates of southern iran the timing and number of supplementary irrigations are two critical factors conducive to improving the growth yield and water productivity under limited water conditions in addition there is not enough information on the response of dryland canola to selenium application in the subtropical regions of southern iran the main novelty of the present study is that it assessed the effect of the interaction between selenium foliar application and supplementary irrigation on the yield and water productivity of dryland canola in the subtropical regions of iran 4 1 number of pods per plant application of selenium concentrations increased the number of pods per plant similarly hashem et al 2013 reported that spraying with 2 5 and 5 mg l 1 selenium increased canola growth in the present study in the supplementary irrigation regimes the number of pods per plant in both cultivars was increased by selenium an element which seems to play a role in increasing the number of fertile pods and absorbing water and other nutrient elements reduced number of pods per plant due to water stress has been reported by some researchers bañuelos et al 2002 dogan et al 2011 pavlista et al 2016 in our study supplementary irrigation increased the number of pods per plant more so in the hyola 401 cultivar compared with the delgan cultivar which may be due to the increase in the number of reproductive buds seemingly the hyola 401 cultivar has reduced number of pods per plant under non irrigation probably because it is less able to distribute photosynthetic material between the pods in the present study under dryland conditions the number of pods per plant was reduced probably due to the shortened flowering period lack of fertility in certain flowers and reduced production of photosynthetic materials for transfer to fresh pods sinaki et al 2007 reported that the lack of moisture at the flowering stage reduced the number of pods per plant in canola because of stunted flowering 4 2 weight of 1000 grains the 1000 grain weight of cultivars increased by supplementary irrigations which is not in line with the results of dogan 2019 who reported that increasing water consumption in supplementary irrigation treatment did not affect the 1000 grain weight in i3 treatment without irrigation at flowering stage fewer fertile grains were formed in the pods in comparison to i2 during irrigation in i3 more photosynthetic materials were stored in these grains hence the increase in the weight of 1000 grains in contrast with irrigation in i2 more fertile grains were formed in the plant pods however non irrigation in i3 resulted in not enough photosynthetic materials available for storage in the grains hence the lower weight of the formed grains fig 4a in the current study the average weight of 1000 grains in hyola was higher than delgan cultivar which could be due to the differences in genetic characteristics and resource management earlier ripening hyola cultivar probably reduces life span to escape drought stress and its 1000 grain weight was less than delgan cultivar because of the shortened grain filling period the 1000 grain weight of delgan cultivar with two irrigations at the flowering stage and grain filling increased compared to hyola cultivar it seems that delgan cultivar had more water absorption and the transfer of more photosynthetic materials to the grains at the flowering stage longer growth period and supplementary irrigation at the filling stage can further help this increase on the other hand supplementary irrigation seems to be effective in increasing the flowering period the average weight of 1000 grain increased by 8 7 following selenium application probably owing to the stimulation in root growth soil moisture and water absorption kápolna et al 2009 stated that selenium can adjust the water status of the plant under dehydration conditions and its protective effect is created by increased water absorption capacity in the root some researchers boldrin et al 2013 scharf et al 2015 have reported that the use of selenium increases the absorption and transfer of nutrients through the plant resulting in enhanced production of photosynthetic products and their transfer to grains 4 3 grain yield in the present study a significant increase in yield of canola was noted by selenium application however application of selenium resulted in much higher grain yield under dryland than supplementary irrigations conditions in i1 and i4 treatments the grain yields in s2 and s1 were 16 and 13 and 3 5 and 1 higher than s0 respectively fig 5a which is consistent with some researchers results kápolna et al 2009 radic et al 2015 who reported that selenium exhibited its effects more clearly under water shortage than normal conditions se increased 1000 seed weight and number of seeds per pod resulted in rising grain yield grain yield of two canola cultivars was significantly influenced by supplemental irrigation supplemental irrigation significantly affected rapeseed yield hergert et al 2016 which is similar to the present study to achieve the maximum grain yield in dryland canola irrigation is essential during the end season hence the increase in grain yield was seen with all supplementary irrigations in the current research fig 5a this is consistent with the findings of george et al 2018 regarding canola and gajić et al 2018 with regards to soybeans where irrigation regimes significantly affected the grain yield also dogan et al 2011 showed a positive and strong correlation between irrigation treatments and grain yield in addition rashidi et al 2012 reported that the reason for seed yield reduction in canola cultivars could be ascribed to the studied stress level and its effect on certain yield components such as flowers per plant and seed weight in this experiment grain yield increase via supplementary irrigation was associated with the number of pods per plant and 1000 grain weight given the significant differences in grain yield components in one time and two time supplementary irrigations one time irrigation at a particular stage of canola growth was not able to store the maximum photosynthetic material in the grain therefore canola yield can be increased through applying two irrigations at flowering and grain filling stages which increases the yield components some results taylor et al 1991 pavlista et al 2016 george et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 further confirm that rainfall is not sufficient for the growth and production of canola thus canola requires supplementary irrigation to achieve acceptable yields also majnooni heris et al 2014 reported that the grain yield of canola was 1790 kg ha 1 using 500 mm of water in this regard faraji et al 2009 observed 2567 kg ha 1 of canola grain yield obtained using flood irrigation which was 500 kg grain more than dryland canola cultivation reduced grain yield growth and biomass of wheat plants exposed to water constraints have been reported by nawaz et al 2015 dogan 2019 further observed that increasing the amount of water in supplementary irrigation augmented the yield and biomass of vetch bean some reports show that the most sensitive stages of canola to water stress are flowering and grain filling periods tesfamariam et al 2010 dogan et al 2011 it seems that delgan cultivar compared with hyola cultivar is not favorable for the end season drought stress conditions this is due to the more grain yield of delgan cultivar in the two stages of irrigation and grain yield reduction in complete dryland and one time supplementary irrigation as expected the hyola cultivar had more grain yield than the delgan cultivar under stress conditions fig 5b 4 4 dry matter yield dry matter yield is the plant overall above ground weight and is affected by grain yield and its components compared with dryland conditions supplementary irrigations increased the dry matter yield by 1 6 2 4 times in one and two irrigations fig 6a and 6b similar results pertaining to irrigation effects on dry matter yield were reported by dogan et al 2011 and jha et al 2018 two times supplementary irrigation increased delgan dry matter yield 8 36 more than hyola 401 indicating the ability of delgan to use the irrigation water more effectively to accumulate dry matter selenium had slightly a little effect on dry matter yield especially in the dryland and also the one supplementary irrigation at grain filling stage se can affect plant growth and development by its effects on the plant antioxidant defense especially in drought affected environments nawaz et al 2015 4 5 harvest index the harvest index shows the partitioning efficiency of photo assimilates to the grains in this experiment the harvest index increased more by two supplementary irrigations compared with one indicating that canola experienced a stress condition even with the one supplementary irrigation in general higher harvest index values were reached with higher irrigation and a statistical difference occurred in i1 and i4 treatments the supplementary irrigation increased the initiation of the lateral branch increasing the number of pods per plant and grain per pod all of which increased the harvest index reduction in canola harvest index has been reported in certain studies faraji et al 2009 dogan et al 2011 sinaki et al 2007 se increased harvest index slightly compared with no se supply indicating that se can affect grain yield more than dry matter yield it can be documented from fig 5 and fig 6 that application of se can increased the yield component more than the yield of stem and leave due to the efficient partitioning of the assimilates to the reproductive organs 4 6 grain oil percentage and oil yield grain oil percentage showed an extremely wide range during this experiment and was significantly influenced by supplementary irrigation the highest amount of grain oil percentage was obtained from i4 supplementary irrigation regime fig 8c which is in accordance with pavlista et al 2016 who reported that the highest amount of oil was obtained from full irrigation with 430 mm water in the current study none of the supplementary irrigation regimes produced more than 40 grain oil which is similar to the results of hergert et al 2016 they reported that in lincoln usa spring canola grain oil increased from 30 no irrigation to 50 full irrigation less than the 40 in dryland farms in iran canola oil was reported in the range of 35 45 motlagh et al 2012 and 41 1 43 4 safavi fard et al 2018 which does not match with the results of this research the range of oil was 36 40 in south africa tesfamariam et al 2010 and 32 44 in the west of nebraska usa pavlista et al 2016 in a nebraska study canola seed oil percentage was significantly higher under irrigation than under rainfed conditions 34 8 and 32 3 respectively 158 170 mm seasonal rainfall pavlista et al 2016 in another study done in nebraska the oil content of rapeseed increased with irrigation during drier years which had no impact when the precipitation was above average hergert et al 2016 in a canadian study the growth season precipitation ranged from 136 mm to 457 mm providing enough moisture for oil biosynthesis in oilseed crops hossain et al 2019 these results indicate that the level of oil concentration may depend on crop species and growth environments including water temperature and nutrient availability in the present study precipitation and supplementary irrigation affected the seed oil percentage fig 8c grain oil yield calculated by multiplying the grain oil percentage by grain yield canola grain oil yield was significantly higher p 0 001 under supplementary irrigation regimes and selenium spraying compared to dryland conditions fig 9a similarly the results obtained by sinaki et al 2007 showed that drought stress at the end of the growth season reduced the yield of canola grain oil lower oil yield in low irrigation water availability than normal irrigation has been previously observed in canola cultivars rashidi et al 2012 however safavi fard et al 2018 stated that grain oil percentage of rapeseed cultivars was not significantly reduced by drought stress at the early canola growth season during budding and flowering rainfall was higher in the first year but at the end of the growth season grain filling it was higher in the second year of experiment unlike the results of hergert et al 2016 there was no significant difference between the oil contents of the experimental years due to the relatively stable conditions of the climate se slightly increased grain oil percentage 1 in s2 compared with s1 however its effect on the grain oil yield is more notable indicating that grain yield is more affected by selenium than grain oil percentage 4 7 water productivity in regions with appropriate rainfall supplementary irrigation does not play an essential role in water productivity compared to dry areas however by supplementary irrigation applied to dryland areas both yield and water productivity may significantly increase the results indicated that by applying supplementary irrigation water productivity increased compared to dryland condition with the highest water productivity 0 67 kg m 3 belonging to i4 and s2 treatments and the lowest 0 34 kg m 3 observed in i1 and s0 treatments this finding is in agreement with the results of jha et al 2018 and contrary to the findings of hao et al 2014 water productivity with supplementary irrigation was 29 1 and 27 6 higher than i1 over the two growth seasons respectively in the present study water use was different among oilseed cultivars which is in contrast to lenssen et al 2012 water productivity of delgan in i4 was more than hyola but as far as i2 i3 and i1 regimes are concerned hyola water productivity was higher fig 10b these results are consistent with zhang et al 2019 who reported that supplementary irrigation at full flowering and stemming stage increased water use efficiency the results reported in the present research are in general agreement with those reported on canola in other regions gu et al 2018 pavlista et al 2016 lenssen et al 2012 hu et al 2015 zeleke et al 2014 reducing the yield and the subsequent decrease in the water productivity of canola is due to the sensitivity to water deficiency from the start of flowering to the end of grain filling in dryland conditions the results showed that two time supplementary irrigations during flowering and grain filling and spraying selenium at stem elongation stage resulted in the highest efficiency of water use and canola performance accordingly canola production management should be performed during flowering and grain filling periods and along with rainfall the required water must be supplied by supplementary irrigation se application compared with no se increased the water productivity in all irrigation regimes water productivity increment by se is well documented in dryland condition indicating the ameliorative effect of se consumption in drought stress condition 5 conclusion the results of this study showed that supplementary irrigation and selenium spraying increased the yield yield components oil percentage and water productivity of two canola cultivars under dryland conditions during the two experimental years with one supplementary irrigation at flowering or grain filling stage i2 and i3 cultivar hyola 401 was superior to delgan however two supplementary irrigations during the flowering and grain filling stages i4 showed delgan was superior to the hyola cultivar our results suggest that hyola has more water productivity than delgan therefore drought tolerant hyola variety is recommended for low rainfall areas selenium spraying increases the yield of the two cultivars supplementary irrigation and selenium spraying show the same trend in increasing the most evaluated traits of canola cultivars in the present experiment therefore it is recommended that the two supplementary irrigations during the flowering and grain filling stages and selenium spraying with a concentration of 1 5 mg l 1 be applied in the subtropical regions of southern iran the present study showed that canola production is economically possible under dryland conditions 802 931 kg ha 1 in southern iran nevertheless to economically grow and produce canola in the years with rainfall below the long term means it is necessary to select the adapted cultivar and apply two supplementary irrigations along with selenium spraying 1 5 mg l 1 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

10693,the limited availability of fresh water is a major constraint to agricultural productivity and livelihood security in many developing countries within the coming decades smallholder farmers in drought prone areas are expected to be increasingly confronted with local water scarcity problems but their access to technological knowledge and financial resources to cope with these problems is often limited in this article we present a methodological framework that allows for identifying in a short period of time suitable and superficial water sources and cost effective water transportation routes for the provisioning of gravity driven irrigation systems as an implementation of the framework we present the automated and extensible geospatial toolset named agri and elaborate a case study in western honduras where the methodology and toolset were applied to provide assistance to field technicians in the process of identifying water intake sites and transportation routes the case study results show that 28 of the water intake sites previously identified by technicians without the support of agri were found to be not feasible for gravity driven irrigation on the other hand for the feasible water intake sites agri was able to provide viable and shorter water transportation routes to farms in 70 of the cases furthermore agri was able to provide alternative feasible water intake sites for all considered farms with correspondingly viable water transportation routes for 74 of them these results demonstrate agri s potential to reduce time costs and risk of failure associated with the development of low cost irrigation systems which becomes increasingly needed to support the livelihoods of some of the world s most vulnerable populations keywords least cost path water intake agriculture dry corridor western honduras 1 introduction with a steadily growing world population and associated food demands the paramount significance of water availability and accessibility for agriculture is increasing de fraiture and wichelns 2010 the stress on water requirements for agriculture is sharpened by several factors such as the increased competition of industrial and urban water use de fraiture and wichelns 2010 and the upstream presence of hydraulic infrastructure such as dams and reservoirs that may change timing of water availability schewe et al 2014 another important factor is climate change haddeland et al 2014 with resulting extreme weather phenomena such as severe droughts thornton et al 2011 consequently water scarcity is increasing and in turn the availability and access to fresh water sources becomes more important for sustained agricultural practices particularly vulnerable are smallholders in developing countries giordano et al 2019 who are strongly dependent on agriculture dile et al 2013 and typically rely on low cost water supply systems furthermore they normally have limited access to relevant technical knowledge hydro climatic information or methodological frameworks to mitigate the vulnerability to changes in short and long term weather projections and the reduction of water provisions due to multiple uses esham and garforth 2013 mapfumo et al 2013 in this article we present a methodological framework for the development of low cost gravity based irrigation systems for small scale agricultural practices in developing countries specifically the framework allows for identifying suitable and inexpensive water intake sources and cost effective water transportation routes to farm locations we hereby focus on central and south america with western honduras as a case study but our work is applicable to other regions with similar geographical conditions honduras is one of the poorest countries in latin america with a rural population of about 50 the world bank 2015 simultaneously it is recognized as one of the countries most affected by extreme climatic events in central america gourdji et al 2014 the western part of honduras belongs to the central american dry corridor in spanish known as the corredor seco an area affected by severe water scarcity bouroncle et al 2017 this area covers zones of guatemala honduras el salvador and nicaragua in honduras dry corridor people live under extreme poverty conditions with incomes below the 2 usd per person per day poverty line and consequently their livelihoods greatly depend on rainfed subsistence agriculture the world bank 2015 hence water access plays an important role as it is one of the main constraints for enhancing human welfare and agricultural production one of the actions undertaken to reduce agricultural losses in small scale farms which are commonly affected by the lack of water access includes the establishment of irrigation infrastructure to enable sustainable water provisioning kahinda et al 2007 most of the poor farmers in western honduras inhabit steep lands where permanent water sources tend to be scarce in consequence they rely on low cost solutions and transfer water to their farms through hosepipes using gravity smits et al 2010 in some cases the hosepipes are installed along routes where gravity is not enough to pull the water to crop areas forcing farmers to install pumps in between source and outflow to improve water flow although many governments ngos and international agencies efforts are currently directed to assist farmers in improving their access to water for crop production bitterman et al 2016 murugani and thamaga chitja 2018 field technicians are dispensed limited information to guide them during the process of identifying potential water intakes and their corresponding conduction paths as a result the establishment of gravity driven water supply systems to irrigate croplands is often a long and challenging operation and involves high costs related to field assessments and trial and error pipeline installation in field communications with implementers of the alliance for the dry corridor acs furthermore in most cases this process is inefficient as the installed hosepipes end up re conducting water from distant sites or do not provide the water volume needed for irrigation based on the above mentioned conditions we developed a gis based methodological framework to identify water intakes in streams for supplemental irrigation in small scale farms and define the most cost effective routes for gravity driven water transportation taking into account topography land cover and environmental restrictions such as the presence of protected areas this may lead to saving time and money and reduces the risk of failure during water deviation investment projects the framework integrates gis technologies decision rules and surface features and uses the least cost path lcp approach to optimize the transfer of captured water to farm locations as an implementation of the framework we present the automated and extensible tool named agri agua para riego water for irrigation in spanish and elaborate a case study in western honduras where the methodology and the tool were applied to identify water intake sites and cost effective conduction paths for local smallholder farmers based on the case study we evaluated the effectiveness of agri to identify viable water conduction paths and compared its results to expert provided paths finally we discuss the use of agri in practice both in agriculture and other scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area includes the western part of honduras and approximately covers the portion of the dry corridor that lies in the country see fig 1 this area comprises about 52 503 km2 and spans from 15 900 n to 12 982 n latitude and from 89 353 w to 86 053 w longitude it completely contains the departments of choluteca comayagua copán cortés francisco morazán intibucá la paz lempira ocotepeque santa bárbara and valle and partially el paraíso and yoro this area is characterized by slopes ranging from 0 coastal zones to 73 steep hills with altitudes that range between 0 2 850 m a s l the annual precipitation ranges from 800 mm up to 2000 mm while the mean temperature varies from 6 c to 30 c fao 2012 the rainy season lasts from may to november interrupted by a dry period from mid july to mid august which is called canícula the rainy periods before and after canícula are called primera and postrera respectively fao 2012 in general the agriculture in the study area is carried out in hillside lands by small scale farmers who mostly produce corn during the primera and beans during the postrera period in areas with steep slopes coffee is produced as well 2 2 problem identification to understand the needs of organizations investing in water solutions for agriculture in the study area we conducted group meetings and one on one interviews with experts in the field and key stakeholders these stakeholders included representatives from different institutions dealing with agricultural policies and education as well as aid and development in western honduras such as the u s agency for international development usaid agricultural finance fintrac honduras strategic investment invest h ministry of agriculture and livestock sag and the panamerican agriculture university zamorano and local farmers as well with these activities we aimed to better understand how the process of identifying suitable sites for water intake for small scale agriculture is currently taking place and what are the main limitations to identify these sites in a cheaper more effective and rapid manner the interviews were accompanied by field visits in the departments of intibucá lempira and santa bárbara to recognize terrain conditions and current strategies of farmers to obtain water for agriculture this resulted in the following observations o1 low cost solutions are essential to reach the target users as local farmers do not have the financial means to invest in costly or moderately costly solutions also the purchase of water pumps may pose a financial challenge o2 as farmers currently take water from streams through hosepipes pipelines they try to avoid the installation of pumps in between the water intake and the farm location hence they mostly take water from upper areas using gravity to pull it to the farm location o3 the length of the path is decisive in order to reduce hosepipe pipeline costs and installation efforts vulnerabilities and point to point pressure loss consequently farmers look for possible water intakes in streams close to their farms o4 in certain areas it is prohibited to install water intakes e g in basins in protected natural parks or other protected areas such as indigenous recognized lands o5 technicians provide assistance to farmers in the process of site identification they normally go to the field without any previous geographical information that guides them in terms of selecting areas with high potential for water intakes this site identification process could take several months and involves many field visits and tests of pipeline installation to confirm effective water transportation technicians are equipped with handheld gps devices to take coordinates of candidate sites with potential for installing water intakes as a technical note the file formats which they usually work with are kml gdb or gpx based on these observations we established the main requirements for a tool to accelerate and improve the effectiveness of the process for finding feasible water intakes for a farm these are r1 water intake sites should be at an altitude of at least 10 m above the farm location to avoid installing water pumps due to o1 o2 r2 the user must be able to search for water intake sites within a linear radius from the farm location due to o3 r3 any potential water intake sites located within protected areas basins have to be discarded due to o4 r4 on a more technical practical level any new tools supporting water intake site identification should work well with and or complement existing processes and tools for example they should support complement technicians currently providing assistance to farmers and therefore allow exporting results to a file format readable by handheld gps devices e g kml due to o5 while the first three requirements are fundamental for water intakes to be considered potential sites for water sourcing for a farm the fourth requirement is more practical closer sites to the farm location are considered better in other words the distance between the water intake site and the farm location establishes a metric according to which suitable sites can be ordered 2 3 methodological framework a methodological framework was developed to identify water intake sites and their corresponding conduction paths under the given conditions and the resources required to instantiate it see fig 2 in essence the methodology identifies suitable water sources and ranks them based on their closeness closer is better to a farm in terms of pipeline surface length the framework is based on two main components 1 a hydrological component that defines hydrological features and that is used to identify sites within streams where the likelihood of sufficient water volume is high and 2 a water transportation route component based on a least cost path lcp approach to generate these components the framework requires a digital elevation model dem land use and land cover lulc and the protected basins of the targeted area indicated in blue in fig 2 the outputs consist of the water intakes and best paths indicated in purple in fig 2 for the farm in the text which follows we capitalize words when they correspond to input calculated or output models as denoted in fig 2 2 3 1 hydrological component the hydrological component corresponds to the lower left part of the methodological framework in fig 2 this component defines the hydrological features outlets streams and watersheds by calculating the water flow direction and accumulation based on topographic properties of the landscape see wu et al 2008 metz et al 2011 choi 2012 to perform these calculations a hydrologically corrected hydro dem is required which refers to the raw dem from which the sinks i e areas of undefined flow directions have been eliminated jarihani et al 2015 lindsay 2016 a sink is a pixel or a bunch of pixels with equal or lower altitudinal values compared to its neighboring pixels which interrupts a continuous downslope water flow direction although it is possible that sinks are real properties of the landscape such as natural depressions like karst areas in many cases they are artefacts resulting from pre processing operations such as resampling processes wu et al 2008 removing these sinks allows for the definition of a stream network with flow paths reaching their corresponding outlets and enables the proper delineation of basins soille 2004 2 3 2 water transportation route component the water transportation route component corresponds to the right part of the methodological framework in fig 2 this component uses the least cost path approach which is a distance based analysis tool provided by gis technologies that allows for the modeling of the most efficient route between a source and destination location melles et al 2011 this is based on the idea that any movement across the surface involves a cost which can be expressed as time distance money or any other variable defined by the modeler collischonn and pilar 2000 in our case it represents the impediments imposed by land surface characteristics for the installation of hosepipes that transfer water from an intake site to a farm location the lcp approach relies on a resistance friction surface theobald 2005 also known as cost surface which is used to calculate the most cost effective route between origin and destination the framework employs the raw dem to generate the slopes then based on the latter along with lulc and protected basins it uses a weighted overlay calculation to generate the cost surface the slope and lulc impose restrictions to water movement whereas the protected basins impose restrictions to the potential location of water intake sites and paths across the landscape the resulting cost surface is used to identify the best path to install a hosepipe for the transportation of water from an intake site to the farm location taking into account these restrictions based on the cost surface along with the location of the farm the cost distance is calculated resulting in a cost distance surface and cost directions layer finally two outputs are generated i the water intakes derived using spatial analysis and filtering from the outlets protected basins and some user configuration parameters minimum elevation difference between the water intakes and the farm search radius within which to identify water intakes and the maximum number of water intakes to be provided and ii the best paths using the lcp approach with the water intakes along with the cost distance surface and the cost directions the implementation of the methodological framework in the form of the agri tool is described in the following sections 2 4 agri development the methodological framework was implemented in an automated tool named agri which is an extensible geospatial toolset that can be applied in any developing country where farmers are affected by water scarcity it was developed as a toolbox consisting of six tools for arcgis for desktop utilizing its modeling and spatial data processing capabilities combined with python for scripting and automation fig 3 and fig 4 it consists of the following tools 1 convert to shapefile 2 calculate best paths 3 calculate final path 4 generate watersheds 5 export results to kml and 6 convert kml to gpx the numbers indicate a possible sequence to be followed for a successful and complete implementation of the agri tool this depends of course on what the user wants to do most of these tools use a geodatabase which consists of the raw dem the hydrological features i e outlets stream network and catchment areas and the cost surface generated in turn from the criterion layers i e slope vegetation and protected basins the essential tools of agri are calculate best paths and calculate final path the former determines the best paths lcps from a farm location to a number of potential water intakes in contrast the latter tool is used to determine the best path from a farm to a predefined water intake site also the tool generate watersheds defines the drainage areas of the potential water intakes while the other tools 1 5 and 6 allow the user to convert between the input and output formats 2 4 1 data collection and preprocessing the following datasets were used for the development of the tool 1 the srtm shuttle radar topography mission dem digital elevation model with void filled data at 1 arc second spatial resolution equivalent to about 30 m at the equator to define the topography of the study area nasa jpl 2013 2 a land use land cover lulc map of honduras which was elaborated at a minimum scale of 1 25 000 using the corine land cover classification system duarte et al 2014 and 3 a layer of declared protected basins since 1987 where water infrastructures to facilitate uses other than for human drinking water are prohibited cardona 2010 these datasets were freely accessible eleven tiles 1 by 1 of the srtm dem were downloaded from the usgs u s geological survey earthexplorer web portal 1 1 it can be accessed at http earthexplorer usgs gov in geotiff format to cover the total extension of the study area using arcgis for desktop 10 2 we merged the tiles into a new raster dataset the resulting raster was clipped with the boundary layer of western honduras to obtain a dem for the study area the same was done for the lulc and protected basins layers as we planned to develop a raster based model we converted the latter two layers to raster format with the same spatial resolution as the dem all spatial information used in this study was projected to the wgs84 utm zone 16 n coordinate system in addition to compare potential solutions provided by the tool developed in this study and potential water intake sites and paths as identified by technicians we obtained a database with 87 farm locations for which 89 potential water intake sites and corresponding water conduction paths had been identified by technicians for one farm there were three potential sites and paths the database contains the coordinates and elevation values of the farms and potential water intake sites as well as surface length information of their corresponding water conduction paths 2 4 2 definition of hydrological features the models shown in figs 3 and 4 were developed in arcgis for desktop using the model builder application the model in fig 3 corresponds to the hydrological component as implemented in the methodological framework see section 2 3 for defining the hydrological features its main input parameters include the raw dem and the flow accumulation threshold while its outputs consist of raster or feature class layers the end products generated by the model include feature class layers of the streams watersheds and outlets which are stored in the output workspace the model employs the raw dem to generate the hydro dem although the arcgis software contains the fill tool for the hydrologically conditioning of dems this tool may not be accurate as it increments the average elevation of the terrain and creates unnatural smooth areas jackson 2012 hence we alternatively used the optimized pit removal v1 5 1 tool proposed by jackson 2012 that attempts to minimally affect the landscape by filling the pit area to a certain elevation after which a path is carved from that elevation to an outlet the calculation of flow direction and accumulation for the definition of hydrological features was performed following procedures described in esri 2013 and by using the arc hydro tools maidment 2002 which provides a modelling framework and tools to support water resource analyses in an arcgis environment the flow accumulation threshold is used to define the stream network in this sense any pixel with a value greater than this threshold is considered part of the network the conditional input parameter t in fig 3 assigns a value of 1 to all pixels with a flow accumulation greater than the specified threshold resulting in a mask layer raster with values of either 1 or nodata of the stream network while it is argued that the flow accumulation threshold value should be defined based on geomorphological and weather characteristics soille 2004 zhang et al 2013 in most cases an arbitrary value is chosen zhang et al 2013 given this we examined the effect of the threshold value on the stream network by performing model iterations using different values until the threshold value was finally set to 500 we contrasted the resulting stream distribution with satellite imagery available on google earth which affirmed that the chosen threshold value leads to a detailed and accurate stream network with high probability of containing water in its channels as will be discussed later in section 3 1 2 4 3 least cost path approach the model in fig 4 corresponds to the water transportation route component as defined in the methodological framework see section 2 3 for the purpose of the honduras case study we conditioned three criterion layers to generate the cost surface the first criterion layer generated was the slope surface it was calculated in degrees using the slope tool in arcgis with the raw dem as input data as the slope layer is a continuous surface it was reclassified into a scale of 1 10 see table s1 supplementary material using the natural breaks jenks classification method described in jenks and caspall 1971 this was the scale chosen to represent the cost values in all criterion layers as to ensure an adequate representation of the values variability in each layer it represents the suitability of the land surface for the installation of a hosepipe with higher values indicating worse suitability the second criterion layer was the clipped lulc layer containing 23 of the 26 land cover classes for all honduras each land cover class was assigned a cost value from 1 10 indicating high and low suitability for hosepipe installation respectively the resulting categories in both spanish original and english the cost values and their corresponding areas are displayed in table s2 supplementary material the third criterion layer used was the layer of protected basins they comprise about 2198 km2 4 of the study area and were assigned a cost value of 10 this value restricts the installation of hosepipes within areas where infrastructure building is prohibited based on the above mentioned criterion layers and using a number of potential water intake sites and a farm location as input parameters the most cost effective paths for water transportation can be identified fig 4 cost paths are calculated in the opposite direction of the water flow due to model parameterization starting from the farm location origin to the candidate water intake sites destinations fig 4 shows that for each independent model run the middle and right parts of the model change as they depend on both origin and destination s on the other hand the cost surface is generated only once by performing a weighted overlay of the three criterion layers left part of the model finally within each run buffer areas around the origin and destination locations are generated to delineate the area for which to calculate the cost paths and distances to put emphasis on the restrictions imposed to water movement in finding the best paths a weight of 40 was given to both vegetation and slope while a weight of 20 was given to protected basins these weights represent the relative importance of the variables in the model in this specific case study we considered vegetation and slope to be equally important while protected basins have a lower impact in the model this weighting gives the highest values to areas with dense vegetation and steep slopes while lower values are assigned to flatter and less densely covered areas therefore the weights assigned to the criterion layers facilitate the hydraulic design of pipelines take into account protected areas and in turn allow for the protection of forests the weights are configurable and can thus be changed depending on the conditions of the case study at hand which may have a significant impact on the calculation of the best paths 3 agri evaluation the agri tool and its underlying methodological framework were extensively tested and applied in practice to verify i the correct identification of potential water intake sites ii the use of agri to detect wrongly identified water intake sites by technicians iii the ability of agri to identify better alternative conductions paths as compared to technician identified paths 3 1 testing and validation we assessed the ability of agri to identify potential water intake sites in streams where the likelihood of water availability is high in three dry watersheds within the departments of intibucá lempira and ocotepeque and one wet watershed in santa bárbara honduras these watersheds were selected because development agencies and governmental institutions prioritized these areas for small irrigation projects that use water diverted from nearby streams to validate the agri tool it was used to identify 27 potential water intake sites within these watersheds then we verified water availability in the identified sites during field visits in march 2016 which is generally the driest month of the year see figure s1 supplementary material to confirm their feasibility to serve as potential water source in addition we used agri to assess the feasibility of potential water intake sites and conduction paths as identified by technicians without the assistance of a gis based tool such as agri as mentioned in section 2 4 we obtained a database of existing projects with farm locations along with their corresponding water intake sites and conduction paths hereafter referred to as technician sites and technician paths respectively first agri was used to assess the feasibility of the technician sites 89 in total where a site in unprotected area and located at an altitude of at least 10 m above the farm was considered as feasible then we used agri to calculate alternative water conduction paths between feasible technician sites and the farm locations the path lengths as calculated by agri were contrasted with the length of the technician paths to examine agri s potential to provide shorter more cost effective paths compared to technicians in addition we examined the viability of each alternative path identified with agri in this regard a path that goes over a peak which is 24 m higher relative to the water intake site was considered as not viable we used 24 m because it is reported that srtm dems have a vertical accuracy of 16 m farr et al 2007 and technicians report that in the field they can circumvent a peak of up to 8 m encountered on a path the present design of agri does not allow for automatic recognition of paths that are not viable hence the viability of the paths was manually examined by comparing the altitude of each water intake site with the highest peak in the path the viability of technician paths could not be examined as information on their positioning as proposed by technicians was unavailable i e the database of existing projects only contained surface length information subsequently we used agri to identify potential water intake sites for the 87 farms included in the database and calculated their corresponding conduction paths hereafter referred to as agri sites and agri paths respectively also the viability of each agri path was examined following the criteria described above we configured agri by specifying a minimum elevation difference between the water intakes and the farm of 10 m and a maximum search radius of 10 km within which to identify potential water intakes in addition we specified a maximum of 10 water intake sites per farm location which implies that more than one water intake site and conduction path per farm could be identified as a final comparison we contrasted the agri paths with the technician paths and examined the differences in their surface lengths 3 2 results the field recognition of potential water intake sites identified by agri carried out in march 2016 allowed us to validate the threshold value used for the definition of the stream network and the ability of agri to identify sites in streams where water availability is high out of the 27 sites visited only two were located in dry channels both channels directly emerge from a spring where the likelihood of water availability is usually lower compared to locations further downwards that are connected to multiple streams hence the chosen threshold value of 500 representing the number of pixels draining upstream of the pixel being analyzed ensured a stream network for the study area with high probability of containing water in its channels the drainage areas of the sites found by agri ranged considerably from 1 4 km2 to 57 km2 showing the level of detail at which drainage areas could be defined despite the fact that agriculture in the study area is mostly implemented in hillside lands agri performed well in identifying feasible water sources in streams this capacity of agri expands the options of farmers to find potential sites that supply water required for crop irrigation with respect to the assessment of the water intake sites previously identified by technicians without the support of agri technician sites we found that by using agri 25 out of 89 28 technician sites were found to be not feasible either because they are located in protected areas or because they do not meet the requirement of 10 m elevation difference between the water intake site and the farm location see table 1 this is a significant finding as it shows that using the agri tool helps to avoid the unnecessary installation of water intakes in locations from which it is anyway not feasible to transport water by gravity as a consequence the use of agri leads to substantial time and financial savings such problems were also reported during meetings with technicians who were dealing with hosepipes that had to be reinstalled due to the lack of water flow by gravity on the other hand we used agri to provide potential alternatives for the water conduction paths as proposed by technicians technician paths using the calculate final path tool for the 64 technician sites that were found to be feasible by agri 64 alternative paths were generated using agri we found that 47 73 of them can be considered viable as they avoid peaks in the landscape of 24 m relative to the water intake site the other 17 alternative paths were found not to be viable as they could not avoid peaks in the landscape 24 m hence although agri found those 64 technician sites to be feasible the terrain conditions impede viable pipeline installations between 17 of them and their corresponding farm locations which implies that for these farms alternative water intake sites should be considered in addition we compared the technician paths with the alternative paths identified by agri in terms of surface length of the 63 technician paths for which surface length information was available agri provided 44 70 viable shorter alternative paths see table 1 again this could reflect considerable gains as for shorter paths less time and funds are needed for pipeline installation apart from the assessment of technician sites and technician paths we assessed agri s ability to identify feasible water intake sites and viable paths for the same 87 farm locations agri sites and agri paths respectively in this regard we used agri s calculate best paths tool to identify the sites and the optimal paths to the farms this resulted in a total of 794 feasible agri sites with at least one feasible site per farm see table 2 correspondingly for 248 out of 794 feasible agri sites at least one viable water conduction path to the target farm could be identified we call these sites viable agri sites therefore for 64 out of 87 74 farms at least one viable path to a feasible agri water intake site could be found the inability of agri to find viable paths for all farms should not be considered a flaw of the tool it rather reflects the lack of adequate terrains in the surroundings of some of the farms that facilitate the installation of a hosepipe even though the potential water intake point itself is feasible for example several farms were found to be located on hilltops or mountain peaks although agri was able to identify water intake sites at altitudes of at least 10 m above the farms in all cases e g located on nearby peaks with sufficient water supply due to significant local peaks depressions between the water intake sites and some farm locations the installation of gravity based irrigation systems will nonetheless be almost impossible or high costly finally we contrasted 88 technician paths with the agri paths in terms of surface length for one technician path surface length information was not available where agri provided up to 10 paths for each farm location based on this analysis we found that agri identified at least one viable shorter path compared to technicians in 49 out of 63 78 cases see table 3 this again confirms that agri allows for significant improvements in terms of water intake site identification and conduction path definition 3 3 further experiences uses in practice and discussion since the release of agri in 2016 it has provided considerable support to cost effective investments by government and development agencies it has been used by at least 30 technicians and at least 200 sites for diverting water for irrigated agriculture purposes have been identified similarly some previously identified sites by technicians have been successfully changed to agri s identified locations meanwhile it is important to note that agri does not replace the role of technicians as the final decision on site selection and path definition remains with the technicians and their overall assessment of the study area importantly also other aspects for instance related to social impacts and local environmental regulations are to be considered by technicians in the process of site assessment while agri is capable of identifying feasible water intake sites along with viable paths for pipeline installation using the calculate best path tool it can also be used to determine the best path between a farm and a predefined water intake site using the calculate final path tool this option is useful when field technicians have already established a suitable water intake for which only the best i e final path between this point and the destination farm needs to be determined on the other hand we found that occasionally water intake sites identified by agri are located within streams on private property where landowners may not be willing to cooperate with the installation of pipelines for these cases agri allows to manually relocate the coordinates of the water intake site within the same stream but outside the property boundaries for which subsequently the final path can be calculated agri was designed to provide information for irrigation projects however the tool has been given other uses by local organizations for example agri has been used to determine the best path from a licensed superficial water source to a tank to store water for human consumption in a small community this evidenced a new utility of agri showing that in addition to irrigation projects it can also help to identify water sources and conduction paths to support human drinking water needs in addition agri allows for the delineation of drainage areas which may help environmental agencies to target local regulations that aim at the conservation of water resources while this article has demonstrated the strengths and potential of agri some adjustments could be made to further improve the tool the present design of agri solely allows for the identification of potential water intakes and the optimal transportation routes to the farm locations to provide more understanding of the water quantity in streams and the potential for water harvesting an extension of agri with a water balance model is currently under development this extension will allow for estimations of the degree to which water from streams and harvesting sites can be captured and stored to support agriculture and household needs while taking into account minimum ecological flows acreman and dunbar 2004 and the water supply requirements of downstream water users furthermore identification of viable conduction paths by comparing the altitude of the water intake site with the highest peak in the path could be automated to automatically filter out non viable paths furthermore the applicability of agri could be enhanced by incorporating case study specific factors that could narrow down the number of candidate water sources such as information on local land registry to define areas where private landowners may oppose to pipeline installations also information on existing or future water infrastructures in the region could provide additional insights on the long term water provisioning potential of candidate water sources the methodological framework and the agri tool are easily adaptable to include such concerns 4 conclusions this article addressed the problem of identifying viable low cost water provisioning solutions for smallholder farmers in developing countries a gis based methodological framework was developed to support ongoing efforts oriented at determining suitable sites for establishing low cost gravity based irrigation systems using water diverted from rivers the implementation of this framework and its use in practice demonstrated its potential for assisting local field technicians in the process of identifying candidate water intake sites and the most cost effective water conduction routes to the destination farm location although our work was motivated by a case study specifically focused on the western part of honduras which has been exposed to severe water scarcity in the last couple of years the framework is equally applicable to other regions that are subjected to similar water scarcity problems the main product obtained in this study is a geospatial tool named agri this tool allows for the characterization of stream networks and drainage areas to simulate water flow over the land surface while aggregating a number of landscape characteristics into a cost surface that imposes restrictions to this water flow the result is the geographical localization of a point in a river or stream where sufficient water is likely available for crop irrigation and the optimal path from this point to a farm along which a hosepipe can be installed the tool was tested and evaluated in a large scale case study in western honduras results show that agri was able 1 to identify sites in streams where water is available during the dry season in 25 out of 27 cases 2 to identify 25 out of 89 technician identified water intake sites as not feasible 3 to provide viable shorter alternative paths compared to technician identified paths between farms and technician identified water intake sites in 44 out of 63 cases 4 to provide feasible alternative water intake sites with at least one viable path for 64 out of 87 farms for other farms likely no viable path exists due to local topography and 5 to provide at least one shorter path between farms and agri identified sites compared to technician identified paths between farms and technician identified sites for 60 out of 88 cases these results demonstrate agri s potential to reduce time and costs associated with field exploration and installation efforts and thus contributes to the low cost water provisioning solutions that are critically needed to address subsistence challenges in some of the world s most underdeveloped regions although agri was developed using freely accessible datasets mainly obtained from public sources in some regions it may be more difficult to obtain accurate spatial information as public data might be less readily available this could potentially be a limitation for the development of case study specific tools for other study regions on the other hand an additional water balance component or additional information on external current and future pressures on water resources and automation of filtering out non viable paths may improve the overall suitability and performance of the tool despite these possible improvements agri has demonstrated to be a novel tool with major practical applicability in

10693,the limited availability of fresh water is a major constraint to agricultural productivity and livelihood security in many developing countries within the coming decades smallholder farmers in drought prone areas are expected to be increasingly confronted with local water scarcity problems but their access to technological knowledge and financial resources to cope with these problems is often limited in this article we present a methodological framework that allows for identifying in a short period of time suitable and superficial water sources and cost effective water transportation routes for the provisioning of gravity driven irrigation systems as an implementation of the framework we present the automated and extensible geospatial toolset named agri and elaborate a case study in western honduras where the methodology and toolset were applied to provide assistance to field technicians in the process of identifying water intake sites and transportation routes the case study results show that 28 of the water intake sites previously identified by technicians without the support of agri were found to be not feasible for gravity driven irrigation on the other hand for the feasible water intake sites agri was able to provide viable and shorter water transportation routes to farms in 70 of the cases furthermore agri was able to provide alternative feasible water intake sites for all considered farms with correspondingly viable water transportation routes for 74 of them these results demonstrate agri s potential to reduce time costs and risk of failure associated with the development of low cost irrigation systems which becomes increasingly needed to support the livelihoods of some of the world s most vulnerable populations keywords least cost path water intake agriculture dry corridor western honduras 1 introduction with a steadily growing world population and associated food demands the paramount significance of water availability and accessibility for agriculture is increasing de fraiture and wichelns 2010 the stress on water requirements for agriculture is sharpened by several factors such as the increased competition of industrial and urban water use de fraiture and wichelns 2010 and the upstream presence of hydraulic infrastructure such as dams and reservoirs that may change timing of water availability schewe et al 2014 another important factor is climate change haddeland et al 2014 with resulting extreme weather phenomena such as severe droughts thornton et al 2011 consequently water scarcity is increasing and in turn the availability and access to fresh water sources becomes more important for sustained agricultural practices particularly vulnerable are smallholders in developing countries giordano et al 2019 who are strongly dependent on agriculture dile et al 2013 and typically rely on low cost water supply systems furthermore they normally have limited access to relevant technical knowledge hydro climatic information or methodological frameworks to mitigate the vulnerability to changes in short and long term weather projections and the reduction of water provisions due to multiple uses esham and garforth 2013 mapfumo et al 2013 in this article we present a methodological framework for the development of low cost gravity based irrigation systems for small scale agricultural practices in developing countries specifically the framework allows for identifying suitable and inexpensive water intake sources and cost effective water transportation routes to farm locations we hereby focus on central and south america with western honduras as a case study but our work is applicable to other regions with similar geographical conditions honduras is one of the poorest countries in latin america with a rural population of about 50 the world bank 2015 simultaneously it is recognized as one of the countries most affected by extreme climatic events in central america gourdji et al 2014 the western part of honduras belongs to the central american dry corridor in spanish known as the corredor seco an area affected by severe water scarcity bouroncle et al 2017 this area covers zones of guatemala honduras el salvador and nicaragua in honduras dry corridor people live under extreme poverty conditions with incomes below the 2 usd per person per day poverty line and consequently their livelihoods greatly depend on rainfed subsistence agriculture the world bank 2015 hence water access plays an important role as it is one of the main constraints for enhancing human welfare and agricultural production one of the actions undertaken to reduce agricultural losses in small scale farms which are commonly affected by the lack of water access includes the establishment of irrigation infrastructure to enable sustainable water provisioning kahinda et al 2007 most of the poor farmers in western honduras inhabit steep lands where permanent water sources tend to be scarce in consequence they rely on low cost solutions and transfer water to their farms through hosepipes using gravity smits et al 2010 in some cases the hosepipes are installed along routes where gravity is not enough to pull the water to crop areas forcing farmers to install pumps in between source and outflow to improve water flow although many governments ngos and international agencies efforts are currently directed to assist farmers in improving their access to water for crop production bitterman et al 2016 murugani and thamaga chitja 2018 field technicians are dispensed limited information to guide them during the process of identifying potential water intakes and their corresponding conduction paths as a result the establishment of gravity driven water supply systems to irrigate croplands is often a long and challenging operation and involves high costs related to field assessments and trial and error pipeline installation in field communications with implementers of the alliance for the dry corridor acs furthermore in most cases this process is inefficient as the installed hosepipes end up re conducting water from distant sites or do not provide the water volume needed for irrigation based on the above mentioned conditions we developed a gis based methodological framework to identify water intakes in streams for supplemental irrigation in small scale farms and define the most cost effective routes for gravity driven water transportation taking into account topography land cover and environmental restrictions such as the presence of protected areas this may lead to saving time and money and reduces the risk of failure during water deviation investment projects the framework integrates gis technologies decision rules and surface features and uses the least cost path lcp approach to optimize the transfer of captured water to farm locations as an implementation of the framework we present the automated and extensible tool named agri agua para riego water for irrigation in spanish and elaborate a case study in western honduras where the methodology and the tool were applied to identify water intake sites and cost effective conduction paths for local smallholder farmers based on the case study we evaluated the effectiveness of agri to identify viable water conduction paths and compared its results to expert provided paths finally we discuss the use of agri in practice both in agriculture and other scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area includes the western part of honduras and approximately covers the portion of the dry corridor that lies in the country see fig 1 this area comprises about 52 503 km2 and spans from 15 900 n to 12 982 n latitude and from 89 353 w to 86 053 w longitude it completely contains the departments of choluteca comayagua copán cortés francisco morazán intibucá la paz lempira ocotepeque santa bárbara and valle and partially el paraíso and yoro this area is characterized by slopes ranging from 0 coastal zones to 73 steep hills with altitudes that range between 0 2 850 m a s l the annual precipitation ranges from 800 mm up to 2000 mm while the mean temperature varies from 6 c to 30 c fao 2012 the rainy season lasts from may to november interrupted by a dry period from mid july to mid august which is called canícula the rainy periods before and after canícula are called primera and postrera respectively fao 2012 in general the agriculture in the study area is carried out in hillside lands by small scale farmers who mostly produce corn during the primera and beans during the postrera period in areas with steep slopes coffee is produced as well 2 2 problem identification to understand the needs of organizations investing in water solutions for agriculture in the study area we conducted group meetings and one on one interviews with experts in the field and key stakeholders these stakeholders included representatives from different institutions dealing with agricultural policies and education as well as aid and development in western honduras such as the u s agency for international development usaid agricultural finance fintrac honduras strategic investment invest h ministry of agriculture and livestock sag and the panamerican agriculture university zamorano and local farmers as well with these activities we aimed to better understand how the process of identifying suitable sites for water intake for small scale agriculture is currently taking place and what are the main limitations to identify these sites in a cheaper more effective and rapid manner the interviews were accompanied by field visits in the departments of intibucá lempira and santa bárbara to recognize terrain conditions and current strategies of farmers to obtain water for agriculture this resulted in the following observations o1 low cost solutions are essential to reach the target users as local farmers do not have the financial means to invest in costly or moderately costly solutions also the purchase of water pumps may pose a financial challenge o2 as farmers currently take water from streams through hosepipes pipelines they try to avoid the installation of pumps in between the water intake and the farm location hence they mostly take water from upper areas using gravity to pull it to the farm location o3 the length of the path is decisive in order to reduce hosepipe pipeline costs and installation efforts vulnerabilities and point to point pressure loss consequently farmers look for possible water intakes in streams close to their farms o4 in certain areas it is prohibited to install water intakes e g in basins in protected natural parks or other protected areas such as indigenous recognized lands o5 technicians provide assistance to farmers in the process of site identification they normally go to the field without any previous geographical information that guides them in terms of selecting areas with high potential for water intakes this site identification process could take several months and involves many field visits and tests of pipeline installation to confirm effective water transportation technicians are equipped with handheld gps devices to take coordinates of candidate sites with potential for installing water intakes as a technical note the file formats which they usually work with are kml gdb or gpx based on these observations we established the main requirements for a tool to accelerate and improve the effectiveness of the process for finding feasible water intakes for a farm these are r1 water intake sites should be at an altitude of at least 10 m above the farm location to avoid installing water pumps due to o1 o2 r2 the user must be able to search for water intake sites within a linear radius from the farm location due to o3 r3 any potential water intake sites located within protected areas basins have to be discarded due to o4 r4 on a more technical practical level any new tools supporting water intake site identification should work well with and or complement existing processes and tools for example they should support complement technicians currently providing assistance to farmers and therefore allow exporting results to a file format readable by handheld gps devices e g kml due to o5 while the first three requirements are fundamental for water intakes to be considered potential sites for water sourcing for a farm the fourth requirement is more practical closer sites to the farm location are considered better in other words the distance between the water intake site and the farm location establishes a metric according to which suitable sites can be ordered 2 3 methodological framework a methodological framework was developed to identify water intake sites and their corresponding conduction paths under the given conditions and the resources required to instantiate it see fig 2 in essence the methodology identifies suitable water sources and ranks them based on their closeness closer is better to a farm in terms of pipeline surface length the framework is based on two main components 1 a hydrological component that defines hydrological features and that is used to identify sites within streams where the likelihood of sufficient water volume is high and 2 a water transportation route component based on a least cost path lcp approach to generate these components the framework requires a digital elevation model dem land use and land cover lulc and the protected basins of the targeted area indicated in blue in fig 2 the outputs consist of the water intakes and best paths indicated in purple in fig 2 for the farm in the text which follows we capitalize words when they correspond to input calculated or output models as denoted in fig 2 2 3 1 hydrological component the hydrological component corresponds to the lower left part of the methodological framework in fig 2 this component defines the hydrological features outlets streams and watersheds by calculating the water flow direction and accumulation based on topographic properties of the landscape see wu et al 2008 metz et al 2011 choi 2012 to perform these calculations a hydrologically corrected hydro dem is required which refers to the raw dem from which the sinks i e areas of undefined flow directions have been eliminated jarihani et al 2015 lindsay 2016 a sink is a pixel or a bunch of pixels with equal or lower altitudinal values compared to its neighboring pixels which interrupts a continuous downslope water flow direction although it is possible that sinks are real properties of the landscape such as natural depressions like karst areas in many cases they are artefacts resulting from pre processing operations such as resampling processes wu et al 2008 removing these sinks allows for the definition of a stream network with flow paths reaching their corresponding outlets and enables the proper delineation of basins soille 2004 2 3 2 water transportation route component the water transportation route component corresponds to the right part of the methodological framework in fig 2 this component uses the least cost path approach which is a distance based analysis tool provided by gis technologies that allows for the modeling of the most efficient route between a source and destination location melles et al 2011 this is based on the idea that any movement across the surface involves a cost which can be expressed as time distance money or any other variable defined by the modeler collischonn and pilar 2000 in our case it represents the impediments imposed by land surface characteristics for the installation of hosepipes that transfer water from an intake site to a farm location the lcp approach relies on a resistance friction surface theobald 2005 also known as cost surface which is used to calculate the most cost effective route between origin and destination the framework employs the raw dem to generate the slopes then based on the latter along with lulc and protected basins it uses a weighted overlay calculation to generate the cost surface the slope and lulc impose restrictions to water movement whereas the protected basins impose restrictions to the potential location of water intake sites and paths across the landscape the resulting cost surface is used to identify the best path to install a hosepipe for the transportation of water from an intake site to the farm location taking into account these restrictions based on the cost surface along with the location of the farm the cost distance is calculated resulting in a cost distance surface and cost directions layer finally two outputs are generated i the water intakes derived using spatial analysis and filtering from the outlets protected basins and some user configuration parameters minimum elevation difference between the water intakes and the farm search radius within which to identify water intakes and the maximum number of water intakes to be provided and ii the best paths using the lcp approach with the water intakes along with the cost distance surface and the cost directions the implementation of the methodological framework in the form of the agri tool is described in the following sections 2 4 agri development the methodological framework was implemented in an automated tool named agri which is an extensible geospatial toolset that can be applied in any developing country where farmers are affected by water scarcity it was developed as a toolbox consisting of six tools for arcgis for desktop utilizing its modeling and spatial data processing capabilities combined with python for scripting and automation fig 3 and fig 4 it consists of the following tools 1 convert to shapefile 2 calculate best paths 3 calculate final path 4 generate watersheds 5 export results to kml and 6 convert kml to gpx the numbers indicate a possible sequence to be followed for a successful and complete implementation of the agri tool this depends of course on what the user wants to do most of these tools use a geodatabase which consists of the raw dem the hydrological features i e outlets stream network and catchment areas and the cost surface generated in turn from the criterion layers i e slope vegetation and protected basins the essential tools of agri are calculate best paths and calculate final path the former determines the best paths lcps from a farm location to a number of potential water intakes in contrast the latter tool is used to determine the best path from a farm to a predefined water intake site also the tool generate watersheds defines the drainage areas of the potential water intakes while the other tools 1 5 and 6 allow the user to convert between the input and output formats 2 4 1 data collection and preprocessing the following datasets were used for the development of the tool 1 the srtm shuttle radar topography mission dem digital elevation model with void filled data at 1 arc second spatial resolution equivalent to about 30 m at the equator to define the topography of the study area nasa jpl 2013 2 a land use land cover lulc map of honduras which was elaborated at a minimum scale of 1 25 000 using the corine land cover classification system duarte et al 2014 and 3 a layer of declared protected basins since 1987 where water infrastructures to facilitate uses other than for human drinking water are prohibited cardona 2010 these datasets were freely accessible eleven tiles 1 by 1 of the srtm dem were downloaded from the usgs u s geological survey earthexplorer web portal 1 1 it can be accessed at http earthexplorer usgs gov in geotiff format to cover the total extension of the study area using arcgis for desktop 10 2 we merged the tiles into a new raster dataset the resulting raster was clipped with the boundary layer of western honduras to obtain a dem for the study area the same was done for the lulc and protected basins layers as we planned to develop a raster based model we converted the latter two layers to raster format with the same spatial resolution as the dem all spatial information used in this study was projected to the wgs84 utm zone 16 n coordinate system in addition to compare potential solutions provided by the tool developed in this study and potential water intake sites and paths as identified by technicians we obtained a database with 87 farm locations for which 89 potential water intake sites and corresponding water conduction paths had been identified by technicians for one farm there were three potential sites and paths the database contains the coordinates and elevation values of the farms and potential water intake sites as well as surface length information of their corresponding water conduction paths 2 4 2 definition of hydrological features the models shown in figs 3 and 4 were developed in arcgis for desktop using the model builder application the model in fig 3 corresponds to the hydrological component as implemented in the methodological framework see section 2 3 for defining the hydrological features its main input parameters include the raw dem and the flow accumulation threshold while its outputs consist of raster or feature class layers the end products generated by the model include feature class layers of the streams watersheds and outlets which are stored in the output workspace the model employs the raw dem to generate the hydro dem although the arcgis software contains the fill tool for the hydrologically conditioning of dems this tool may not be accurate as it increments the average elevation of the terrain and creates unnatural smooth areas jackson 2012 hence we alternatively used the optimized pit removal v1 5 1 tool proposed by jackson 2012 that attempts to minimally affect the landscape by filling the pit area to a certain elevation after which a path is carved from that elevation to an outlet the calculation of flow direction and accumulation for the definition of hydrological features was performed following procedures described in esri 2013 and by using the arc hydro tools maidment 2002 which provides a modelling framework and tools to support water resource analyses in an arcgis environment the flow accumulation threshold is used to define the stream network in this sense any pixel with a value greater than this threshold is considered part of the network the conditional input parameter t in fig 3 assigns a value of 1 to all pixels with a flow accumulation greater than the specified threshold resulting in a mask layer raster with values of either 1 or nodata of the stream network while it is argued that the flow accumulation threshold value should be defined based on geomorphological and weather characteristics soille 2004 zhang et al 2013 in most cases an arbitrary value is chosen zhang et al 2013 given this we examined the effect of the threshold value on the stream network by performing model iterations using different values until the threshold value was finally set to 500 we contrasted the resulting stream distribution with satellite imagery available on google earth which affirmed that the chosen threshold value leads to a detailed and accurate stream network with high probability of containing water in its channels as will be discussed later in section 3 1 2 4 3 least cost path approach the model in fig 4 corresponds to the water transportation route component as defined in the methodological framework see section 2 3 for the purpose of the honduras case study we conditioned three criterion layers to generate the cost surface the first criterion layer generated was the slope surface it was calculated in degrees using the slope tool in arcgis with the raw dem as input data as the slope layer is a continuous surface it was reclassified into a scale of 1 10 see table s1 supplementary material using the natural breaks jenks classification method described in jenks and caspall 1971 this was the scale chosen to represent the cost values in all criterion layers as to ensure an adequate representation of the values variability in each layer it represents the suitability of the land surface for the installation of a hosepipe with higher values indicating worse suitability the second criterion layer was the clipped lulc layer containing 23 of the 26 land cover classes for all honduras each land cover class was assigned a cost value from 1 10 indicating high and low suitability for hosepipe installation respectively the resulting categories in both spanish original and english the cost values and their corresponding areas are displayed in table s2 supplementary material the third criterion layer used was the layer of protected basins they comprise about 2198 km2 4 of the study area and were assigned a cost value of 10 this value restricts the installation of hosepipes within areas where infrastructure building is prohibited based on the above mentioned criterion layers and using a number of potential water intake sites and a farm location as input parameters the most cost effective paths for water transportation can be identified fig 4 cost paths are calculated in the opposite direction of the water flow due to model parameterization starting from the farm location origin to the candidate water intake sites destinations fig 4 shows that for each independent model run the middle and right parts of the model change as they depend on both origin and destination s on the other hand the cost surface is generated only once by performing a weighted overlay of the three criterion layers left part of the model finally within each run buffer areas around the origin and destination locations are generated to delineate the area for which to calculate the cost paths and distances to put emphasis on the restrictions imposed to water movement in finding the best paths a weight of 40 was given to both vegetation and slope while a weight of 20 was given to protected basins these weights represent the relative importance of the variables in the model in this specific case study we considered vegetation and slope to be equally important while protected basins have a lower impact in the model this weighting gives the highest values to areas with dense vegetation and steep slopes while lower values are assigned to flatter and less densely covered areas therefore the weights assigned to the criterion layers facilitate the hydraulic design of pipelines take into account protected areas and in turn allow for the protection of forests the weights are configurable and can thus be changed depending on the conditions of the case study at hand which may have a significant impact on the calculation of the best paths 3 agri evaluation the agri tool and its underlying methodological framework were extensively tested and applied in practice to verify i the correct identification of potential water intake sites ii the use of agri to detect wrongly identified water intake sites by technicians iii the ability of agri to identify better alternative conductions paths as compared to technician identified paths 3 1 testing and validation we assessed the ability of agri to identify potential water intake sites in streams where the likelihood of water availability is high in three dry watersheds within the departments of intibucá lempira and ocotepeque and one wet watershed in santa bárbara honduras these watersheds were selected because development agencies and governmental institutions prioritized these areas for small irrigation projects that use water diverted from nearby streams to validate the agri tool it was used to identify 27 potential water intake sites within these watersheds then we verified water availability in the identified sites during field visits in march 2016 which is generally the driest month of the year see figure s1 supplementary material to confirm their feasibility to serve as potential water source in addition we used agri to assess the feasibility of potential water intake sites and conduction paths as identified by technicians without the assistance of a gis based tool such as agri as mentioned in section 2 4 we obtained a database of existing projects with farm locations along with their corresponding water intake sites and conduction paths hereafter referred to as technician sites and technician paths respectively first agri was used to assess the feasibility of the technician sites 89 in total where a site in unprotected area and located at an altitude of at least 10 m above the farm was considered as feasible then we used agri to calculate alternative water conduction paths between feasible technician sites and the farm locations the path lengths as calculated by agri were contrasted with the length of the technician paths to examine agri s potential to provide shorter more cost effective paths compared to technicians in addition we examined the viability of each alternative path identified with agri in this regard a path that goes over a peak which is 24 m higher relative to the water intake site was considered as not viable we used 24 m because it is reported that srtm dems have a vertical accuracy of 16 m farr et al 2007 and technicians report that in the field they can circumvent a peak of up to 8 m encountered on a path the present design of agri does not allow for automatic recognition of paths that are not viable hence the viability of the paths was manually examined by comparing the altitude of each water intake site with the highest peak in the path the viability of technician paths could not be examined as information on their positioning as proposed by technicians was unavailable i e the database of existing projects only contained surface length information subsequently we used agri to identify potential water intake sites for the 87 farms included in the database and calculated their corresponding conduction paths hereafter referred to as agri sites and agri paths respectively also the viability of each agri path was examined following the criteria described above we configured agri by specifying a minimum elevation difference between the water intakes and the farm of 10 m and a maximum search radius of 10 km within which to identify potential water intakes in addition we specified a maximum of 10 water intake sites per farm location which implies that more than one water intake site and conduction path per farm could be identified as a final comparison we contrasted the agri paths with the technician paths and examined the differences in their surface lengths 3 2 results the field recognition of potential water intake sites identified by agri carried out in march 2016 allowed us to validate the threshold value used for the definition of the stream network and the ability of agri to identify sites in streams where water availability is high out of the 27 sites visited only two were located in dry channels both channels directly emerge from a spring where the likelihood of water availability is usually lower compared to locations further downwards that are connected to multiple streams hence the chosen threshold value of 500 representing the number of pixels draining upstream of the pixel being analyzed ensured a stream network for the study area with high probability of containing water in its channels the drainage areas of the sites found by agri ranged considerably from 1 4 km2 to 57 km2 showing the level of detail at which drainage areas could be defined despite the fact that agriculture in the study area is mostly implemented in hillside lands agri performed well in identifying feasible water sources in streams this capacity of agri expands the options of farmers to find potential sites that supply water required for crop irrigation with respect to the assessment of the water intake sites previously identified by technicians without the support of agri technician sites we found that by using agri 25 out of 89 28 technician sites were found to be not feasible either because they are located in protected areas or because they do not meet the requirement of 10 m elevation difference between the water intake site and the farm location see table 1 this is a significant finding as it shows that using the agri tool helps to avoid the unnecessary installation of water intakes in locations from which it is anyway not feasible to transport water by gravity as a consequence the use of agri leads to substantial time and financial savings such problems were also reported during meetings with technicians who were dealing with hosepipes that had to be reinstalled due to the lack of water flow by gravity on the other hand we used agri to provide potential alternatives for the water conduction paths as proposed by technicians technician paths using the calculate final path tool for the 64 technician sites that were found to be feasible by agri 64 alternative paths were generated using agri we found that 47 73 of them can be considered viable as they avoid peaks in the landscape of 24 m relative to the water intake site the other 17 alternative paths were found not to be viable as they could not avoid peaks in the landscape 24 m hence although agri found those 64 technician sites to be feasible the terrain conditions impede viable pipeline installations between 17 of them and their corresponding farm locations which implies that for these farms alternative water intake sites should be considered in addition we compared the technician paths with the alternative paths identified by agri in terms of surface length of the 63 technician paths for which surface length information was available agri provided 44 70 viable shorter alternative paths see table 1 again this could reflect considerable gains as for shorter paths less time and funds are needed for pipeline installation apart from the assessment of technician sites and technician paths we assessed agri s ability to identify feasible water intake sites and viable paths for the same 87 farm locations agri sites and agri paths respectively in this regard we used agri s calculate best paths tool to identify the sites and the optimal paths to the farms this resulted in a total of 794 feasible agri sites with at least one feasible site per farm see table 2 correspondingly for 248 out of 794 feasible agri sites at least one viable water conduction path to the target farm could be identified we call these sites viable agri sites therefore for 64 out of 87 74 farms at least one viable path to a feasible agri water intake site could be found the inability of agri to find viable paths for all farms should not be considered a flaw of the tool it rather reflects the lack of adequate terrains in the surroundings of some of the farms that facilitate the installation of a hosepipe even though the potential water intake point itself is feasible for example several farms were found to be located on hilltops or mountain peaks although agri was able to identify water intake sites at altitudes of at least 10 m above the farms in all cases e g located on nearby peaks with sufficient water supply due to significant local peaks depressions between the water intake sites and some farm locations the installation of gravity based irrigation systems will nonetheless be almost impossible or high costly finally we contrasted 88 technician paths with the agri paths in terms of surface length for one technician path surface length information was not available where agri provided up to 10 paths for each farm location based on this analysis we found that agri identified at least one viable shorter path compared to technicians in 49 out of 63 78 cases see table 3 this again confirms that agri allows for significant improvements in terms of water intake site identification and conduction path definition 3 3 further experiences uses in practice and discussion since the release of agri in 2016 it has provided considerable support to cost effective investments by government and development agencies it has been used by at least 30 technicians and at least 200 sites for diverting water for irrigated agriculture purposes have been identified similarly some previously identified sites by technicians have been successfully changed to agri s identified locations meanwhile it is important to note that agri does not replace the role of technicians as the final decision on site selection and path definition remains with the technicians and their overall assessment of the study area importantly also other aspects for instance related to social impacts and local environmental regulations are to be considered by technicians in the process of site assessment while agri is capable of identifying feasible water intake sites along with viable paths for pipeline installation using the calculate best path tool it can also be used to determine the best path between a farm and a predefined water intake site using the calculate final path tool this option is useful when field technicians have already established a suitable water intake for which only the best i e final path between this point and the destination farm needs to be determined on the other hand we found that occasionally water intake sites identified by agri are located within streams on private property where landowners may not be willing to cooperate with the installation of pipelines for these cases agri allows to manually relocate the coordinates of the water intake site within the same stream but outside the property boundaries for which subsequently the final path can be calculated agri was designed to provide information for irrigation projects however the tool has been given other uses by local organizations for example agri has been used to determine the best path from a licensed superficial water source to a tank to store water for human consumption in a small community this evidenced a new utility of agri showing that in addition to irrigation projects it can also help to identify water sources and conduction paths to support human drinking water needs in addition agri allows for the delineation of drainage areas which may help environmental agencies to target local regulations that aim at the conservation of water resources while this article has demonstrated the strengths and potential of agri some adjustments could be made to further improve the tool the present design of agri solely allows for the identification of potential water intakes and the optimal transportation routes to the farm locations to provide more understanding of the water quantity in streams and the potential for water harvesting an extension of agri with a water balance model is currently under development this extension will allow for estimations of the degree to which water from streams and harvesting sites can be captured and stored to support agriculture and household needs while taking into account minimum ecological flows acreman and dunbar 2004 and the water supply requirements of downstream water users furthermore identification of viable conduction paths by comparing the altitude of the water intake site with the highest peak in the path could be automated to automatically filter out non viable paths furthermore the applicability of agri could be enhanced by incorporating case study specific factors that could narrow down the number of candidate water sources such as information on local land registry to define areas where private landowners may oppose to pipeline installations also information on existing or future water infrastructures in the region could provide additional insights on the long term water provisioning potential of candidate water sources the methodological framework and the agri tool are easily adaptable to include such concerns 4 conclusions this article addressed the problem of identifying viable low cost water provisioning solutions for smallholder farmers in developing countries a gis based methodological framework was developed to support ongoing efforts oriented at determining suitable sites for establishing low cost gravity based irrigation systems using water diverted from rivers the implementation of this framework and its use in practice demonstrated its potential for assisting local field technicians in the process of identifying candidate water intake sites and the most cost effective water conduction routes to the destination farm location although our work was motivated by a case study specifically focused on the western part of honduras which has been exposed to severe water scarcity in the last couple of years the framework is equally applicable to other regions that are subjected to similar water scarcity problems the main product obtained in this study is a geospatial tool named agri this tool allows for the characterization of stream networks and drainage areas to simulate water flow over the land surface while aggregating a number of landscape characteristics into a cost surface that imposes restrictions to this water flow the result is the geographical localization of a point in a river or stream where sufficient water is likely available for crop irrigation and the optimal path from this point to a farm along which a hosepipe can be installed the tool was tested and evaluated in a large scale case study in western honduras results show that agri was able 1 to identify sites in streams where water is available during the dry season in 25 out of 27 cases 2 to identify 25 out of 89 technician identified water intake sites as not feasible 3 to provide viable shorter alternative paths compared to technician identified paths between farms and technician identified water intake sites in 44 out of 63 cases 4 to provide feasible alternative water intake sites with at least one viable path for 64 out of 87 farms for other farms likely no viable path exists due to local topography and 5 to provide at least one shorter path between farms and agri identified sites compared to technician identified paths between farms and technician identified sites for 60 out of 88 cases these results demonstrate agri s potential to reduce time and costs associated with field exploration and installation efforts and thus contributes to the low cost water provisioning solutions that are critically needed to address subsistence challenges in some of the world s most underdeveloped regions although agri was developed using freely accessible datasets mainly obtained from public sources in some regions it may be more difficult to obtain accurate spatial information as public data might be less readily available this could potentially be a limitation for the development of case study specific tools for other study regions on the other hand an additional water balance component or additional information on external current and future pressures on water resources and automation of filtering out non viable paths may improve the overall suitability and performance of the tool despite these possible improvements agri has demonstrated to be a novel tool with major practical applicability in

production cover crops shoot biomass production ranged between 3243 and 9871 kg ha 1 across seasons and termination dates table 2 these values fit within the range of those reported for cover crops shoot biomass production in the region martinez et al 2013 duval et al 2016 mean cover crop shoot biomass production across treatments was higher in season 1 than in season 2 p 0 05 table 2 larger cover crop shoot biomass production might have been the result of i an earlier sowing date and thus a longer 2 weeks cover crop growing period and ii a better growing environment for the cover crop associated with 33 more rainfall in season 1 than in season 2 table 1 delaying cover crop termination approximately 25 days increased cover crop shoot biomass accumulation by 60 p 0 05 table 2 increments in cover crop shoot biomass at delayed termination dates were previously reported for the same cover crop specie used in this study rosario lebron et al 2019 and for other cover crop species e g clark et al 1997 cline and silvernail 2001 larger biomass production of the cover crop promotes a thicker mulch formation which is more recalcitrant to decomposition and therefore more suitable to protect the soil and enhance water conservation unger and parker 1976 klocke 2004 and weed control teasdale and mohler 2000 3 2 soil water availability soil water availability in the whole profile close to cover crop termination dates was lower in cover crops treatments saw 58 season 1 and 73 season 2 averaged between the two termination dates fig 2 than in soybean monoculture saw 70 season 1 and 79 season 2 significant in season 1 p 0 05 as could be expected soil available water reductions produced by cover crops ranged from 18 to 23 mm at early and delayed termination dates respectively larger soil water availability reductions due to cover crops were evident in season 1 this could be explained by the rain pattern close to termination date which showed 190 mm less rainfall during the three months previous to termination date i e september october november fig 1 in season 1 as compared to season 2 in season 1 reduction of saw by cover crops was evident up to a soil depth of 40 cm significant in the upper 20 cm p 0 05 fig 3 these results agree with those from restovich et al 2012 who reported soil water content reductions at the cover crop termination date in the uppermost soil layers i e 0 30 cm soil water profile was not modified by the cover crop in season 2 soil water content could not be measured for termination date 2 in season 2 fig 2 soil water availability in the whole soil profile from around 30 days after soybean sowing and during its growing period was similar among cover crops at both termination dates and soybean monoculture p 0 05 fig 2 no differences were either detected among treatments at different soil layers during soybean initial growth 10 30 days after soybean sowing or during the critical period for kernel set fig 3 thus although cover crops reduced saw before soybean sowing in season 1 rain fallen during soybean initial growth was able to offset water losses due to cover crop uptake i e rainfall accumulated from cover crops termination until 30 days after soybean sowing was 129 and 91 mm for early and delayed termination dates respectively in environments with high amount and frequency of rainfall during fallows advantages of fallow periods with stubble i e no till management over bared soils on reducing soil evaporation and increasing soil water content were previously shown e g incerti et al 1993 gregory et al 2000 monzón et al 2006 our work demonstrates further that the cover crop water uptake did not compromise soil available water in the upper layers of the profile during soybean growth in a humid environment fig 2 in the same direction basche et al 2016 reported higher soil water content in the top 30 cm of soil during the soybean season after a rye cover crop as compared to soybean without any previous cover crops our results confirm those from meta analyses alvarez et al 2017 and simulation models pinto et al 2017 indicating that cover crops during fallow periods had little impact on soil water content at the sowing date of the subsequent cash crop in humid environments soil water availability during soybean critical period for grain yield determination which occurs from r4 january 30 in season 1 and february 4 in season 2 to r6 march 1 and 3 in seasons 1 and 2 respectively andrade et al 2002 fehr and caviness 1977 ranged from 41 to 73 in season 1 and from 38 to 68 in season 2 across treatments fig 2 during that period saw tended to be larger in soils with cover crops than in soybean monoculture fig 2 some authors have reported increments in soil moisture associated with straw mulch e g sekhon et al 2005 ramakrishna et al 2006 akhtar et al 2019 while others have related this mulch to improved rain capture and water infiltration munawar et al 1990 unger and vigil 1998 dabney 1998 and or increased water conservation by reductions in water evaporation klocke 2004 ghosh et al 2006 ali et al 2018 despite the many benefits of including a cover crop in a crop system reicosky and forcella 1998 teasdale and mohler 2000 poeplau and don 2015 a recent work based on a simulation model has warned about cover crops feasibility in terms of water availability for the cash crop pointing out that this practice would only be possible when cumulative rainfall during the fallow period is larger than 100 mm while cover crop duration should be shortened to less than 2 months in regions where cumulative rainfall during fallow periods is lower than 350 mm pinto et al 2017 3 3 soybean grain yield evapotranspiration and wp soybean grain yield ranged from 2723 to 3707 kg ha 1 table 3 values within the range of reported yields for rainfed soybean in the region calviño and sadras 1999 grain yields were larger in season 2 than in season 1 p 0 05 table 3 probably related to more rainfall during the critical period for kernel set r4 to r6 in season 2 72 6 mm than in season 1 33 3 mm fig 1 cover crops did not influence soybean grain yield compared with soybean monoculture in any season p 0 05 there are discrepancies in the literature about the effects of cover crops on soybean grain yield some reports agreed on that cover crops do not affect soybean grain yield e g caviglia and andrade 2010 restovich et al 2012 some evidenced slight soybean grain yield reductions 2 alvarez et al 2017 while others reported soybean grain yield increments in the range of 4 4 68 3 sekhon et al 2005 these discrepancies might be associated with differences in the environment and or the species used as cover crops and their management e g rimski korsakov et al 2015 alvarez et al 2017 for example cover crops increase or have no effect on cash crop yields in humid and sub humid environments but may reduce yields in water limited regions e g unger and vigil 1998 our study shows further that in humid environments although delayed termination promoted cover crops shoot biomass increments table 2 and larger water uptake especially in season 1 fig 2 it did not influence soybean grain yield table 3 cover crops at both termination dates reduced soybean et as compared to soybean monoculture p 0 05 table 3 fig 4 mean soybean et across cover crops termination dates was 12 season 1 and 17 mm season 2 lower than et of soybean monoculture these reductions in et could be attributed to the facts that i evaporation of the soil was lower todd et al 1991 klocke 2004 van donk et al 2010 and ii the water saved by means of lower evaporation has not been used for transpiration since soil water was not limiting fig 2 slightly lower soybean et for delayed termination date treatments table 3 could respond to larger cover crop biomass that might have promoted larger reductions in soil evaporation in this humid environment soybean et was closely and negatively related to cover crops biomass production p 0 05 fig 4 however it is likely that in less humid environments increments in soybean transpiration offset reductions in evaporation during soybean growing season following a cover crop significant soybean et reductions in response to the inclusion of a cover crop under no till management highlights the relevance of this practice for reducing the non productive component of et in particular for soybean monoculture even larger et reductions in response to including a cover crop can be expected under bared soil than those obtained in this work under no till management water productivity in soybean ranged between 5 93 to 8 30 kg ha 1 mm 1 across treatments and seasons table 3 these values are within the range of values reported for wp in soybean without cover crops e g clawson et al 1986 scott et al 1987 hattendorf et al 1988 quaglietta charandá and y mori 1994 in the present study cover crops tended to increase soybean wp around 4 season 2 and 10 season 1 table 3 previous reports showed that straw mulch produced wp increments of around 30 in wheat and 7 in maize jin et al 2009 to the best of our knowledge there are no reports quantifying soybean wp in response to cover crops inclusion results of our study i indicate that cover crops reduce soybean et while slightly increase soybean wp in a humid environment and ii suggest that cover crops reduce evaporation during soybean growing season 4 conclusions results of our work show that cover crops reduced soil available water at cover crop termination date mostly in the uppermost soil layers 0 40 cm a delay of cover crops termination of approximately 25 days increased 60 cover crop shoot biomass and promoted larger soil available water reductions however in the humid environment here studied rainfall after cover crop termination allowed to compensating cover crop water uptake producing little impact on soil available water during soybean initial growth and critical period for kernel set and thus cover crops did not influence soybean grain yield moreover our findings evidenced that in this humid environment i including a cover crop before soybean sowing reduced soybean et between 12 17 mm for early and delayed cover crops termination respectively and slightly increased water productivity in soybean 4 10 and ii larger cover crops shoot biomass

shoot biomass production in the region martinez et al 2013 duval et al 2016 mean cover crop shoot biomass production across treatments was higher in season 1 than in season 2 p 0 05 table 2 larger cover crop shoot biomass production might have been the result of i an earlier sowing date and thus a longer 2 weeks cover crop growing period and ii a better growing environment for the cover crop associated with 33 more rainfall in season 1 than in season 2 table 1 delaying cover crop termination approximately 25 days increased cover crop shoot biomass accumulation by 60 p 0 05 table 2 increments in cover crop shoot biomass at delayed termination dates were previously reported for the same cover crop specie used in this study rosario lebron et al 2019 and for other cover crop species e g clark et al 1997 cline and silvernail 2001 larger biomass production of the cover crop promotes a thicker mulch formation which is more recalcitrant to decomposition and therefore more suitable to protect the soil and enhance water conservation unger and parker 1976 klocke 2004 and weed control teasdale and mohler 2000 3 2 soil water availability soil water availability in the whole profile close to cover crop termination dates was lower in cover crops treatments saw 58 season 1 and 73 season 2 averaged between the two termination dates fig 2 than in soybean monoculture saw 70 season 1 and 79 season 2 significant in season 1 p 0 05 as could be expected soil available water reductions produced by cover crops ranged from 18 to 23 mm at early and delayed termination dates respectively larger soil water availability reductions due to cover crops were evident in season 1 this could be explained by the rain pattern close to termination date which showed 190 mm less rainfall during the three months previous to termination date i e september october november fig 1 in season 1 as compared to season 2 in season 1 reduction of saw by cover crops was evident up to a soil depth of 40 cm significant in the upper 20 cm p 0 05 fig 3 these results agree with those from restovich et al 2012 who reported soil water content reductions at the cover crop termination date in the uppermost soil layers i e 0 30 cm soil water profile was not modified by the cover crop in season 2 soil water content could not be measured for termination date 2 in season 2 fig 2 soil water availability in the whole soil profile from around 30 days after soybean sowing and during its growing period was similar among cover crops at both termination dates and soybean monoculture p 0 05 fig 2 no differences were either detected among treatments at different soil layers during soybean initial growth 10 30 days after soybean sowing or during the critical period for kernel set fig 3 thus although cover crops reduced saw before soybean sowing in season 1 rain fallen during soybean initial growth was able to offset water losses due to cover crop uptake i e rainfall accumulated from cover crops termination until 30 days after soybean sowing was 129 and 91 mm for early and delayed termination dates respectively in environments with high amount and frequency of rainfall during fallows advantages of fallow periods with stubble i e no till management over bared soils on reducing soil evaporation and increasing soil water content were previously shown e g incerti et al 1993 gregory et al 2000 monzón et al 2006 our work demonstrates further that the cover crop water uptake did not compromise soil available water in the upper layers of the profile during soybean growth in a humid environment fig 2 in the same direction basche et al 2016 reported higher soil water content in the top 30 cm of soil during the soybean season after a rye cover crop as compared to soybean without any previous cover crops our results confirm those from meta analyses alvarez et al 2017 and simulation models pinto et al 2017 indicating that cover crops during fallow periods had little impact on soil water content at the sowing date of the subsequent cash crop in humid environments soil water availability during soybean critical period for grain yield determination which occurs from r4 january 30 in season 1 and february 4 in season 2 to r6 march 1 and 3 in seasons 1 and 2 respectively andrade et al 2002 fehr and caviness 1977 ranged from 41 to 73 in season 1 and from 38 to 68 in season 2 across treatments fig 2 during that period saw tended to be larger in soils with cover crops than in soybean monoculture fig 2 some authors have reported increments in soil moisture associated with straw mulch e g sekhon et al 2005 ramakrishna et al 2006 akhtar et al 2019 while others have related this mulch to improved rain capture and water infiltration munawar et al 1990 unger and vigil 1998 dabney 1998 and or increased water conservation by reductions in water evaporation klocke 2004 ghosh et al 2006 ali et al 2018 despite the many benefits of including a cover crop in a crop system reicosky and forcella 1998 teasdale and mohler 2000 poeplau and don 2015 a recent work based on a simulation model has warned about cover crops feasibility in terms of water availability for the cash crop pointing out that this practice would only be possible when cumulative rainfall during the fallow period is larger than 100 mm while cover crop duration should be shortened to less than 2 months in regions where cumulative rainfall during fallow periods is lower than 350 mm pinto et al 2017 3 3 soybean grain yield evapotranspiration and wp soybean grain yield ranged from 2723 to 3707 kg ha 1 table 3 values within the range of reported yields for rainfed soybean in the region calviño and sadras 1999 grain yields were larger in season 2 than in season 1 p 0 05 table 3 probably related to more rainfall during the critical period for kernel set r4 to r6 in season 2 72 6 mm than in season 1 33 3 mm fig 1 cover crops did not influence soybean grain yield compared with soybean monoculture in any season p 0 05 there are discrepancies in the literature about the effects of cover crops on soybean grain yield some reports agreed on that cover crops do not affect soybean grain yield e g caviglia and andrade 2010 restovich et al 2012 some evidenced slight soybean grain yield reductions 2 alvarez et al 2017 while others reported soybean grain yield increments in the range of 4 4 68 3 sekhon et al 2005 these discrepancies might be associated with differences in the environment and or the species used as cover crops and their management e g rimski korsakov et al 2015 alvarez et al 2017 for example cover crops increase or have no effect on cash crop yields in humid and sub humid environments but may reduce yields in water limited regions e g unger and vigil 1998 our study shows further that in humid environments although delayed termination promoted cover crops shoot biomass increments table 2 and larger water uptake especially in season 1 fig 2 it did not influence soybean grain yield table 3 cover crops at both termination dates reduced soybean et as compared to soybean monoculture p 0 05 table 3 fig 4 mean soybean et across cover crops termination dates was 12 season 1 and 17 mm season 2 lower than et of soybean monoculture these reductions in et could be attributed to the facts that i evaporation of the soil was lower todd et al 1991 klocke 2004 van donk et al 2010 and ii the water saved by means of lower evaporation has not been used for transpiration since soil water was not limiting fig 2 slightly lower soybean et for delayed termination date treatments table 3 could respond to larger cover crop biomass that might have promoted larger reductions in soil evaporation in this humid environment soybean et was closely and negatively related to cover crops biomass production p 0 05 fig 4 however it is likely that in less humid environments increments in soybean transpiration offset reductions in evaporation during soybean growing season following a cover crop significant soybean et reductions in response to the inclusion of a cover crop under no till management highlights the relevance of this practice for reducing the non productive component of et in particular for soybean monoculture even larger et reductions in response to including a cover crop can be expected under bared soil than those obtained in this work under no till management water productivity in soybean ranged between 5 93 to 8 30 kg ha 1 mm 1 across treatments and seasons table 3 these values are within the range of values reported for wp in soybean without cover crops e g clawson et al 1986 scott et al 1987 hattendorf et al 1988 quaglietta charandá and y mori 1994 in the present study cover crops tended to increase soybean wp around 4 season 2 and 10 season 1 table 3 previous reports showed that straw mulch produced wp increments of around 30 in wheat and 7 in maize jin et al 2009 to the best of our knowledge there are no reports quantifying soybean wp in response to cover crops inclusion results of our study i indicate that cover crops reduce soybean et while slightly increase soybean wp in a humid environment and ii suggest that cover crops reduce evaporation during soybean growing season 4 conclusions results of our work show that cover crops reduced soil available water at cover crop termination date mostly in the uppermost soil layers 0 40 cm a delay of cover crops termination of approximately 25 days increased 60 cover crop shoot biomass and promoted larger soil available water reductions however in the humid environment here studied rainfall after cover crop termination allowed to compensating cover crop water uptake producing little impact on soil available water during soybean initial growth and critical period for kernel set and thus cover crops did not influence soybean grain yield moreover our findings evidenced that in this humid environment i including a cover crop before soybean sowing reduced soybean et between 12 17 mm for early and delayed cover crops termination respectively and slightly increased water productivity in soybean 4 10 and ii larger cover crops shoot biomass production can be associated with larger soybean et reductions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships
