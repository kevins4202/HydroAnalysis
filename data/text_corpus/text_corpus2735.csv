13675,coupling photoelectrocatalysis with reverse osmosis ro provides a promising way to improve the performance of ro through the elimination of concentrated nitrate in retentate flow however poor visible light response limits the performance of photoelectrocatalytic process hence graphene ag n tio2 was prepared as a good visible light response through loading n tio2 nanoparticles ag particles and graphene nanoplatelets on ti plate using electrophoretic deposition method the prepared nanocomposite was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd diffuse reflectance spectra drs scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray edx and n2 adsorption desorption isotherm first the effect of ph bias potential catalyst surface area and irradiation power on the nitrate reduction was assessed through the photoelectrocatalytic process it was observed that almost 85 of the nitrate was reduced through the photoelectrocatalytic process using the optimized conditions including neutral ph potential of 1 5 v three electrodes and three visible light lamps nitrate removal efficiency was considerably higher than sorption 8 photocatalysis 8 and electrocatalysis 35 processes furthermore 33 of nitrate was reduced to no2 and nh4 using the optimized photoelectrocatalytic process after 120 min this indicates more than 50 of nitrate reduction products are volatile compounds such as n2 and n2o which can be get out of the water finally the photoelectrocatalytic process using the graphene ag n tio2 was integrated with ro to eliminate the nitrate in concentrated retentate of the ro through the reclamation results showed that the nitrate concentration was not increased over time on the contrary of observations made with ro keywords nitrate reduction n tio2 reverse osmosis visible light photoelectrocatalysis continuous flow process 1 introduction nitrate is the commonly found form of nitrogen in surface water and ground water release of considerable quantities of agricultural wastewater especially fertilizer is the most important source of nitrate entry into water sources 1 2 according to studies done by the world health organization the maximum limit of nitrate concentration in drinking water is 50 mg l 3 high levels of nitrate in drinking water cause health problems such as thyroid diseases methemoglobinemia blue baby syndrome and cancer 4 5 therefore it is essential to remove excessive amounts of nitrate from polluted water to date different methods have been developed and applied to remove nitrate from water reverse osmosis ro is one of the frequently used methods to remove nitrate from water through a semi permeable membrane however the ro produces a concentrated solution of nitrate in retentate flow from the membrane which is not desirable in other words it results in the release of secondary pollutant into the environment which needs to be refined 6 photocatalytic reduction process is another method to remove nitrate from water in this process by irradiating a semiconductor with an appropriate light electron e transfers from the semiconductor valence band to the conduction band and leaves positive hole h on the semiconductor 7 8 the e at the conduction band has a potential to react with nitrate and reduce it early studies by several research groups such as freire et al 9 zarei et al 10 and li et al 11 have demonstrated nitrate photocatalytic reduction however rapid recombination of h and e considerably diminishes the photocatalytic efficiency presently much more attentions have been attracted to improve the photocatalytic reduction process efficiency by preventing the rate of e h recombination 12 14 using expedient oxidative agents such as oxalic acid 15 16 or formic acid 17 19 is a common method to progress the photocatalytic reduction process because these agents can act as h trapper to slow the rate of e h recombination 20 thus more electrons are available for the nitrate reduction however in this method an additional chemical agent should be added to the nitrate solution therefore it is required to discover an efficient strategy to overcome the necessity of chemical oxidative agents adding the primary purpose of this work to accelerate the separation of e h pairs is applying an electric field to the photocatalyst known as photoelectrocatalytic process to trap h and consequently improve the efficiency of the photocatalytic reduction process photoelectrocatalytic reduction of nitrate in aqueous solution has not been well established among various semiconductors tio2 as a widely used stable and nontoxic photocatalyst was applied in this work 21 22 to enhance the performance of the tio2 in photoelectrocatalytic reduction process the substrate was modified by nitrogen doping to shift the photocatalyst absorption towards the visible region and hybridized with graphene nanoplatelets and silver particles to facilitate charge separation 23 furthermore another aim of this project is to examine the performance of membrane photoreactor consisting of visible light photoelectrocatalytic and ro processes to overcome the essential restriction of the ro process through the reductive removal of the concentrated nitrate 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials tio2 p25 with an average size of 20 30 nm was acquired from degussa germany graphene nanoplatelets 99 5 thickness 2 18 nm with less than 32 layers were obtained from us research nanomaterials inc usa iso propyl alcohol 99 9 was purchased from dr mojallal co iran ethanol 96 was obtained from jahan alcohol teb co iran all other chemical reagents were of analytical grade and supplied by merck all chemicals were used directly without further purification 2 2 synthesis of n tio2 and ag particles to prepare n tio2 1 g of tio2 p25 nanoparticles and 6 g of urea were thoroughly mixed in a mortar the mixture was heated in an electric oven at 450 c for 5 h and then allowed to cool the resulting yellowish precipitate was washed with ethanol 96 and distilled water and dried at 100 c for 90 min 24 furthermore ag particles were synthesized using a chemical reduction method described in our previous work with silver nitrate ascorbic acid and sodium citrate as the precursor reducing agent and stabilizer respectively 25 2 3 preparation of graphene ag n tio2 nanocomposite electrophoretic deposition epd method was applied to prepare graphene ag n tio2 nanocomposite through simultaneous immobilization of graphene ag and n tio2 particles on the surface of titanium grid sheet this process was done in three steps the first step was titanium substrate preparation at this stage the titanium grid sheet was placed in an acetone solution for 5 min to remove any organic contaminant then etched by hcl h2so4 solution for 2 h and rinsed with distilled water the second step included preparation of a suspension containing 0 25 g n tio2 0 06 g ag 0 08 g graphene and 0 07 g magnesium nitrate in 80 ml of iso propyl alcohol the suspension was sonicated at room temperature for 1 h in order to uniform homogenization the final step was electrophoretic immobilization the titanium substrate as the cathode and the stainless steel plate as the anode were horizontally located in the epd cell and the distance between them was adjusted to 0 5 cm then suspension was transferred to the cell and voltage of 40 v was applied between the cathode and the anode for 7 min finally the graphene ag n tio2 nanocomposite deposited on the titanium substrate was dried in an oven at 60 c and calcined in a vacuum oven at 450 c for 1 h 2 4 characterization methods x ray diffraction xrd was performed to identify the crystalline structure of the graphene ag n tio2 nanocomposite by philips x pert x ray diffractometer with co kα incident radiation at a tube voltage of 40 kv and a current of 40 ma diffuse reflectance spectra drs were carried out using avaspec 2048 tec uv vis spectrophotometer to demonstrate the absorption of the nanocomposite in the visible region scanning electron microscopy sem image and energy dispersive x ray edx analysis of graphene ag n tio2 surface were performed using mira3tescan xmu the specific brunauer emmett teller bet surface area was determined with a belsorp mini ii surface analyzer bel japan by n2 adsorption at 77 k 2 5 photoelectrocatalytic reduction process after preparation of the graphene ag n tio2 ti nanocomposite this catalyst was used to remove nitrate from tap water with conductivity of 500 μs cm2 through the visible light photoelectrocatalysis the reactor was made up of a cylindrical vessel consisting of a graphene ag n tio2 ti plate 3 4 cm2 as the working electrode platinum plate as the auxiliary electrode and silver silver chloride as the reference electrode the electrodes were connected to a potentiostat cv 320 xh hirad iran and inputted in the reactor containing 100 ml of nitrate solution 50 mg l the reactor was placed on a magnetic stirrer to keep constant mixing of the solution the ph of the solution was adjusted to the desired values furthermore the solution was irradiated by 1 3 visible light lamp s 18 w nama noor co iran as soon as the light was turned on a constant negative potential was applied to the working electrode all of the photoelectrocatalytic tests were repeated three times and the average of the obtained results was reported 2 6 nitrate concentration measurement to measure nitrate concentration in the solution 5 ml of the solution was transferred to an evaporation vessel 1 ml of sodium azide solution 0 5 g l and 0 4 ml of acetic acid 17 m were added to the evaporation vessel after 5 min the mixture was dried in a boiling water bath then 2 ml of sodium salicylate solution 0 1 g l was added to the dry mix and again was allowed to be evaporated in the boiling water bath at the end of the evaporation the vessel was cooled at room temperature in the next step 2 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid was added to the vessel and the sediment was dissolved by gentle stirring the solution was left undisturbed for 10 min then 20 ml of distilled water and 20 ml of naoh edta solution were added to the solution and left again for 10 min finally the solution was brought to final volume of 50 ml and its absorbance was measured at 415 nm 26 the measured absorbance was converted to nitrate concentration using the calibration graph 2 7 continuous membrane photoreactor continuous membrane photoreactor was designed by combining the ro and visible light photoelectrocatalytic reduction processes to investigate the simultaneous application of these two processes to overcome the main restriction of the ro process by the reductive removal of the concentrated nitrate in fact in continuous membrane photoreactor the concentrated retentate of the ro is returned to the photoreactor for nitrate removal through the photoelectrocatalytic reduction process the setup used in this work fig 1 consists of a feed tank polluted water a peristaltic pump for continuous flow of concentrated nitrate into the photoreactor with the volume of 3 7 l a ro module dow filmtec tw30 1812 50 and a treated water storage tank the photoreactor was irradiated with a visible light lamp 36 w at the center of the vessel and dual row high voltage led strip light lamps twisted uniformly around it furthermore the graphene ag n tio2 ti platinum and silver silver chloride electrodes were placed in the photoreactor during the continuous membrane photoreactor process the raw nitrate solution was continuously pumped to the visible light photoelectrocatalytic reactor and the treated solution was pumped into the ro module for the separation of remained and unreduced nitrate ions from water the concentrated nitrate solution was recycled to the photoelectrocatalytic reactor for complete reduction the nitrate concentration in the photoelectrocatalytic reactor was determined using the method described in section 2 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the photocatalyst with pondering the appearance of the catalyst the color of the tio2 after modification changed from its original white to yellow for n tio2 and gray for graphene ag n tio2 this indicates a red shifted light absorption to the visible region to evaluate this observation the uv vis drs of the tio2 n tio2 and graphene ag n tio2 samples were taken based on the results shown in fig 2 n tio2 shows a photo absorption in the visible light range in comparison to undoped tio2 which can be related to the nitrogen atoms introduced into the tio2 lattice moreover with comparison the drs of n tio2 and graphene ag n tio2 samples a strong photo absorption is seen in the visible light range for graphene ag n tio2 it can be due to the presence of graphene and ag particles which can result in low energy transitions within the n tio2 and consequently enhance in visible light photocatalytic activity furthermore by using kubelka munk function 27 the band gap amounts of 3 1 2 9 and 2 7 ev were determined to tio2 n tio2 and graphene ag n tio2 respectively fig 3 shows the xrd pattern of graphene ag n tio2 peak values at 2θ of 25 3 37 0 37 8 38 6 48 2 54 7 55 1 and 62 6 can be ascribed to the 101 103 004 112 200 105 211 and 118 planes of the tio2 anatase crystalline jcpds card 04 0477 28 29 the peaks at 2θ values of 26 6 44 6 and 57 3 are corresponded to tio2 rutile 110 210 220 planes jcpds card 34 0180 30 ag crystalline phase peaks detected at 2θ values equal to 38 3 44 4 64 7 and 77 6 are corresponded to 111 200 220 and 311 planes respectively jcpds card 87 0717 the main peak of graphene nanoplatelets at 2θ 26 was not observed in the xrd pattern 30 it probably is hidden behind the main peak of anatase tio2 at 25 3 furthermore the results approved that the presence of nitrogen and graphene could not change the crystalline structure of tio2 fig 4 a shows the sem image of graphene ag n tio2 ti nanocomposite as shown in the figure there is a uniform distribution of particles on the ti plate indicating that the epd has been successfully performed in this work as shown in fig 4a most of the particles were smaller than 40 nm edx analysis based on the sem was used to identify the elements in the structure of the graphene ag n tio2 ti fig 4 b the results reveal the presence of silver 18 5 oxygen 22 1 titanium 51 2 nitrogen 0 8 and carbon 7 4 in the nanocomposite which approve that the graphene ag and n tio2 were immobilized on the titanium grid sheet through the epd method the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm was used to characterize the pore structure of the prepared composite the obtained n2 adsorption desorption isotherm matches well the type iv isotherm as classified by the iupac because hysteresis occurred during the desorption branches fig 5 14 31 this describes strongly interactions between adsorbate and adsorbent the hysteresis loop can be attributed to its mesoporous structure the calculated specific surface area and total pore volume p p0 0 990 of the graphene ag n tio2 nanocomposite as obtained by the bet equation were 37 896 m2 g and 0 174 cm3 g respectively the mesoporous volume was found by barrett joyner halenda bjh equation as 0 173 cm3 g comparison of the total pore volume and mesoporous volume of the graphene ag n tio2 nanocomposite confirms that the structure of the catalyst contains the mesoporous predominantly 3 2 photoelectrocatalytic reduction of nitrate 3 2 1 effect of initial ph to identify the impact of ph changes on the nitrate reduction by the visible light photoelectrocatalysis some experiments were conducted using the conditions including initial nitrate concentration of 50 mg l when the ph was kept around acidic or neutral or alkaline conditions during the reaction the residence time of 120 min applied potential of 1 5 v and three visible light lamps as can be seen from fig 6 there is no noticeable nitrate reduction at ph 4 and ph 10 while the highest nitrate removal efficiency was obtained at ph 7 as the neutral ph since hcl or naoh solutions were used to ph adjustment this observation can be attributed to the competitive effect between the electrolyte ions and no3 in solution to catch the light induced electrons in this situations the number of electrons transferred to the surface of nanocomposite may be restricted and lead to decrease in nitrate reduction efficiency while at neural ph there is no competitive effect or electrostatic repulsion due to the balancing of ions similar results were reported in studies on the electrochemical removal of nitrate li et al used nanosheet structured co3o4 ti for electrochemical removal of nitrate at neutral ph and observed nearly 100 nitrate removal at 45 c and current of 0 16 a for 240 min 32 furthermore the highest nitrate removal of 87 5 was obtained at the current density of 6 ma cm 2 at 4 h and in neutral ph by gao et al using cu bi electrode through the electrocatalytic reduction 33 3 2 2 effect of bias potential in the photoelectrocatalytic process a constant potential is applied between the working and the reference electrodes to prevent e h recombination in this part the effect of the applied bias potential in the range of 0 to 1 5 v just before the hydrogen evolution reaction was investigated on nitrate removal by the visible light photoelectrocatalysis the experiments were done by using three graphene ag n tio2 ti electrodes initial nitrate concentration of 50 mg l ph of 7 and 120 min residence time according to the obtained results fig 7 it was found that rising the applied bias potential to 1 5 v caused more nitrate removal efficiency this trend may be explained by the ability of graphene ag n tio2 ti electrode in the photoelectrocatalytic reduction process and positive role of bias potential on the process efficiency applying more bias potential to the graphene ag n tio2 ti electrode may lead to trap more h which developed by irradiating the semiconductor with the visible light and consequently increase the number of electrons that are ready to reduce the nitrate ions 25 34 3 2 3 effect of the catalyst surface area the effect of the graphene ag n tio2 ti surface area on the photoelectrocatalytic reduction of nitrate was studied through the variation in the number of the catalyst electrodes while the other parameters were kept constant initial nitrate concentration of 50 mg l ph of 7 potential of 1 5 v and residence time of 120 min as shown in fig 8 an increase in the nitrate removal efficiency was obtained by increasing the electrode number with increase in the electrode number or the other words with the development in the surface area the number of active sites and consequently the number of absorbed photons increases leading to an enhancement in the e h pair production which ultimately improves nitrate removal efficiency 35 3 2 4 effect of irradiation power increasing the number of visible light lamps from 1 to 3 were investigated in order to evaluate the influence of the irradiation power in the photoelectrocatalytic reduction of nitrate as shown in fig 9 with using two lamps increase in irradiation power nitrate reduction efficiency was increased in reactions involved photocatalysts the pollutant removal efficiency is strongly depends on the amount of radiation photons reaches to the catalyst surface in fact with adding the number of lamps the number of photons reaching to the photocatalyst surface increases which causes to produce more e h pairs 24 however with using three lamps instead of two and rising the irradiation power the nitrate removal efficiency grew slightly with more increase in the irradiation power more e h pairs are formed and the recombination is reduced which brings less dependence of photoelectrocatalytic removal efficiency to irradiation power 25 3 3 stability of the graphene ag n tio2 ti nanocomposite to investigate the stability of the graphene ag n tio2 ti nanocomposite it was subjected to five recycles nitrate reduction using the photoelectrocatalytic process at the optimum conditions including ph of 7 three graphene ag n tio2 ti three lamps and applied potential of 1 5 v according to the results of the experiments fig 10 the nanocomposite can be judged to have relatively outstanding durability in water for extended service time in the photoelectrocatalytic process 3 4 comparison of different processes in nitrate removal the ability of different processes such as sorption photocatalysis electrocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis in nitrate removal was compared in fig 11 the photoelectrocatalytic process was conducted at the optimum conditions of initial ph of 7 with using three graphene ag n tio2 ti electrodes three visible light lamps and applied potential of 1 5 v for 120 min the experimental conditions for photocatalysis electrocatalysis and sorption were similar to those of the photoelectrocatalysis in the absence of the electric field light irradiation and both of them respectively the order of nitrate reduction efficiency using different processes was as follows photoelectrocatalysis electrocatalysis photocatalysis sorption as can be seen in fig 11 the sorption process conducted in dark resulted to only 8 nitrate removal since the stabilized nanocomposite does not have the photochemically and electrochemically activities in this process this result is only attributed to the sorbed nitrate to the surface of the nanocomposite furthermore the results showed that the photocatalytic process was not effective in nitrate reduction and the efficiency of the photocatalytic process is equal to that of the sorption it probably means that exciting the nanocomposite with using visible light irradiation alone without using any h scavenger would not be able to provide the enough e for nitrate reduction the slightly improvement in nitrate removal efficiency in the electrocatalytic process can be ascribed to apply the electric field which can prevent the recombination of produced e and h during the photocatalytic process in the photoelectrocatalytic process the synergy effect of the photocatalysis and electrocatalysis showed 77 more reduction in the removal efficiency in comparison to the simple photocatalytic process in fact applying potential can accelerate the separation of the e h more effectively on the other hand the photo generated electrons can transfer the electrons produced by external electric field more easily from interior to surface of the catalyst in order to reduce nitrate 36 therefore the photoelectrocatalytic process achieved the highest nitrate removal under the similar experimental conditions compared to the other processes 3 5 nitrate reduction products in order to monitor the concentration of nitrate reduction products the photoelectrocatalytic test with nitrate initial concentration of 50 mg l ph 7 three nanocomposite electrodes three visible light lamps and bias potential of 1 5 v was conducted and the initial and final concentrations of no3 nh4 and no2 were measured according to the obtained results shown in fig 12 after 120 min the remaining concentration of no3 is 8 mg l which concludes that 33 of this pollutant was reduced to no2 and nh4 this indicates more than 50 of no3 reduction products are volatile compounds such as n2 and n2o which can be get out of the water in fact this approves the ability of the photoelectrocatalytic reduction process in irreversible reductive removal of nitrate from water 3 6 effect of photoelectrocatalytic process in continuous membrane photoreactor after investigating the ability of the graphene ag n tio2 ti nanocomposite in reduction of nitrate from aqueous solution through the visible light photoelectrocatalysis the catalyst was used in the continuous membrane photoreactor including photoelectrocatalytic reactor and ro membrane to evaluate the effect of photoelectrocatalytic process on nitrate elimination in concentrated output of the ro membrane in the operating conditions used in this section nine graphene ag n tio2 ti electrodes 5 15 cm2 were applied with bias potential of 1 5 v ph 7 with various nitrate flow rates 480 and 720 ml h based on the experiments results not shown in fig 13 the solo continuous ro process could eliminate nitrate concentration from 50 to 5 5 mg l with measuring the concentration of nitrate in permeate however as shown in fig 13 the nitrate concentration in concentrated output retentate solution of the solo continuous ro process increased over time with involving the photoelectrocatalytic process in the continuous membrane photoreactor as it is observed in fig 13 the nitrate concentration in the concentrated output was kept constant or increased slightly over time which depends on the nitrate flow rate raising nitrate flow rate in the continuous membrane photoreactor has a negative effect because the photoelectrocatalytic process may have not enough time to reduce the pollutant however the photoelectrocatalytic reduction ro process reduced more nitrate in concentrated output in comparison to solo ro even by recycling the solution these results indicate that the integration of the photoelectrocatalytic reduction process with the ro process has potential to solve the main problem of ro that is condensation of pollutant in the concentrated output through the reclamation of the concentrated nitrate 4 conclusions the present work shows the effect of different variables on the removal efficiency of nitrate during the visible light photoelectrocatalytic reduction process using graphene ag n tio2 ti as catalyst comparison of photoelectrocatalysis with sorption photocatalysis and electrocatalysis confirms the synergistic effect of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis in nitrate reduction the results of complementary experiments show that the integration of the photoelectrocatalytic reduction process with ro led to control the nitrate concentration in the retentate of the ro through more reduction of nitrate in the photoreactor therefore the photoelectrocatalytic reduction ro has a potential to use as a new and effective process for removal of nitrate from water declaration of competing interest the authors

gray for graphene ag n tio2 this indicates a red shifted light absorption to the visible region to evaluate this observation the uv vis drs of the tio2 n tio2 and graphene ag n tio2 samples were taken based on the results shown in fig 2 n tio2 shows a photo absorption in the visible light range in comparison to undoped tio2 which can be related to the nitrogen atoms introduced into the tio2 lattice moreover with comparison the drs of n tio2 and graphene ag n tio2 samples a strong photo absorption is seen in the visible light range for graphene ag n tio2 it can be due to the presence of graphene and ag particles which can result in low energy transitions within the n tio2 and consequently enhance in visible light photocatalytic activity furthermore by using kubelka munk function 27 the band gap amounts of 3 1 2 9 and 2 7 ev were determined to tio2 n tio2 and graphene ag n tio2 respectively fig 3 shows the xrd pattern of graphene ag n tio2 peak values at 2θ of 25 3 37 0 37 8 38 6 48 2 54 7 55 1 and 62 6 can be ascribed to the 101 103 004 112 200 105 211 and 118 planes of the tio2 anatase crystalline jcpds card 04 0477 28 29 the peaks at 2θ values of 26 6 44 6 and 57 3 are corresponded to tio2 rutile 110 210 220 planes jcpds card 34 0180 30 ag crystalline phase peaks detected at 2θ values equal to 38 3 44 4 64 7 and 77 6 are corresponded to 111 200 220 and 311 planes respectively jcpds card 87 0717 the main peak of graphene nanoplatelets at 2θ 26 was not observed in the xrd pattern 30 it probably is hidden behind the main peak of anatase tio2 at 25 3 furthermore the results approved that the presence of nitrogen and graphene could not change the crystalline structure of tio2 fig 4 a shows the sem image of graphene ag n tio2 ti nanocomposite as shown in the figure there is a uniform distribution of particles on the ti plate indicating that the epd has been successfully performed in this work as shown in fig 4a most of the particles were smaller than 40 nm edx analysis based on the sem was used to identify the elements in the structure of the graphene ag n tio2 ti fig 4 b the results reveal the presence of silver 18 5 oxygen 22 1 titanium 51 2 nitrogen 0 8 and carbon 7 4 in the nanocomposite which approve that the graphene ag and n tio2 were immobilized on the titanium grid sheet through the epd method the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm was used to characterize the pore structure of the prepared composite the obtained n2 adsorption desorption isotherm matches well the type iv isotherm as classified by the iupac because hysteresis occurred during the desorption branches fig 5 14 31 this describes strongly interactions between adsorbate and adsorbent the hysteresis loop can be attributed to its mesoporous structure the calculated specific surface area and total pore volume p p0 0 990 of the graphene ag n tio2 nanocomposite as obtained by the bet equation were 37 896 m2 g and 0 174 cm3 g respectively the mesoporous volume was found by barrett joyner halenda bjh equation as 0 173 cm3 g comparison of the total pore volume and mesoporous volume of the graphene ag n tio2 nanocomposite confirms that the structure of the catalyst contains the mesoporous predominantly 3 2 photoelectrocatalytic reduction of nitrate 3 2 1 effect of initial ph to identify the impact of ph changes on the nitrate reduction by the visible light photoelectrocatalysis some experiments were conducted using the conditions including initial nitrate concentration of 50 mg l when the ph was kept around acidic or neutral or alkaline conditions during the reaction the residence time of 120 min applied potential of 1 5 v and three visible light lamps as can be seen from fig 6 there is no noticeable nitrate reduction at ph 4 and ph 10 while the highest nitrate removal efficiency was obtained at ph 7 as the neutral ph since hcl or naoh solutions were used to ph adjustment this observation can be attributed to the competitive effect between the electrolyte ions and no3 in solution to catch the light induced electrons in this situations the number of electrons transferred to the surface of nanocomposite may be restricted and lead to decrease in nitrate reduction efficiency while at neural ph there is no competitive effect or electrostatic repulsion due to the balancing of ions similar results were reported in studies on the electrochemical removal of nitrate li et al used nanosheet structured co3o4 ti for electrochemical removal of nitrate at neutral ph and observed nearly 100 nitrate removal at 45 c and current of 0 16 a for 240 min 32 furthermore the highest nitrate removal of 87 5 was obtained at the current density of 6 ma cm 2 at 4 h and in neutral ph by gao et al using cu bi electrode through the electrocatalytic reduction 33 3 2 2 effect of bias potential in the photoelectrocatalytic process a constant potential is applied between the working and the reference electrodes to prevent e h recombination in this part the effect of the applied bias potential in the range of 0 to 1 5 v just before the hydrogen evolution reaction was investigated on nitrate removal by the visible light photoelectrocatalysis the experiments were done by using three graphene ag n tio2 ti electrodes initial nitrate concentration of 50 mg l ph of 7 and 120 min residence time according to the obtained results fig 7 it was found that rising the applied bias potential to 1 5 v caused more nitrate removal efficiency this trend may be explained by the ability of graphene ag n tio2 ti electrode in the photoelectrocatalytic reduction process and positive role of bias potential on the process efficiency applying more bias potential to the graphene ag n tio2 ti electrode may lead to trap more h which developed by irradiating the semiconductor with the visible light and consequently increase the number of electrons that are ready to reduce the nitrate ions 25 34 3 2 3 effect of the catalyst surface area the effect of the graphene ag n tio2 ti surface area on the photoelectrocatalytic reduction of nitrate was studied through the variation in the number of the catalyst electrodes while the other parameters were kept constant initial nitrate concentration of 50 mg l ph of 7 potential of 1 5 v and residence time of 120 min as shown in fig 8 an increase in the nitrate removal efficiency was obtained by increasing the electrode number with increase in the electrode number or the other words with the development in the surface area the number of active sites and consequently the number of absorbed photons increases leading to an enhancement in the e h pair production which ultimately improves nitrate removal efficiency 35 3 2 4 effect of irradiation power increasing the number of visible light lamps from 1 to 3 were investigated in order to evaluate the influence of the irradiation power in the photoelectrocatalytic reduction of nitrate as shown in fig 9 with using two lamps increase in irradiation power nitrate reduction efficiency was increased in reactions involved photocatalysts the pollutant removal efficiency is strongly depends on the amount of radiation photons reaches to the catalyst surface in fact with adding the number of lamps the number of photons reaching to the photocatalyst surface increases which causes to produce more e h pairs 24 however with using three lamps instead of two and rising the irradiation power the nitrate removal efficiency grew slightly with more increase in the irradiation power more e h pairs are formed and the recombination is reduced which brings less dependence of photoelectrocatalytic removal efficiency to irradiation power 25 3 3 stability of the graphene ag n tio2 ti nanocomposite to investigate the stability of the graphene ag n tio2 ti nanocomposite it was subjected to five recycles nitrate reduction using the photoelectrocatalytic process at the optimum conditions including ph of 7 three graphene ag n tio2 ti three lamps and applied potential of 1 5 v according to the results of the experiments fig 10 the nanocomposite can be judged to have relatively outstanding durability in water for extended service time in the photoelectrocatalytic process 3 4 comparison of different processes in nitrate removal the ability of different processes such as sorption photocatalysis electrocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis in nitrate removal was compared in fig 11 the photoelectrocatalytic process was conducted at the optimum conditions of initial ph of 7 with using three graphene ag n tio2 ti electrodes three visible light lamps and applied potential of 1 5 v for 120 min the experimental conditions for photocatalysis electrocatalysis and sorption were similar to those of the photoelectrocatalysis in the absence of the electric field light irradiation and both of them respectively the order of nitrate reduction efficiency using different processes was as follows photoelectrocatalysis electrocatalysis photocatalysis sorption as can be seen in fig 11 the sorption process conducted in dark resulted to only 8 nitrate removal since the stabilized nanocomposite does not have the photochemically and electrochemically activities in this process this result is only attributed to the sorbed nitrate to the surface of the nanocomposite furthermore the results showed that the photocatalytic process was not effective in nitrate reduction and the efficiency of the photocatalytic process is equal to that of the sorption it probably means that exciting the nanocomposite with using visible light irradiation alone without using any h scavenger would not be able to provide the enough e for nitrate reduction the slightly improvement in nitrate removal efficiency in the electrocatalytic process can be ascribed to apply the electric field which can prevent the recombination of produced e and h during the photocatalytic process in the photoelectrocatalytic process the synergy effect of the photocatalysis and electrocatalysis showed 77 more reduction in the removal efficiency in comparison to the simple photocatalytic process in fact applying potential can accelerate the separation of the e h more effectively on the other hand the photo generated electrons can transfer the electrons produced by external electric field more easily from interior to surface of the catalyst in order to reduce nitrate 36 therefore the photoelectrocatalytic process achieved the highest nitrate removal under the similar experimental conditions compared to the other processes 3 5 nitrate reduction products in order to monitor the concentration of nitrate reduction products the photoelectrocatalytic test with nitrate initial concentration of 50 mg l ph 7 three nanocomposite electrodes three visible light lamps and bias potential of 1 5 v was conducted and the initial and final concentrations of no3 nh4 and no2 were measured according to the obtained results shown in fig 12 after 120 min the remaining concentration of no3 is 8 mg l which concludes that 33 of this pollutant was reduced to no2 and nh4 this indicates more than 50 of no3 reduction products are volatile compounds such as n2 and n2o which can be get out of the water in fact this approves the ability of the photoelectrocatalytic reduction process in irreversible reductive removal of nitrate from water 3 6 effect of photoelectrocatalytic process in continuous membrane photoreactor after investigating the ability of the graphene ag n tio2 ti nanocomposite in reduction of nitrate from aqueous solution through the visible light photoelectrocatalysis the catalyst was used in the continuous membrane photoreactor including photoelectrocatalytic reactor and ro membrane to evaluate the effect of photoelectrocatalytic process on nitrate elimination in concentrated output of the ro membrane in the operating conditions used in this section nine graphene ag n tio2 ti electrodes 5 15 cm2 were applied with bias potential of 1 5 v ph 7 with various nitrate flow rates 480 and 720 ml h based on the experiments results not shown in fig 13 the solo continuous ro process could eliminate nitrate concentration from 50 to 5 5 mg l with measuring the concentration of nitrate in permeate however as shown in fig 13 the nitrate concentration in concentrated output retentate solution of the solo continuous ro process increased over time with involving the photoelectrocatalytic process in the continuous membrane photoreactor as it is observed in fig 13 the nitrate concentration in the concentrated output was kept constant or increased slightly over time which depends on the nitrate flow rate raising nitrate flow rate in the continuous membrane photoreactor has a negative effect because the photoelectrocatalytic process may have not enough time to reduce the pollutant however the photoelectrocatalytic reduction ro process reduced more nitrate in concentrated output in comparison to solo ro even by recycling the solution these results indicate that the integration of the photoelectrocatalytic reduction process with the ro process has potential to solve the main problem of ro that is condensation of pollutant in the concentrated output through the reclamation of the concentrated nitrate 4 conclusions the present work shows the effect of different variables on the removal efficiency of nitrate during the visible light photoelectrocatalytic reduction process using graphene ag n tio2 ti as catalyst comparison of photoelectrocatalysis with sorption photocatalysis and electrocatalysis confirms the synergistic effect of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis in nitrate reduction the results of complementary experiments show that the integration of the photoelectrocatalytic reduction process with ro led to control the nitrate concentration in the retentate of the ro through more reduction of nitrate in the photoreactor therefore the photoelectrocatalytic reduction ro has a potential to use as a new and effective process for removal of nitrate from water declaration of competing interest the authors

13676,currently little information is available on how the particle size would influence the physicochemical characteristics nitrogen conversion activity and microbial community in the anammox sludge granules this study was targeting to answer the question by studying anammox granular sludge with average particle sizes ranging from 0 5 1 0 1 0 1 5 1 5 2 0 and 2 0 mm results indicated that the wet density and settling velocity were positively correlated with particle size however the volatile suspended sludge suspended sludge vss ss ratio and particle integrity coefficient ic decreased with an increase in particle size the granular sludge with a particle size of 1 0 1 5 mm had the largest extracellular polymeric substances eps content and protein polysaccharide pn ps ratio the removal efficiency of ammonium and nitrite as well as the specific anammox activity saa increased with an increase in particle size high throughput sequencing showed that the richness and diversity of the microbial community decreased firstly and then increased with an increase in particle size the granular sludge with a particle size of 1 0 1 5 mm had the lowest diversity but that of 0 5 1 0 mm had the largest biomass and relative abundance values of anammox bacteria the granular sludge size should be controlled below 1 5 mm to maintain the predominant microorganisms of anammox bacteria while particle sizes of 1 5 2 0 mm should be selected to maintain high nitrogen removal performance keywords anammox granular sludge physicochemical characteristics particle size microbial community 1 introduction the anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox is one of the hot spots in the autotrophic nitrogen removal process compared to the traditional nitrification denitrification process anammox is a green and environmentally friendly alternative with lower energy consumption less sludge production and no addition of external organic carbon 1 the anammox process is driven by the anammox autotrophic bacteria with a low growth rate e g the maximum specific growth rate 0 0027 h 1 only and a doubling time 10 12 d 2 to maintain high nitrogen removal efficiency the anammox reactor must keep a high sludge concentration therefore the anammox granular sludge was being the most important form to maintain higher biomass in the reactor compared with the flocculent sludge the anammox sludge granules provide high sludge settling velocities ensuring a high biomass retention and utilization of relatively small reactors costs and footprint and so on 3 4 the anammox granular sludge was reported to be competent in achieving the highest average nitrogen removal efficiency of 81 1 which were 80 8 and 74 1 in biofilm and flocs respectively in the anammox reactor 5 the nitrogen removal rate nrr and specific anammox activity saa could dramatically reach 74 3 76 7 kg n m3 d and 42 0 57 7 g vss l in the anammox granular sludge uasb reactor 6 the particle size of anammox sludge granules directly affects the sedimentation performance there are certain restrictions and obstacles for microorganisms in the granular sludge with a larger particle size to obtain the substrate from the bulk solution the sewage the internal microorganisms maybe starve to death due to lack of substrate which may lead to the formation of cavities inside the granular sludge and make sludge granules floating in the reactor s supernatant 7 on the other hand the larger anammox granules could provide a larger specific surface area for microorganisms to contact with the substrate and could have a better resistance to temperature or nitrogenous shock loading leading to a better reaction performance 8 the particle size distribution was reported to have a clear impact on the conversion efficiency of nitrogen in a partial nitritation anammox granular sludge system because of the effect of the granular size on the competition between nitrite oxidizing and anammox bacteria as well as on the interaction among granules in terms of solutes exchange 9 for different anammox sludge granules including large size 1 2 mm medium size 0 6 1 2 mm and small size 0 6 mm large differences were observed in physical characteristics and microbial population distribution these granules particularly in the medium and large granular sludge had desert regions abandoned by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and anammox bacteria due to lack of nutrients 7 when the anammox granular sludge sizes was 0 5 0 9 mm the anammox bacterial abundance activity and specific anammox rate could be enhanced 10 the bacteria activity granule stability and shock resistance capacity of anammox granule sludge within the size range of 1 0 1 5 mm were found superior to that of 0 5 1 0 mm and above 1 5 mm respectively 8 the anammox granules should be controlled at lower than 2 20 mm to avoid the granule floatation 11 despite the aforementioned knowledge information is not enough on the influence of particle sizes of anammox sludge granules on the physicochemical characteristics nitrogen conversion activity and microbial community therefore the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of different particle sizes of anammox granules on 1 the physicochemical characteristics vss ss sedimentation performance apparent characteristics mechanical strength eps and content distribution etc 2 anammox activity of granular sludge with different particle sizes and 3 the microbial community of anammox granular sludge and to establish the relationships among these properties with respect to the particle size of anammox sludge granules 2 materials and methods 2 1 anammox granular sludge source the anammox granular sludge was taken from a bench scale expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor made of plexiglass the effective volume of the reactor was about 1 7 l with a height to diameter ratio of 10 1 the outer layer of the reactor had a water bath jacket to keep the temperature at 32 1 the hydraulic retention time was 2 8 h with an ascensional velocity of 4 0 m h the tn removal efficiency was 88 7 when the influent nitrite and ammonium were 329 4 and 295 5 mg l with a nitrogen removal loading rate of 5 17 kg n m3 d the egsb reactor was operated for 384 d before sampling without discharging the residual sludge the size of anammox granule sludge arranged for 0 5 0 5 1 0 1 0 1 5 1 5 2 0 and 2 0 mm were accounted for 2 69 37 81 44 33 6 53 and 8 64 respectively the anammox granular sludge was washed 3 times with phosphate buffer solution 10 and the sludge water mixture was left standing for 1 h to remove the residual substance on the surface of the granular sludge the anammox granular sludge was sieved with 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mm aperture screens 35 18 self restraint and 10 mesh sieve to obtain four groups of anammox granular sludge with a particle size range of 0 5 1 0 1 0 1 5 1 5 2 0 and 2 0 mm and labeled as r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively three parallel samples were set up for the analysis of physiochemical characteristics of anammox granular sludge throughout the study 2 2 physiochemical characteristics analysis method 1 the macroscopic morphological characteristics of the anammox granular sludge were recorded by the iphone 8 rear camera and the microscopic morphological and structural characteristics were analyzed by a microbial optical microscope olympus cx41 japan 2 the settling velocity was calculated by recording the time taken for each particle to fall from the measuring cylinder at a height of 28 mm 8 each particle size range r1 to r4 was done 15 times 3 the wet density was expressed by the mass ratio of equal volume of sludge to distilled water and the calculation formula was as follows 12 granular sludge wet density ρ gs g c m 3 m 3 m 1 m 2 m 1 m 4 m 3 ρ w where m1 empty weight of centrifuge tube g m2 centrifuge tube weighs filled with water g m3 centrifuge tube after centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 5 min and discarding the supernatant g m4 centrifuge tube after filling with water and sludge g ρw water density at room temperature g cm3 4 the instability coefficient of anammox granular sludge was determined by a method for detecting the strength of granular sludge 13 took 5 0 g of wet granular sludge and rinsed it by 3 times put the rinsed granular sludge in a 100 ml beaker and set the volume to 50 ml with ultrapure water put the beaker containing water and granular sludge in a ultrasonic instrument ultrasonic cell crusher scientz iid and placed the ultrasonic probe 2 cm below the liquid level set the alarm temperature ultrasonic frequency ultrasonic power at 26 20 khz and 65 w and used the 10 s on and 10 s off intermittent ultrasound mode after ultrasonic treatment sampled 3 ml of liquid at a fixed height each minute and measure the absorbance of samples obtained at different time points 10 times in the whole experiment with a visible spectrophotometer u t1810 yipu shanghai at a wavelength of 600 nm performed linear fitting of the absorbance data vs time and the slope of the linear equation was the instability coefficient 13 the larger value of the instability coefficient indicates the anammox granular sludge is more easily broken by ultrasonic waves and thus has a lower mechanical strength 5 integrity coefficient of anammox granular sludge took 5 ml of sludge water mixture in a 50 ml centrifuge tube diluted to 30 ml and mixed with a vortex mixer xw 80a for 2 min and settled for 1 min the dry weights of the settled granules mlss2 and the residual granules mlss1 in the supernatant were measured 14 the specific calculation formula of integrity coefficient ic was i c m l s s 2 m l s s 1 m l s s 2 6 the eps was the sum of protein pn and polysaccharide ps with a unit of mg g 1 calculated by vss which was extracted by the formaldehyde naoh method the protein content was determined by the lowry method and the bovine serum protein was used as the standard substance the polysaccharide content was determined by the phenol sulfuric acid method and glucose was used as the standard substance 15 7 anammox activity of anammox granular sludge the ammonium and nitrite in artificial simulated wastewater were obtained by adding nh4cl and nano2 and the initial concentration was all 50 mg l together with 1 mg l trace element solutions i and ii 16 to make deaerated wastewater disposed 1 l of artificial simulated wastewater contained 60 mg l of ammonium and 60 mg l of nitrite and aerated with nitrogen gas 95 for 30 min to remove dissolved oxygen do added 10 g of wet anammox granular sludge to the brown feed bottle with a volume of 100 ml and injected 100 ml of deaerated wastewater connected the two way sampling cover with a rubber tube to seal placed the feeding bottle on the gas bath shaker set the temperature to 32 in the shaker and controlled the shaker speed to 120 rpm took samples every 1 h to determine the ammonium and nitrite concentration of water samples the saa gn gvssd of sludge was calculated by the substrate concentration degradation curve 6 the ammonium and nitrite were analyzed using the standard methods 17 and each sample was analyzed twice as parallel analysis further fitting verifies the linear relationship of ln c c0 t that is ln c c 0 kt t was the reaction time h c0 was the initial concentration of ammonium and nitrite the c was the concentration of ammonium and nitrite after t hours 2 3 determination of microbial community here the anammox granular sludge of different sizes samples r1 r2 r3 r4 were stored at 80 c until dna extraction microbial dna was extracted from different granular sludge samples using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s the extraction was performed according to the manufacturer s instructions the concentrations and quality of dna samples were measured using a nano drop nd 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific ma usa the v3 v4 region of the bacteria 16s ribosomal rna gene was amplified with the primers 338 f 5 actcctacgggag gcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the pcr products which was contained adapter and barcode were quantized by a quant it dsdna hs reagent and then pooled together equally for each sample the nucleic acid extraction and illumina miseq sequencing were according by chen et al 18 19 the sequencing was performed with the illumina hiseq 2500 platform 2 250 paired ends at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china 2 4 multivariate statistical analysis the multivariate statistical analysis between miseq data and seven different physicochemical characteristics particle size wet density settling velocity vss ss eps saa ic of anammox granular sludge under different particle sizes were performed with canoco 5 biometris plant research international wageningen nl 20 redundancy analysis rda at the genus level was also conducted to reflect the relationship between different granular sludge characters and microbial functional groups which can be seen intuitively from the analysis results the rare genus less than 0 5 was excluded from the rda analysis the significance of each anammox granular sludge character on the microbial community was evaluated using the monte carlo permutation test 999 replicates the pearson s correlation between two environmental parameters under different terms was performed using the software spss 18 0 21 3 results and discussion 3 1 physiochemical characteristics of anammox granular sludge with different particle sizes as shown in table 1 the average particle diameters of the four groups of granular sludge were 0 75 1 28 1 83 and 2 67 mm respectively the vss ss representing the ratio of biological organic matter to total solid components was between 0 40 0 51 and gradually decreased with an increase in particle there were more inorganic components in large particles of anammox granular sludge an et al 2013 reported that the vss ss were 0 66 0 71 and 0 75 for anammox granular sludge sizes ranging from 0 5 1 0 mm 1 1 5 mm and above 1 5 mm respectively the difference in the vss ss ratio between this study and the one reported by an et al 2013 could be due to the cultivation environment and conditions of anammox granular sludge the wet density of the four anammox granular sludges was among 1 0489 1 0682 which was basically consistent with the previously reported ranges 1 0279 1 1352 13 the wet density of the granular sludge increased with an increase in particle size indicating that the large size granular sludge was denser than that of the small size one the granular sludge had a porous structure with air cavities and water channels inside the wet density of the granular sludge was affected by the three phase ratio of solid liquid and gas however the volume of gas pockets became larger and more porous with an increase in the diameter of anammox granules which would lower the density and settling velocity of the sludge granules 11 13 the settling velocity of the sludge granules was between 78 32 and 211 57 m h and increased with an increase in the average particle size which was consistent with the trend of wet density change the increasing size and density might result in a significant increase in settling velocity of granules 8 22 the particle size and wet density of granular sludge are important factors that affect the sedimentation performance the settling velocity is frequently greater when the particle size is larger 8 the settling velocity of anammox granular sludge was reported to be about 64 2 m h with the particle size of 1 33 2 50 mm 23 52 20 143 64 m h under different influent temperature salt and calcium concentrations 13 and 41 79 m h for the anammox granular sludge start up from a uasb at an ammonium removal efficiency of 94 and a loading rate of 0 064 kg n kg vss d 24 in this study the settling velocity of anammox granular sludge was above 78 32 m h and the sedimentation performance was better than those reported before as shown in fig 1 the anammox granular sludge had a uniform color which appeared light red or reddish brown for r1 and r2 and had remarkable different color for r3 an r4 including light red red dark red gray black and so on the surface of the grey granular sludge was covered with a layer of scale like inorganic substances presumably calcium precipitates the ca2 was always the most common and most abundant metal ions in the anammox granular sludge 8 the presence of metal ions such as ca2 mg2 and fe3 in the anammox granular sludge could effectively promote the granulation of anammox sludge 8 25 however metal ions such as ca2 easily combined with co3 2 so4 2 and po4 3 ions to form calcium precipitates the calcium concentration in the granules was increased by the calcium concentration of feed and also the calcium carbonate was the dominate calcium precipitate in the granules 26 in the process of domestication and cultivation of granular sludge the calcium precipitate process would reduce the percentage of organic matter as the particle size increases lowering reaction activity under the microscope the anammox sludge granules with different particle sizes were irregularly spherical with thicker biomass inside and wrapped by agar like extracellular polymer outside under long term interaction among bacteria substrates and environmental factors the anammox granular sludge could self select immobilize the microbial community and form a special structure 11 the anammox granular sludge had a recognizable cauliflower like appearance in some high rate anaerobic bioreactors 6 27 the higher mechanical strength was an important advantage of granular sludge over flocculent sludge the particles with higher mechanical strength could resist the shearing force of rising water and air bubbles while the particles with lower strength may loss biomass with a lower performance 13 the mechanical strength of granular sludge depends on the composition and interaction of the particulate components such as the microorganism structure eps composition and inorganic components as calcium adsorbed from wastewater etc 28 the instability coefficient and complete coefficient were usually used to characterize the mechanical strength of granular sludge the mechanical strength of granular sludge was higher with smaller instability coefficient or greater complete coefficient as shown in figure 2 a the instability coefficient of r1 r2 r3 and r4 were 0 061 0 0845 0 0753 and 0 0743 respectively the mechanical strength was in the order of r1 r3 r4 r2 however from the perspective of complete coefficients r1 r2 r3 and r4 were 99 86 99 16 97 22 and 96 25 respectively indicating that the complete coefficients decreased with an increase in particle size fig 2 a the mechanical strength of the granular sludge was different by calculating with instability coefficient and complete coefficients and the specific reason was still remained to be analyzed in the future in general the anammox granular sludge with a particle size of 0 5 1 0 mm r1 has the highest mechanical strength the total eps of r1 to r4 was 132 4 174 2 110 0 and 102 9 mg gvss fig 2 b the eps of anammox sludge could improve the flocculation the eps extraction could sharply decrease the flocculation efficiency of anammox sludge from 80 to 50 29 also the pn and ps are the key eps components of anammox bacteria 29 the contents of pn and ps indicated that the main component of eps was protein accounted for 70 97 79 22 of the total eps the pn ps ratios of r1 to r4 anammox granular sludge were 3 08 3 81 2 77 and 2 44 respectively there was a certain difference between the total eps and pn ps of anammox granular sludge in different reactors with different nitrogen loading the pn and ps contents in anammox sludge were determined to be 67 9 mg gvss and 25 3 mg gvss respectively 29 in addition the pn and ps were 42 7 6 5 and 83 2 7 9 mg gvss in an anammox granular sludge uasb reactor as well as 71 8 112 1 and 164 4 298 2 mg gvss in a high loaded anammox uasb reactors 6 24 the total eps and the pn ps ratio in this study were all ranked as r2 r1 r3 r4 showing that the anammox granular sludge with a particle size of 1 0 1 5 mm secreted more extracellular polymers in addition the pn ps ratio increased with eps increasing the physiochemical properties of anammox granular sludge came from the same egsb reactor under different particle sizes were quite different the different diameter of the anammox granular sludge was affected by the shape of the reactors hydrodynamic shear force and nitrogen loading rate nlr which caused completely different physiochemical properties 6 10 at the same time the different eps composition would directly affect the formation and particle sizes of the anammox granular sludge 29 3 2 anammox activity of granular sludge with different particle sizes the anammox activity was the main parameter for evaluating the nitrogen removal performance of granular sludge to explore the different nitrogen removal rates of anammox granular sludge with different particle sizes the nitrogen removal curves was tested with 100 ml of anaerobic feed bottle as shown in fig 3 the nitrite removal was slightly different from that for ammonium the nitrite was completely removed after 5 h for r1 and after about 4 h for r2 r4 fig 3 a ammonium removal efficiency of the granules with all the particle sizes reached up to 90 after 4 h fig 3 b the substrate degradation rate follows the first order decay reaction kinetics r2 0 91 fig 3 c and d from the 1st order kinetics of fitting curves of nitrite the r2 and r3 were consistent in the first 3 h and the degradation rate of r3 gradually exceeded that of r2 the r4 with larger particles had outstripped than other reactors in the first 5 h and decreased lower than r3 in the 6 h however the degradation rate of r1 was always the lowest during the whole experiment the ammonium degradation rate of r1 and r4 were similar as the nitrite in addition the ammonium degradation rate of r2 and r3 was fluctuated back in the first 4 h but r3 was exceeded r2 after 4 h throughout the experiment in summary the degradation rate increased with an increase in particle size r4 r3 r2 r1 as indicated by the reaction rate the maximum anammox activity was calculated according to the substrate degradation curve in the first 1 h showed in fig 3 the ammonium removal rate of r1 r2 r3 and r4 was 0 088 0 131 0 169 and 0 170 kg n kgvss d while the nitrite removal rate was 0 086 0 133 0 175 and 0 175 kg n kgvss d respectively the saa was 0 174 0 264 0 344 and 0 345 kg n kgvss d respectively fig 4 the calculation results showed that the activity of anammox granular sludge increased with particle size increasing while the growth rate of saa was slowed down with an increase in particle size up to now consistent information is not available on the influence of particle sizes of anammox sludge granules on the anammox reaction activity one common opinion is that the anammox reaction activity is higher for the particle with a smaller particle size as it has a larger specific surface area and higher mass transfer efficiency the optimal anammox granule sludge sizes were reported to be 0 5 0 9 mm for enhanced anammox bacterial abundance activity and specific anammox rate 10 another opinion is that the anammox granular sludge activity is mainly concentrated in the range of 1 mm near the granular surface and does not decrease with an increase in particle size 30 the third opinion states that the biofilm of the thickness of 0 2 0 3 mm on the surface of a large size anammox granular sludge is the most important part of anammox reaction 31 nevertheless contrary to the first two opinions the result of this research indicated that the larger the particle size of the granular sludge the higher the biological activity of the granule 3 3 microbial community of anammox granular sludge with different particles 3 3 1 diversity and abundance analysis the total sequence number of r1 r2 r3 and r4 was 42 123 50 352 table 2 the larger chao1 and ace index reflected the higher abundance of community 20 the results showed that both index decreased first and then increased with the particle size increasing r2 had the minimum value of the two indexes 1 0 1 5 the simpson and shannon index reflected the diversity of the sample community the simpson index decreased first and then increased as particle size increasing indicated that the proportion of dominant bacteria in the total biological microorganisms increased first and then decreased the shannon index was just the opposite which increased first and then decreased as the particle size increasing indicated that the complexity of the bacterial composition of the anammox granular sludge decreased first and then increased the alpha diversity analysis indicated that the anammox granular sludge had undergone great changes in the microbial community structure during the growth process and a single positive or negative correlation did not exist with the particle size increasing bacteria from larger granules above 1 5 mm exhibited a high diversity compared with those from smaller granules 0 5 1 5 mm 8 when the particle size of the granular sludge was cultivated to be 1 0 1 5 mm the community diversity of the granules was the lowest and the dominant bacterial community accounted for the largest proportion of overall biological microorganisms 3 3 2 comparison of microorganisms at phylum level the main microorganisms at the phylum level with different particle size were basically consistent including chloroflexi proteobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes firmicutes and actinobacteria fig 5 a the chloroflexi and proteobacteria were accounted for 30 8 38 3 27 5 24 3 and 27 8 25 1 37 1 27 6 of r1 r2 r3 r4 respectively the anammox bacteria belonged to the phytophthora phylum which accounted for 14 0 12 7 8 4 and 5 0 the proportion of planctomycetes decreased as the particle size increasing the phylum planctomycetes were 6 5 16 6 and 13 0 in the flocs 0 2 mm optimum particles 0 5 0 9 mm and the largest particles 2 0 2 5 mm of anammox samples respectively 10 results of this study have shown that the anammox bacteria belong to planctomycetes occupied a relatively high proportion in the smaller sized anammox granular sludge 0 5 1 0 mm in contrast the proportion of bacteroidetes increased from 6 2 11 6 with the particle size increasing 3 3 3 comparison of microorganisms at genus level the main abundance bacteria in anammox granules of different sizes were a bit different as shown in fig 5 b the main abundance bacteria were olb13 14 57 denitratisoma 12 03 sbr1031 10 88 candidatus brocadia 10 68 jg36 gs 52 3 48 limnobacter 3 32 and proteocatella 3 30 for r1 olb13 20 68 sbr1031 11 35 denitratisoma 10 44 candidatus brocadia 9 18 ignavibateria 3 80 ws6 dojkabateria 3 74 and proteocatella 3 30 for r2 pseudomonas 11 87 sbr1031 10 74 olb13 9 62 denitratisoma 7 22 candidatus brocadia 4 77 sporacetigenium 4 27 limnobacter 4 05 and ignavibateria 3 07 for r3 olb13 9 08 sbr1031 7 3 limnobacter 6 04 denitratisoma 4 36 ignavibateria 4 03 sporacetigenium 3 62 and candidatus brocadia 0 80 for r4 both olb13 and sbr1031 belonged to the chloroflexi phylum bacteria which were the focus microorganisms for anaerobic digestion 32 the denitratisoma was denitrifying bacteria which drive denitrification under the anoxic state by consuming organic carbon source 33 the anammox process would produce nitrate and there were also organic substances in the reactor after cell metabolism or microbial death which could be used by denitrifying bacteria to convert nitrate to n2 to improve nitrogen removal the limnobacter was often found in various environments such as surface seawater deep oceans human intestines volcanic sediments and so on 34 35 the ignavibacterium was a genus of chlorobi which belonged to strict anaerobic bacteria and had certain sulfur oxidation capacity 3 3 4 anammox bacteria abundance at genus level three anammox bacteria were detected in r1 r2 r3 and r4 using the miseq high throughput sequencing namely candidatus brocadia candidatus kuenenia and candidatus jettenia respectively table 3 the candidatus kuenenia and candidatus jettenia were only 0 4 0 7 and about 0 01 the candidatus brocadia was the dominant anammox bacteria with the highest abundance among the anammox granules with different sizes accounting for 10 68 9 18 4 77 and 0 80 of the microbial abundance in r1 0 5 1 0 mm r2 1 0 1 5 mm r3 1 5 2 0 mm and r4 2 0 mm respectively the anammox granular sludge with 0 5 1 5 mm particles was almost mainly contained candidatus brocadia bacteria though candidatus brocadia was still the predominant bacterium in the anammox granules higher than 1 5 mm particles and the candidatus jettenia and candidatus kuenenia were coexisted 8 the results showed that the abundance of anammox bacteria gradually decreased with the particle size increasing and the candidatus brocadia was always the dominant genus of anammox 3 3 5 connection between physiochemical characteristics and bacterial community in order to analyze the similarity of bacterial community and its correlation with different sludge characters the rda analysis of miseq data and seven different physicochemical characteristics were conducted at the genes level table 1 and fig 6 fig 6 indicates that r1 0 5 1 0 mm and r2 1 0 1 5 mm had a similar results that are quite different from r3 1 5 2 0 mm and r4 2 0 mm the anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia detected in the samples were correlated positively with eps ic and vss ss but negatively with wet density settling velocity particle size and saa 3 4 implications in the past research found that the dominant genus of anammox reactors was mainly candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia and there was generally only one dominant genus in an anammox system 36 the anammox diversity of the sludge of the wastewater treatment plant was quite different and which anammox organism s could be enriched might be determined by not only inoculation but also niche differentiation or other aspects e g composition and concentration of the feed substrate 37 the free ammonia concentration had different inhibitory effects on anammox bacteria genus but both candidatus kuenenia and brocadia species were present in the reactor with higher ammonia and nitrite concentrations 38 the candidatus brocadia cells were more susceptible to nitrite inhibition and thus were hard to be dominant in the anammox reactor at high nitrite levels 39 the population was shifted observely from candidatus brocadia to candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis in the anammox start up process in membrane bioreactor mbr which was presumably dued to the higher nitrite affinity of kuenenia 40 in this study the anammox granular sludge was taken from the same anammox egsb reactor fed with a high influent nitrite and ammonium concentration 329 4 and 295 5 mg l therefore the main genuses in the anammox granular sludge with different particle sizes were all candidatus brocadia which is consistent with the previous reports there were large differences in the microbial community structure of anammox granular sludge with different particle sizes 10 the diversity of bacterial and anammox bacteria were gradually increased by the particle size increasing 10 in addition the microbial community structure and biodiversity of different size granules in a partial nitritation anammox process was indicated that the larger granules particles was more diverse microbial communities than smaller 41 results of this study however demonstrated the opposite among the four different particle sizes the abundance of anammox bacteria was the largest in the granules of 0 5 1 0 mm in fact the granular sludge could be regarded as a special form of biofilm an increase in particle size was equivalent to an increase in the biofilm thickness which would inhibit the mass transfer efficiency of substances the lack of substrate would lead to metabolic difficulties or even microbial death usually the active depth of anammox granular sludge was within the top 0 2 0 3 mm of the granular surface 42 but could reach 0 8 mm depending on different bacterial species and hydraulic environmental conditions 43 the kinetic model simulated that 1 0 1 3 mm was the best size range for anammox granular sludge 44 results of this research demonstrated that the microbial community and nitrogen removal trend of anammox granular sludge were not uniform as a function of the particle size distribution probably because the mass transfer resistance increased with an increase in the granular size the granular sludge size should be controlled below 1 5 mm to maintain the predominant microorganisms and biomass of anammox bacteria while particle sizes of 1 5 2 0 mm should be selected to maintain high and stable nitrogen removal performance the smaller substance transfer distance may provide convenience for the growth and reproduction of anammox bacteria in the granular sludge 42 in addition the particle size range of anammox granular sludge could be adjusted according to actual needs for higher nitrogen removal efficiency or better precipitation efficiency by means of reactor rising velocity hydraulic shear force and so on moreover results of this study indicated that the anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia were correlated positively with eps ic and vss ss but negatively with wet density settling velocity particle size and saa the reasons for these correlations may be due to the high content of eps promoted the flocculation aggregation and higher stability of anammox bacteria and stimulated the better activity to increase vss ss 29 in addition the low content of eps would result in poor settling performance of anammox granular sludge however the high proportion of anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia brought lower saa for anammox granular sludge should be further studied in addition the abundance of anammox bacteria was decreased with the increase of particle size while the removal efficiencies of ammonium and nitrite as well as saa were increased with the increase of particle size the larger particles could significantly improve the performance of the anammox process because of the high abundance of anammox bacteria 9 however the dead zone would be formed in the anammox particles due to mass transfer in the larger particle size which would be resulting in the disintegration of anammox granular sludge 45 at present the direct cause of the opposite relationship between the anammox microbial abundance and nitrogen removal efficiency caused by particle size was still unknown it is hoped that further studies will be carried out in the follow up studies 4 conclusion the physicochemical characteristics of anammox granular sludge were closely related to the granular particle size both wet density and settling velocity were positively correlated with particle size however the vss ss ratio and particle integrity coefficient decreased with an increase in particle size the granular sludge with a particle size between 1 0 and 1 5 mm had the largest eps content and pn ps ratio the removal efficiency of ammonium and nitrite as well as the saa increased with an increase in particle size while the growth rate of saa was slowed down with an increase in particle size the richness and diversity of the microbial community decreased first and then increased with an increase in particle size the granular sludge had the lowest diversity for the particle size of 1 0 1 5 mm but the largest biomass and relative abundance values of anammox bacteria for the particle size of 0 5 1 0 mm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in

13676,currently little information is available on how the particle size would influence the physicochemical characteristics nitrogen conversion activity and microbial community in the anammox sludge granules this study was targeting to answer the question by studying anammox granular sludge with average particle sizes ranging from 0 5 1 0 1 0 1 5 1 5 2 0 and 2 0 mm results indicated that the wet density and settling velocity were positively correlated with particle size however the volatile suspended sludge suspended sludge vss ss ratio and particle integrity coefficient ic decreased with an increase in particle size the granular sludge with a particle size of 1 0 1 5 mm had the largest extracellular polymeric substances eps content and protein polysaccharide pn ps ratio the removal efficiency of ammonium and nitrite as well as the specific anammox activity saa increased with an increase in particle size high throughput sequencing showed that the richness and diversity of the microbial community decreased firstly and then increased with an increase in particle size the granular sludge with a particle size of 1 0 1 5 mm had the lowest diversity but that of 0 5 1 0 mm had the largest biomass and relative abundance values of anammox bacteria the granular sludge size should be controlled below 1 5 mm to maintain the predominant microorganisms of anammox bacteria while particle sizes of 1 5 2 0 mm should be selected to maintain high nitrogen removal performance keywords anammox granular sludge physicochemical characteristics particle size microbial community 1 introduction the anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox is one of the hot spots in the autotrophic nitrogen removal process compared to the traditional nitrification denitrification process anammox is a green and environmentally friendly alternative with lower energy consumption less sludge production and no addition of external organic carbon 1 the anammox process is driven by the anammox autotrophic bacteria with a low growth rate e g the maximum specific growth rate 0 0027 h 1 only and a doubling time 10 12 d 2 to maintain high nitrogen removal efficiency the anammox reactor must keep a high sludge concentration therefore the anammox granular sludge was being the most important form to maintain higher biomass in the reactor compared with the flocculent sludge the anammox sludge granules provide high sludge settling velocities ensuring a high biomass retention and utilization of relatively small reactors costs and footprint and so on 3 4 the anammox granular sludge was reported to be competent in achieving the highest average nitrogen removal efficiency of 81 1 which were 80 8 and 74 1 in biofilm and flocs respectively in the anammox reactor 5 the nitrogen removal rate nrr and specific anammox activity saa could dramatically reach 74 3 76 7 kg n m3 d and 42 0 57 7 g vss l in the anammox granular sludge uasb reactor 6 the particle size of anammox sludge granules directly affects the sedimentation performance there are certain restrictions and obstacles for microorganisms in the granular sludge with a larger particle size to obtain the substrate from the bulk solution the sewage the internal microorganisms maybe starve to death due to lack of substrate which may lead to the formation of cavities inside the granular sludge and make sludge granules floating in the reactor s supernatant 7 on the other hand the larger anammox granules could provide a larger specific surface area for microorganisms to contact with the substrate and could have a better resistance to temperature or nitrogenous shock loading leading to a better reaction performance 8 the particle size distribution was reported to have a clear impact on the conversion efficiency of nitrogen in a partial nitritation anammox granular sludge system because of the effect of the granular size on the competition between nitrite oxidizing and anammox bacteria as well as on the interaction among granules in terms of solutes exchange 9 for different anammox sludge granules including large size 1 2 mm medium size 0 6 1 2 mm and small size 0 6 mm large differences were observed in physical characteristics and microbial population distribution these granules particularly in the medium and large granular sludge had desert regions abandoned by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and anammox bacteria due to lack of nutrients 7 when the anammox granular sludge sizes was 0 5 0 9 mm the anammox bacterial abundance activity and specific anammox rate could be enhanced 10 the bacteria activity granule stability and shock resistance capacity of anammox granule sludge within the size range of 1 0 1 5 mm were found superior to that of 0 5 1 0 mm and above 1 5 mm respectively 8 the anammox granules should be controlled at lower than 2 20 mm to avoid the granule floatation 11 despite the aforementioned knowledge information is not enough on the influence of particle sizes of anammox sludge granules on the physicochemical characteristics nitrogen conversion activity and microbial community therefore the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of different particle sizes of anammox granules on 1 the physicochemical characteristics vss ss sedimentation performance apparent characteristics mechanical strength eps and content distribution etc 2 anammox activity of granular sludge with different particle sizes and 3 the microbial community of anammox granular sludge and to establish the relationships among these properties with respect to the particle size of anammox sludge granules 2 materials and methods 2 1 anammox granular sludge source the anammox granular sludge was taken from a bench scale expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor made of plexiglass the effective volume of the reactor was about 1 7 l with a height to diameter ratio of 10 1 the outer layer of the reactor had a water bath jacket to keep the temperature at 32 1 the hydraulic retention time was 2 8 h with an ascensional velocity of 4 0 m h the tn removal efficiency was 88 7 when the influent nitrite and ammonium were 329 4 and 295 5 mg l with a nitrogen removal loading rate of 5 17 kg n m3 d the egsb reactor was operated for 384 d before sampling without discharging the residual sludge the size of anammox granule sludge arranged for 0 5 0 5 1 0 1 0 1 5 1 5 2 0 and 2 0 mm were accounted for 2 69 37 81 44 33 6 53 and 8 64 respectively the anammox granular sludge was washed 3 times with phosphate buffer solution 10 and the sludge water mixture was left standing for 1 h to remove the residual substance on the surface of the granular sludge the anammox granular sludge was sieved with 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mm aperture screens 35 18 self restraint and 10 mesh sieve to obtain four groups of anammox granular sludge with a particle size range of 0 5 1 0 1 0 1 5 1 5 2 0 and 2 0 mm and labeled as r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively three parallel samples were set up for the analysis of physiochemical characteristics of anammox granular sludge throughout the study 2 2 physiochemical characteristics analysis method 1 the macroscopic morphological characteristics of the anammox granular sludge were recorded by the iphone 8 rear camera and the microscopic morphological and structural characteristics were analyzed by a microbial optical microscope olympus cx41 japan 2 the settling velocity was calculated by recording the time taken for each particle to fall from the measuring cylinder at a height of 28 mm 8 each particle size range r1 to r4 was done 15 times 3 the wet density was expressed by the mass ratio of equal volume of sludge to distilled water and the calculation formula was as follows 12 granular sludge wet density ρ gs g c m 3 m 3 m 1 m 2 m 1 m 4 m 3 ρ w where m1 empty weight of centrifuge tube g m2 centrifuge tube weighs filled with water g m3 centrifuge tube after centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 5 min and discarding the supernatant g m4 centrifuge tube after filling with water and sludge g ρw water density at room temperature g cm3 4 the instability coefficient of anammox granular sludge was determined by a method for detecting the strength of granular sludge 13 took 5 0 g of wet granular sludge and rinsed it by 3 times put the rinsed granular sludge in a 100 ml beaker and set the volume to 50 ml with ultrapure water put the beaker containing water and granular sludge in a ultrasonic instrument ultrasonic cell crusher scientz iid and placed the ultrasonic probe 2 cm below the liquid level set the alarm temperature ultrasonic frequency ultrasonic power at 26 20 khz and 65 w and used the 10 s on and 10 s off intermittent ultrasound mode after ultrasonic treatment sampled 3 ml of liquid at a fixed height each minute and measure the absorbance of samples obtained at different time points 10 times in the whole experiment with a visible spectrophotometer u t1810 yipu shanghai at a wavelength of 600 nm performed linear fitting of the absorbance data vs time and the slope of the linear equation was the instability coefficient 13 the larger value of the instability coefficient indicates the anammox granular sludge is more easily broken by ultrasonic waves and thus has a lower mechanical strength 5 integrity coefficient of anammox granular sludge took 5 ml of sludge water mixture in a 50 ml centrifuge tube diluted to 30 ml and mixed with a vortex mixer xw 80a for 2 min and settled for 1 min the dry weights of the settled granules mlss2 and the residual granules mlss1 in the supernatant were measured 14 the specific calculation formula of integrity coefficient ic was i c m l s s 2 m l s s 1 m l s s 2 6 the eps was the sum of protein pn and polysaccharide ps with a unit of mg g 1 calculated by vss which was extracted by the formaldehyde naoh method the protein content was determined by the lowry method and the bovine serum protein was used as the standard substance the polysaccharide content was determined by the phenol sulfuric acid method and glucose was used as the standard substance 15 7 anammox activity of anammox granular sludge the ammonium and nitrite in artificial simulated wastewater were obtained by adding nh4cl and nano2 and the initial concentration was all 50 mg l together with 1 mg l trace element solutions i and ii 16 to make deaerated wastewater disposed 1 l of artificial simulated wastewater contained 60 mg l of ammonium and 60 mg l of nitrite and aerated with nitrogen gas 95 for 30 min to remove dissolved oxygen do added 10 g of wet anammox granular sludge to the brown feed bottle with a volume of 100 ml and injected 100 ml of deaerated wastewater connected the two way sampling cover with a rubber tube to seal placed the feeding bottle on the gas bath shaker set the temperature to 32 in the shaker and controlled the shaker speed to 120 rpm took samples every 1 h to determine the ammonium and nitrite concentration of water samples the saa gn gvssd of sludge was calculated by the substrate concentration degradation curve 6 the ammonium and nitrite were analyzed using the standard methods 17 and each sample was analyzed twice as parallel analysis further fitting verifies the linear relationship of ln c c0 t that is ln c c 0 kt t was the reaction time h c0 was the initial concentration of ammonium and nitrite the c was the concentration of ammonium and nitrite after t hours 2 3 determination of microbial community here the anammox granular sludge of different sizes samples r1 r2 r3 r4 were stored at 80 c until dna extraction microbial dna was extracted from different granular sludge samples using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s the extraction was performed according to the manufacturer s instructions the concentrations and quality of dna samples were measured using a nano drop nd 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific ma usa the v3 v4 region of the bacteria 16s ribosomal rna gene was amplified with the primers 338 f 5 actcctacgggag gcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the pcr products which was contained adapter and barcode were quantized by a quant it dsdna hs reagent and then pooled together equally for each sample the nucleic acid extraction and illumina miseq sequencing were according by chen et al 18 19 the sequencing was performed with the illumina hiseq 2500 platform 2 250 paired ends at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china 2 4 multivariate statistical analysis the multivariate statistical analysis between miseq data and seven different physicochemical characteristics particle size wet density settling velocity vss ss eps saa ic of anammox granular sludge under different particle sizes were performed with canoco 5 biometris plant research international wageningen nl 20 redundancy analysis rda at the genus level was also conducted to reflect the relationship between different granular sludge characters and microbial functional groups which can be seen intuitively from the analysis results the rare genus less than 0 5 was excluded from the rda analysis the significance of each anammox granular sludge character on the microbial community was evaluated using the monte carlo permutation test 999 replicates the pearson s correlation between two environmental parameters under different terms was performed using the software spss 18 0 21 3 results and discussion 3 1 physiochemical characteristics of anammox granular sludge with different particle sizes as shown in table 1 the average particle diameters of the four groups of granular sludge were 0 75 1 28 1 83 and 2 67 mm respectively the vss ss representing the ratio of biological organic matter to total solid components was between 0 40 0 51 and gradually decreased with an increase in particle there were more inorganic components in large particles of anammox granular sludge an et al 2013 reported that the vss ss were 0 66 0 71 and 0 75 for anammox granular sludge sizes ranging from 0 5 1 0 mm 1 1 5 mm and above 1 5 mm respectively the difference in the vss ss ratio between this study and the one reported by an et al 2013 could be due to the cultivation environment and conditions of anammox granular sludge the wet density of the four anammox granular sludges was among 1 0489 1 0682 which was basically consistent with the previously reported ranges 1 0279 1 1352 13 the wet density of the granular sludge increased with an increase in particle size indicating that the large size granular sludge was denser than that of the small size one the granular sludge had a porous structure with air cavities and water channels inside the wet density of the granular sludge was affected by the three phase ratio of solid liquid and gas however the volume of gas pockets became larger and more porous with an increase in the diameter of anammox granules which would lower the density and settling velocity of the sludge granules 11 13 the settling velocity of the sludge granules was between 78 32 and 211 57 m h and increased with an increase in the average particle size which was consistent with the trend of wet density change the increasing size and density might result in a significant increase in settling velocity of granules 8 22 the particle size and wet density of granular sludge are important factors that affect the sedimentation performance the settling velocity is frequently greater when the particle size is larger 8 the settling velocity of anammox granular sludge was reported to be about 64 2 m h with the particle size of 1 33 2 50 mm 23 52 20 143 64 m h under different influent temperature salt and calcium concentrations 13 and 41 79 m h for the anammox granular sludge start up from a uasb at an ammonium removal efficiency of 94 and a loading rate of 0 064 kg n kg vss d 24 in this study the settling velocity of anammox granular sludge was above 78 32 m h and the sedimentation performance was better than those reported before as shown in fig 1 the anammox granular sludge had a uniform color which appeared light red or reddish brown for r1 and r2 and had remarkable different color for r3 an r4 including light red red dark red gray black and so on the surface of the grey granular sludge was covered with a layer of scale like inorganic substances presumably calcium precipitates the ca2 was always the most common and most abundant metal ions in the anammox granular sludge 8 the presence of metal ions such as ca2 mg2 and fe3 in the anammox granular sludge could effectively promote the granulation of anammox sludge 8 25 however metal ions such as ca2 easily combined with co3 2 so4 2 and po4 3 ions to form calcium precipitates the calcium concentration in the granules was increased by the calcium concentration of feed and also the calcium carbonate was the dominate calcium precipitate in the granules 26 in the process of domestication and cultivation of granular sludge the calcium precipitate process would reduce the percentage of organic matter as the particle size increases lowering reaction activity under the microscope the anammox sludge granules with different particle sizes were irregularly spherical with thicker biomass inside and wrapped by agar like extracellular polymer outside under long term interaction among bacteria substrates and environmental factors the anammox granular sludge could self select immobilize the microbial community and form a special structure 11 the anammox granular sludge had a recognizable cauliflower like appearance in some high rate anaerobic bioreactors 6 27 the higher mechanical strength was an important advantage of granular sludge over flocculent sludge the particles with higher mechanical strength could resist the shearing force of rising water and air bubbles while the particles with lower strength may loss biomass with a lower performance 13 the mechanical strength of granular sludge depends on the composition and interaction of the particulate components such as the microorganism structure eps composition and inorganic components as calcium adsorbed from wastewater etc 28 the instability coefficient and complete coefficient were usually used to characterize the mechanical strength of granular sludge the mechanical strength of granular sludge was higher with smaller instability coefficient or greater complete coefficient as shown in figure 2 a the instability coefficient of r1 r2 r3 and r4 were 0 061 0 0845 0 0753 and 0 0743 respectively the mechanical strength was in the order of r1 r3 r4 r2 however from the perspective of complete coefficients r1 r2 r3 and r4 were 99 86 99 16 97 22 and 96 25 respectively indicating that the complete coefficients decreased with an increase in particle size fig 2 a the mechanical strength of the granular sludge was different by calculating with instability coefficient and complete coefficients and the specific reason was still remained to be analyzed in the future in general the anammox granular sludge with a particle size of 0 5 1 0 mm r1 has the highest mechanical strength the total eps of r1 to r4 was 132 4 174 2 110 0 and 102 9 mg gvss fig 2 b the eps of anammox sludge could improve the flocculation the eps extraction could sharply decrease the flocculation efficiency of anammox sludge from 80 to 50 29 also the pn and ps are the key eps components of anammox bacteria 29 the contents of pn and ps indicated that the main component of eps was protein accounted for 70 97 79 22 of the total eps the pn ps ratios of r1 to r4 anammox granular sludge were 3 08 3 81 2 77 and 2 44 respectively there was a certain difference between the total eps and pn ps of anammox granular sludge in different reactors with different nitrogen loading the pn and ps contents in anammox sludge were determined to be 67 9 mg gvss and 25 3 mg gvss respectively 29 in addition the pn and ps were 42 7 6 5 and 83 2 7 9 mg gvss in an anammox granular sludge uasb reactor as well as 71 8 112 1 and 164 4 298 2 mg gvss in a high loaded anammox uasb reactors 6 24 the total eps and the pn ps ratio in this study were all ranked as r2 r1 r3 r4 showing that the anammox granular sludge with a particle size of 1 0 1 5 mm secreted more extracellular polymers in addition the pn ps ratio increased with eps increasing the physiochemical properties of anammox granular sludge came from the same egsb reactor under different particle sizes were quite different the different diameter of the anammox granular sludge was affected by the shape of the reactors hydrodynamic shear force and nitrogen loading rate nlr which caused completely different physiochemical properties 6 10 at the same time the different eps composition would directly affect the formation and particle sizes of the anammox granular sludge 29 3 2 anammox activity of granular sludge with different particle sizes the anammox activity was the main parameter for evaluating the nitrogen removal performance of granular sludge to explore the different nitrogen removal rates of anammox granular sludge with different particle sizes the nitrogen removal curves was tested with 100 ml of anaerobic feed bottle as shown in fig 3 the nitrite removal was slightly different from that for ammonium the nitrite was completely removed after 5 h for r1 and after about 4 h for r2 r4 fig 3 a ammonium removal efficiency of the granules with all the particle sizes reached up to 90 after 4 h fig 3 b the substrate degradation rate follows the first order decay reaction kinetics r2 0 91 fig 3 c and d from the 1st order kinetics of fitting curves of nitrite the r2 and r3 were consistent in the first 3 h and the degradation rate of r3 gradually exceeded that of r2 the r4 with larger particles had outstripped than other reactors in the first 5 h and decreased lower than r3 in the 6 h however the degradation rate of r1 was always the lowest during the whole experiment the ammonium degradation rate of r1 and r4 were similar as the nitrite in addition the ammonium degradation rate of r2 and r3 was fluctuated back in the first 4 h but r3 was exceeded r2 after 4 h throughout the experiment in summary the degradation rate increased with an increase in particle size r4 r3 r2 r1 as indicated by the reaction rate the maximum anammox activity was calculated according to the substrate degradation curve in the first 1 h showed in fig 3 the ammonium removal rate of r1 r2 r3 and r4 was 0 088 0 131 0 169 and 0 170 kg n kgvss d while the nitrite removal rate was 0 086 0 133 0 175 and 0 175 kg n kgvss d respectively the saa was 0 174 0 264 0 344 and 0 345 kg n kgvss d respectively fig 4 the calculation results showed that the activity of anammox granular sludge increased with particle size increasing while the growth rate of saa was slowed down with an increase in particle size up to now consistent information is not available on the influence of particle sizes of anammox sludge granules on the anammox reaction activity one common opinion is that the anammox reaction activity is higher for the particle with a smaller particle size as it has a larger specific surface area and higher mass transfer efficiency the optimal anammox granule sludge sizes were reported to be 0 5 0 9 mm for enhanced anammox bacterial abundance activity and specific anammox rate 10 another opinion is that the anammox granular sludge activity is mainly concentrated in the range of 1 mm near the granular surface and does not decrease with an increase in particle size 30 the third opinion states that the biofilm of the thickness of 0 2 0 3 mm on the surface of a large size anammox granular sludge is the most important part of anammox reaction 31 nevertheless contrary to the first two opinions the result of this research indicated that the larger the particle size of the granular sludge the higher the biological activity of the granule 3 3 microbial community of anammox granular sludge with different particles 3 3 1 diversity and abundance analysis the total sequence number of r1 r2 r3 and r4 was 42 123 50 352 table 2 the larger chao1 and ace index reflected the higher abundance of community 20 the results showed that both index decreased first and then increased with the particle size increasing r2 had the minimum value of the two indexes 1 0 1 5 the simpson and shannon index reflected the diversity of the sample community the simpson index decreased first and then increased as particle size increasing indicated that the proportion of dominant bacteria in the total biological microorganisms increased first and then decreased the shannon index was just the opposite which increased first and then decreased as the particle size increasing indicated that the complexity of the bacterial composition of the anammox granular sludge decreased first and then increased the alpha diversity analysis indicated that the anammox granular sludge had undergone great changes in the microbial community structure during the growth process and a single positive or negative correlation did not exist with the particle size increasing bacteria from larger granules above 1 5 mm exhibited a high diversity compared with those from smaller granules 0 5 1 5 mm 8 when the particle size of the granular sludge was cultivated to be 1 0 1 5 mm the community diversity of the granules was the lowest and the dominant bacterial community accounted for the largest proportion of overall biological microorganisms 3 3 2 comparison of microorganisms at phylum level the main microorganisms at the phylum level with different particle size were basically consistent including chloroflexi proteobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes firmicutes and actinobacteria fig 5 a the chloroflexi and proteobacteria were accounted for 30 8 38 3 27 5 24 3 and 27 8 25 1 37 1 27 6 of r1 r2 r3 r4 respectively the anammox bacteria belonged to the phytophthora phylum which accounted for 14 0 12 7 8 4 and 5 0 the proportion of planctomycetes decreased as the particle size increasing the phylum planctomycetes were 6 5 16 6 and 13 0 in the flocs 0 2 mm optimum particles 0 5 0 9 mm and the largest particles 2 0 2 5 mm of anammox samples respectively 10 results of this study have shown that the anammox bacteria belong to planctomycetes occupied a relatively high proportion in the smaller sized anammox granular sludge 0 5 1 0 mm in contrast the proportion of bacteroidetes increased from 6 2 11 6 with the particle size increasing 3 3 3 comparison of microorganisms at genus level the main abundance bacteria in anammox granules of different sizes were a bit different as shown in fig 5 b the main abundance bacteria were olb13 14 57 denitratisoma 12 03 sbr1031 10 88 candidatus brocadia 10 68 jg36 gs 52 3 48 limnobacter 3 32 and proteocatella 3 30 for r1 olb13 20 68 sbr1031 11 35 denitratisoma 10 44 candidatus brocadia 9 18 ignavibateria 3 80 ws6 dojkabateria 3 74 and proteocatella 3 30 for r2 pseudomonas 11 87 sbr1031 10 74 olb13 9 62 denitratisoma 7 22 candidatus brocadia 4 77 sporacetigenium 4 27 limnobacter 4 05 and ignavibateria 3 07 for r3 olb13 9 08 sbr1031 7 3 limnobacter 6 04 denitratisoma 4 36 ignavibateria 4 03 sporacetigenium 3 62 and candidatus brocadia 0 80 for r4 both olb13 and sbr1031 belonged to the chloroflexi phylum bacteria which were the focus microorganisms for anaerobic digestion 32 the denitratisoma was denitrifying bacteria which drive denitrification under the anoxic state by consuming organic carbon source 33 the anammox process would produce nitrate and there were also organic substances in the reactor after cell metabolism or microbial death which could be used by denitrifying bacteria to convert nitrate to n2 to improve nitrogen removal the limnobacter was often found in various environments such as surface seawater deep oceans human intestines volcanic sediments and so on 34 35 the ignavibacterium was a genus of chlorobi which belonged to strict anaerobic bacteria and had certain sulfur oxidation capacity 3 3 4 anammox bacteria abundance at genus level three anammox bacteria were detected in r1 r2 r3 and r4 using the miseq high throughput sequencing namely candidatus brocadia candidatus kuenenia and candidatus jettenia respectively table 3 the candidatus kuenenia and candidatus jettenia were only 0 4 0 7 and about 0 01 the candidatus brocadia was the dominant anammox bacteria with the highest abundance among the anammox granules with different sizes accounting for 10 68 9 18 4 77 and 0 80 of the microbial abundance in r1 0 5 1 0 mm r2 1 0 1 5 mm r3 1 5 2 0 mm and r4 2 0 mm respectively the anammox granular sludge with 0 5 1 5 mm particles was almost mainly contained candidatus brocadia bacteria though candidatus brocadia was still the predominant bacterium in the anammox granules higher than 1 5 mm particles and the candidatus jettenia and candidatus kuenenia were coexisted 8 the results showed that the abundance of anammox bacteria gradually decreased with the particle size increasing and the candidatus brocadia was always the dominant genus of anammox 3 3 5 connection between physiochemical characteristics and bacterial community in order to analyze the similarity of bacterial community and its correlation with different sludge characters the rda analysis of miseq data and seven different physicochemical characteristics were conducted at the genes level table 1 and fig 6 fig 6 indicates that r1 0 5 1 0 mm and r2 1 0 1 5 mm had a similar results that are quite different from r3 1 5 2 0 mm and r4 2 0 mm the anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia detected in the samples were correlated positively with eps ic and vss ss but negatively with wet density settling velocity particle size and saa 3 4 implications in the past research found that the dominant genus of anammox reactors was mainly candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia and there was generally only one dominant genus in an anammox system 36 the anammox diversity of the sludge of the wastewater treatment plant was quite different and which anammox organism s could be enriched might be determined by not only inoculation but also niche differentiation or other aspects e g composition and concentration of the feed substrate 37 the free ammonia concentration had different inhibitory effects on anammox bacteria genus but both candidatus kuenenia and brocadia species were present in the reactor with higher ammonia and nitrite concentrations 38 the candidatus brocadia cells were more susceptible to nitrite inhibition and thus were hard to be dominant in the anammox reactor at high nitrite levels 39 the population was shifted observely from candidatus brocadia to candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis in the anammox start up process in membrane bioreactor mbr which was presumably dued to the higher nitrite affinity of kuenenia 40 in this study the anammox granular sludge was taken from the same anammox egsb reactor fed with a high influent nitrite and ammonium concentration 329 4 and 295 5 mg l therefore the main genuses in the anammox granular sludge with different particle sizes were all candidatus brocadia which is consistent with the previous reports there were large differences in the microbial community structure of anammox granular sludge with different particle sizes 10 the diversity of bacterial and anammox bacteria were gradually increased by the particle size increasing 10 in addition the microbial community structure and biodiversity of different size granules in a partial nitritation anammox process was indicated that the larger granules particles was more diverse microbial communities than smaller 41 results of this study however demonstrated the opposite among the four different particle sizes the abundance of anammox bacteria was the largest in the granules of 0 5 1 0 mm in fact the granular sludge could be regarded as a special form of biofilm an increase in particle size was equivalent to an increase in the biofilm thickness which would inhibit the mass transfer efficiency of substances the lack of substrate would lead to metabolic difficulties or even microbial death usually the active depth of anammox granular sludge was within the top 0 2 0 3 mm of the granular surface 42 but could reach 0 8 mm depending on different bacterial species and hydraulic environmental conditions 43 the kinetic model simulated that 1 0 1 3 mm was the best size range for anammox granular sludge 44 results of this research demonstrated that the microbial community and nitrogen removal trend of anammox granular sludge were not uniform as a function of the particle size distribution probably because the mass transfer resistance increased with an increase in the granular size the granular sludge size should be controlled below 1 5 mm to maintain the predominant microorganisms and biomass of anammox bacteria while particle sizes of 1 5 2 0 mm should be selected to maintain high and stable nitrogen removal performance the smaller substance transfer distance may provide convenience for the growth and reproduction of anammox bacteria in the granular sludge 42 in addition the particle size range of anammox granular sludge could be adjusted according to actual needs for higher nitrogen removal efficiency or better precipitation efficiency by means of reactor rising velocity hydraulic shear force and so on moreover results of this study indicated that the anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia were correlated positively with eps ic and vss ss but negatively with wet density settling velocity particle size and saa the reasons for these correlations may be due to the high content of eps promoted the flocculation aggregation and higher stability of anammox bacteria and stimulated the better activity to increase vss ss 29 in addition the low content of eps would result in poor settling performance of anammox granular sludge however the high proportion of anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia brought lower saa for anammox granular sludge should be further studied in addition the abundance of anammox bacteria was decreased with the increase of particle size while the removal efficiencies of ammonium and nitrite as well as saa were increased with the increase of particle size the larger particles could significantly improve the performance of the anammox process because of the high abundance of anammox bacteria 9 however the dead zone would be formed in the anammox particles due to mass transfer in the larger particle size which would be resulting in the disintegration of anammox granular sludge 45 at present the direct cause of the opposite relationship between the anammox microbial abundance and nitrogen removal efficiency caused by particle size was still unknown it is hoped that further studies will be carried out in the follow up studies 4 conclusion the physicochemical characteristics of anammox granular sludge were closely related to the granular particle size both wet density and settling velocity were positively correlated with particle size however the vss ss ratio and particle integrity coefficient decreased with an increase in particle size the granular sludge with a particle size between 1 0 and 1 5 mm had the largest eps content and pn ps ratio the removal efficiency of ammonium and nitrite as well as the saa increased with an increase in particle size while the growth rate of saa was slowed down with an increase in particle size the richness and diversity of the microbial community decreased first and then increased with an increase in particle size the granular sludge had the lowest diversity for the particle size of 1 0 1 5 mm but the largest biomass and relative abundance values of anammox bacteria for the particle size of 0 5 1 0 mm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in

13677,this study aimed at investigating the effect of varying light dark l d regimes and different tertiary wastewater types synthetic and real on the biomass production nutrient removal photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll and carotenoids and production of value added products of chlorella sorokiniana algae culture was grown at ph 7 140 150 rpm agitation and with controlled temperature 25 c under continuous illumination of 140 μmol m 2 s 1 the highest amount of biomass productivity 548 20 mg l d nitrogen and phosphorus removal 60 and 85 the percentage increase in total chlorophyll 63 and total carotenoids carot accumulation 11 mg l were observed in real wastewater rww under 24 0 h h l d cycles c sorokiniana showed autotrophic growth as biomass increased in the light phase and decreased in the dark phase for all culture conditions among all the cultivation conditions a maximum increase in the protein content was 15 in rww 24 0 h and an increase in the carbohydrate content was 6 5 in synthetic wastewater sww 24 0 h showing that prolonged light phase positively affects the treatment efficiency furthermore this study demonstrated that biomass productivity reached a threshold and then started to decline after 24 h and 30 h in rww and sww under both light regimes the conditions of the rww 24 0 h l d regime with rww media were found to give the maximum tertiary treatment efficiency suggesting that selected microalgae cultured under these conditions would be best suited for integrated wastewater treatment keywords c sorokiniana tertiary wastewater biomass production nutrient removal threshold time value added products 1 introduction the ever increasing world s population and rapid urbanization have led to the large scale depletion of fossil fuels and uncontrolled emission of greenhouse gases thus the present situation demands non renewable resources that can be produced using green technologies on a global scale cultivation of micro algae offers a promising solution as it has enormous potential to produce value added products such as proteins carbohydrates and lipids 1 in ancient times microalgae were utilized as a food supplement due to the prevailing drought conditions in china afterward it became an emerging technology in the field of usage of biomass as a feedstock for potential by products recovery 2 6 moreover microalgae have considerable advantages over traditional crops they proliferate with minimal land and water requirements and extract recalcitrant organic matter such as cellulose and lignin for their growth microalgae consume only one seventh of the water consumed by soy for producing the same amount of biomass 3 7 8 one study reported that microalgae produce 20 times more biodiesel than traditional crops 8 it can bioremediate various types of wastewater by utilizing the excess nutrients present an integrated system of wwt and algae cultivation provides energy security 9 the symbiotic relationship between microalgae and bacteria present in wastewater involves mutualistic association microalgae acts as a source of dissolved organic matter dom for bacteria which is utilized by them and remineralized into inorganic forms to support the growth of microalgae 50 microalgae especially diatoms and green algae exude metabolic products such as extra polymeric substance eps these accumulate on the microbial cell surface and provide protection to the cells and during periods of starvation can serve as carbon or energy source for microalgal cells 50 in nitrogen limiting environments symbiotic association between nitrogen fixing prokaryotes and photosynthetic microalgae provides biologically available nitrogen in the form of ammonium to microalgae in return algae provide dom to the bacteria for their growth inorganic phosphate is required by algae for the synthesis of dna rna and atp and other organic compounds bacteria hydrolyze dissolved organic phosphorus produced by algae into inorganic phosphate which is again utilized by algae for its growth establishing a symbiotic relationship 50 an added advantage is that it also produces some useful secondary metabolites which have applications in the field of medicines pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals therefore the idea of utilizing microalgal biomass to produce value added products is worth while especially for bio refinery industries 8 9 generally microalgal biomass is composed of different fractions of macromolecules such as carbohydrates 20 30 proteins 40 60 and lipids 10 20 which can be further processed to obtain many potential products such as biofuels biodiesel animal feed biofertilizers and bio active compounds 4 it is already reported that the percentage of different fractions of microalgal biomass can be easily modified under particular conditions 17 algal biomass rich in carbohydrates can be used for bioethanol production as shown in eq 1 47 some algal species such as picochlorum sp chlorella sp contain considerable amounts of lipids up to 70 whereas some species of microalgae accumulate lipids under nutrient stressed conditions and therefore can be used for biodiesel production as shown in eq 2 47 the algal biomass can also be used as feedstock for biogas production as given in eq 3 and for the production of animal feed biofertilizers and bio active compounds 4 18 47 1 carbohydrate saccharification c 6 h 12 o 6 fermentation c h 3 c h 2 oh c o 2 2 triacylglyceride c h 3 oh transesterification biodiesel glycerol 3 carbohydrates proteins lipids anaerobic digestion methanogenesis c h 4 c o 2 microalgae chlorella sorokiniana is one of the most widely used chlorella strains for co2 capture wastewater remediation and production of value added products 2 10 13 algal growth is highly dependent upon light intensity photoperiod regime inoculum dose and various stress conditions such as nutrients depletion the variability of ph and wastewater characteristics 13 16 46 the current technologies used in bio refinery industries lack optimization for algal strain selection and all other factors such as light inoculum dose nutrient concentration and media characteristics that affect its growth profiles and biomass accumulation 9 10 14 17 primary technologies for microalgae cultivation have already been established but low yields and high bioenergy costs are major impediments to large scale exploitation of microalgae 1 4 5 in this manner to make microalgae a commercially feasible feedstock the spotlight should be on diminishing the production cost and enhancing the productivity of algal biomass it has been observed in various studies that in algae dominated batch systems the algal growth reaches a threshold beyond which the algal cells start to die off which has an adverse effect as the bod cod values again start increasing because of the increased organic content 46 therefore in the integrated approach of wastewater management the algal biomass should be harvested before reaching this threshold time for achieving maximum treatment efficiency and this can also be used as a benchmark for the development of a continuous system therefore for achieving maximum algal biomass production with minimal energy input the parameters such as algal strain selection inoculum dose and l d cycles and nutrient concentration should be optimized to get minimum threshold time leading to overall reduced production cost this will also help in controlling the eutrophication of water bodies caused by the discharge of treated wastewater the studies done until now were mainly focused on achieving near complete removal of nutrients even if there was no significant algal biomass accumulation beyond the threshold time thus leading to overall high operating and production costs which outweigh the benefits of using microalgae as a potential bioremediation technique for wwt therefore in this study isolated algal strain c sorokiniana was cultivated in synthetic and in real tertiary wastewater under different photoperiod regimes to evaluate their effect on biomass production nutrient removal for estimation of carbohydrates proteins and photosynthetic pigments such as carotenoids carot and chlorophyll chl 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae inoculum and culture conditions microalgae strain chlorella

illumination was provided by a white fluorescent tube with an intensity of 140 μmol m 2 s 1 the study was done in two phases one with sww i and the other one with rww ii initially all reactors were inoculated with the same inoculum concentration of c sorokininana 650 700 mg l taken from culture stock 19 in each phase of the study further two subsequent batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of varying photoperiod regimes of 12 12 h and 24 0 h l d on the growth nutrient removal photosynthesis and value added products estimation all the batch experiments were conducted in the replica sww phase i and rww phase ii were used as a control or blank samples were drawn after every six hours over a period of 48 h from all the reactors and all analytical data was recorded as mean and standard deviation samples were processed with their physicochemical analysis 2 4 physicochemical analysis of wastewater organic carbon such as bod and cod nutrients such as nitrogen nh4 n no3 n tkn and phosphate were analyzed according to the standard methods for the estimation of water and wastewater 20 standard methods such as the azide modification method and the potassium dichromate method were used to calculate the bod and cod 20 no3 n nh4 n po4 p were analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr 6000 20 tkn was measured using the hach simplified tkn s tkn tnt

various conditions optical density od at 680 nm was used to calculate the specific growth rate μ and doubling time td 21 the following eqs 4 5 were used to calculate the specific growth rate μ and doubling time td 4 μ ln x t x 0 t 0 5 t d ln 2 μ xt biomass concentration at time t h x0 biomass concentration at 0th hour 21 here t is the threshold time 1 1 threshold time is the duration till which the maximum nutrient removal maximum nutrient uptake and cod removal was observed in this study beyond the threshold time cod values start to increase it is noted that eqs 4 and 5 can be used for any time frame 2 6 harvesting and pre treatment of biomass algal biomass was obtained by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 5 min in a refrigerated centrifuge the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 1 w v g 100 ml aqueous nacl solution it was again centrifuged and the washed pellet was further freeze dried by liquid nitrogen 196 c after this the dried biomass can be analyzed instantly or can be stored at 20 c for analyses at a later time for up to 10 days 2 7 pigments extraction a 100 acetone method was used to extract the chlorophyll content of microalgae absorption was taken at wavelength 663 nm and 645 nm against a solvent blank in hach dr 5000 spectrophotometer the following eqs 6 8 were used to calculate the total chlorophyll content mg l 44 6 c h l o r o p h y l

respectively the content of total carotenoids carot was calculated spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of acetone extract at 480 nm and the following eq 9 was used to calculate the content of carot 22 9 c a r o t m g l 4 a 480 2 8 protein and carbohydrate estimation the total carbohydrate content present in the algae biomass was estimated by the phenol sulphuric acid method and total protein by the standard lowry method 23 glucose and bovine serum albumin bsa were used as standards for phenol sulphuric acid method 24 and standard lowry method 23 respectively a

evaluate their effect on the growth cycle and biomass production of c sorokiniana cultivated in synthetic wastewater sww as well as in real tertiary wastewater rww the biomass production was monitored by measuring total suspended solids tss and optical density od at 680 nm after every six hours during cultivation fig 1 shows time wise variation of growth and biomass production of c sorokiniana cultivated in sww as well as in rww for both the photoperiod regimes microalgae cultivated under 24 0 h photoperiod regimes showed continuous growth till 30 h fig 1a and c whereas for 12 12 h photoperiod regimes growth showed rhythmic oscillations with light and dark phase which was found to be in accordance with the study done by xu et al 2016 fig 1b and d 21 this might be because of the increased biomass concentration during the light phase and decrease during the dark phase 21 overall the maximum average biomass productivities were 126 and 158 mg l d in sww and 319 and 548 mg l d in rww under 12 12 h and 24 0 h light regimes respectively denoting the threshold time table 3 microalgae cultivated in rww showed three times higher biomass productivity than that of sww under both light regimes the initial concentration of nutrients tn p 7 3 1 present in rww was higher table 2 which is why the biomass production was higher in rww as compared to sww tn p 3 4 1 as per the study 25 the ratio of n p strongly affects the rate of biomass production of chlorella sp and it can be improved multiple times by the addition of a particular dose of anaerobic digestion centrate to secondary effluent 25 table 3 shows the effects of different photoperiod regimes on biomass productivity mg l d specific growth rate d 1 and doubling time 2 2 doubling time is a time at which the microalgal population doubled in size td of c sorokininana cultivated in sww and rww among all the highest average biomass productivity 548 mg l d specific growth rate 0 59 d 1 and lower doubling time 1 17 td were observed in rww under a photoperiod of 24 0 h l d which means these are the most suitable conditions for the growth of the strain c sorokiniana used in this study c sorokinana under 12 12 h l d regimes in sww showed the lowest growth profiles in terms of specific growth rate and biomass productivity in the present study the biomass productivity is much higher as compared to the previously reported biomass productivity values for chlorella sp biomass productivity mg l d of chlorella sp were 20 281 mg l d at different culture conditions and wastewater media 13 14 25 26 28 40 the changes in their biomass productivity are influenced by many biotic and abiotic factors 46 in the present study it is concluded that the l d period n p ratio of wastewater were the main limiting factors to microalgal growth in sww which is in accordance with earlier studies reported by many researchers 14 25 27 the correlation between tss and od was implied to check the data accuracy fig s1 supplementary information variation in initial od values from 0 7 0 9 was because of the difference in the color and initial nutrient concentration of sww and rww 15 16 it has already been reported that the dilution rate of wastewater and the difference in color intensity quantifies the initial value of od wastewater with lower dilution ratio gave higher initial od values 1 v v 1 3 nm whereas the higher dilution ratio gave lower initial od values 0 17 v v 0 2 nm 15 moreover the initial concentration of nutrients present in wastewater also affects light penetration and subsequently affects the od values 16 in the present study a linear regression approach was used to find out the correlation between the growth od and biomass production tss of microalgae the value of regression coefficient r2 0 9348 and 0 9122 for the algae growth cultivated in 24 0 h l d in both the wastewaters showed the variable tss and od had a linear relationship in this particular mode of cultivation in a particular threshold time of 24 30 h fig s1b and c 3 2 nutrient removal 3 2 1 nitrogen and phosphorus fig 2 a and b summarizes the nutrient removal n and p efficiencies of c sorokiniana in the sww and rww respectively at different photoperiod regimes 12 12 h and 24 0 h in sww total nitrogen tn content decreased from the initial value of 12 mg l to 5 95 mg l and 7 76 mg l and in rww it decreased from the 31 mg l to 12 54 mg l and 12 8 mg l for 24 0 h and 12 12 h photoperiod regimes respectively similarly in sww the initial phosphorus content decreased from 3 5 mg l to 0 74 mg l and 2 05 mg l and in rww it decreased from 4 2 mg l to 1 5 mg l and 1 67 mg l for 24 0 h and 12 12 h photoperiod regimes respectively additionally table 4 shows the nutrient removal efficiencies maximum nutrient uptake rate and threshold time of c sorokiniana in the sww and rww respectively for different photoperiod regimes 12 12 h and 24 0 h the maximum nutrient removal tn 60 p 85 and nutrient uptake rate were observed for rww under 24 0 h photoperiod regime table 4 microalgae preferably uptake nitrogen in the form of ammonical nitrogen 31 45 therefore nitrogen removal is higher in rww because the ammonical nitrogen is approximately 4 times higher in rww as compared to sww 31 45 more than 90 of nh4 n removal was observed in all different reactors conditions it is already reported that an optimum amount of nh4 n is required for better growth in the case of chlorella sp safafar 45 evaluated the effect of different concentrations of nh4 n such as 50 100 and 150 mg l on microalgal growth and showed that microalgal growth increases with increasing concentration of ammonia in the present study overall tn removal is lower and p removal was in the same range as reported previously for chlorella sp grown in tertiary treated landfill leachate tn 86 p 96 6 secondary effluent tn 82 5 p 86 25 secondary effluent tn 92 p 86 28 0 2 μm membrane filtered primary wastewater nh4 n 94 18 p 97 69 respectively 29 wang et al 41 grew chlorella pyrenoida in diluted piggery wastewater and showed lower removal of tn 54 7 and p 31 at higher dilution rates initial cod 250 mg l tn 20 mg n l p 3 5 mg p l whereas the nutrient removal efficiencies improved by lowering the dilution rates by increasing nutrient concentration it depicted that the initial nutrient concentration and its ratio present in the media highly influence the overall treatment efficiency the phosphorus removal was higher in rww as compared to the sww under the 12 12 h l d regime because of the presence of an optimum n p ratio of 7 3 1 as p uptake is dependent upon external n and p supply in a study it has been reported that c sorokinana removed 40 60 phosphorus from a mixture of piggery and municipal wastewater which is lower than that of the removal observed in the present study within 24 30 h 47 the nutrient removal reported in the literature with chlorella sp showed removal efficiencies with a residence time minimum of 3 10 days whereas the removal in the present study was observed in 24 30 h this might be because of the higher initial inoculum dose 700 mg l of microalgae present in all the systems and is also mentioned in previously reported studies 19 25 3 2 2 cod removal in fig 3 a cod value decreased from 250 mg l to 172 mg l and 160 mg l till 30 h in sww for 24 0 h and 12 12 h photoperiod regimes respectively in fig 3b the cod value decreased from 125 mg l to 80 6 mg l and 65 mg l till 24 h in rww for 24 0 h and 12 12 h photoperiod regimes respectively the cod removal efficiencies were comparable to the previously reported literature 28 41 overall lower cod removal was observed in all the cases it might be because isolated c sorokiniana showed autotrophic growth in all conditions the results show that the threshold time was 30 h and 24 h in sww and rww respectively this observation is concluded based on cod values as they increased beyond the threshold time suggesting that there is an increase in the organic matter indicating algal death which is also corroborated by the decrease in the algal biomass content and nutrients assimilation this data suggests the timeline by which all the algal biomass should be harvested to get the efficient tertiary wastewater treatment 3 3 microalgae pigments total chlorophyll and carotenoids pigment composition in green algae mainly consists of chlorophyll chl and carotenoids carot estimation of pigments described the changes that occurred in the photosynthetic process to evaluate the variations that occurred during microalgae growth both chl and carot were estimated spectrophotometrically fig 4 demonstrates that the maximum amount of chl and carot reached till 30 36 h for both the photoperiod regimes of 24 0 h and 12 12 h in all the cultivation conditions and thereafter started to decrease beyond this point however the pattern of attaining the maximum accumulation was different for both the photoperiod regimes fig 4 the highest content of chl and carot was observed with rww in the 24 0 h l d period in sww chl increased from 19 mg l to 26 mg l and 22 mg l under 24 0 h and 12 12 h l d period respectively likewise in rww chl increased from 22 mg l to 57 mg l and 60 mg l under 24 0 h and 12 12 h l d respectively fig 4 overall the highest carot production 10 11 mg l was reported in c sorokiniana cultivated in rww under both the photoperiod regimes fig 4c and d both external and internal factors affect the process of photosynthesis the external factors are light intensity carbon dioxide concentration and temperature and internal factors include the chl and carot content the internal factors are themselves dependent upon the nutrient concentration and the type of algal species specifically the concentrations of nitrogen and carbon present in media as they play an essential role in the photosynthesis and production of chlorophyll 29 31 ji et al 44 observed chl a content was 2980 μg l in the presence of algae bacteria when biomass was 900 mg l in hydraulic retention time hrt of 6 days whereas in the present study chl a reached up to 22 50 mg l with a biomass concentration of 1024 mg l within 30 h in rww 24 0 h l d which is significantly more than the above mentioned study 44 in the present study it was observed that the amount of both the pigments increased in the light phase and decreased in the dark phase fig 4b and c which means c sorokininana grew an autotrophic mode in both the wastewater types photosynthesis does not take place in the dark and therefore requires light as the main source of energy light is electromagnetic radiation and based on its wavelength it can be divided into several components photosynthetically active radiation par lies in the visible range of the spectrum 400 700 nm and is absorbed by the photosynthetic pigments chlorophylls carotenoids and phycobilins photosynthesis begins at low light intensities and increases proportionately with increasing light intensity until it reaches a plateau after this any further increase in light intensities does not affect the rate of photosynthesis 10 21 in light limiting conditions the organism increases pigmentation that is increases the number of photosynthetic units and or size of the light harvesting complexes lhc s in contrast to this it had been demonstrated by song and pei 2018 that the highest amount of chlorophyll 7 5 mg l and carotenoids 2 mg l were observed by the supplementation of xylose 4 g l in mixotrophic conditions using strain scenedesmus quadricauda initial inoculum 30 mg l during the batch study of 14 days 30 nitrogen is the main precursor of photosynthesis and its limitation in the media reduced the amount of pigments so the reduction of pigments after 30 36 h was observed when the culture became substrate limited refer to section 3 2 one study analyzed the effect of nitrogen limitation on the photosynthetic activity of algae which demonstrated that there was a 62 5 reduction in chl a due to nitrogen limitation in autotrophic growth of spirulina platensis 43 3 4 protein and carbohydrate accumulation a comparison is made between the accumulation of proteins and carbohydrates by cultivating c sorokiniana in synthetic and real wastewater under 24 0 h as well as in 12 12 h l d cycles quantitative estimation of intracellular protein and carbohydrate of c sorokiniana showed variations under varying photoperiod regimes protein and carbohydrate content were measured at starting and at the end of the study to calculate the overall increase during the study the estimated increase in protein and carbohydrate content showed significant variations with respect to different photoperiod regimes and the wastewater used fig 5 initial values of protein 21 and carbohydrate 32 of total algal biomass were approximately similar in both the wastewaters in sww an increase in the protein and carbohydrate content was approximately the same 7 and 6 5 in the photoperiod of 24 0 h whereas in the 12 12 h photoperiod the increase in protein and carbohydrate accumulation was very low at the end of the study there was no increase 0 in protein content and a very low increase 2 in carbohydrate content was observed in sww under 12 12 h l d cycles fig 5 the percentage increase in the accumulation of protein and carbohydrate content was 15 and 5 respectively through microalgae cultivating rww 24 0 h l d cycle as already reported in earlier studies accumulations were dependent upon the ability of a strain to grow mixotrophically in the dark phase as well as the duration of the l d period 32 36 the growth of an isolated strain of c sorokiniana used in the present study showed no traits of mixotrophy that is why the dark phase had a negative effect on protein and carbohydrate accumulation numerous researchers have already explained the positive relationship between protein and chlorophyll content 37 39 nitrogen starved conditions induce stress on the chlorophyll protein complex which results in decreased protein production 32 37 along with this the n p ratio of wastewater media as well as the algal cellular n p ratio is one of the significant factors which are taken into consideration in the present study the increase in the percentage content of protein 10 15 in the rww was high as compared to protein content accumulated in sww by considering the n p ratios of both the wastewater types table 2 it can be concluded that a higher ratio of n p 7 3 1 in rww promoted the algal growth via more nitrogen assimilation in the system which ultimately promoted the chlorophyll content therefore the accumulation of protein in rww was higher than in sww fig 5 fig 5 represented that the accumulated protein content is 7 10 higher in rww as compared to sww in both the light durations whereas measured carbohydrate content is approximately the same irrespective of wastewater used and light duration the carbohydrate and protein accumulation requires a sufficient supply of carbon and nitrogen to algal cells which justify the more protein accumulation using rww fig 5 carbohydrate is slightly higher in sww because of the higher carbon content present in it table 2 therefore in the present study the composition of nutrients present in wastewater made a significant impact on the removal efficiency and value added product recovery through microalgae 37 39 42 3 5 energy input cost and biomass considerations one more added advantage of setting cut off time threshold is that it also helps in lowering the energy input imparted operational cost into the system in the present study batch reactors were used in a lab scale set up there were mainly two types of energies light energy energy from stirrer motor imparted into all reactors the energy input of all the reactors in different l d photoperiod regimes was compared and the cost analysis is summarized in table 5 table 5 shows the total energy input and its respective cost relative to the threshold time the result revealed that the input energy cost can be potentially reduced only when the threshold time is set as the experiments ran for 48 h but in all reactors the maximum biomass productivity nutrient removal value added products were achieved during the threshold time 24 30 h after this threshold time the cod values start increasing and biomass starts decreasing and successful tertiary wastewater treatment is beneficial only when the nutrients and toxic pollutants organic biomass can be eliminated this analysis further highlights that excluding that extra time for the running bioreactor is imperative to cost effectively produce sustainable algal biomass a study was done to evaluate the cost analysis revenue and operating of wastewater treatment through c sorokinana and found that most of the energy was consumed by artificial lights 48 so adding a dark phase for some time to the bioreactors is beneficial for cost reduction similarly it was observed that the running cost of rww reactor under the 12 12 h photoperiod regime was the lowest table 5 the algal biomass produced desired bioproducts such as protein chlorophylls carotenoids carbohydrates estimation of the economics of algal biomass is assessed through the market value of the desired products 33 48 the current global market value for carotenoids is estimated at 1 2 1 4 billion carotenoids such as astaxanthin β carotene lutein are having a market value of 233 334 million bioethanol market worth is 64 8 billion 33 algae based biofertilizer is comparable to organic fertilizers and chemical fertilizers 49 if biomass is harvested before microalgal s threshold time for a particular system then it will naturally reduce the cost of purification while undergoing the downstream processing and also increase the total sustainability of the integrated wastewater system 34 due to this analysis dependent upon threshold time the algal biomass generated will be profitable if all these above mentioned bio products are processed and marketed after scaling up the process one study described that there is a need for consideration of irradiance threshold but the time of irradiance is also important to get the desired product 34 there is still very resultant noise in the experimental data literature that needs to be calibrated for microalgal biomass production and its valuable resource recovery 34 so in this context further study is needed to get an insight into the optimum integrated approach to check the efficacy and utilization of the algal biomass 4 future recommendations the results of the present study indicated that photoperiod variation and wastewater type have a considerable impact on biomass production nutrients removal photosynthetic pigments production and value added products such as protein and carbohydrate accumulation the findings of the study can contribute significantly to reducing the eutrophication deciding the operational parameter such as photoperiod and wastewater type characteristics and threshold or cut off time with due consideration to overall cost by benefit analysis for future research the long term effects of dark and light cycles on the performance of the integrated wastewater treatment system can be evaluated and also the mechanism of cellular changes taking place because of this can be elucidated to better understand the changes at the molecular level as the scope of the present study was limited only to the microalgal biomass evaluation for value added products such as estimation of pigments chlorophyll and carotenoids protein carbohydrate for presenting a comparative study therefore as a future recommendation proper downstream processing can be carried out to recover the purified products and do their assessment to achieve overall cost effectiveness 5 conclusions the integrated microalgae based wastewater treatment approach can be used for biomass recovery which can be utilized for bioenergy production and conversion to value added products in this way microalgae can be used to achieve dual objectives of reducing wastewater treatment costs and cleaner bioenergy production leading to a circular economy the results of the study showed that microalgae c sorokinana gave promising results for wastewater treatment and biomass production in comparison to sww c sorokiniana grew well in rww and showed the lowest cost highest biomass productivity specific growth rate and percentage increase in total chlorophyll and total carotenoids for 24 0 h l d cycles the conditions of continuous illumination improved biomass production and value added product recovery suggesting that c sorokiniana prefers autotrophic growth in both rww and sww algal cells start to die off after 24 h and 36 h respectively these time values indicate the threshold levels for biomass productivity suggesting that biomass should be harvested after reaching threshold time which will help in reducing the treatment cost these results are extremely useful as the accumulation of value added products such as pigments chlorophyll and carotenoids proteins and carbohydrates enhance its economic feasibility for large scale cultivation the resulting biomass with value added product recovery can be further processed and used for energy resource recovery with further downstream processing the precursor of value added products can also be used in the pharmaceutical and food industries hence the results obtained in this integrated algae wastewater system can also be used for scaling up to large scale cultivation systems which will treat ww in a more sustainable eco friendly and cost efficient manner declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of

13677,this study aimed at investigating the effect of varying light dark l d regimes and different tertiary wastewater types synthetic and real on the biomass production nutrient removal photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll and carotenoids and production of value added products of chlorella sorokiniana algae culture was grown at ph 7 140 150 rpm agitation and with controlled temperature 25 c under continuous illumination of 140 μmol m 2 s 1 the highest amount of biomass productivity 548 20 mg l d nitrogen and phosphorus removal 60 and 85 the percentage increase in total chlorophyll 63 and total carotenoids carot accumulation 11 mg l were observed in real wastewater rww under 24 0 h h l d cycles c sorokiniana showed autotrophic growth as biomass increased in the light phase and decreased in the dark phase for all culture conditions among all the cultivation conditions a maximum increase in the protein content was 15 in rww 24 0 h and an increase in the carbohydrate content was 6 5 in synthetic wastewater sww 24 0 h showing that prolonged light phase positively affects the treatment efficiency furthermore this study demonstrated that biomass productivity reached a threshold and then started to decline after 24 h and 30 h in rww and sww under both light regimes the conditions of the rww 24 0 h l d regime with rww media were found to give the maximum tertiary treatment efficiency suggesting that selected microalgae cultured under these conditions would be best suited for integrated wastewater treatment keywords c sorokiniana tertiary wastewater biomass production nutrient removal threshold time value added products 1 introduction the ever increasing world s population and rapid urbanization have led to the large scale depletion of fossil fuels and uncontrolled emission of greenhouse gases thus the present situation demands non renewable resources that can be produced using green technologies on a global scale cultivation of micro algae offers a promising solution as it has enormous potential to produce value added products such as proteins carbohydrates and lipids 1 in ancient times microalgae were utilized as a food supplement due to the prevailing drought conditions in china afterward it became an emerging technology in the field of usage of biomass as a feedstock for potential by products recovery 2 6 moreover microalgae have considerable advantages over traditional crops they proliferate with minimal land and water requirements and extract recalcitrant organic matter such as cellulose and lignin for their growth microalgae consume only one seventh of the water consumed by soy for producing the same amount of biomass 3 7 8 one study reported that microalgae produce 20 times more biodiesel than traditional crops 8 it can bioremediate various types of wastewater by utilizing the excess nutrients present an integrated system of wwt and algae cultivation provides energy security 9 the symbiotic relationship between microalgae and bacteria present in wastewater involves mutualistic association microalgae acts as a source of dissolved organic matter dom for bacteria which is utilized by them and remineralized into inorganic forms to support the growth of microalgae 50 microalgae especially diatoms and green algae exude metabolic products such as extra polymeric substance eps these accumulate on the microbial cell surface and provide protection to the cells and during periods of starvation can serve as carbon or energy source for microalgal cells 50 in nitrogen limiting environments symbiotic association between nitrogen fixing prokaryotes and photosynthetic microalgae provides biologically available nitrogen in the form of ammonium to microalgae in return algae provide dom to the bacteria for their growth inorganic phosphate is required by algae for the synthesis of dna rna and atp and other organic compounds bacteria hydrolyze dissolved organic phosphorus produced by algae into inorganic phosphate which is again utilized by algae for its growth establishing a symbiotic relationship 50 an added advantage is that it also produces some useful secondary metabolites which have applications in the field of medicines pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals therefore the idea of utilizing microalgal biomass to produce value added products is worth while especially for bio refinery industries 8 9 generally microalgal biomass is composed of different fractions of macromolecules such as carbohydrates 20 30 proteins 40 60 and lipids 10 20 which can be further processed to obtain many potential products such as biofuels biodiesel animal feed biofertilizers and bio active compounds 4 it is already reported that the percentage of different fractions of microalgal biomass can be easily modified under particular conditions 17 algal biomass rich in carbohydrates can be used for bioethanol production as shown in eq 1 47 some algal species such as picochlorum sp chlorella sp contain considerable amounts of lipids up to 70 whereas some species of microalgae accumulate lipids under nutrient stressed conditions and therefore can be used for biodiesel production as shown in eq 2 47 the algal biomass can also be used as feedstock for biogas production as given in eq 3 and for the production of animal feed biofertilizers and bio active compounds 4 18 47 1 carbohydrate saccharification c 6 h 12 o 6 fermentation c h 3 c h 2 oh c o 2 2 triacylglyceride c h 3 oh transesterification biodiesel glycerol 3 carbohydrates proteins lipids anaerobic digestion methanogenesis c h 4 c o 2 microalgae chlorella sorokiniana is one of the most widely used chlorella strains for co2 capture wastewater remediation and production of value added products 2 10 13 algal growth is highly dependent upon light intensity photoperiod regime inoculum dose and various stress conditions such as nutrients depletion the variability of ph and wastewater characteristics 13 16 46 the current technologies used in bio refinery industries lack optimization for algal strain selection and all other factors such as light inoculum dose nutrient concentration and media characteristics that affect its growth profiles and biomass accumulation 9 10 14 17 primary technologies for microalgae cultivation have already been established but low yields and high bioenergy costs are major impediments to large scale exploitation of microalgae 1 4 5 in this manner to make microalgae a commercially feasible feedstock the spotlight should be on diminishing the production cost and enhancing the productivity of algal biomass it has been observed in various studies that in algae dominated batch systems the algal growth reaches a threshold beyond which the algal cells start to die off which has an adverse effect as the bod cod values again start increasing because of the increased organic content 46 therefore in the integrated approach of wastewater management the algal biomass should be harvested before reaching this threshold time for achieving maximum treatment efficiency and this can also be used as a benchmark for the development of a continuous system therefore for achieving maximum algal biomass production with minimal energy input the parameters such as algal strain selection inoculum dose and l d cycles and nutrient concentration should be optimized to get minimum threshold time leading to overall reduced production cost this will also help in controlling the eutrophication of water bodies caused by the discharge of treated wastewater the studies done until now were mainly focused on achieving near complete removal of nutrients even if there was no significant algal biomass accumulation beyond the threshold time thus leading to overall high operating and production costs which outweigh the benefits of using microalgae as a potential bioremediation technique for wwt therefore in this study isolated algal strain c sorokiniana was cultivated in synthetic and in real tertiary wastewater under different photoperiod regimes to evaluate their effect on biomass production nutrient removal for estimation of carbohydrates proteins and photosynthetic pigments such as carotenoids carot and chlorophyll chl 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae inoculum and culture conditions microalgae strain chlorella

illumination was provided by a white fluorescent tube with an intensity of 140 μmol m 2 s 1 the study was done in two phases one with sww i and the other one with rww ii initially all reactors were inoculated with the same inoculum concentration of c sorokininana 650 700 mg l taken from culture stock 19 in each phase of the study further two subsequent batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of varying photoperiod regimes of 12 12 h and 24 0 h l d on the growth nutrient removal photosynthesis and value added products estimation all the batch experiments were conducted in the replica sww phase i and rww phase ii were used as a control or blank samples were drawn after every six hours over a period of 48 h from all the reactors and all analytical data was recorded as mean and standard deviation samples were processed with their physicochemical analysis 2 4 physicochemical analysis of wastewater organic carbon such as bod and cod nutrients such as nitrogen nh4 n no3 n tkn and phosphate were analyzed according to the standard methods for the estimation of water and wastewater 20 standard methods such as the azide modification method and the potassium dichromate method were used to calculate the bod and cod 20 no3 n nh4 n po4 p were analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr 6000 20 tkn was measured using the hach simplified tkn s tkn tnt

various conditions optical density od at 680 nm was used to calculate the specific growth rate μ and doubling time td 21 the following eqs 4 5 were used to calculate the specific growth rate μ and doubling time td 4 μ ln x t x 0 t 0 5 t d ln 2 μ xt biomass concentration at time t h x0 biomass concentration at 0th hour 21 here t is the threshold time 1 1 threshold time is the duration till which the maximum nutrient removal maximum nutrient uptake and cod removal was observed in this study beyond the threshold time cod values start to increase it is noted that eqs 4 and 5 can be used for any time frame 2 6 harvesting and pre treatment of biomass algal biomass was obtained by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 5 min in a refrigerated centrifuge the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 1 w v g 100 ml aqueous nacl solution it was again centrifuged and the washed pellet was further freeze dried by liquid nitrogen 196 c after this the dried biomass can be analyzed instantly or can be stored at 20 c for analyses at a later time for up to 10 days 2 7 pigments extraction a 100 acetone method was used to extract the chlorophyll content of microalgae absorption was taken at wavelength 663 nm and 645 nm against a solvent blank in hach dr 5000 spectrophotometer the following eqs 6 8 were used to calculate the total chlorophyll content mg l 44 6 c h l o r o p h y l

respectively the content of total carotenoids carot was calculated spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of acetone extract at 480 nm and the following eq 9 was used to calculate the content of carot 22 9 c a r o t m g l 4 a 480 2 8 protein and carbohydrate estimation the total carbohydrate content present in the algae biomass was estimated by the phenol sulphuric acid method and total protein by the standard lowry method 23 glucose and bovine serum albumin bsa were used as standards for phenol sulphuric acid method 24 and standard lowry method 23 respectively a

evaluate their effect on the growth cycle and biomass production of c sorokiniana cultivated in synthetic wastewater sww as well as in real tertiary wastewater rww the biomass production was monitored by measuring total suspended solids tss and optical density od at 680 nm after every six hours during cultivation fig 1 shows time wise variation of growth and biomass production of c sorokiniana cultivated in sww as well as in rww for both the photoperiod regimes microalgae cultivated under 24 0 h photoperiod regimes showed continuous growth till 30 h fig 1a and c whereas for 12 12 h photoperiod regimes growth showed rhythmic oscillations with light and dark phase which was found to be in accordance with the study done by xu et al 2016 fig 1b and d 21 this might be because of the increased biomass concentration during the light phase and decrease during the dark phase 21 overall the maximum average biomass productivities were 126 and 158 mg l d in sww and 319 and 548 mg l d in rww under 12 12 h and 24 0 h light regimes respectively denoting the threshold time table 3 microalgae cultivated in rww showed three times higher biomass productivity than that of sww under both light regimes the initial concentration of nutrients tn p 7 3 1 present in rww was higher table 2 which is why the biomass production was higher in rww as compared to sww tn p 3 4 1 as per the study 25 the ratio of n p strongly affects the rate of biomass production of chlorella sp and it can be improved multiple times by the addition of a particular dose of anaerobic digestion centrate to secondary effluent 25 table 3 shows the effects of different photoperiod regimes on biomass productivity mg l d specific growth rate d 1 and doubling time 2 2 doubling time is a time at which the microalgal population doubled in size td of c sorokininana cultivated in sww and rww among all the highest average biomass productivity 548 mg l d specific growth rate 0 59 d 1 and lower doubling time 1 17 td were observed in rww under a photoperiod of 24 0 h l d which means these are the most suitable conditions for the growth of the strain c sorokiniana used in this study c sorokinana under 12 12 h l d regimes in sww showed the lowest growth profiles in terms of specific growth rate and biomass productivity in the present study the biomass productivity is much higher as compared to the previously reported biomass productivity values for chlorella sp biomass productivity mg l d of chlorella sp were 20 281 mg l d at different culture conditions and wastewater media 13 14 25 26 28 40 the changes in their biomass productivity are influenced by many biotic and abiotic factors 46 in the present study it is concluded that the l d period n p ratio of wastewater were the main limiting factors to microalgal growth in sww which is in accordance with earlier studies reported by many researchers 14 25 27 the correlation between tss and od was implied to check the data accuracy fig s1 supplementary information variation in initial od values from 0 7 0 9 was because of the difference in the color and initial nutrient concentration of sww and rww 15 16 it has already been reported that the dilution rate of wastewater and the difference in color intensity quantifies the initial value of od wastewater with lower dilution ratio gave higher initial od values 1 v v 1 3 nm whereas the higher dilution ratio gave lower initial od values 0 17 v v 0 2 nm 15 moreover the initial concentration of nutrients present in wastewater also affects light penetration and subsequently affects the od values 16 in the present study a linear regression approach was used to find out the correlation between the growth od and biomass production tss of microalgae the value of regression coefficient r2 0 9348 and 0 9122 for the algae growth cultivated in 24 0 h l d in both the wastewaters showed the variable tss and od had a linear relationship in this particular mode of cultivation in a particular threshold time of 24 30 h fig s1b and c 3 2 nutrient removal 3 2 1 nitrogen and phosphorus fig 2 a and b summarizes the nutrient removal n and p efficiencies of c sorokiniana in the sww and rww respectively at different photoperiod regimes 12 12 h and 24 0 h in sww total nitrogen tn content decreased from the initial value of 12 mg l to 5 95 mg l and 7 76 mg l and in rww it decreased from the 31 mg l to 12 54 mg l and 12 8 mg l for 24 0 h and 12 12 h photoperiod regimes respectively similarly in sww the initial phosphorus content decreased from 3 5 mg l to 0 74 mg l and 2 05 mg l and in rww it decreased from 4 2 mg l to 1 5 mg l and 1 67 mg l for 24 0 h and 12 12 h photoperiod regimes respectively additionally table 4 shows the nutrient removal efficiencies maximum nutrient uptake rate and threshold time of c sorokiniana in the sww and rww respectively for different photoperiod regimes 12 12 h and 24 0 h the maximum nutrient removal tn 60 p 85 and nutrient uptake rate were observed for rww under 24 0 h photoperiod regime table 4 microalgae preferably uptake nitrogen in the form of ammonical nitrogen 31 45 therefore nitrogen removal is higher in rww because the ammonical nitrogen is approximately 4 times higher in rww as compared to sww 31 45 more than 90 of nh4 n removal was observed in all different reactors conditions it is already reported that an optimum amount of nh4 n is required for better growth in the case of chlorella sp safafar 45 evaluated the effect of different concentrations of nh4 n such as 50 100 and 150 mg l on microalgal growth and showed that microalgal growth increases with increasing concentration of ammonia in the present study overall tn removal is lower and p removal was in the same range as reported previously for chlorella sp grown in tertiary treated landfill leachate tn 86 p 96 6 secondary effluent tn 82 5 p 86 25 secondary effluent tn 92 p 86 28 0 2 μm membrane filtered primary wastewater nh4 n 94 18 p 97 69 respectively 29 wang et al 41 grew chlorella pyrenoida in diluted piggery wastewater and showed lower removal of tn 54 7 and p 31 at higher dilution rates initial cod 250 mg l tn 20 mg n l p 3 5 mg p l whereas the nutrient removal efficiencies improved by lowering the dilution rates by increasing nutrient concentration it depicted that the initial nutrient concentration and its ratio present in the media highly influence the overall treatment efficiency the phosphorus removal was higher in rww as compared to the sww under the 12 12 h l d regime because of the presence of an optimum n p ratio of 7 3 1 as p uptake is dependent upon external n and p supply in a study it has been reported that c sorokinana removed 40 60 phosphorus from a mixture of piggery and municipal wastewater which is lower than that of the removal observed in the present study within 24 30 h 47 the nutrient removal reported in the literature with chlorella sp showed removal efficiencies with a residence time minimum of 3 10 days whereas the removal in the present study was observed in 24 30 h this might be because of the higher initial inoculum dose 700 mg l of microalgae present in all the systems and is also mentioned in previously reported studies 19 25 3 2 2 cod removal in fig 3 a cod value decreased from 250 mg l to 172 mg l and 160 mg l till 30 h in sww for 24 0 h and 12 12 h photoperiod regimes respectively in fig 3b the cod value decreased from 125 mg l to 80 6 mg l and 65 mg l till 24 h in rww for 24 0 h and 12 12 h photoperiod regimes respectively the cod removal efficiencies were comparable to the previously reported literature 28 41 overall lower cod removal was observed in all the cases it might be because isolated c sorokiniana showed autotrophic growth in all conditions the results show that the threshold time was 30 h and 24 h in sww and rww respectively this observation is concluded based on cod values as they increased beyond the threshold time suggesting that there is an increase in the organic matter indicating algal death which is also corroborated by the decrease in the algal biomass content and nutrients assimilation this data suggests the timeline by which all the algal biomass should be harvested to get the efficient tertiary wastewater treatment 3 3 microalgae pigments total chlorophyll and carotenoids pigment composition in green algae mainly consists of chlorophyll chl and carotenoids carot estimation of pigments described the changes that occurred in the photosynthetic process to evaluate the variations that occurred during microalgae growth both chl and carot were estimated spectrophotometrically fig 4 demonstrates that the maximum amount of chl and carot reached till 30 36 h for both the photoperiod regimes of 24 0 h and 12 12 h in all the cultivation conditions and thereafter started to decrease beyond this point however the pattern of attaining the maximum accumulation was different for both the photoperiod regimes fig 4 the highest content of chl and carot was observed with rww in the 24 0 h l d period in sww chl increased from 19 mg l to 26 mg l and 22 mg l under 24 0 h and 12 12 h l d period respectively likewise in rww chl increased from 22 mg l to 57 mg l and 60 mg l under 24 0 h and 12 12 h l d respectively fig 4 overall the highest carot production 10 11 mg l was reported in c sorokiniana cultivated in rww under both the photoperiod regimes fig 4c and d both external and internal factors affect the process of photosynthesis the external factors are light intensity carbon dioxide concentration and temperature and internal factors include the chl and carot content the internal factors are themselves dependent upon the nutrient concentration and the type of algal species specifically the concentrations of nitrogen and carbon present in media as they play an essential role in the photosynthesis and production of chlorophyll 29 31 ji et al 44 observed chl a content was 2980 μg l in the presence of algae bacteria when biomass was 900 mg l in hydraulic retention time hrt of 6 days whereas in the present study chl a reached up to 22 50 mg l with a biomass concentration of 1024 mg l within 30 h in rww 24 0 h l d which is significantly more than the above mentioned study 44 in the present study it was observed that the amount of both the pigments increased in the light phase and decreased in the dark phase fig 4b and c which means c sorokininana grew an autotrophic mode in both the wastewater types photosynthesis does not take place in the dark and therefore requires light as the main source of energy light is electromagnetic radiation and based on its wavelength it can be divided into several components photosynthetically active radiation par lies in the visible range of the spectrum 400 700 nm and is absorbed by the photosynthetic pigments chlorophylls carotenoids and phycobilins photosynthesis begins at low light intensities and increases proportionately with increasing light intensity until it reaches a plateau after this any further increase in light intensities does not affect the rate of photosynthesis 10 21 in light limiting conditions the organism increases pigmentation that is increases the number of photosynthetic units and or size of the light harvesting complexes lhc s in contrast to this it had been demonstrated by song and pei 2018 that the highest amount of chlorophyll 7 5 mg l and carotenoids 2 mg l were observed by the supplementation of xylose 4 g l in mixotrophic conditions using strain scenedesmus quadricauda initial inoculum 30 mg l during the batch study of 14 days 30 nitrogen is the main precursor of photosynthesis and its limitation in the media reduced the amount of pigments so the reduction of pigments after 30 36 h was observed when the culture became substrate limited refer to section 3 2 one study analyzed the effect of nitrogen limitation on the photosynthetic activity of algae which demonstrated that there was a 62 5 reduction in chl a due to nitrogen limitation in autotrophic growth of spirulina platensis 43 3 4 protein and carbohydrate accumulation a comparison is made between the accumulation of proteins and carbohydrates by cultivating c sorokiniana in synthetic and real wastewater under 24 0 h as well as in 12 12 h l d cycles quantitative estimation of intracellular protein and carbohydrate of c sorokiniana showed variations under varying photoperiod regimes protein and carbohydrate content were measured at starting and at the end of the study to calculate the overall increase during the study the estimated increase in protein and carbohydrate content showed significant variations with respect to different photoperiod regimes and the wastewater used fig 5 initial values of protein 21 and carbohydrate 32 of total algal biomass were approximately similar in both the wastewaters in sww an increase in the protein and carbohydrate content was approximately the same 7 and 6 5 in the photoperiod of 24 0 h whereas in the 12 12 h photoperiod the increase in protein and carbohydrate accumulation was very low at the end of the study there was no increase 0 in protein content and a very low increase 2 in carbohydrate content was observed in sww under 12 12 h l d cycles fig 5 the percentage increase in the accumulation of protein and carbohydrate content was 15 and 5 respectively through microalgae cultivating rww 24 0 h l d cycle as already reported in earlier studies accumulations were dependent upon the ability of a strain to grow mixotrophically in the dark phase as well as the duration of the l d period 32 36 the growth of an isolated strain of c sorokiniana used in the present study showed no traits of mixotrophy that is why the dark phase had a negative effect on protein and carbohydrate accumulation numerous researchers have already explained the positive relationship between protein and chlorophyll content 37 39 nitrogen starved conditions induce stress on the chlorophyll protein complex which results in decreased protein production 32 37 along with this the n p ratio of wastewater media as well as the algal cellular n p ratio is one of the significant factors which are taken into consideration in the present study the increase in the percentage content of protein 10 15 in the rww was high as compared to protein content accumulated in sww by considering the n p ratios of both the wastewater types table 2 it can be concluded that a higher ratio of n p 7 3 1 in rww promoted the algal growth via more nitrogen assimilation in the system which ultimately promoted the chlorophyll content therefore the accumulation of protein in rww was higher than in sww fig 5 fig 5 represented that the accumulated protein content is 7 10 higher in rww as compared to sww in both the light durations whereas measured carbohydrate content is approximately the same irrespective of wastewater used and light duration the carbohydrate and protein accumulation requires a sufficient supply of carbon and nitrogen to algal cells which justify the more protein accumulation using rww fig 5 carbohydrate is slightly higher in sww because of the higher carbon content present in it table 2 therefore in the present study the composition of nutrients present in wastewater made a significant impact on the removal efficiency and value added product recovery through microalgae 37 39 42 3 5 energy input cost and biomass considerations one more added advantage of setting cut off time threshold is that it also helps in lowering the energy input imparted operational cost into the system in the present study batch reactors were used in a lab scale set up there were mainly two types of energies light energy energy from stirrer motor imparted into all reactors the energy input of all the reactors in different l d photoperiod regimes was compared and the cost analysis is summarized in table 5 table 5 shows the total energy input and its respective cost relative to the threshold time the result revealed that the input energy cost can be potentially reduced only when the threshold time is set as the experiments ran for 48 h but in all reactors the maximum biomass productivity nutrient removal value added products were achieved during the threshold time 24 30 h after this threshold time the cod values start increasing and biomass starts decreasing and successful tertiary wastewater treatment is beneficial only when the nutrients and toxic pollutants organic biomass can be eliminated this analysis further highlights that excluding that extra time for the running bioreactor is imperative to cost effectively produce sustainable algal biomass a study was done to evaluate the cost analysis revenue and operating of wastewater treatment through c sorokinana and found that most of the energy was consumed by artificial lights 48 so adding a dark phase for some time to the bioreactors is beneficial for cost reduction similarly it was observed that the running cost of rww reactor under the 12 12 h photoperiod regime was the lowest table 5 the algal biomass produced desired bioproducts such as protein chlorophylls carotenoids carbohydrates estimation of the economics of algal biomass is assessed through the market value of the desired products 33 48 the current global market value for carotenoids is estimated at 1 2 1 4 billion carotenoids such as astaxanthin β carotene lutein are having a market value of 233 334 million bioethanol market worth is 64 8 billion 33 algae based biofertilizer is comparable to organic fertilizers and chemical fertilizers 49 if biomass is harvested before microalgal s threshold time for a particular system then it will naturally reduce the cost of purification while undergoing the downstream processing and also increase the total sustainability of the integrated wastewater system 34 due to this analysis dependent upon threshold time the algal biomass generated will be profitable if all these above mentioned bio products are processed and marketed after scaling up the process one study described that there is a need for consideration of irradiance threshold but the time of irradiance is also important to get the desired product 34 there is still very resultant noise in the experimental data literature that needs to be calibrated for microalgal biomass production and its valuable resource recovery 34 so in this context further study is needed to get an insight into the optimum integrated approach to check the efficacy and utilization of the algal biomass 4 future recommendations the results of the present study indicated that photoperiod variation and wastewater type have a considerable impact on biomass production nutrients removal photosynthetic pigments production and value added products such as protein and carbohydrate accumulation the findings of the study can contribute significantly to reducing the eutrophication deciding the operational parameter such as photoperiod and wastewater type characteristics and threshold or cut off time with due consideration to overall cost by benefit analysis for future research the long term effects of dark and light cycles on the performance of the integrated wastewater treatment system can be evaluated and also the mechanism of cellular changes taking place because of this can be elucidated to better understand the changes at the molecular level as the scope of the present study was limited only to the microalgal biomass evaluation for value added products such as estimation of pigments chlorophyll and carotenoids protein carbohydrate for presenting a comparative study therefore as a future recommendation proper downstream processing can be carried out to recover the purified products and do their assessment to achieve overall cost effectiveness 5 conclusions the integrated microalgae based wastewater treatment approach can be used for biomass recovery which can be utilized for bioenergy production and conversion to value added products in this way microalgae can be used to achieve dual objectives of reducing wastewater treatment costs and cleaner bioenergy production leading to a circular economy the results of the study showed that microalgae c sorokinana gave promising results for wastewater treatment and biomass production in comparison to sww c sorokiniana grew well in rww and showed the lowest cost highest biomass productivity specific growth rate and percentage increase in total chlorophyll and total carotenoids for 24 0 h l d cycles the conditions of continuous illumination improved biomass production and value added product recovery suggesting that c sorokiniana prefers autotrophic growth in both rww and sww algal cells start to die off after 24 h and 36 h respectively these time values indicate the threshold levels for biomass productivity suggesting that biomass should be harvested after reaching threshold time which will help in reducing the treatment cost these results are extremely useful as the accumulation of value added products such as pigments chlorophyll and carotenoids proteins and carbohydrates enhance its economic feasibility for large scale cultivation the resulting biomass with value added product recovery can be further processed and used for energy resource recovery with further downstream processing the precursor of value added products can also be used in the pharmaceutical and food industries hence the results obtained in this integrated algae wastewater system can also be used for scaling up to large scale cultivation systems which will treat ww in a more sustainable eco friendly and cost efficient manner declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of

13678,penicillins pens are β lactam antibiotics with significant environmental toxicology this review aimed to synthesise the research efforts on the removal of pens via a variety of separation degradation and biological processes it was observed that isotropic microporous microfiltration membranes are not effective for rejecting pens due to their large uniform pore size distribution researchers favoured the application of nanofiltration membrane and adsorption as separation technologies carbon based adsorbents were the most efficient class of adsorbents for pens removal from water lewis acid base interactions hydrogen bonding electrostatic attraction and π π interactions were the main adsorption mechanisms generally the ultraviolet irradiation assisted advanced oxidation processes aops and the fenton like processes outperformed the electrochemical and ultrasonic assisted aops for pens degradation aops must be incorporated with other methods of treatment to minimise potential costs in terms of energy time equipment and chemicals for biological processes for pens removal anaerobic treatment processes were observed to be more efficient for the removal of pens than aerobic processes with the exception of microfiltration and electrocoagulation most other processes were found to be effective for the removal of pens from water albeit with some disadvantages from the review it can be surmised that there has been great research progress on the subject and many new findings have been obtained in recent times though there is still much work to be done

treatment plants keywords amoxicillin adsorption penicillin membrane advanced oxidation processes 1 introduction in recent times there have been grave ecological concerns due to the proliferation of antibiotics in the aquatic environment 1 2 the extent of detection of these pharmaceutically active compounds phacs has also been on the rise 3 4 their release into the environment is usually through pharmaceutical industry effluent hospital effluent 5 aquacultural activities and runoffs from animal feedlots 6 7 these phacs have been known to have a deleterious effect on aquatic flora and fauna 8 penicillin pen was discovered in the early 20th century by alexander fleming 9 despite more than 75 years of clinical use 10 it is still one of the most frequently utilised antibiotic in contemporary times 11 it can exist in different forms based on a variety of molecular arrangements 12 due to their widespread use pens are inadvertently one of the occurring phacs in the aquatic environment 13 pens are β lactam class of antibiotics and they are quite recalcitrant in the aqueous environment 14 they usually get into the aqueous environment by agricultural and veterinary applications 15 16 the importance of sustainable water management for the achievement of environmental sustainability cannot be overemphasised 17 in line with these goals researchers have over the years developed more sophisticated hybrid water treatment processes in the physico chemical and biological domain for the treatment of antibiotics such as pen and amoxicillin amx from water mitigation strategies employed for the removal of pen from water include adsorption 18 membrane separation 19 advanced oxidation processes 20 21 biological processes 5 and a host of others within the scope of the authors exhaustive search the varieties of processes employed specifically for the removal of pen g pen v and amx from water does not have a dedicated review paper this is an important gap in knowledge that the current paper intends to fill this short review aims to synthesise the research efforts on the removal of pens via a variety of separation degradation and biological processes the review is to provide an assessment of research progress highlight key papers in the domain of each technique compare and discuss the intricacies of the various mitigation strategies identify gaps in knowledge in the research area and predict interesting areas future for work in light of the need for environmental protection and sustainable development the removal of such antibiotic in water is an important concept that needs a well structured review this therefore underlines the significance of the current study this therefore underlines the significance of this study in terms of the literature utilised the focus of the study was the last decade however older papers that had a key impact and important contributions to the research progress were also included in the review the choice of pen g pen v and amx as the interest of the review as opposed to other β lactams class of antibiotics is due to its wider usage and popularity especially in developing countries 2 ecotoxicology of penicillins pen and amx are a group of antibiotic that is used for the treatment of bacterial infection the general chemical structure of pens is shown in fig 1 with r as the variable group this means that we have different types of pens based on the r group these include pen g pen v procaine pen and benzathine pen others are now being referred to by other trade names such as amoxicillin amx ampicillin amp dicloxacillin nafcillin and oxacillin in this brief section the ecotoxicology of pen and amx are discussed this was presented as a precursor to the review itself to help the readers in gaining an understanding of the negative implications of pen and amx in the environment furthermore it serves as a justification for the importance of removing it from the aqueous environment β lactams class of antibiotics has been shown to have very high ecotoxicology in comparison with other pharmaceuticals based on an apical acute aquatic effects prioritisation technique 22 toxicity of pen g to a cyanobacterial mat by single toxicity test revealed an ec50 value of 0 13 mg l 23 the acute toxicity test by tong et al 24 to determine the eco toxicological effect of pens revealed that amoxicillin amx and ampicillin amp at 50 mg l initial concentration had 15 20 inhibition of vibrio fischeri bioluminescence in bioassay after 30 min exposure in the effluent the authors surmised that it is not sensitive at initial concentration of 50 mg l it has also been observed from algal bio assay that amx is not toxic to eukaryotic organisms such as closterium ehrenbergii and pseudokirkneriella subcapitata at 50 ng l concentration but showed significant toxicity to synechococcus leopolensis even at such low concentrations 25 daphnia magna acute toxicity tests have also revealed a negative impact of pen which can be as high as 80 death for untreated effluent having 600 mg l cod 48 mg l bod and unknown pen conc with 50 dilution 21 pens had shown toxicity in this order effluent groundwater surface water 24 at the same concentration though the reasons were not provided by the authors this could be due to the complementary effect of other pollutants in the water as effluents are conventionally more polluted than ground or surface water in line with these investigations another recent study has also confirmed the negative environmental effect of different types of pen and amx 26 even after going through anaerobic degradation based on these discussions it can be surmised that pens have an ecotoxicological effect on the environment pens usually exist around 1 1000 μg l in the aquatic environment and 1 1000 mg l in wastewater treatment plants 27 at such concentrations ranges the ecotoxicological effect has been observed the significance of removing pens from the environment is thereby justified 3 separation processes 3 1 membrane separation processes membrane separation is a key type of separation process due to its characteristics of providing selective permeation to specific components species in a mixture 28 reverse osmosis ro ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf are the major membrane types applied in membrane separation while nanofiltration nf membranes are the hybrid trade off between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membranes 29 30 these membrane types are conceptually similar but their varied pore diameters dramatically differentiate their applications the effectiveness of different membrane types in effluent treatment with particular interest in antibiotics especially amx and pen rejection from aqueous environment have been demonstrated it was however observed that the rejection of these antibiotics is dependent on their particulate nature either charged or neutral and molecular sizes ph of the medium and membrane properties 31 furthermore the dominant mechanism could be either one or a combination of size exclusion charge exclusion and solute solvent membrane interactions 32 the superiority of any of the mechanism in a given filtration process is a function of the antibiotic s physicochemical properties particle size pka etc membrane properties nature of the material pore size etc and characteristics of medium ph ionic strength etc 33 the review of works on membrane application for the rejection of amx and pen is discussed in this section it was noted that isotropic microporous microfiltration membranes are likely not effective for rejecting amx and pen as evidenced in the absence of any journal article to that respect this could be due to their large uniform pore size distribution 0 1 μm which is quite porous for such applications similarly there are few studies on the use of uf as a standalone and as part of an integrated treatment system the effectiveness of a novel integration of uf membrane me activated carbon adsorption a and ultrasonic irradiation us for the rejection of amx and other emerging contaminants ecs from synthetic 34 and real 35 effluents were investigated the rejection efficiencies and mechanisms of the treatment techniques at standalone only me and integrated ame and usame mode were further studied for the synthetic effluent findings showed that the dispersion of powdered ac to the uf membrane surface that is ame system resulted in about 99 improvement in the amx rejection as opposed to the 10 rejection achieved with me 34 similarly about 100 of amx rejection was achieved with usame it was further deduced that the overall mechanism responsible for the rejection of amx and other ecs in the studied system was solute adsorption onto the powdered ac on the membrane surface notably us irradiation improved the powdered ac adsorption capacity by creating cavitation and micro streaming effect which reduced powdered ac particle size thus resulting in increased adsorption sites 34 when applied as an innovative tertiary treatment for real secondary effluent above 99 rejection of amx and other ecs was recorded using the hybrid usame while about 90 and 30 rejection was achieved using ame and me respectively 35 the application of usame was successful at mitigating the incidence of membrane fouling by nom in the treatment of real life effluent asides integrated use studies revealed that uf support membrane with a thin film coating incorporating suitable additive is efficient for amx rejection this assertion was demonstrated by a near perfect about 99 amx rejection achieved using thin film ultrafiltration composite membrane with a poly vinyl alcohol selective layer incorporating a polyelectrolyte 31 in nf membrane applications permeate transport mechanism was identified to be through diffusion whose rate is strongly influenced by either the pressure concentration or charge potentials 30 it was also observed that amx rejection especially from nf membrane with surface hydrophilicity is as a result of size and donnan exclusion 36 37 solute solubility and diffusivity 30 thus antibiotics of uniform molecular sizes can be preferentially rejected provided they sustain significantly varied concentration on the membrane material steric hindrance for uncharged solutes and electrostatic steric hindrance effect for charged solutes were also identified as having a significant effect on amx separation 38 40 furthermore the effect of ph 41 43 and the ionic composition 36 on amx rejection by nf was reported by adjusting the ph of the feed effluent to the alkaline region ph 8 3 10 0 high amx rejection of 99 09 42 85 41 and 91 43 were achieved the integration of nf and fenton process for the mitigation of membrane fouling and to engender improved amx rejection was reported 44 the study demonstrated that the incorporation of different fe based nanoparticles goethite and maleate ferroxane into polyacrylonitrile nf membrane film resulted in high amx rejection efficiency improved permeate flux and flux recovery ratio was also high above 96 due to the absence of discrete pores it was deduced that the free volume areas served as the main permeation channel during ro membrane filtration 30 only a few works reported the application of ro membrane in the recovery of our antibiotics of interest from synthetic 45 and real life effluent 46 the study by gholami et al 45 depicted size exclusion effect as being responsible for attaining up to 95 amx rejection in an ro membrane process it was also observed that the studied process variables operating temperature pressure and ph independently influenced the process while their interactive effect was non significant similarly by using the ro membrane 100 amx and pen removal were achieved in the treatment of secondary effluent from a treatment plant 46 table 1 presents the reports on the application of different membrane types in the removal of amx and pen antibiotics from effluent and sorted in decreasing order of removal efficiency the literature survey showed that numerous researchers favoured the application of nf membrane as compared to ro membrane irrespective of their outstanding performance in species rejection this finding could be related to the fact that ro treatment usually overshoots the intended water quality objective by depleting the concentration of other useful dissolved minerals and hardness in addition to the species of concern to such a detrimental extent 30 it was also observed that very few works exist on the pen removal as compared to amx even though both antibiotics are pens this observation is unconnected with the fact that pen narrow spectrum antibiotics is mainly efficacious against only gram positive organisms hence its treatment application is limited and is being gradually discontinued 47 meanwhile amx which is effective against a wide range of bacteria is heavily used thus its huge presence as a contaminant in pharmaceutical hospital effluents 3 2 adsorption in this section the recent advances in the adsorption of pens are discussed the focus of the discussion is on the solution chemistry and the recent types of adsorbent material that has been used to remove pens from aqueous solution for the adsorption process the adsorbate pen or amx is dissociated at ph pka 51 in this ph regime adsorption is usually by electrostatic interaction with the adsorbent however the point of zero charge phpzc of the adsorbent also plays a significant role because it helps us identify the net surface charge of the adsorbent at a specific ph for the non ionised adsorbate other physical attraction forces become the major mechanism responsible for adsorption the intricacies of solution ph and adsorption mechanism vary from one adsorption system to the other 52 this is a key reason why the optimum ph in table 2 can be observed to vary from one adsorption system to the other for pen g adsorption removal has been shown to decrease with increasing ph 53 and vice versa 54 this is due to the way the pka and phpzc are affected by the ph at very low ph the high concentration of the more mobile h will compete significantly with the antibiotics for active sites a recent study revealed that of β lactams antibiotics such as pen amx and amp can be simultaneously removed in aqueous media using ternary adsorbate system and an iron nickel bimetallic adsorbent supported on bentonite 55 in the competitive adsorption system 94 6 amx 80 6 amp and 53 7 pen was successfully removed thus suggested that amx had a higher affinity for the adsorbent in the aqueous system a competitive adsorption study has also been performed from amx and tetracycline using ac from durian shell in a mechanistic modelling study 56 it was observed that there was less removal in the binary system than for the single systems which are due to the greater competition for active sites by the adsorbate in the binary system pens can also be effectively removed in a fixed bed continuous flow set up 57 in another interesting study the batch and fixed bed column adsorption of amx has been considered using commercial ac 58 the batch study was best fit to sips isotherm while the fixed bed process was best fit for the yan model a recent study 59 has carefully conducted the mechanistic investigation in amx adsorption albeit for metal organic frameworks mofs it was observed that lewis acid base interactions were the main adsorption mechanisms although hydrogen bonding and π π interactions could also be identified besides these competitive adsorption studies fixed bed column studies and mechanistic studies most other investigations in recent years have taken the conventional route of novel adsorbent development and evaluation of sorption capacity and removal efficiency via batch experiments other materials that have been explored for pens adsorption in recent times include commercial ac 60 61 nh4cl induced ac 62 63 powdered ac 1 granular ac 64 ac from capsules of cashew of para 65 converter slag 66 multi walled cnt 67 iron benzoate iron oxalate and cobalt modified ac 68 and bimetallic fe ni nanoparticles 69 table 2 summarises the adsorption capacities of different adsorption media for pens and arranged in order of decreasing q m a x in mg g all adsorption capacity values are reported to four significant figures the ph and temperature at which these values are obtained are also reported to help show the reasons for any discrepancies observed the ph effect has been discussed the temperature was reported because the nature of the enthalpy adsorption process will control the optimal removal and specificity is required in this domain while reporting the q m a x values furthermore the method of determining the adsorption capacity was also stated in table 2 this is usually calculated from experiments or predicted from the adsorption capacity for isotherms such as langmuir and sips 70 71 it can be observed that a large number of adsorbent materials have been investigated as sorbents for the removal of pens from water carbon based adsorbents are the most efficient class of adsorbents for pens removal from water however adsorbents from clay mofs polymers and resins have not been extensively studied for pens furthermore the disposal of used adsorbent has not been considered lewis acid base interactions hydrogen bonding electrostatic attraction and π π interactions are the main adsorption mechanisms 3 3 other separation processes asides those already discussed the other separation processes effective for amx and pen removal from effluent is presented here the dissolved air flotation process was reported as effective in pen g removal from synthetic effluent with a relatively high removal efficiency of 67 45 99 the aggregation of the pen g molecules particles into floatable flocs occurred via the particle electrostatic charge reduction initiated in the presence of polyaluminum chloride coagulants also pen g was successfully removed from effluent via electrodialysis operated under constant current 100 and voltage 101 in both types of electrodialysis operation the size of the pen g ions and their degree of attraction towards the ion exchange membrane governed the process the effectiveness of the electrocoagulation process for the removal of amx and pen was also investigated the ineffectiveness of the process for the removal of pens was pointed out 102 meanwhile about 98 98 removal was reported in the case of amx using an aluminium electrode at ph 7 60 v and electrolysis time of 75 min 103 4 advanced oxidation processes nowadays amongst different water treatment methods the advanced oxidation process aops is an assuring method for the removal of diverse antibiotics including pen g and amx due to their high oxidation potentials and extraordinary efficiency in the oxidative degradation of organic recalcitrant compounds 104 to give inert end products 105 they are new water decontamination technologies that have found extensive utilisation in the previous years because of their flexibility and comprehensive range of applicability the aops comprise the set of highly successful approaches for wastewater handling and management 105 106 although aops give high removal efficiencies for different pollutants in water and generate a low amount of sludge they possess some setbacks such as high cost of the procedure they are highly selective for the high effectiveness of removal of different pollutants 107 due to its high cost of operation they have not been fully added into viable usage on a large scale most particularly the developing countries example nigeria aops were ﬁrstly suggested by glaze 108 different aops mechanisms are presented in table 3 the aops differ from each other in the way in which the radicals oh so4 ho2 etc required for the pollutants degradation are generated although the utilisation of the advanced oxidation method alone is not so efficient the introduction of several chemical materials such as persulfate ps nanoparticles and catalytic particles could increase its efficiency 112 aops are either performed in the presence of catalysts e g transition metal ions or oxides catalytic processes or the absence of catalysts non catalytic processes catalysts increase the cavitation effect and the rate of organic molecules decomposition 114 the catalysts employed are mainly nanoparticles since nanoparticles are have been shown to be effective nanoparticles have provided unique optical catalytic semi conductive and piezoelectric properties that are developed technologically 112 the aops take advantage of the high capacities of oxidation by hydroxyl radicals oh and sulphate radicals so 4 generated in situ the processes 114 these radicals react rapidly with most organic compounds to degrade them within close diffusion limited rates 118 these degradation processes will diminish the level of organic pollutants in water the success of the aops are dependent on the efficiency of the oxidant oh which is the second recognised species with higher oxidant power after fluorine 119 oh are less choosy and very reactive than the other oxidants due to their standard oxidation potential e 0 of 2 8 v which is greater than that of the other conventional oxidants 120 the so 4 has e 0 of 2 6 v which is usually generated from peroxydisulfate pds also known as persulfate or peroxymonosulfate pms using uv heat or catalysts 114 121 the oh are widely employed than the other powerful oxidants since no additional waste is generated when used they are not toxic have a very short lifetime not corrosive to equipment and are produced by assemblies that are simple to operate these radicals should be generated in sufficient quantity to interact with the organic compounds these organic compounds are mineralised to co2 h2o and inorganic salts 122 oh radicals are produced with the aid of primary oxidants such as ozone oxygen and hydrogen peroxide energy sources such as ultraviolet light electric current ultrasound and gamma γ radiation and catalysts 123 aops can be classified into homogeneous processes and heterogeneous processes distinguishing between those that operate with an external input of energy radiant energy ultrasonic energy electrical energy and those that do not these oxidative treatment processes can also be classified into four categories namely 1 the photocatalytic processes in homogeneous phase and or heterogeneous phase uv h2o2 uv o3 uv fe2 h2o2 uv catalyst etc using uv ultraviolet radiation or visible light 2 the chemical oxidation processes in homogeneous phase fe2 h2o2 o3 h2o2 etc 3 the sonochemical processes using ultrasonics us and 4 the electrochemical oxidation processes a combination of the mentioned categories can be employed to yield a greater degradation percentage or lower adsorbate concentration the major metabolite of pen is penilloic acid in acidic medium and penillic acid in basic medium while others are penicilloic acid isopenillic acid 124 and penicilloaldehyde 125 details of the mechanism of degradation of pen g into the metabolites are shown in fig 2 126 chen et al 127 suggested that the residual cod observed after the aops treatment of amx could be due to the presence of metabolites but the specific compounds were not elucidated generally the metabolites of pens can be detected in stable forms in the environment despite the degradation process requiring the opening up of the β lactams rings 125 the metabolites have been shown to also possess an environmental risk 19 125 though most research studies do not focus on them in aops investigations for pens aops have been employed by many researchers for the removal of pen and amx from different aqueous media tables 4 7 summaries the uv radiation assisted aops chemical assisted aops us assisted aops and the electrochemical assisted aops used by various researchers for the degradation of pens 4 1 photolytic processes photolytic processes are aops that utilises uv light either artificial or natural and gamma γ radiation or radiolysis as the sources of energy which will aid in the photolytic yield of oh for faster pollutant degradation its mechanism is to break the chemical bonds present in the pollutants by direct photolysis 128 but this process can be enhanced by the introduction of other materials from table 4 it can be observed that the use of combinations of two or more of the aops types led to higher amx pen cod and toc removal the use of uv alone photolysis was not effective for pen g and amx degradation 129 table 4 the degradation process was improved when a catalyst was added 130 131 termed photocatalytic degradation and when h2o2 a very strong oxidant 132 ozone o3 133 persulfate ps 134 135 or combinations with nanocatalyst iron ions fe3 and fe2 photo fenton 133 136 and us 137 138 were introduced into the uv alone process 132 table 4 this improvement is as a result increased oh production with the addition of other materials which will facilitate the process of degradation the presence of a catalyst in the system will enhance the rate of cavitation bubbles formation by offering nucleation sites which will enhance the generation of free radicals 111 the application of the numerous uv assisted aops resulted in a 100 reduction for amx table 4 the ionising gamma irradiation is another process for the degradation of persistent organic contamiants the colour of the light energy source also influences the degradation of pen g as observed in table 4 white light max of 99 as a source of irradiation was more active than the use of blue 88 yellow 28 and green 50 for the degradation of pen g 131 table 4 other factors such as the light intensity ph temperature irradiation time catalyst type and catalyst dose had a great impact on the pens degradation 4 2 chemical oxidation processes chemical oxidation processes are chemicals fe2 fe3 ps h2o2 ozone etc assisted processes table 5 summaries the chemical assisted aops used by various researchers for the reduction of amx pen cod and toc the use of ozonation alone a strong oxidant decomposes in water to form stronger oxidants oh was efficient for pen g 162 and amx 133 mineralisation table 5 the ozonation mechanism is based on oh creation which is related to the rate of ozonation in the system 128 which can be weakened by the existence of radical scavengers in the system however pollutants efficiency can be improved when the process of ozonation is combined with other materials such as fe2 133 and h2o2 153 the presence of fe2 or fe3 with h2o2 fenton process produces oh the fe functions as the catalyst 105 this process can be enhanced further for higher efficiency by the involvement of uv irradiation us or other energy sources since more oh are produced compared to dark fenton processes the assisted fenton like process was more effective than the fenton like process alone for pen g degradation 136 tables 5 7 from tables 4 and 5 it was also revealed that the uv peroxydisulfate uv pds process was more promising for the degradation of pen g with efficiency greater than 99 134 also good degradation efficiency was observed for amx using the uv pds process 134 tables 4 and 5 this revealed that the use of thermally activated persulfate alone greatly eliminated pen g and amx 163 table 5 since they have a strong capacity of adsorption 114 the applications of the numerous chemical assisted aops resulted in a 100 reduction for amx table 5 4 3 sonochemical processes in the sonochemical process us waves are used as the energy source at high frequencies between 20 1000 khz to cause acoustic cavitations which will cause the release of the reactive oh and h hydrogen radicals as a result of thermal dissociation of the water and oxygen radicals 105 111 a few studies have been reported for pen g and amx degradation using the us assisted aops table 6 although many works have shown that higher efficiency of pollutants degradation as a result of the increase in the number of available oh derived from a hybrid or combined system the use of sonolysis us alone has not been reported for pen g and amx which was reported by other authors for different pollutants such as ciprofloxacin 112 remazol black b 111 paracetamol 171 and diclofenac 172 over 98 amx degradation was observed using the us o3 and ps us processes 81 14 pen g oxidation was observed using the us catalyst process 4 4 electrochemical oxidation processes in electrochemical oxidation processes electrodes such as metals several alloys and recently bdd boron doped diamond electrodes the electrochemical oxidation is performed in the presence of an electrolyte nacl is more effective than other electrolytes such as nano3 and na2so4 105 nacl is commonly employed since it doesn t only increase the conductivity of the liquid media but also provides cl2 and other secondary oxidants for the indirect oxidation of contaminants apart from the electrolyte type other significant factors that influence this process are the electrode type temperature concentration of catalyst current density and ph of the liquid media the electrochemical oxidation process can be enhanced by introducing h2o2 fe2 fe3 or uv as seen in table 7 the fe2 and fe3 fenton catalysts catalyses the dissociation of h2o2 to form oh electro fenton process also instead of introducing these ions in the system fe electrodes can be used as the sacrificial electrode which will eventually act as the coagulant and the catalyst the merits of electro fenton include the generation of the h2o2 during the electrochemical reaction and the involvement of other processes such as adsorption anodic oxidation and flocculation table 7 shows the percentage amx cod and toc reduction results obtained by various researchers using the electrochemical advanced oxidation process maximum amx removal of 99 69 was obtained when a platinum wire was utilised as the anodic material 177 platinum possesses good stability and good catalytic properties but to the best of our knowledge no report was provided using this aop type for pen g degradation tables 4 7 revealed that the use of combinations of two or more of the aops types led to higher amx pen cod and toc removal generally the uv assisted aops and the fenton like processes outperformed the electrochemical and us assisted aops for pen g and amx degradation the uv is also effective for disinfecting potable water 128 the drawback of fenton like processes is the generation of ferric sludge and the high requirement of the expensive h2o2 122 few studies on the elimination of pen g and amx via the us assisted and electrochemical assisted processes were reported according to these considerations the aops are water treatment technologies friendly with the environments based on this section different combinations and competitive processes were developed which are efficient and also can be further developed researched for the degradation of pen g and amx even for other related antibiotics aops must be incorporated with other methods of treatment to minimise potential costs in terms of energy time equipment and chemicals the quest for innovative inexpensive photocatalysts is critical for lowering energy costs and the use of renewable sources of energy is also crucial 106 5 biological processes the recalcitrant nature of antibiotics necessitates treatment processes that can efficiently reduce their concentrations in final effluent at little or no additional cost biological treatment entails actions of microorganisms in the degradation of organic matter and other pollutants contained in effluents a review of various biological treatment processes for effluent containing pen and amx are presented below the summary of biological processes used by various researchers for the degradation of pens is shown in table 8 5 1 anaerobic treatment commonly applied in the treatment of waste sludge and high strength effluent anaerobic treatment serves dual purposes namely fermentation and oxidation of organic substrates to yield lower biomasses and energy hence its use at pre treatment stages as a widely used anaerobic system the performance of up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor and its variant expanded granular sludge bed egsb for pre treatment of 6 aminopenicillanic acid 6 apa and amx effluent were investigated 127 180 uasb system achieved low antibiotics removal efficiency 26 3 6 apa and 21 6 amx due to excessive organic matter concentration in the influent resulting in shock loads which inhibited anaerobic metabolism 127 on a similar type of effluent egsb achieved higher amx removal about 80 180 the higher removal efficiency for egsb is attributed to its design which creates rapid up flow velocity to overcome effects such as shock loads and microbial transformation 181 huang et al 182 investigated bla elimination from pharmaceutical effluent using anaerobic membrane bioreactor that consists of a uasb and ultrafiltration membrane module results obtained showed amx removal efficiency by the system was sufficiently high 73 2 and other identified antibiotics were effectively eliminated from the effluent furthermore their findings showed uasb unit achieved more antibiotics removal than the uf module due to biodegradation was a dominant process in the system 5 2 aerobic treatment conventional aerobic systems include but not limited to activated sludge aerated filters wetlands these systems have vast application in effluent treatment due to the ability to handle various sources of effluent and effective nutrient removal 183 the degradation of emerging contaminants such as amx and pen in these systems brought about by microbial activities have been studied and reported 126 184 187 baghapour et al 185 successfully carried out amx removal from the aquatic environment using a submerged biological aerated filter synthetic effluent comprising sucrose and amx served as a carbon source while mixed bacteria were degrading agents with a column setup operated under varying hrts 3 6 and 12 h and having the following dimensions effective volume 3 9 l height 60 cm internal diameter 1 cm 50 7 amx and 45 7 soluble chemical oxygen demand cod contained in the influent were removed the study suggested concentration gradient accounted for more amx elimination at higher initial concentrations besides co metabolism was equally active as evidenced in the degradation of contaminants to trace concentrations by microbes the performance of activated sludge in the removal of amx ampicillin and dicloxacillin from pharmaceutical effluent was investigated by abou elela and el khateeb 184 with a slightly acidic ph 5 3 6 9 and highly contaminated influent having the blas β lactams organic and inorganic pollutants the degrading agents utilised were nitrosomonas and nitrobacter acclimated to the influent after five weeks near perfect bla elimination of 99 was achieved after 24 h in the system due to the complete opening of β lactam rings by the nitrifying bacteria this is validated with high removal efficiencies of 94 8 and 88 4 recorded for bod and cod respectively studies on the use of medium size constructed wetlands cw for antibiotics removal from urban effluent in the open air was reported by hijosa valsero et al 186 the system comprises of several wetlands of varying configurations presence or absence of plants flow type plant species typha angustifolia or phragmites australis and presence or absence of soil matrix influent into the system contained tetracyclines β lactams macrolides lincosamides and sulfonamides in addition to other organics the findings showed that maximum amx removal efficiency of 45 15 was achieved with a free water subsurface flow wetland containing t angustifolia it was deduced that the low removal efficiency of amx was occasioned by the stability of β lactam rings therefore there is reduced bla biodegradation in ph neutral solutions furthermore design configurations and time of year limit the application of cw for the removal of antibiotics no substantial inhibition of aerobic microbial consortia was observed despite the recalcitrance character of pens 185 this could be attributed to the multi resistance gained on account of their heterogeneity and collaborative partnerships thus allowing for interchange during biochemical processes such as metabolism fermentation hydrolysis 188 aerobic processes are utilised based on advantages such as high nutrient removal the occurrence of parallel biochemical mechanisms and the ability to handle different types of wastewater anaerobic treatment is preferred for the purposes of stability and control low sludge yield ability to handle high strength effluents high organic loading lower cost of operation high bioenergy and nutrient recovery comparatively anaerobic technologies are more efficient for the biological treatment of polluted effluent than aerobic technologies 5 3 combined anaerobic aerobic treatment combined systems are operationally and economically valuable as they integrate the advantages of anaerobic and aerobic treatments hence offering a robust effluent treatment and overcoming drawbacks of the separate individual systems 189 the removal of veterinary antibiotics from swine effluent using combined treatment processes was investigated by han et al 190 findings from the studies showed 3 of total antibiotics amx 57 and 95 cod were removed by anaerobic digestion while 92 of total antibiotics were removed by the sequencing batch reactor the above findings affirm the view that anaerobic treatment breaks down pollutants into solubilised organic matter which are better eliminated using aerobic treatment 191 chen et al 192 in a novel combined process comprising of anaerobic micro aerobic and two stage aerobic achieved varying degrees of amx removal from pharmaceutical effluent from the results mechanisms for amx removal in ranking order are biodegradation adsorption and hydrolysis across all systems biodegradation accounted for most removal due to the presence of large colonies of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria were found most especially in aerobic systems 5 4 hybrid technologies the recalcitrant nature of antibiotics proves that no single treatment process can achieve complete removal hence the combination of conventional and advanced technologies are adopted 193 such combinations link the physical biological and chemical processes together to achieve desired results in a fenton activated sludge combined system hydroxyl radicals can effectively degrade high concentrations of amx as a pre treatment for subsequent removal in activated sludge 170 the oxidation potentials of radicals were utilised to breakdown the β lactam rings of the antibiotics furthermore 80 of pen contained in industrial effluent was eliminated with a combination of several biological processes and micro electrolysis 194 from the results it is suggested that micro electrolysis process enhanced the biodegradability of the effluent by way of electrochemical oxidation and co precipitation mechanisms 195 co precipitation here refers to the agglomeration of foreign species within structures of precipitating compound e g clustering of contaminants in oxides of iron 196 this leads to the functional destabilisation and simultaneous removal of pen g nh3 n and bod5 cod concentrations from effluent 5 5 microbial community the recalcitrant nature of pens in the environs is well known nevertheless microorganisms can breakdown these antibiotics by utilising several mechanisms pathways such as biodegradation hydrolysis etc with wastewater from treatment plants and its sludge as sources of microbes enzymatic degradation of target pollutants could be accomplished the biodegradation of amx in an aqueous environment performed by pure bacterial culture 197 199 microbial consortia 200 201 and immobilised fungi 202 resulted in high removal of the pollutant notably the removal mechanism is affected by the intrinsic properties of the biocatalyst and the conditions of the environment in which it acts for instance the findings of liu et al 199 showed that nitrogen concentrations could control exchanges between amx and microcystis aeruginosa via the synthesis of penicillin binding proteins this phenomenon resulted in 30 5 amx removal after 7days at nitrogen concentration of 5 mg l conversely the addition of co substrates increased the responses of functional enzymes such as β lactamase and amidase respectively to hydrolyse β lactam ring and amide bond of amx thus enhancing the pollutant removal 203 pen g biodegradation from various matrices was reported by different authors using several bacterial strains 126 187 204 serratia sp achieved pen g degradation efficiency of 84 at the end of 14 days due to the presence of hydrolysing and multi resistant enzymes 204 unlike in the case of serratia sp wang et al 126 investigated the degradation capacity of klebsiella pneumonia on glucose and pen g substrates their findings showed that ring opening by β lactamase enzyme from the resistant bacteria promotes the transformation of pen g to metabolites such as penilloic acid penillic acid despite the harsh conditions of the medium the removal efficiency of pen g 99 99 exceeded that of conventional substrate 93 due to its biodegradation process is interlaced with another biochemical process hydrolysis thus the presence of transient and dynamic metabolites from the available literature works on biological processes prokaryotic microorganisms i e bacteria are vastly responsible for the degradation of pens from aquatic matrices this is due to their ability to close link molecular structures of the antibiotics to enzyme active sites for biodegradation summarily biodegradation mechanism results to near complete degradation of the antibiotics from aqueous solutions and integrated biological processes give the best performance also due to variations in operating conditions effluent type and recalcitrant nature of pen antibiotics near perfect removal of the antibiotics and their intermediates can be possibly achieved by the integration of the above mentioned biological processes 6 comparing the different treatment methods in this section the different classes of removal processes for pens are compared and discussed the most widely studied separation processes for pens is adsorption adsorption is low cost does not require the addition of any chemical has low energy requirement and can be regenerated the comparative ease and speed at which batch experimental studies are performed for adsorption usually lead to lots of published literature on the subject though membrane processes are not as popular as adsorption for pens nanofiltration is the most widely studied membrane process due to its high efficiency in comparison with other membrane processes a lot of aops have been studied and there is no specific type that is widely used for pens research on the subject now focuses on the investigation of hybrid technologies and a combination of different processes in table 9 the advantages and disadvantages of different mitigation strategies for pen in water are compared with the exception of microfiltration and electrocoagulation other separation processes have been found to be effective for the removal of pens from water the major drawback of membrane separation processes is the high cost of usage and high energy requirements adsorption solves both of these issues albeit at a lower influent load aops are also generally expensive and energy intensive their major advantage is their highly effective performance for pens removal and the subsequent absence of sludge biological processes on the other hand are low cost and quite popular however they are quite sensitive to the nature of the influent as changes in ph and temperature can cause a shock on the micro organisms and hence affect the process performance 7 knowledge gap and future perspectives based on this review several interesting gaps were identified that could serve as future work for other research teams from the review of membrane separation processes for amx and pen recovery it was observed that nf membranes were the commonly adopted membrane type with associated appreciably high removal efficiency however most of the reported amx and pen recovery studies were performed using synthetic effluent it was noted that real effluent from effluent treatment plants wwtps are usually characterised by a huge presence of natural organic matters nom these noms constitutes a major limitation to the wide application of membranes in wwtps being the major cause of membrane fouling and subsequent loss of membrane flux serious undoing in membrane filtration interestingly few recent studies 35 46 48 demonstrated the efficiency and the superiority of an integrated treatment approach to a stand alone treatment mode therefore researchers are encouraged towards a continued exploration of varieties of integrated hybrid processes to mitigate the incidences of fouling due to nom and ensure effective and efficient membrane application in wwtps carbon based adsorbents are the most efficient class of adsorbents for pens removal from water however adsorbents from clay mofs polymers and resins have not been extensively studied for pens furthermore the disposal of used adsorbent has not been considered as also observed for diclofenac adsorption 3 key studies such as adsorbent disposal cost benefit analysis and adsorbent disposal techniques have not been investigated for pens adsorption a considerable number of studies have not been done on the use of only ultrasound us for pen g and amx degradation which can be compared with the addition of other aops in the study to see the degree of variation when the us alone is applied also the effectiveness of using different colours of irradiation light has not been considered for amx oxidation studies on the combination of us and different catalysts such as nio tio2 etc have not been exhausted for both pollutants even the us uv catalyst process which included both the two energy sources used for pen removal 138 which gave a good result for pen g 91 3 cod removal have not been tested for amx gamma ionising irradiation can be saturated with gases such as n2o o2 and n2 etc which was done for amx oxidation which resulted in toc of 90 143 and not for pen g 141 to observe whether there will be an improvement in the process even a study obtained 95 91 for aniline removal using us h2o2 113 where the us cleaves the oo bond in h2o2 to generate oh but no study for amx and pen g using the same route was reported the us assisted persulfate process which resulted in 98 amx removal 175 has not been investigated for pen g removal even the degradation pen g using the electrochemical aop was not reported by any researcher the popular sono fenton process was not reported for the degradation of amx and pen g us enhances fenton processes 122 therefore it is encouraged that more research is carried out to find more alternative aops for complete reduction mineralisation of pen g the applicability of the aops is limited at an industrial scale due to their high operating cost 106 recently cuerda correa et al 106 suggested that the synergistic effects between the processes should also be investigated at least on a pilot scale metabolites have been found to pose an environmental risk 19 125 but most of the scientific experiments do not reflect on them in aops for pens therefore studies on the metabolites formed after pens degradation through aops are very beneficial the breakdown of organic substrates results in volumetric increase that can have drastic effects on the removal efficiencies of targeted pollutants and biological systems the effects of volumetric loading rate vlr however were reported for egsb performance in amoxicillin pre treatment from wastewater 180 consequently it is suggested that studies should be done on the effects of vlr and pollutants shock loads for the various types of biological treatment technologies also degradation of amx and pen g results in the formation of metabolites that are equally recalcitrant therefore constitute harm if left untreated in the final effluent degradation and removal of these metabolites in addition to the parent antibiotics by the various biological systems are silent in the literature reviewed lastly mechanisms for the breakdown of antibiotics contained in wastewater include biosynthesis endogenous respiration biodegradation adsorption hydrolysis from the reviewed literature biodegradation features prominently as a dominant mechanism for antibiotics removal studies on the effects of the other mechanisms need to be done as biodegradation remains limited in ph neutral solutions 186 also the presence of β lactamase in enzymatic degradation of β lactams makes it imperative for research into these other mechanisms furthermore there exists the need to determine optimum values of temperature and ph conditions for biological processes as these parameters will assist in modelling and prediction of such techniques in large scale applications some aops have not been tried for pens due to sufficient information gathered during degradation of other pollutants this could be used to make predictions of the potential performance for pens high costs of the specific process or low likelihood of technical upscaling the process could be other challenges why specific processes have not been tried however this does not preclude researchers from conducting preliminary examinations of such processes for potential new insights the upscaling of a particular process is an important determinant of the acceptability and wide application of a particular mitigation strategy researchers usually consider cost and performance of the process at a larger scale the advantages and disadvantages have already been discussed in the previous sections 8 conclusion in this review the research efforts on the removal of pens via a variety of separation degradation and biological processes were examined it was noted that isotropic microporous microfiltration membranes are not effective for rejecting amx and pen due to their large uniform pore size distribution 0 1 μm which is quite large for such applications numerous researchers favoured the application of nf membrane as compared to ro membrane because the latter usually overshoot the intended water quality objective by depleting the concentration of other useful dissolved minerals and hardness to a detrimental extent it was observed that a large number of adsorbent materials have been investigated as sorbents for the removal of pens from water carbon based adsorbents were the most efficient class of adsorbents for pens removal from water lewis acid base interactions hydrogen bonding electrostatic attraction and π π interactions were the main adsorption mechanisms generally the uv assisted aops and the fenton like processes outperformed the electrochemical and us assisted aops for pen g and amx degradation aops must be incorporated with other methods of treatment to minimise potential costs in terms of energy time equipment and chemicals biological processes for pens removal have also been explored in the domain of aerobic anaerobic and hybrid processes anaerobic treatment processes were observed to be more efficient for the removal of pens than aerobic processes with the exception of microfiltration and electrocoagulation most other processes were found to be effective for the removal of pens from water though effective these processes have some disadvantages the major drawback of membrane separation processes is the high cost of usage and high energy requirements adsorption solves both of these issues albeit at a lower influent load aops are also generally expensive and energy intensive biological processes are quite sensitive to the nature of the influent as changes in ph and temperature can cause a shock on the micro organisms and hence affect the process performance from this review it can be surmised that the mitigation of pens from the aqueous is important for the achievement of environmental sustainability and this has aroused the interest of many researchers on the subject there has been great research progress on the subject and

13678,penicillins pens are β lactam antibiotics with significant environmental toxicology this review aimed to synthesise the research efforts on the removal of pens via a variety of separation degradation and biological processes it was observed that isotropic microporous microfiltration membranes are not effective for rejecting pens due to their large uniform pore size distribution researchers favoured the application of nanofiltration membrane and adsorption as separation technologies carbon based adsorbents were the most efficient class of adsorbents for pens removal from

aerobic processes with the exception of microfiltration and electrocoagulation most other processes were found to be effective for the removal of pens from water albeit with some disadvantages from

antibiotics in the aquatic environment 1 2 the extent of detection of these pharmaceutically active compounds phacs has also been on the rise 3 4 their release into the environment is usually through pharmaceutical industry effluent hospital effluent 5 aquacultural activities and runoffs from animal feedlots 6 7 these phacs have been known to have a deleterious effect on aquatic flora and fauna 8 penicillin pen was discovered in the early 20th century by alexander fleming 9 despite more than 75 years of clinical use 10 it is still one of the most frequently utilised antibiotic in contemporary times 11 it can exist in different forms based on a variety of molecular arrangements 12 due to their widespread use pens are inadvertently one of the occurring phacs in the aquatic environment 13 pens are β lactam class of antibiotics and they are quite recalcitrant in the aqueous environment 14 they usually get into the aqueous environment by agricultural and veterinary applications 15 16 the importance of sustainable water management for the achievement of environmental sustainability cannot be overemphasised 17 in line with these goals researchers have over the years developed more sophisticated hybrid water treatment processes in the physico chemical and biological domain for the treatment of antibiotics such as pen and amoxicillin amx from water mitigation strategies employed for the removal of pen from water include adsorption 18 membrane separation 19 advanced oxidation processes 20 21 biological processes 5 and a host of others within the scope of the authors exhaustive search the varieties of processes employed specifically for the removal of pen g pen v and amx from water does not have a dedicated review paper this is an important gap in knowledge that the current paper intends to fill this short review aims to synthesise the research efforts on the removal of pens via a variety of separation degradation and biological processes the review is to provide an assessment of research progress highlight key papers in the domain of each technique compare and discuss the intricacies of the various mitigation strategies identify gaps in knowledge in the research area and predict interesting areas future for work in light of the need for environmental protection and sustainable development the removal of such antibiotic in water is an important concept that needs a well structured review this therefore underlines the significance of the current study this therefore underlines the significance of this study in terms of the literature utilised the focus of the study was the last decade however older papers that had a key impact and important contributions to the research progress were also included in the review the choice of pen g pen v and amx as the interest of the review as opposed to other β lactams class of antibiotics is due to its wider usage and popularity especially in developing countries 2 ecotoxicology of penicillins pen and amx are a group of antibiotic that is used for the treatment of bacterial infection the general chemical structure of pens is shown in fig 1 with r as the variable group this means that we have different types of pens based on the r group these include pen g pen v procaine pen and benzathine pen others are now being referred to by other trade names such as amoxicillin amx ampicillin amp dicloxacillin nafcillin and oxacillin in this brief section the ecotoxicology of pen and amx are discussed this was presented as a precursor to the review itself to help the readers in gaining an understanding of the negative implications of pen and amx in the environment furthermore it serves as a justification for the importance of removing it from the aqueous environment β lactams class of antibiotics has been shown to have very high ecotoxicology in comparison with other pharmaceuticals based on an apical acute aquatic effects prioritisation technique 22 toxicity of pen g to a cyanobacterial mat by single toxicity test revealed an ec50 value of 0 13 mg l 23 the acute toxicity test by tong et al 24 to determine the eco toxicological effect of pens revealed that amoxicillin amx and ampicillin amp at 50 mg l initial concentration had 15 20 inhibition of vibrio fischeri bioluminescence in bioassay after 30 min exposure in the effluent the authors surmised that it is not sensitive at initial concentration of 50 mg l it has also been observed from algal bio assay that amx is not toxic to eukaryotic organisms such as closterium ehrenbergii and pseudokirkneriella subcapitata at 50 ng l concentration but showed significant toxicity to synechococcus leopolensis even at such low concentrations 25 daphnia magna acute toxicity tests have also revealed a negative impact of pen which can be as high as 80 death for untreated effluent having 600 mg l cod 48 mg l bod and unknown pen conc with 50 dilution 21 pens had shown toxicity in this order effluent groundwater surface water 24 at the same concentration though the reasons were not provided by the authors this could be due to the complementary effect of other pollutants in the water as effluents are conventionally more polluted than ground or surface water in line with these investigations another recent study has also confirmed the negative environmental effect of different types of pen and amx 26 even after going through anaerobic degradation based on these discussions it can be surmised that pens have an ecotoxicological effect on the environment pens usually exist around 1 1000 μg l in the aquatic environment and 1 1000 mg l in wastewater treatment plants 27 at such concentrations ranges the ecotoxicological effect has been observed the significance of removing pens from the environment is thereby justified 3 separation processes 3 1 membrane separation processes membrane separation is a key type of separation process due to its characteristics of providing selective permeation to specific components species in a mixture 28 reverse osmosis ro ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf are the major membrane types applied in membrane separation while nanofiltration nf membranes are the hybrid trade off between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membranes 29 30 these membrane types are conceptually similar but their varied pore diameters dramatically differentiate their applications the effectiveness of different membrane types in effluent treatment with particular interest in antibiotics especially amx and pen rejection from aqueous environment have been demonstrated it was however observed that the rejection of these antibiotics is dependent on their particulate nature either charged or neutral and molecular sizes ph of the medium and membrane properties 31 furthermore the dominant mechanism could be either one or a combination of size exclusion charge exclusion and solute solvent membrane interactions 32 the superiority of any of the mechanism in a given filtration process is a function of the antibiotic s physicochemical properties particle size pka etc membrane properties nature of the material pore size etc and characteristics of medium ph ionic strength etc 33 the review of works on membrane application for the rejection of amx and pen is discussed in this section it was noted that isotropic microporous microfiltration membranes are likely not effective for rejecting amx and pen as evidenced in the absence of any journal article to that respect this could be due to their large uniform pore size distribution 0 1 μm which is quite porous for such applications similarly there are few studies on the use of uf as a standalone and as part of an integrated treatment system the effectiveness of a novel integration of uf membrane me activated carbon adsorption a and ultrasonic irradiation us for the rejection of amx and other emerging contaminants ecs from synthetic 34 and real 35 effluents were investigated the rejection efficiencies and mechanisms of the treatment techniques at standalone only me and integrated ame and usame mode were further studied for the synthetic effluent findings showed that the dispersion of powdered ac to the uf membrane surface that is ame system resulted in about 99 improvement in the amx rejection as opposed to the 10 rejection achieved with me 34 similarly about 100 of amx rejection was achieved with usame it was further deduced that the overall mechanism responsible for the rejection of amx and other ecs in the studied system was solute adsorption onto the powdered ac on the membrane surface notably us irradiation improved the powdered ac adsorption capacity by creating cavitation and micro streaming effect which reduced powdered ac particle size thus resulting in increased adsorption sites 34 when applied as an innovative tertiary treatment for real secondary effluent above 99 rejection of amx and other ecs was recorded using the hybrid usame while about 90 and 30 rejection was achieved using ame and me respectively 35 the application of usame was successful at mitigating the incidence of membrane fouling by nom in the treatment of real life effluent asides integrated use studies revealed that uf support membrane with a thin film coating incorporating suitable additive is efficient for amx rejection this assertion was demonstrated by a near perfect about 99 amx rejection achieved using thin film ultrafiltration composite membrane with a poly vinyl alcohol selective layer incorporating a polyelectrolyte 31 in nf membrane applications permeate transport mechanism was identified to be through diffusion whose rate is strongly influenced by either the pressure concentration or charge potentials 30 it was also observed that amx rejection especially from nf membrane with surface hydrophilicity is as a result of size and donnan exclusion 36 37 solute solubility and diffusivity 30 thus antibiotics of uniform molecular sizes can be preferentially rejected provided they sustain significantly varied concentration on the membrane material steric hindrance for uncharged solutes and electrostatic steric hindrance effect for charged solutes were also identified as having a significant effect on amx separation 38 40 furthermore the effect of ph 41 43 and the ionic composition 36 on amx rejection by nf was reported by adjusting the ph of the feed effluent to the alkaline region ph 8 3 10 0 high amx rejection of 99 09 42 85 41 and 91 43 were achieved the integration of nf and fenton process for the mitigation of membrane fouling and to engender improved amx rejection was reported 44 the study demonstrated that the incorporation of different fe based nanoparticles goethite and maleate ferroxane into polyacrylonitrile nf membrane film resulted in high amx rejection efficiency improved permeate flux and flux recovery ratio was also high above 96 due to the absence of discrete pores it was deduced that the free volume areas served as the main permeation channel during ro membrane filtration 30 only a few works reported the application of ro membrane in the recovery of our antibiotics of interest from synthetic 45 and real life effluent 46 the study by gholami et al 45 depicted size exclusion effect as being responsible for attaining up to 95 amx rejection in an ro membrane process it was also observed that the studied process variables operating temperature pressure and ph independently influenced the process while their interactive effect was non significant similarly by using the ro membrane 100 amx and pen removal were achieved in the treatment of secondary effluent from a treatment plant 46 table 1 presents the reports on the application of different membrane types in the removal of amx and pen antibiotics from effluent and sorted in decreasing order of removal efficiency the literature survey showed that numerous researchers favoured the application of nf membrane as compared to ro membrane irrespective of their outstanding performance in species rejection this finding could be related to the fact that ro treatment usually overshoots the intended water quality objective by depleting the concentration of other useful dissolved minerals and hardness in addition to the species of concern to such a detrimental extent 30 it was also observed that very few works exist on the pen removal as compared to amx even though both antibiotics are pens this observation is unconnected with the fact that pen narrow spectrum antibiotics is mainly efficacious against only gram positive organisms hence its treatment application is limited and is being gradually discontinued 47 meanwhile amx which is effective against a wide range of bacteria is heavily used thus its huge presence as a contaminant in pharmaceutical hospital effluents 3 2 adsorption in this section the recent advances in the adsorption of pens are discussed the focus of the discussion is on the solution chemistry and the recent types of adsorbent material that has been used to remove pens from aqueous solution for the adsorption process the adsorbate pen or amx is dissociated at ph pka 51 in this ph regime adsorption is usually by electrostatic interaction with the adsorbent however the point of zero charge phpzc of the adsorbent also plays a significant role because it helps us identify the net surface charge of the adsorbent at a specific ph for the non ionised adsorbate other physical attraction forces become the major mechanism responsible for adsorption the intricacies of solution ph and adsorption mechanism vary from one adsorption system to the other 52 this is a key reason why the optimum ph in table 2 can be observed to vary from one adsorption system to the other for pen g adsorption removal has been shown to decrease with increasing ph 53 and vice versa 54 this is due to the way the pka and phpzc are affected by the ph at very low ph the high concentration of the more mobile h will compete significantly with the antibiotics for active sites a recent study revealed that of β lactams antibiotics such as pen amx and amp can be simultaneously removed in aqueous media using ternary adsorbate system and an iron nickel bimetallic adsorbent supported on bentonite 55 in the competitive adsorption system 94 6 amx 80 6 amp and 53 7 pen was successfully removed thus suggested that amx had a higher affinity for the adsorbent in the aqueous system a competitive adsorption study has also been performed from amx and tetracycline using ac from durian shell in a mechanistic modelling study 56 it was observed that there was less removal in the binary system than for the single systems which are due to the greater competition for active sites by the adsorbate in the binary system pens can also be effectively removed in a fixed bed continuous flow set up 57 in another interesting study the batch and fixed bed column adsorption of amx has been considered using commercial ac 58 the batch study was best fit to sips isotherm while the fixed bed process was best fit for the yan model a recent study 59 has carefully conducted the mechanistic investigation in amx adsorption albeit for metal organic frameworks mofs it was observed that lewis acid base interactions were the main adsorption mechanisms although hydrogen bonding and π π interactions could also be identified besides these competitive adsorption studies fixed bed column studies and mechanistic studies most other investigations in recent years have taken the conventional route of novel adsorbent development and evaluation of sorption capacity and removal efficiency via batch experiments other materials that have been explored for pens adsorption in recent times include commercial ac 60 61 nh4cl induced ac 62 63 powdered ac 1 granular ac 64 ac from capsules of cashew of para 65 converter slag 66 multi walled cnt 67 iron benzoate iron oxalate and cobalt modified ac 68 and bimetallic fe ni nanoparticles 69 table 2 summarises the adsorption capacities of different adsorption media for pens and arranged in order of decreasing q m a x in mg g all adsorption capacity values are reported to four significant figures the ph and temperature at which these values are obtained are also reported to help show the reasons for any discrepancies observed the ph effect has been discussed the temperature was reported because the nature of the enthalpy adsorption process will control the optimal removal and specificity is required in this domain while reporting the q m a x values furthermore the method of determining the adsorption capacity was also stated in table 2 this is usually calculated from experiments or predicted from the adsorption capacity for isotherms such as langmuir and sips 70 71 it can be observed that a large number of adsorbent materials have been investigated as sorbents for the removal of pens from water carbon based adsorbents are the most efficient class of adsorbents for pens removal from water however adsorbents from clay mofs polymers and resins have not been extensively studied for pens furthermore the disposal of used adsorbent has not been considered lewis acid base interactions hydrogen bonding electrostatic attraction and π π interactions are the main adsorption mechanisms 3 3 other separation processes asides those already discussed the other separation processes effective for amx and pen removal from effluent is presented here the dissolved air flotation process was reported as effective in pen g removal from synthetic effluent with a relatively high removal efficiency of 67 45 99 the aggregation of the pen g molecules particles into floatable flocs occurred via the particle electrostatic charge reduction initiated in the presence of polyaluminum chloride coagulants also pen g was successfully removed from effluent via electrodialysis operated under constant current 100 and voltage 101 in both types of electrodialysis operation the size of the pen g ions and their degree of attraction towards the ion exchange membrane governed the process the effectiveness of the electrocoagulation process for the removal of amx and pen was also investigated the ineffectiveness of the process for the removal of pens was pointed out 102 meanwhile about 98 98 removal was reported in the case of amx using an aluminium electrode at ph 7 60 v and electrolysis time of 75 min 103 4 advanced oxidation processes nowadays amongst different water treatment methods the advanced oxidation process aops is an assuring method for the removal of diverse antibiotics including pen g and amx due to their high oxidation potentials and extraordinary efficiency in the oxidative degradation of organic recalcitrant compounds 104 to give inert end products 105 they are new water decontamination technologies that have found extensive utilisation in the previous years because of their flexibility and comprehensive range of applicability the aops comprise the set of highly successful approaches for wastewater handling and management 105 106 although aops give high removal efficiencies for different pollutants in water and generate a low amount of sludge they possess some setbacks such as high cost of the procedure they are highly selective for the high effectiveness of removal of different pollutants 107 due to its high cost of operation they have not been fully added into viable usage on a large scale most particularly the developing countries example nigeria aops were ﬁrstly suggested by glaze 108 different aops mechanisms are presented in table 3 the aops differ from each other in the way in which the radicals oh so4 ho2 etc required for the pollutants degradation are generated although the utilisation of the advanced oxidation method alone is not so efficient the introduction of several chemical materials such as persulfate ps nanoparticles and catalytic particles could increase its efficiency 112 aops are either performed in the presence of catalysts e g transition metal ions or oxides catalytic processes or the absence of catalysts non catalytic processes catalysts increase the cavitation effect and the rate of organic molecules decomposition 114 the catalysts employed are mainly nanoparticles since nanoparticles are have been shown to be effective nanoparticles have provided unique optical catalytic semi conductive and piezoelectric properties that are developed technologically 112 the aops take advantage of the high capacities of oxidation by hydroxyl radicals oh and sulphate radicals so 4 generated in situ the processes 114 these radicals react rapidly with most organic compounds to degrade them within close diffusion limited rates 118 these degradation processes will diminish the level of organic pollutants in water the success of the aops are dependent on the efficiency of the oxidant oh which is the second recognised species with higher oxidant power after fluorine 119 oh are less choosy and very reactive than the other oxidants due to their standard oxidation potential e 0 of 2 8 v which is greater than that of the other conventional oxidants 120 the so 4 has e 0 of 2 6 v which is usually generated from peroxydisulfate pds also known as persulfate or peroxymonosulfate pms using uv heat or catalysts 114 121 the oh are widely employed than the other powerful oxidants since no additional waste is generated when used they are not toxic have a very short lifetime not corrosive to equipment and are produced by assemblies that are simple to operate these radicals should be generated in sufficient quantity to interact with the organic compounds these organic compounds are mineralised to co2 h2o and inorganic salts 122 oh radicals are produced with the aid of primary oxidants such as ozone oxygen and hydrogen peroxide energy sources such as ultraviolet light electric current ultrasound and gamma γ radiation and catalysts 123 aops can be classified into homogeneous processes and heterogeneous processes distinguishing between those that operate with an external input of energy radiant energy ultrasonic energy electrical energy and those that do not these oxidative treatment processes can also be classified into four categories namely 1 the photocatalytic processes in homogeneous phase and or heterogeneous phase uv h2o2 uv o3 uv fe2 h2o2 uv catalyst etc using uv ultraviolet radiation or visible light 2 the chemical oxidation processes in homogeneous phase fe2 h2o2 o3 h2o2 etc 3 the sonochemical processes using ultrasonics us and 4 the electrochemical oxidation processes a combination of the mentioned categories can be employed to yield a greater degradation percentage or lower adsorbate concentration the major metabolite of pen is penilloic acid in acidic medium and penillic acid in basic medium while others are penicilloic acid isopenillic acid 124 and penicilloaldehyde 125 details of the mechanism of degradation of pen g into the metabolites are shown in fig 2 126 chen et al 127 suggested that the residual cod observed after the aops treatment of amx could be due to the presence of metabolites but the specific compounds were not elucidated generally the metabolites of pens can be detected in stable forms in the environment despite the degradation process requiring the opening up of the β lactams rings 125 the metabolites have been shown to also possess an environmental risk 19 125 though most research studies do not focus on them in aops investigations for pens aops have been employed by many researchers for the removal of pen and amx from different aqueous media tables 4 7 summaries the uv radiation assisted aops chemical assisted aops us assisted aops and the electrochemical assisted aops used by various researchers for the degradation of pens 4 1 photolytic processes photolytic processes are aops that utilises uv light either artificial or natural and gamma γ radiation or radiolysis as the sources of energy which will aid in the photolytic yield of oh for faster pollutant degradation its mechanism is to break the chemical bonds present in the pollutants by direct photolysis 128 but this process can be enhanced by the introduction of other materials from table 4 it can be observed that the use of combinations of two or more of the aops types led to higher amx pen cod and toc removal the use of uv alone photolysis was not effective for pen g and amx degradation 129 table 4 the degradation process was improved when a catalyst was added 130 131 termed photocatalytic degradation and when h2o2 a very strong oxidant 132 ozone o3 133 persulfate ps 134 135 or combinations with nanocatalyst iron ions fe3 and fe2 photo fenton 133 136 and us 137 138 were introduced into the uv alone process 132 table 4 this improvement is as a result increased oh production with the addition of other materials which will facilitate the process of degradation the presence of a catalyst in the system will enhance the rate of cavitation bubbles formation by offering nucleation sites which will enhance the generation of free radicals 111 the application of the numerous uv assisted aops resulted in a 100 reduction for amx table 4 the ionising gamma irradiation is another process for the degradation of persistent organic contamiants the colour of the light energy source also influences the degradation of pen g as observed in table 4 white light max of 99 as a source of irradiation was more active than the use of blue 88 yellow 28 and green 50 for the degradation of pen g 131 table 4 other factors such as the light intensity ph temperature irradiation time catalyst type and catalyst dose had a great impact on the pens degradation 4 2 chemical oxidation processes chemical oxidation processes are chemicals fe2 fe3 ps h2o2 ozone etc assisted processes table 5 summaries the chemical assisted aops used by various researchers for the reduction of amx pen cod and toc the use of ozonation alone a strong oxidant decomposes in water to form stronger oxidants oh was efficient for pen g 162 and amx 133 mineralisation table 5 the ozonation mechanism is based on oh creation which is related to the rate of ozonation in the system 128 which can be weakened by the existence of radical scavengers in the system however pollutants efficiency can be improved when the process of ozonation is combined with other materials such as fe2 133 and h2o2 153 the presence of fe2 or fe3 with h2o2 fenton process produces oh the fe functions as the catalyst 105 this process can be enhanced further for higher efficiency by the involvement of uv irradiation us or other energy sources since more oh are produced compared to dark fenton processes the assisted fenton like process was more effective than the fenton like process alone for pen g degradation 136 tables 5 7 from tables 4 and 5 it was also revealed that the uv peroxydisulfate uv pds process was more promising for the degradation of pen g with efficiency greater than 99 134 also good degradation efficiency was observed for amx using the uv pds process 134 tables 4 and 5 this revealed that the use of thermally activated persulfate alone greatly eliminated pen g and amx 163 table 5 since they have a strong capacity of adsorption 114 the applications of the numerous chemical assisted aops resulted in a 100 reduction for amx table 5 4 3 sonochemical processes in the sonochemical process us waves are used as the energy source at high frequencies between 20 1000 khz to cause acoustic cavitations which will cause the release of the reactive oh and h hydrogen radicals as a result of thermal dissociation of the water and oxygen radicals 105 111 a few studies have been reported for pen g and amx degradation using the us assisted aops table 6 although many works have shown that higher efficiency of pollutants degradation as a result of the increase in the number of available oh derived from a hybrid or combined system the use of sonolysis us alone has not been reported for pen g and amx which was reported by other authors for different pollutants such as ciprofloxacin 112 remazol black b 111 paracetamol 171 and diclofenac 172 over 98 amx degradation was observed using the us o3 and ps us processes 81 14 pen g oxidation was observed using the us catalyst process 4 4 electrochemical oxidation processes in electrochemical oxidation processes electrodes such as metals several alloys and recently bdd boron doped diamond electrodes the electrochemical oxidation is performed in the presence of an electrolyte nacl is more effective than other electrolytes such as nano3 and na2so4 105 nacl is commonly employed since it doesn t only increase the conductivity of the liquid media but also provides cl2 and other secondary oxidants for the indirect oxidation of contaminants apart from the electrolyte type other significant factors that influence this process are the electrode type temperature concentration of catalyst current density and ph of the liquid media the electrochemical oxidation process can be enhanced by introducing h2o2 fe2 fe3 or uv as seen in table 7 the fe2 and fe3 fenton catalysts catalyses the dissociation of h2o2 to form oh electro fenton process also instead of introducing these ions in the system fe electrodes can be used as the sacrificial electrode which will eventually act as the coagulant and the catalyst the merits of electro fenton include the generation of the h2o2 during the electrochemical reaction and the involvement of other processes such as adsorption anodic oxidation and flocculation table 7 shows the percentage amx cod and toc reduction results obtained by various researchers using the electrochemical advanced oxidation process maximum amx removal of 99 69 was obtained when a platinum wire was utilised as the anodic material 177 platinum possesses good stability and good catalytic properties but to the best of our knowledge no report was provided using this aop type for pen g degradation tables 4 7 revealed that the use of combinations of two or more of the aops types led to higher amx pen cod and toc removal generally the uv assisted aops and the fenton like processes outperformed the electrochemical and us assisted aops for pen g and amx degradation the uv is also effective for disinfecting potable water 128 the drawback of fenton like processes is the generation of ferric sludge and the high requirement of the expensive h2o2 122 few studies on the elimination of pen g and amx via the us assisted and electrochemical assisted processes were reported according to these considerations the aops are water treatment technologies friendly with the environments based on this section different combinations and competitive processes were developed which are efficient and also can be further developed researched for the degradation of pen g and amx even for other related antibiotics aops must be incorporated with other methods of treatment to minimise potential costs in terms of energy time equipment and chemicals the quest for innovative inexpensive photocatalysts is critical for lowering energy costs and the use of renewable sources of energy is also crucial 106 5 biological processes the recalcitrant nature of antibiotics necessitates treatment processes that can efficiently reduce their concentrations in final effluent at little or no additional cost biological treatment entails actions of microorganisms in the degradation of organic matter and other pollutants contained in effluents a review of various biological treatment processes for effluent containing pen and amx are presented below the summary of biological processes used by various researchers for the degradation of pens is shown in table 8 5 1 anaerobic treatment commonly applied in the treatment of waste sludge and high strength effluent anaerobic treatment serves dual purposes namely fermentation and oxidation of organic substrates to yield lower biomasses and energy hence its use at pre treatment stages as a widely used anaerobic system the performance of up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor and its variant expanded granular sludge bed egsb for pre treatment of 6 aminopenicillanic acid 6 apa and amx effluent were investigated 127 180 uasb system achieved low antibiotics removal efficiency 26 3 6 apa and 21 6 amx due to excessive organic matter concentration in the influent resulting in shock loads which inhibited anaerobic metabolism 127 on a similar type of effluent egsb achieved higher amx removal about 80 180 the higher removal efficiency for egsb is attributed to its design which creates rapid up flow velocity to overcome effects such as shock loads and microbial transformation 181 huang et al 182 investigated bla elimination from pharmaceutical effluent using anaerobic membrane bioreactor that consists of a uasb and ultrafiltration membrane module results obtained showed amx removal efficiency by the system was sufficiently high 73 2 and other identified antibiotics were effectively eliminated from the effluent furthermore their findings showed uasb unit achieved more antibiotics removal than the uf module due to biodegradation was a dominant process in the system 5 2 aerobic treatment conventional aerobic systems include but not limited to activated sludge aerated filters wetlands these systems have vast application in effluent treatment due to the ability to handle various sources of effluent and effective nutrient removal 183 the degradation of emerging contaminants such as amx and pen in these systems brought about by microbial activities have been studied and reported 126 184 187 baghapour et al 185 successfully carried out amx removal from the aquatic environment using a submerged biological aerated filter synthetic effluent comprising sucrose and amx served as a carbon source while mixed bacteria were degrading agents with a column setup operated under varying hrts 3 6 and 12 h and having the following dimensions effective volume 3 9 l height 60 cm internal diameter 1 cm 50 7 amx and 45 7 soluble chemical oxygen demand cod contained in the influent were removed the study suggested concentration gradient accounted for more amx elimination at higher initial concentrations besides co metabolism was equally active as evidenced in the degradation of contaminants to trace concentrations by microbes the performance of activated sludge in the removal of amx ampicillin and dicloxacillin from pharmaceutical effluent was investigated by abou elela and el khateeb 184 with a slightly acidic ph 5 3 6 9 and highly contaminated influent having the blas β lactams organic and inorganic pollutants the degrading agents utilised were nitrosomonas and nitrobacter acclimated to the influent after five weeks near perfect bla elimination of 99 was achieved after 24 h in the system due to the complete opening of β lactam rings by the nitrifying bacteria this is validated with high removal efficiencies of 94 8 and 88 4 recorded for bod and cod respectively studies on the use of medium size constructed wetlands cw for antibiotics removal from urban effluent in the open air was reported by hijosa valsero et al 186 the system comprises of several wetlands of varying configurations presence or absence of plants flow type plant species typha angustifolia or phragmites australis and presence or absence of soil matrix influent into the system contained tetracyclines β lactams macrolides lincosamides and sulfonamides in addition to other organics the findings showed that maximum amx removal efficiency of 45 15 was achieved with a free water subsurface flow wetland containing t angustifolia it was deduced that the low removal efficiency of amx was occasioned by the stability of β lactam rings therefore there is reduced bla biodegradation in ph neutral solutions furthermore design configurations and time of year limit the application of cw for the removal of antibiotics no substantial inhibition of aerobic microbial consortia was observed despite the recalcitrance character of pens 185 this could be attributed to the multi resistance gained on account of their heterogeneity and collaborative partnerships thus allowing for interchange during biochemical processes such as metabolism fermentation hydrolysis 188 aerobic processes are utilised based on advantages such as high nutrient removal the occurrence of parallel biochemical mechanisms and the ability to handle different types of wastewater anaerobic treatment is preferred for the purposes of stability and control low sludge yield ability to handle high strength effluents high organic loading lower cost of operation high bioenergy and nutrient recovery comparatively anaerobic technologies are more efficient for the biological treatment of polluted effluent than aerobic technologies 5 3 combined anaerobic aerobic treatment combined systems are operationally and economically valuable as they integrate the advantages of anaerobic and aerobic treatments hence offering a robust effluent treatment and overcoming drawbacks of the separate individual systems 189 the removal of veterinary antibiotics from swine effluent using combined treatment processes was investigated by han et al 190 findings from the studies showed 3 of total antibiotics amx 57 and 95 cod were removed by anaerobic digestion while 92 of total antibiotics were removed by the sequencing batch reactor the above findings affirm the view that anaerobic treatment breaks down pollutants into solubilised organic matter which are better eliminated using aerobic treatment 191 chen et al 192 in a novel combined process comprising of anaerobic micro aerobic and two stage aerobic achieved varying degrees of amx removal from pharmaceutical effluent from the results mechanisms for amx removal in ranking order are biodegradation adsorption and hydrolysis across all systems biodegradation accounted for most removal due to the presence of large colonies of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria were found most especially in aerobic systems 5 4 hybrid technologies the recalcitrant nature of antibiotics proves that no single treatment process can achieve complete removal hence the combination of conventional and advanced technologies are adopted 193 such combinations link the physical biological and chemical processes together to achieve desired results in a fenton activated sludge combined system hydroxyl radicals can effectively degrade high concentrations of amx as a pre treatment for subsequent removal in activated sludge 170 the oxidation potentials of radicals were utilised to breakdown the β lactam rings of the antibiotics furthermore 80 of pen contained in industrial effluent was eliminated with a combination of several biological processes and micro electrolysis 194 from the results it is suggested that micro electrolysis process enhanced the biodegradability of the effluent by way of electrochemical oxidation and co precipitation mechanisms 195 co precipitation here refers to the agglomeration of foreign species within structures of precipitating compound e g clustering of contaminants in oxides of iron 196 this leads to the functional destabilisation and simultaneous removal of pen g nh3 n and bod5 cod concentrations from effluent 5 5 microbial community the recalcitrant nature of pens in the environs is well known nevertheless microorganisms can breakdown these antibiotics by utilising several mechanisms pathways such as biodegradation hydrolysis etc with wastewater from treatment plants and its sludge as sources of microbes enzymatic degradation of target pollutants could be accomplished the biodegradation of amx in an aqueous environment performed by pure bacterial culture 197 199 microbial consortia 200 201 and immobilised fungi 202 resulted in high removal of the pollutant notably the removal mechanism is affected by the intrinsic properties of the biocatalyst and the conditions of the environment in which it acts for instance the findings of liu et al 199 showed that nitrogen concentrations could control exchanges between amx and microcystis aeruginosa via the synthesis of penicillin binding proteins this phenomenon resulted in 30 5 amx removal after 7days at nitrogen concentration of 5 mg l conversely the addition of co substrates increased the responses of functional enzymes such as β lactamase and amidase respectively to hydrolyse β lactam ring and amide bond of amx thus enhancing the pollutant removal 203 pen g biodegradation from various matrices was reported by different authors using several bacterial strains 126 187 204 serratia sp achieved pen g degradation efficiency of 84 at the end of 14 days due to the presence of hydrolysing and multi resistant enzymes 204 unlike in the case of serratia sp wang et al 126 investigated the degradation capacity of klebsiella pneumonia on glucose and pen g substrates their findings showed that ring opening by β lactamase enzyme from the resistant bacteria promotes the transformation of pen g to metabolites such as penilloic acid penillic acid despite the harsh conditions of the medium the removal efficiency of pen g 99 99 exceeded that of conventional substrate 93 due to its biodegradation process is interlaced with another biochemical process hydrolysis thus the presence of transient and dynamic metabolites from the available literature works on biological processes prokaryotic microorganisms i e bacteria are vastly responsible for the degradation of pens from aquatic matrices this is due to their ability to close link molecular structures of the antibiotics to enzyme active sites for biodegradation summarily biodegradation mechanism results to near complete degradation of the antibiotics from aqueous solutions and integrated biological processes give the best performance also due to variations in operating conditions effluent type and recalcitrant nature of pen antibiotics near perfect removal of the antibiotics and their intermediates can be possibly achieved by the integration of the above mentioned biological processes 6 comparing the different treatment methods in this section the different classes of removal processes for pens are compared and discussed the most widely studied separation processes for pens is adsorption adsorption is low cost does not require the addition of any chemical has low energy requirement and can be regenerated the comparative ease and speed at which batch experimental studies are performed for adsorption usually lead to lots of published literature on the subject though membrane processes are not as popular as adsorption for pens nanofiltration is the most widely studied membrane process due to its high efficiency in comparison with other membrane processes a lot of aops have been studied and there is no specific type that is widely used for pens research on the subject now focuses on the investigation of hybrid technologies and a combination of different processes in table 9 the advantages and disadvantages of different mitigation strategies for pen in water are compared with the exception of microfiltration and electrocoagulation other separation processes have been found to be effective for the removal of pens from water the major drawback of membrane separation processes is the high cost of usage and high energy requirements adsorption solves both of these issues albeit at a lower influent load aops are also generally expensive and energy intensive their major advantage is their highly effective performance for pens removal and the subsequent absence of sludge biological processes on the other hand are low cost and quite popular however they are quite sensitive to the nature of the influent as changes in ph and temperature can cause a shock on the micro organisms and hence affect the process performance 7 knowledge gap and future perspectives based on this review several interesting gaps were identified that could serve as future work for other research teams from the review of membrane separation processes for amx and pen recovery it was observed that nf membranes were the commonly adopted membrane type with associated appreciably high removal efficiency however most of the reported amx and pen recovery studies were performed using synthetic effluent it was noted that real effluent from effluent treatment plants wwtps are usually characterised by a huge presence of natural organic matters nom these noms constitutes a major limitation to the wide application of membranes in wwtps being the major cause of membrane fouling and subsequent loss of membrane flux serious undoing in membrane filtration interestingly few recent studies 35 46 48 demonstrated the efficiency and the superiority of an integrated treatment approach to a stand alone treatment mode therefore researchers are encouraged towards a continued exploration of varieties of integrated hybrid processes to mitigate the incidences of fouling due to nom and ensure effective and efficient membrane application in wwtps carbon based adsorbents are the most efficient class of adsorbents for pens removal from water however adsorbents from clay mofs polymers and resins have not been extensively studied for pens furthermore the disposal of used adsorbent has not been considered as also observed for diclofenac adsorption 3 key studies such as adsorbent disposal cost benefit analysis and adsorbent disposal techniques have not been investigated for pens adsorption a considerable number of studies have not been done on the use of only ultrasound us for pen g and amx degradation which can be compared with the addition of other aops in the study to see the degree of variation when the us alone is applied also the effectiveness of using different colours of irradiation light has not been considered for amx oxidation studies on the combination of us and different catalysts such as nio tio2 etc have not been exhausted for both pollutants even the us uv catalyst process which included both the two energy sources used for pen removal 138 which gave a good result for pen g 91 3 cod removal have not been tested for amx gamma ionising irradiation can be saturated with gases such as n2o o2 and n2 etc which was done for amx oxidation which resulted in toc of 90 143 and not for pen g 141 to observe whether there will be an improvement in the process even a study obtained 95 91 for aniline removal using us h2o2 113 where the us cleaves the oo bond in h2o2 to generate oh but no study for amx and pen g using the same route was reported the us assisted persulfate process which resulted in 98 amx removal 175 has not been investigated for pen g removal even the degradation pen g using the electrochemical aop was not reported by any researcher the popular sono fenton process was not reported for the degradation of amx and pen g us enhances fenton processes 122 therefore it is encouraged that more research is carried out to find more alternative aops for complete reduction mineralisation of pen g the applicability of the aops is limited at an industrial scale due to their high operating cost 106 recently cuerda correa et al 106 suggested that the synergistic effects between the processes should also be investigated at least on a pilot scale metabolites have been found to pose an environmental risk 19 125 but most of the scientific experiments do not reflect on them in aops for pens therefore studies on the metabolites formed after pens degradation through aops are very beneficial the breakdown of organic substrates results in volumetric increase that can have drastic effects on the removal efficiencies of targeted pollutants and biological systems the effects of volumetric loading rate vlr however were reported for egsb performance in amoxicillin pre treatment from wastewater 180 consequently it is suggested that studies should be done on the effects of vlr and pollutants shock loads for the various types of biological treatment technologies also degradation of amx and pen g results in the formation of metabolites that are equally recalcitrant therefore constitute harm if left untreated in the final effluent degradation and removal of these metabolites in addition to the parent antibiotics by the various biological systems are silent in the literature reviewed lastly mechanisms for the breakdown of antibiotics contained in wastewater include biosynthesis endogenous respiration biodegradation adsorption hydrolysis from the reviewed literature biodegradation features prominently as a dominant mechanism for antibiotics removal studies on the effects of the other mechanisms need to be done as biodegradation remains limited in ph neutral solutions 186 also the presence of β lactamase in enzymatic degradation of β lactams makes it imperative for research into these other mechanisms furthermore there exists the need to determine optimum values of temperature and ph conditions for biological processes as these parameters will assist in modelling and prediction of such techniques in large scale applications some aops have not been tried for pens due to sufficient information gathered during degradation of other pollutants this could be used to make predictions of the potential performance for pens high costs of the specific process or low likelihood of technical upscaling the process could be other challenges why specific processes have not been tried however this does not preclude researchers from conducting preliminary examinations of such processes for potential new insights the upscaling of a particular process is an important determinant of the acceptability and wide application of a particular mitigation strategy researchers usually consider cost and performance of the process at a larger scale the advantages and disadvantages have already been discussed in the previous sections 8 conclusion in this review the research efforts on the removal of pens via a variety of separation degradation and biological processes were examined it was noted that isotropic microporous microfiltration membranes are not effective for rejecting amx and pen due to their large uniform pore size distribution 0 1 μm which is quite large for such applications numerous researchers favoured the application of nf membrane as compared to ro membrane because the latter usually overshoot the intended water quality objective by depleting the concentration of other useful dissolved minerals and hardness to a detrimental extent it was observed that a large number of adsorbent materials have been investigated as sorbents for the removal of pens from water carbon based adsorbents were the most efficient class of adsorbents for pens removal from water lewis acid base interactions hydrogen bonding electrostatic attraction and π π interactions were the main adsorption mechanisms generally the uv assisted aops and the fenton like processes outperformed the electrochemical and us assisted aops for pen g and amx degradation aops must be incorporated with other methods of treatment to minimise potential costs in terms of energy time equipment and chemicals biological processes for pens removal have also been explored in the domain of aerobic anaerobic and hybrid processes anaerobic treatment processes were observed to be more efficient for the removal of pens than aerobic processes with the exception of microfiltration and electrocoagulation most other processes were found to be effective for the removal of pens from water though effective these processes have some disadvantages the major drawback of membrane separation processes is the high cost of usage and high energy requirements adsorption solves both of these issues albeit at a lower influent load aops are also generally expensive and energy intensive biological processes are quite sensitive to the nature of the influent as changes in ph and temperature can cause a shock on the micro organisms and hence affect the process performance from this review it can be surmised that the mitigation of pens from the aqueous is important for the achievement of environmental sustainability and this has aroused the interest of many researchers on the subject there has been great research progress on the subject and many new findings have been obtained in recent times though there is still much work to be done compliance with ethical standards this article does not contain any studies involving human or animal

13679,iron copper oxide impregnated naoh activated biochar fecu abc was successfully fabricated through simple pyrolysis of activated biochar followed by the impregnation method the catalytic activity of the bimetallic catalyst was investigated for ciprofloxacin cip degradation through a heterogeneous photo electro fenton process at natural ph the characterization analyses verified the structural suitability of as synthesized fecu abc to act as a catalyst for treating cip the effects of operating parameters such as cu fe mass ratio initial ph catalyst dosage electrical current and initial concentration of cip were carefully studied complete removal of cip concentrations of up to 45 mg l was obtained after 2 h of reaction at cu fe mass ratio of 1 1 ph 5 8 catalyst dosage of 1 g l and electrical current of 400 ma cip decay followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics the synthesized heterogeneous catalyst exhibited a remarkable catalytic activity at natural ph 92 mineralization of cip after 8 h under the optimum conditions the prepared catalyst possessed great stability and structural integrity for 5 consecutive runs furthermore from a practical point of view the catalyst exhibited an acceptable performance by oxidizing cip dissolved in various water matrices such as tap water river water and a real sample of wastewater the possible cip degradation pathways were also proposed based on the identification of different oxidation by products keywords heterogeneous catalyst fecu abc photo electro fenton process ciprofloxacin mineralization 1 introduction as one of the most outstanding medical achievements in the history of mankind antibiotics have successfully been used to destroy various kinds of hazardous bacteria nonetheless this accomplishment was not perfectly innocuous in the last decade due to the widespread overuse and misuse of antibiotics their concentration in water reservoirs is approaching a risky level ciprofloxacin is one of these emerging pollutants which its presence at high concentrations in the aquatic environment has led to serious environmental concerns ciprofloxacin can cause nausea vomiting acute renal failure and diarrhea if present in drinking water 1 since this refractory antibiotic cannot easily be decomposed by living organisms it is considered to be a serious threat to the prosperity and diversity of useful microorganisms 2 research endeavors have been made to develop hybrid water treatment methods for the effective elimination of antibiotic pollution from water resources among these different processes advanced oxidation processes aops are widely replacing the conventional methods to tackle their inevitable drawbacks such as poor efficiency and expensiveness 3 gupta et al reported around 70 cip degradation from synthetic wastewater cip concentration 100 mg l through classical fenton oxidation performed under the acidic condition for 120 min duration 4 the application of biochar produced from sewage sludge as a heterogeneous fenton like catalyst eliminated more than 80 of 10 mg l cip under a less acidic condition although the reaction time was increased to 4 h 5 electro fenton ef is a more powerful approach to degrade cip mn2 fe2 modified graphite felt ferrocene functionalized graphene and nimn2o4 cf cathodes have been effective to completely mineralize cip present in water 6 8 as one of hybrid aops photo electro fenton pef has been extensively studied and implemented to decompose various kinds of toxic bio recalcitrant antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole 9 erythromycin 10 and nafcillin 11 during the electro fenton process the two electron oxygen reduction reaction orr continuously generates in situ h2o2 on the surface of the cathode eq 1 highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals generated by oxidation of fe2 ions through classical fenton reaction eq 2 unselectively attack organic pollutants and degrade them into lighter and less toxic intermediates eq 3 oh radicals can also be generated through direct irradiation of uv eq 4 and by uv promoted re generation of fe2 species through the photo fenton process eq 5 12 1 o2 gas 2h 2e h2o2 2 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 3 organic pollutants oh intermediates co2 h2o 4 h2o2 hυ 2 oh 5 fe oh 2 hυ fe2 oh conventionally soluble ferrous salts are used as a homogeneous catalyst source this strategy suffers from several disadvantages limiting its practical application the homogeneous fenton process is efficient merely under a limited operative ph between 2 and 3 5 restricting its application for degradation of organic pollutants dissolved in solutions with lower acidity when working at low ph values the necessity of the neutralization process compounds the problem by the production of a huge amount of undesired iron sludge generated through the precipitation of iron ions 13 one effective approach to circumvent this problem is limiting the presence of the catalyst in the aqueous environment by using a heterogeneous catalyst a heterogeneous form of the catalyst is recoverable and regularly sustains its activity over successive operations in recent years the development of new generations of heterogeneous iron containing catalysts with efficacy over a wide ph range has provided a wealth of scientific interest iron bearing minerals such as ferrihydrite hematite goethite lepidocrocite magnetite and pyrite were primarily used to heterogeneously catalyze the degradation process of some organic pollutants from wastewaters 14 aside from naturally occurring fenton catalysts the fabrication and design of various kinds of synthetic iron containing catalysts with engineerable properties were reported by researchers 15 16 the performance of heterogeneous catalysts is highly dependent on the distribution of active sites in order to avoid amalgamation and provide a well dispersed field of active sites catalyst species are often immobilized onto a porous surface recently considerable interest has been paid to the application of biochar bc as an eco friendly low cost and porous substrate to the host catalyst species biochar has also demonstrated a positive impact on the acceleration of oh production through h2o2 decomposition 17 fabrication and development of biochar from excess materials such as agricultural waste and sewage sludge is an environmentally friendly process since it contributes to the reduction of the overall carbon footprint 18 19 moreover there is a variety of physical and chemical activation processes that can be applied to further enhance the porosity and surface area of biochar despite all its promising structural and chemical characteristics as catalyst support the employment of activated biochar with abundant pore structure and supreme surface area has been seldom studied according to recent literature another effective way to facilitate the oxidation process in an aqueous medium with higher ph values is by introducing acidic micro environments using lewis acidic metals such as cu mn and co as a co catalyst 20 in this sense the results of recent studies have demonstrated the benefit of the co existence of cu cu2 and fe2 fe3 redox pairs in the structure of catalyst to not only broaden the practical ph range of fenton based reactions but also to further improve the oxidation process by enhancing the generation of hydroxyl radicals 21 22 in the present study the degradation of ciprofloxacin cip was investigated through the heterogeneous photo electro fenton process catalyzed by fecu naoh activated biochar the structural properties of the as prepared bimetallic catalyst were examined to verify the chemical and morphological properties of a catalyst before the treatment process effects of several influential parameters such as mass ratio of cu fe in the catalyst initial ph of solution dosage of catalyst and cip as well as electrical current were carefully experimented the mineralization of cip was ascertained by monitoring the total organic carbon toc abatement and the reaction intermediates production during the degradation process in the end the effectiveness of the heterogeneous catalyst was considered by various tests and compared with the literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used in the research were of analytical grade without further purification deionized water was used to prepare the solutions in

walnut shell was used as a raw material to prepare biochar after washing several times with deionized water to remove impurities attached to their surfaces raw materials were oven dried at 60 c to reach a constant weight then walnut shells were ground and passed through a 50 mesh sieve the crushed walnut shell was mixed with naoh activating agent mass ratio of 1 1 the mixture then was pyrolyzed

with deionized water to a constant ph of 7 and finally dried at 100 c for 6 h in an oven to synthesize the composite catalyst suitable amounts of fe no3 3 9h2o and cu no3 2 3h2o depending on the mass ratio of cu fe of 0 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 and 1 0 were initially dissolved in the deionized water then 4 g of the activated sample 20 nominal mass ratio of metal was added into already mixed solutions under continuous stirring at 30 c for 24 h the ph of zero point charge of activated biochar was 6 85 fig s1 upon completion of the mixing step the mixture was dried for 10 h at 95 c and calcined in the furnace at 200 c for 2 h the final samples were washed with deionized water and dried at 60 c overnight 24 the obtained samples of composite catalysts were named based on the mass ratio of cu fe fe

fenton oxidation experiments of the cip antibiotic were performed in an undivided cylindrical glass reactor a cylindrical graphite rod was used as the cathode and a platinum pt plate as the anode the

low pressure mercury vapor lamp was used as a source of uv irradiation the initial ph of the reaction medium varied between 2 9 and was adjusted to the given value using 0 1 m h2so4 or naoh solutions

at different time intervals were centrifuged to separate the catalyst to measure cip removal efficiency the initial and final concentration of cip was analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer perkin

discussion 3 1 characterization of catalysts the sem micrographs of untreated biochar bc activated biochar abc and fecu 2 abc are shown in figs 1 a c as expected the activation process contributed to the development of a well developed porous structure comparing with the activated sample the untreated form of biochar exhibited a relatively poor pore structure the well aligned micro channels developed in the structure of abc favored the impregnation of catalyst particles onto its surface in comparison to abc the surfaces of the composite samples were rougher and the pore structure has been blocked to some extent by the catalyst particles figs 1 d f show edx elemental mapping of cufe 2 abc the edx elemental maps confirmed that fe and cu elements are uniformly distributed in fecu 2 abc the relative atomic content of these elements is tabulated in table 1 the mass ratio of cu fe was 0 97 almost equal to the theoretical value 1 the xrd patterns of bc abc fe abc cu abc and fecu 2 abc are presented in fig 2 a as shown in this figure the xrd patterns of untreated bc and activated biochars abcs did not present appreciable differences a broad diffraction peak at 2θ 20 26 is representative of the amorphous structure of graphite in biochar and its activated form 25 by introducing fe cu binary oxides the intensity of carbon peak slightly became weaker indicating the possible coverage of catalyst onto the surface of abc for fe abc the peaks appearing at 33 28 0 5 and 35 75 0 5 represent the existence of fe2o3 26 moreover the diffraction peak at 57 2 0 5 was characteristic peaks of fe3o4 27 cu abc peaks at 38 18 0 5 and 48 40 0 5 reflected the presence of cuo and the present peaks around 42 40 0 5 and 61 71 0 5 testified to the existence of cu2o in the structure of composite 28 29 moreover the presence of fe2o3 cuo and cu2o was conformed in the structure of fecu 2 abc composite although the peak of fe3o4 was not detected which may be attributed to the bimetallic interaction of the composite it is worth mentioning that the detection peaks of metallic compounds were not significantly sharp as suggested previously this phenomenon might be an indicator of a uniform dispersion of catalyst sites onto the porous structure 30 in the case of our catalyst the edx results of the samples were in agreement with this conclusion ftir spectra of samples were depicted in fig 2 b the broad bands at the wavelength of 3432 cm 1 are characteristic of the oh stretching vibration of the hydrogen bonded network on the surface of water molecules and hydroxyl functional groups from alcohol phenols and carboxylic acids 31 the activation of biochar by naoh strengthened the vibration of oh the peaks centered at 2926 cm 1and 1568 cm 1can be assigned to c h stretching bands of aliphatic amines and cc stretching of the benzene rings verifying the aromatization process during the pyrolysis process of biochar moreover the peaks at 1387cm 1 1112 cm 1 and 873 cm 1are bands associated with carboxyl o co alkoxy co and ch groups 32 for fecu 2 biochar composite the peaks centered at 579 cm 1 25 and 605 cm 1can be assigned to the fe o and cu o bending vibrations 29 33 in addition the peak of oh at 3432 cm 1 migrated to 3428 cm 1 as an indicator of a chelation effect of the ionic form of iron and copper with oh group the chemical states of the elements present on the cufe 2 abc catalyst surface were also analyzed via xps in agreement with the edx analysis the catalyst sample contained fe cu c n and o according to the full survey spectra in fig s2 the surface of activated biochar supported metal oxide was covered by different polar functional groups implying its hydrophilic nature for the c1s xps spectrum three peaks at 285 2 0 5 284 7 0 2 and 285 6 0 5 ev were attributed to cc ch and co respectively 34 35 the three peaks components at approximately 397 5 0 2 401 3 0 5 and 401 9 0 3 ev were consistent with the nitrogen atoms in the conh nh2 and nc species respectively 36 37 the presence of the oxide layer of iron and copper on the structure of the catalyst was confirmed as displayed on the high resolution of fe 2p cu 2p and o1 spectrums fig 3 the spectral peak of fe 2p is shown in fig 3 a two main spectrum peaks corresponding to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 are detected the fe 2p3 2 peak consists of one fe2 peak at 709 5 0 5 and two peaks at 711 4 0 2 and 712 6 0 2 ev correlating to the existence of octahedrally coordinated fe3 38 39 the fe 2p1 2 consisted of two peaks at 721 0 5 and 725 9 0 2 ev attributed to fe2 and fe3 respectively the presence of fe2 peaks might be related to the existence of fe3o4 composite in the structure of fecu 2 abc sample which was not detectable with xrd analysis another satellite peak at 716 1 0 5 ev originated from the high spin and charge transition of fe 2p 40 the spectra regions of cu 2p can be fitted into four contributions it can be seen in fig 3 b that the cu 2p1 2 band at 954 1 0 5 ev the higher band of cu 2p3 2 at 934 5 0 5 ev and the shake up peak at942 0 5 ev are attributed to cu2 41 42 the lower band of cu 2p3 2 at 932 2 0 2 ev belongs to cu 43 two separate peaks in the o1s xps spectra fig 3 c located at 529 8 ev and 531 2 are corresponded to o2 in oxygen containing functional groups co oco oc o and co as well as iron and copper oxides fe o and cu o 44 the oxygen was introduced in the structure of the catalyst through the calcination process based on the results above the assumption can be well verified that a layer of iron and copper oxide containing fe2o3 fe3o4 cu2o and cuo had covered the mesoporous structure of activated biochar fig 4 depicted the bet surface area and pore size distribution plots of bc abc and fecu 2 abc as shown in fig 4 samples featured type iv isotherms with h3 hysteresis loop according to the iupac classification and n2 uptakes in the middle relative pressure from 0 2 to 0 9 corresponding to mesoporous material with random distribution and interconnection of pores comparing with abc and fecu 2 abc the bc sample presented a duplicated adsorption and desorption line indicating an undeveloped porous structure as shown in table 2 the activated sample of biochar possessed the highest pore volume and bet surface area while the untreated biochar showed a relatively low pore volume and undeveloped surface area the results as expected indicated that the naoh agent significantly improved the structural properties of poor biochar during the chemical activation process indeed the activation process improved the specific surface area and pore volume of biochar samples by more than 380 and 220 respectively chemical activation of biochar with naoh is predominated by the following reaction 9 6naoh 2c 2na 2na2co3 3h2 na2co3 decomposes at high temperature of pyrolysis as 10 na2co3 na2o co2 the interaction between alkali compounds and carbon along with the presence of h2 and co2 is responsible for the development of extensive porosity within the activated biochar structure 18 both sbet and pore volume of abc experienced a decrease revealing that fe and cu occupied some areas on the surface and porous structure of abc with loading fe and cu onto the surface of abc as displayed in the inset panels of fig 4 the pore size distribution curves calculated from desorption branches clearly confirm the narrow pore size distribution of samples the activation process decreased the average pore diameter of biochar from 5 62 to 3 79 nm comparing with the activated biochar sample the catalyst sample possessed a bulkier average pore diameter 4 83 nm which was contributed to the deposition of metal oxides onto the surface and inner surface of the catalyst pore sizes below 2 nm were only observed in the activated biochar sample indicating a combination of micro and mesoporous structure for abc in the case of bc the microporous structure was not developed and the introduction of iron and copper oxide onto the surface of abc blocked the micro pores of the fecu 2 abc sample since the molecular size of cip was less than the average pore diameter of the composite sample the porous structure of the catalyst had enough space to host cip molecules during the photo electro fenton reaction 3 2 effects of operational factors on degradation process 3 2 1 effect of cu fe mass ratio it is well documented that the addition of cu as a co catalyst could widely improve the catalytic properties of fenton based processes 45 46 the previous reports emphasized that the oxidative ability of the bimetallic catalyst is highly dependent on its chemical composition to see the impact of this parameter experiments were accomplished to investigate the synergistic effect of bimetals as various mass ratios of cu fe as depicted in fig 5 monometallic catalysts of fe abc and cu abc were able to remove 89 8 and 75 4 of cip within 120 min of pef reaction indicating the dominance of fe as the main catalyst of the reaction with the cu fe mass ratio changing from 0 1 to 1 1 the efficiency of cip removal was improved from 89 8 98 9 reflecting the successful synergistic effect of fe and cu in the pef degradation of cip the adsorption of as generated h2o2 onto the well developed surface of the mesoporous bimetallic catalyst facilitated the reduction of fe3 to fe2 and cu2 to cu through fenton and fenton like reactions respectively the reduced forms of the metals are instantly oxidized in the reaction medium to accomplish the cycle of fe3 fe2 and cu2 cu redox pairs eqs 11 14 meanwhile the reaction between fe3 and cu results in the generation of fe2 through eq 15 thereby accelerating the production of oh 20 in other words the co existence of fe and cu on the surface of activated biochar accelerates the process of electron transfer in the reaction environment providing an appropriate condition for the generation of hydrogen peroxide and reactive radical species 11 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ho2 h 12 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 13 cu2 h2o2 cu ho2 h 14 cu h2o2 cu2 oh oh 15 fe3 cu cu2 fe2 further ramping up or stepping up of cu fe mass ratio from 1 1 to 2 1 reduced the final removal efficiency of cip more than 5 this decline in catalyst performance was observed by other researchers and can be explained by the unstable nature of cu activating agents which are easily scavenged at higher concentrations 26 45 47 nonetheless all bimetallic catalysts achieved better cip removal efficiencies than monometallic catalysts the concentration decays are also analyzed by means of kinetic equations in all cases a linear relationship between ln ccip t ccip 0 and electrolysis time min was found considering a pseudo first order reaction for cip removal as presented in the inset panels of fig 5 as depicted in table 3 the reaction rate constant of fecu 2 abc was 0 03686 min 1 which is higher than that of other composites under the same operational conditions since the best catalytic performance for the pef process was obtained for the catalyst with cu fe mass ratio of 1 1 fecu 2 abc was selected as the catalyst to investigate the effect of other parameters for subsequent experiments 3 2 2 effect of initial ph to assess the effect of initial ph value as one of the major influencing factors in the fenton based processes the degradation efficiency of cip was measured under different initial ph levels 2 9 it was found that cip removal efficiency increased by increasing the initial ph from 2 0 3 0 while it was decreased when ph rose from 3 0 9 0 the same pattern was obtained for the reaction rate constant of cip removal efficiency as depicted in the insert panel of fig 6 and table 3 unlike homogeneous fenton reaction the performance of fecu 2 abc was not highly dependent on ph values in fact while using the bimetallic heterogeneous catalyst cip removal efficiency was located between 85 1 and 100 over a wide ph range of 3 7 within 120 min of reaction the reaction medium at ph of 2 favors the generation of hydroxyoxidanium h3o2 preventing the effective production of hydroxyl radicals 48 as expected the best performance occurred at ph 3 which is the ideal acidic media in which the oxidative capacity of oh radicals is at its highest point besides the detachment and ionization of catalyst particles from the surface of catalyst at a highly acidic environment lead to the prevalence of homogeneous fenton and fenton like reactions over their heterogeneous parallels this situation is unfavorable as it can jeopardize the reusability of the catalyst and enhance the risk of iron precipitation during the neutralization process on the other hand the comparative productivity of the fecu abc based heterogeneous system at ph 5 8 is ascribed to the marginal precipitation of catalyst and contributory effect of cu the precipitation of iron with increasing alkalinity is the major performance deteriorating feature of the traditional homogeneous ef process the application of heterogeneous catalysts minimizes iron precipitation by concentrating the reaction on the surface of the catalyst rather than the bulk of the solution this can be explained by the deprotonation of strong acidic sites in the structure of the catalyst which results in the formation of acidic microenvironments near the surface of catalyst particles 20 49 moreover according to the literature the introduced cu metals exhibit superior catalytic activity at ph values higher than 4 5 boosting the synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts at natural ph 50 these two effects can compensate for the lower production and oxidation activity of oh species at higher ph values 25 since working at near neutral ph appears to carry less risk of metal leakage and sludge production during the process the experiments were done at the neutral ph value of cip solution without any adjustment 3 2 3 effect of catalyst dosage catalyst dosage plays an important role in the efficiency of the pef process since it determines the availability of active catalyst sites and controls the production of oh radicals fig 7 indicates the impact of catalyst dosage on the cip removal efficiency by the pef process there is a positive correlation between catalyst dosage and removal efficiency fig 7 clearly shows that the photo electro degradation of cip initially increased as the fecu 2 abc dosage in fact it was increased from 0 5 g l to 1 g l and then decreased when the catalyst amount was beyond1 g l the results of the kinetic analysis exhibited the same trend as the reaction rate constant it was initially increased from 0 01392 min 1 to 0 03686 min 1 and then declined to 0 02811 min 1 for catalyst dosage of 1 25 g l it clearly indicates that increasing the catalyst dosage provides more accessible active sites on the surface of the catalyst to generate oxidative radical species accelerating the degradation reaction furthermore the excessive presence of the catalyst in the reaction medium increases the chance of oh scavenging reactions initiated by catalyst sits eqs 16 17 51 52 16 fe2 oh fe3 oh 17 cu oh cu2 oh the highest removal efficiency was observed at a catalyst concentration of 1 g l 98 95 as a result this dosage was fixed as the optimum level and used in all subsequent experiments 3 2 4 effect of electrical current in the ef based processes electrical current supplies the needed power to drive the electrochemical generation of h2o2 the effect of applied electrical current was investigated by varying the electrical current from 50 ma to 600 ma as shown in fig 8 it can be seen that at its lower values the electrical current can largely affect the degradation of cip while it was not successful to appreciably improve the productivity of the heterogeneous pef process at higher electrical current values there was a clear improvement in the removal efficiency of cip from 85 2 100 when the applied electrical current increased from50 ma to 400 ma after 120 min of reaction fig 8 a likewise the reaction rate constant was increased from 0 01624 min 1 to 0 06359 min 1 when the electrical current increased from 50 ma to 400 ma table 3 accordingly the final toc removal after 8 h of reaction obviously increased from 56 2 93 1 when the applied electrical current varied between the aforementioned values fig 8 b this can be explained by the fact that the initial enhancement in the electrical current increases the number of electrons in the aqueous medium promoting the electro generation of h2o2 and hydroxyl radical nevertheless a further increase in the quantity of electrical current is destructive since it launches a series of parasitic reactions through the unnecessary production of h2o2 a high concentration of electro generated h2o2 has scavenging effects on oh radicals eqs 18 19 and favors the formation of hydroperoxyl radical ooh with lower oxidation capability than hydroxyl radicals 31 the reduction of h2o2at the surface of the cathode eq 20 and four electron reduction eq 21 reactions are other negative side reactions preventing the ideal performance of the pef system 53 the obtained results for the accumulation of oh radicals are in agreement with this theory as depicted in fig s3 when the electrical current was increased from 50 ma to 400 ma the final concentration of accumulated oh radicals was increased from 38 13 μm to 50 05 μm nonetheless the dominance of scavenging reactions at higher currents negatively affected the generation of oh radicals 18 h2o2 oh ooh h2o 19 oh ooh h2o o2 20 h2o2 2h 2e h2o 21 o2 4h 4e 2h2o the observed decline in the reaction rate constant for the electrical current of 600 ma table 3 confirms the aforementioned facts it is also worth mentioning that during the first 4 h of the reaction the toc removal efficiency possessed a fast ascending profile although insignificant changes have been observed for further extending in reaction time the possible explanation for this pattern may be attributed to the recalcitrant nature of organic intermediates produced during the mineralization of cip 7 the transitions of mce values calculated from eq 7 are depicted in fig 8 c during the early stages of the experiments mce displayed a relatively sharp increase before reaching its optimum value intimating high speed mineralization of intermediates by the action of the applied bimetallic heterogeneous catalyst contrarily the gradual progressive drop of mce at extended electrolysis time is connected with the production of short chain organic intermediates with hardly destroyable structures the observed drop in the mce with the increase of electrical current is due to the acceleration of the above mentioned parasitic reactions consuming the electro generated hydroxyl radicals as specified by the obtained results the electrical current of 400 ma was the most effective current intensity for the present heterogeneous pef system with a maximum removal efficiency of 100 and mineralization of 93 1 for 30 mg l of cip 3 2 5 effect of the cip initial concentration the effect of pollutant concentration on the pef process for cip degradation was studied by varying the cip dosage from 15 mg l to 60 mg l as shown in fig 9 there is an inverse correlation between the removal efficiency of the pef reaction and the initial concentration of the pollutant the final cip removal efficiency of the reaction was gradually decreased from 100 to 90 0 with increasing the cip concentration from 15 to 60 mg l according to these results the reaction rate constant was decreased from 0 07329 min 1 to 0 01955 min 1 when the cip initial concentration increased from 15 mg l to 60 mg l in fact an adequate number of oh radicals are available to degrade cip and produce the intermediates at low cip concentrations on the other side the shortage of oxidizing agents prevents the complete elimination of the target pollutant when an excessive amount of cip molecules is available moreover congestion of pollutant in the reaction medium heightens the risk of catalyst deactivation by blocking the active sites 54 nonetheless the bimetallic heterogeneous catalyst synthesized in this research demonstrated high performance by removing to 45 mg l of cip after 2 h of reaction under natural ph 3 3 comparative assessment of cip removal and mineralization efficiencies to precisely monitor the potential of different treatment technologies in the mass reduction of the toxic organic pollutants a sequence of comparison study was conducted by treating 500 ml of 45 mg l cip solution in 50 mm na2so4 by heterogeneous pef process as well as by heterogeneous ef process homogeneous ef process using 0 2 mm feso4 7h2o and anodic oxidation at the electrical current of 400 ma up to 480 min 1 g l of fecu 2 abc catalyst was added to the reaction medium for heterogeneous reactions as observed in figs 10 a b the adsorption process exhibited the lowest efficiency by eliminating 8 5 of cip and 10 of toc within 120 min and 480 min of reaction time respectively furthermore very slow removal and mineralization rates were found through the electro generation of oh by water oxidation reaction onto the surface of pt anode during the anodic oxidation process and in the absence of any form of catalyst 22 pt h2o pt oh h e 15 8 of cip and 18 1 of toc were removed after 120 min and 480 min of the anodic oxidation reaction this conveys that the number of physisorbed pt oh radicals originated from eq 22 at the surface of the anode in fact they were not adequate to treat antibiotic pollution within a reasonable amount of time conversely fig 10 b also represented a very fast and complete cip mineralization by homogeneous pef process at ph of 3 the optimum acidity of homogeneous ef process and heterogeneous pef processes at ph of 5 8 similarly these two processes possessed almost equivalent toc removal after 480 min of reaction the remarkable performance of the heterogeneous ef process at near neutral ph is connected with the synergistic effect of fe and cu and well dispersion of active sites onto the surface of porous activated biochar which enhanced oxidative destruction of organic pollutants in fact cu2 ions are more reactive towards oh radicals than fe3 during the oxidation process of carboxylate intermediates 55 the maximum removal of homogeneous pef dropped up to 75 1 and 72 1 for cip and toc when ph increased from 3 to 5 8 these results indicate that against the heterogeneous pef process the soluble form of the catalyst is not able to maintain its efficacy over a wide range of ph moreover the final cip and toc removal respectively dropped by 90 and 87 2 for heterogeneous ef process compared with the pef process so this indicates the significant role of uv radiation in the degradation process aside from promoting the continuous regeneration of fe2 and hydroxyl radicals uv photons can accelerate the mineralization process through the photo decarboxylation of fe3 carboxylate intermediates eq 23 56 23 fe oocr 2 hυ fe2 co2 r table 4 shows a comparison between the synthesized bimetallic catalyst potential prepared in this research with the literature according to this table the developed fecu abc catalyst has competitive oxidative activity towards cip over a wider range of ph this outstanding performance is related to the excellent distribution of a large number of active sites onto the surface of activated biochar and synergistic effects between iron and copper as fenton and fenton like catalysts to investigate the viability of pef process based on fecu abc heterogeneous catalyst from a practical point of view the removal efficiency of 45 mg l of cip dissolved in tap water river water obtained from karaj river alborz province iran and a real sample of pharmaceutical wastewater obtained from osvah pharmaceutical company tehran iran was studied the characteristics of this wastewater are reported in table s1 as shown in fig 10 c the cip removal data for 120 min were at 100 99 8 and 91 74 for tap water river water and pharmaceutical wastewater respectively furthermore the lower efficiency of the pef process for removing cip from the wastewater matrix is related to the high concentration of dissolved organic matter which can filter the active light and compete with cip molecules over oh radicals through the non selective oxidation process in general the bimetallic activated biochar composite demonstrated a remarkable catalytic performance to efficiently remove cip at nearly circum neutral ph 3 4 recyclability of the catalyst the stability of the synthesized composite was monitored over 5 consecutive cycles to investigate the stability of the catalyst experiments were conducted at ph 3 since acidic condition increases the chance of fe and cu detachment and ionization from the surface of the catalyst 20 after each operation cycle the solid catalyst was removed from the reactor washed with distilled water and dried under n2 to inhibit additional oxidation in the air as shown in fig 10 d the final cip removal data at the end of each run were at 100 95 12 93 76 91 55 and 90 1 respectively the degradation efficiency of cip still was more than 90 after five consecutive runs confirming the adequate stability and reusability of composite over the cip degradation besides the noticed reduction in oxidative activity may be due to the metallic active site leakage and the active site blockage due to the accumulation of the intermediate adsorbed onto the surface of catalyst 57 the concentrations of leached fe and cu ions were analyzed using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy perkin elmer analyst 400 the highest amounts of fe and cu ions were at 0 07 and 0 05 mg l respectively less than 0 15 catalyst leaching in the first cycle and then declined to lower than 0 05 mg l for the subsequent experiments 3 5 intermediates and mineralization pathways of cip to better understand the degradation process of cip lcms was conducted to identify the produced intermediates through the heterogeneous pef process complication and multistage degradation process of cip encompassed the formation and subsequent destruction of intermediates several reactive sites existence on the cip molecules and the simultaneous action of various oxidizing agents in the reaction environment may be proposed as degradation paths of the intermediates fig 11 shows 10 intermediates identification produced during the possible mechanisms the details of detected intermediates were presented in table s2 analysis of lcms fragmentations and comparing with previous literature corroborated the chemical structure of these components through path 1 the piperazine ring of cip was ruptured through oh attack intermediates a with double aldehyde group production further oxidation of compound a by electron holes and hydroxyl radicals resulted in the formation of intermediates b with mono aldehyde moiety the loss of the second aldehyde group on the open piperazine ring converted intermediate b into compound c 58 the intermediate d was generated through the separation of one ethylamine group from intermediate c with a fully opened piperazine ring 59 component e was appeared by subsequent defluorination of d path 2 was started by the generation of f through direct hydroxylation of the aromatic ring of cip 52 intermediate f can undergo further addition of oh group or decarboxylation to process g and h respectively 60 intermediate i was the product of the oh f substitution process of g this path proceeded through the oxidation of i to j after carboxylic release from quinolone moiety pathway 3 was initiated through the substitution of f group by hydroxyl group to produce k in the next step the oxidation of the piperazine ring by oh radicals resulted in the formation of l 61 furthermore the compounds d and g were not detected by lcms analysis due to having a short lifetime and impulsive degradation 59 60 short chain carboxylic acids such as oxalic oxamic and formic acids and then co2 h2o nh4 f and no3 are final products of mineralization processes 4 conclusions in this study a catalyst based on cu and fe bimetallic oxide particles was successfully synthesized the low cost and eco friendly naoh activated biochar obtained from agricultural waste provided a well structured porous matrix for hosting the catalyst particles the materials were characterized by sem edx bet xrd xps and ftir analyses then the bimetallic composite was efficiently applied as a heterogeneous catalyst for the decomposition of ciprofloxacin antibiotic by the pef process the recent composite displayed as excellent ph insensitive catalyst by removing 45 mg l cip without any ph control within 2 h of reaction experimental results confirmed that the heterogeneous catalyst at natural ph showed competitive mineralization with the conventional homogeneous pef process at the acidic condition the intermediates byproducts of cip were determined and a plausible degradation mechanism was proposed moreover low metal leaching verified the structural stability of the synthesized catalyst by justifying its economical and practical applications furthermore the successful elimination of cip from tap water river water and a real sample of pharmaceutical wastewater confirmed the superb performance of the catalyst declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this

13679,iron copper oxide impregnated naoh activated biochar fecu abc was successfully fabricated through simple pyrolysis of activated biochar followed by the impregnation method the catalytic activity of the bimetallic catalyst was investigated for ciprofloxacin cip degradation through a heterogeneous photo electro fenton process at natural ph the characterization analyses verified the structural suitability of as synthesized fecu abc to act as a catalyst for treating cip the effects of operating parameters such as cu fe mass ratio initial ph catalyst dosage electrical current and initial concentration of cip were carefully studied complete removal of cip concentrations of up to 45 mg l was obtained after 2 h of reaction at cu fe mass ratio of 1 1 ph 5 8 catalyst dosage of 1 g l and electrical current of 400 ma cip decay followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics the synthesized heterogeneous catalyst exhibited a remarkable catalytic activity at natural ph 92 mineralization of cip after 8 h under the optimum conditions the prepared catalyst possessed great stability and structural integrity for 5 consecutive runs furthermore from a practical point of view the catalyst exhibited an acceptable performance by oxidizing cip dissolved in various water matrices such as tap water river water and a real sample of wastewater the possible cip degradation pathways were also proposed based on the identification of different oxidation by products keywords heterogeneous catalyst fecu abc photo electro fenton process ciprofloxacin mineralization 1 introduction as one of the most outstanding medical achievements in the history of mankind antibiotics have successfully been used to destroy various kinds of hazardous bacteria nonetheless this accomplishment was not perfectly innocuous in the last decade due to the widespread overuse and misuse of antibiotics their concentration in water reservoirs is approaching a risky level ciprofloxacin is one of these emerging pollutants which its presence at high concentrations in the aquatic environment has led to serious environmental concerns ciprofloxacin can cause nausea vomiting acute renal failure and diarrhea if present in drinking water 1 since this refractory antibiotic cannot easily be decomposed by living organisms it is considered to be a serious threat to the prosperity and diversity of useful microorganisms 2 research endeavors have been made to develop hybrid water treatment methods for the effective elimination of antibiotic pollution from water resources among these different processes advanced oxidation processes aops are widely replacing the conventional methods to tackle their inevitable drawbacks such as poor efficiency and expensiveness 3 gupta et al reported around 70 cip degradation from synthetic wastewater cip concentration 100 mg l through classical fenton oxidation performed under the acidic condition for 120 min duration 4 the application of biochar produced from sewage sludge as a heterogeneous fenton like catalyst eliminated more than 80 of 10 mg l cip under a less acidic condition although the reaction time was increased to 4 h 5 electro fenton ef is a more powerful approach to degrade cip mn2 fe2 modified graphite felt ferrocene functionalized graphene and nimn2o4 cf cathodes have been effective to completely mineralize cip present in water 6 8 as one of hybrid aops photo electro fenton pef has been extensively studied and implemented to decompose various kinds of toxic bio recalcitrant antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole 9 erythromycin 10 and nafcillin 11 during the electro fenton process the two electron oxygen reduction reaction orr continuously generates in situ h2o2 on the surface of the cathode eq 1 highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals generated by oxidation of fe2 ions through classical fenton reaction eq 2 unselectively attack organic pollutants and degrade them into lighter and less toxic intermediates eq 3 oh radicals can also be generated through direct irradiation of uv eq 4 and by uv promoted re generation of fe2 species through the photo fenton process eq 5 12 1 o2 gas 2h 2e h2o2 2 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 3 organic pollutants oh intermediates co2 h2o 4 h2o2 hυ 2 oh 5 fe oh 2 hυ fe2 oh conventionally soluble ferrous salts are used as a homogeneous catalyst source this strategy suffers from several disadvantages limiting its practical application the homogeneous fenton process is efficient merely under a limited operative ph between 2 and 3 5 restricting its application for degradation of organic pollutants dissolved in solutions with lower acidity when working at low ph values the necessity of the neutralization process compounds the problem by the production of a huge amount of undesired iron sludge generated through the precipitation of iron ions 13 one effective approach to circumvent this problem is limiting the presence of the catalyst in the aqueous environment by using a heterogeneous catalyst a heterogeneous form of the catalyst is recoverable and regularly sustains its activity over successive operations in recent years the development of new generations of heterogeneous iron containing catalysts with efficacy over a wide ph range has provided a wealth of scientific interest iron bearing minerals such as ferrihydrite hematite goethite lepidocrocite magnetite and pyrite were primarily used to heterogeneously catalyze the degradation process of some organic pollutants from wastewaters 14 aside from naturally occurring fenton catalysts the fabrication and design of various kinds of synthetic iron containing catalysts with engineerable properties were reported by researchers 15 16 the performance of heterogeneous catalysts is highly dependent on the distribution of active sites in order to avoid amalgamation and provide a well dispersed field of active sites catalyst species are often immobilized onto a porous surface recently considerable interest has been paid to the application of biochar bc as an eco friendly low cost and porous substrate to the host catalyst species biochar has also demonstrated a positive impact on the acceleration of oh production through h2o2 decomposition 17 fabrication and development of biochar from excess materials such as agricultural waste and sewage sludge is an environmentally friendly process since it contributes to the reduction of the overall carbon footprint 18 19 moreover there is a variety of physical and chemical activation processes that can be applied to further enhance the porosity and surface area of biochar despite all its promising structural and chemical characteristics as catalyst support the employment of activated biochar with abundant pore structure and supreme surface area has been seldom studied according to recent literature another effective way to facilitate the oxidation process in an aqueous medium with higher ph values is by introducing acidic micro environments using lewis acidic metals such as cu mn and co as a co catalyst 20 in this sense the results of recent studies have demonstrated the benefit of the co existence of cu cu2 and fe2 fe3 redox pairs in the structure of catalyst to not only broaden the practical ph range of fenton based reactions but also to further improve the oxidation process by enhancing the generation of hydroxyl radicals 21 22 in the present study the degradation of ciprofloxacin cip was investigated through the heterogeneous photo electro fenton process catalyzed by fecu naoh activated biochar the structural properties of the as prepared bimetallic catalyst were examined to verify the chemical and morphological properties of a catalyst before the treatment process effects of several influential parameters such as mass ratio of cu fe in the catalyst initial ph of solution dosage of catalyst and cip as well as electrical current were carefully experimented the mineralization of cip was ascertained by monitoring the total organic carbon toc abatement and the reaction intermediates production during the degradation process in the end the effectiveness of the heterogeneous catalyst was considered by various tests and compared with the literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used in the research were of analytical grade without further purification deionized water was used to prepare the solutions in

walnut shell was used as a raw material to prepare biochar after washing several times with deionized water to remove impurities attached to their surfaces raw materials were oven dried at 60 c to reach a constant weight then walnut shells were ground and passed through a 50 mesh sieve the crushed walnut shell was mixed with naoh activating agent mass ratio of 1 1 the mixture then was pyrolyzed with a muffle furnace at 700 c the heating rate was 5 c min for 2 h under nitrogen gas injection 300 ml min 23 the activated samples were washed with 0 1 m dilute hydrochloric acid for ash removal and with deionized water to a constant ph of 7 and finally dried at 100 c for 6 h in an oven to synthesize the composite catalyst suitable amounts of fe no3 3 9h2o and cu no3 2 3h2o depending on the mass

continuous stirring at 30 c for 24 h the ph of zero point charge of activated biochar was 6 85 fig s1 upon completion of the mixing step the mixture was dried for 10 h at 95 c and calcined in the furnace at 200 c for 2 h the final samples were washed with deionized water and dried at 60 c overnight 24 the obtained samples of composite catalysts were named based on the mass ratio of cu fe fe

low pressure mercury vapor lamp was used as a source of uv irradiation the initial ph of the reaction medium varied between 2 9 and was adjusted to the given value using 0 1 m h2so4 or naoh solutions

at different time intervals were centrifuged to separate the catalyst to measure cip removal efficiency the initial and final concentration of cip was analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer perkin

discussion 3 1 characterization of catalysts the sem micrographs of untreated biochar bc activated biochar abc and fecu 2 abc are shown in figs 1 a c as expected the activation process contributed to the development of a well developed porous structure comparing with the activated sample the untreated form of biochar exhibited a relatively poor pore structure the well aligned micro channels developed in the structure of abc favored the impregnation of catalyst particles onto its surface in comparison to abc the surfaces of the composite samples were rougher and the pore structure has been blocked to some extent by the catalyst particles figs 1 d f show edx elemental mapping of cufe 2 abc the edx elemental maps confirmed that fe and cu elements are uniformly distributed in fecu 2 abc the relative atomic content of these elements is tabulated in table 1 the mass ratio of cu fe was 0 97 almost equal to the theoretical value 1 the xrd patterns of bc abc fe abc cu abc and fecu 2 abc are presented in fig 2 a as shown in this figure the xrd patterns of untreated bc and activated biochars abcs did not present appreciable differences a broad diffraction peak at 2θ 20 26 is representative of the amorphous structure of graphite in biochar and its activated form 25 by introducing fe cu binary oxides the intensity of carbon peak slightly became weaker indicating the possible coverage of catalyst onto the surface of abc for fe abc the peaks appearing at 33 28 0 5 and 35 75 0 5 represent the existence of fe2o3 26 moreover the diffraction peak at 57 2 0 5 was characteristic peaks of fe3o4 27 cu abc peaks at 38 18 0 5 and 48 40 0 5 reflected the presence of cuo and the present peaks around 42 40 0 5 and 61 71 0 5 testified to the existence of cu2o in the structure of composite 28 29 moreover the presence of fe2o3 cuo and cu2o was conformed in the structure of fecu 2 abc composite although the peak of fe3o4 was not detected which may be attributed to the bimetallic interaction of the composite it is worth mentioning that the detection peaks of metallic compounds were not significantly sharp as suggested previously this phenomenon might be an indicator of a uniform dispersion of catalyst sites onto the porous structure 30 in the case of our catalyst the edx results of the samples were in agreement with this conclusion ftir spectra of samples were depicted in fig 2 b the broad bands at the wavelength of 3432 cm 1 are characteristic of the oh stretching vibration of the hydrogen bonded network on the surface of water molecules and hydroxyl functional groups from alcohol phenols and carboxylic acids 31 the activation of biochar by naoh strengthened the vibration of oh the peaks centered at 2926 cm 1and 1568 cm 1can be assigned to c h stretching bands of aliphatic amines and cc stretching of the benzene rings verifying the aromatization process during the pyrolysis process of biochar moreover the peaks at 1387cm 1 1112 cm 1 and 873 cm 1are bands associated with carboxyl o co alkoxy co and ch groups 32 for fecu 2 biochar composite the peaks centered at 579 cm 1 25 and 605 cm 1can be assigned to the fe o and cu o bending vibrations 29 33 in addition the peak of oh at 3432 cm 1 migrated to 3428 cm 1 as an indicator of a chelation effect of the ionic form of iron and copper with oh group the chemical states of the elements present on the cufe 2 abc catalyst surface were also analyzed via xps in agreement with the edx analysis the catalyst sample contained fe cu c n and o according to the full survey spectra in fig s2 the surface of activated biochar supported metal oxide was covered by different polar functional groups implying its hydrophilic nature for the c1s xps spectrum three peaks at 285 2 0 5 284 7 0 2 and 285 6 0 5 ev were attributed to cc ch and co respectively 34 35 the three peaks components at approximately 397 5 0 2 401 3 0 5 and 401 9 0 3 ev were consistent with the nitrogen atoms in the conh nh2 and nc species respectively 36 37 the presence of the oxide layer of iron and copper on the structure of the catalyst was confirmed as displayed on the high resolution of fe 2p cu 2p and o1 spectrums fig 3 the spectral peak of fe 2p is shown in fig 3 a two main spectrum peaks corresponding to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 are detected the fe 2p3 2 peak consists of one fe2 peak at 709 5 0 5 and two peaks at 711 4 0 2 and 712 6 0 2 ev correlating to the existence of octahedrally coordinated fe3 38 39 the fe 2p1 2 consisted of two peaks at 721 0 5 and 725 9 0 2 ev attributed to fe2 and fe3 respectively the presence of fe2 peaks might be related to the existence of fe3o4 composite in the structure of fecu 2 abc sample which was not detectable with xrd analysis another satellite peak at 716 1 0 5 ev originated from the high spin and charge transition of fe 2p 40 the spectra regions of cu 2p can be fitted into four contributions it can be seen in fig 3 b that the cu 2p1 2 band at 954 1 0 5 ev the higher band of cu 2p3 2 at 934 5 0 5 ev and the shake up peak at942 0 5 ev are attributed to cu2 41 42 the lower band of cu 2p3 2 at 932 2 0 2 ev belongs to cu 43 two separate peaks in the o1s xps spectra fig 3 c located at 529 8 ev and 531 2 are corresponded to o2 in oxygen containing functional groups co oco oc o and co as well as iron and copper oxides fe o and cu o 44 the oxygen was introduced in the structure of the catalyst through the calcination process based on the results above the assumption can be well verified that a layer of iron and copper oxide containing fe2o3 fe3o4 cu2o and cuo had covered the mesoporous structure of activated biochar fig 4 depicted the bet surface area and pore size distribution plots of bc abc and fecu 2 abc as shown in fig 4 samples featured type iv isotherms with h3 hysteresis loop according to the iupac classification and n2 uptakes in the middle relative pressure from 0 2 to 0 9 corresponding to mesoporous material with random distribution and interconnection of pores comparing with abc and fecu 2 abc the bc sample presented a duplicated adsorption and desorption line indicating an undeveloped porous structure as shown in table 2 the activated sample of biochar possessed the highest pore volume and bet surface area while the untreated biochar showed a relatively low pore volume and undeveloped surface area the results as expected indicated that the naoh agent significantly improved the structural properties of poor biochar during the chemical activation process indeed the activation process improved the specific surface area and pore volume of biochar samples by more than 380 and 220 respectively chemical activation of biochar with naoh is predominated by the following reaction 9 6naoh 2c 2na 2na2co3 3h2 na2co3 decomposes at high temperature of pyrolysis as 10 na2co3 na2o co2 the interaction between alkali compounds and carbon along with the presence of h2 and co2 is responsible for the development of extensive porosity within the activated biochar structure 18 both sbet and pore volume of abc experienced a decrease revealing that fe and cu occupied some areas on the surface and porous structure of abc with loading fe and cu onto the surface of abc as displayed in the inset panels of fig 4 the pore size distribution curves calculated from desorption branches clearly confirm the narrow pore size distribution of samples the activation process decreased the average pore diameter of biochar from 5 62 to 3 79 nm comparing with the activated biochar sample the catalyst sample possessed a bulkier average pore diameter 4 83 nm which was contributed to the deposition of metal oxides onto the surface and inner surface of the catalyst pore sizes below 2 nm were only observed in the activated biochar sample indicating a combination of micro and mesoporous structure for abc in the case of bc the microporous structure was not developed and the introduction of iron and copper oxide onto the surface of abc blocked the micro pores of the fecu 2 abc sample since the molecular size of cip was less than the average pore diameter of the composite sample the porous structure of the catalyst had enough space to host cip molecules during the photo electro fenton reaction 3 2 effects of operational factors on degradation process 3 2 1 effect of cu fe mass ratio it is well documented that the addition of cu as a co catalyst could widely improve the catalytic properties of fenton based processes 45 46 the previous reports emphasized that the oxidative ability of the bimetallic catalyst is highly dependent on its chemical composition to see the impact of this parameter experiments were accomplished to investigate the synergistic effect of bimetals as various mass ratios of cu fe as depicted in fig 5 monometallic catalysts of fe abc and cu abc were able to remove 89 8 and 75 4 of cip within 120 min of pef reaction indicating the dominance of fe as the main catalyst of the reaction with the cu fe mass ratio changing from 0 1 to 1 1 the efficiency of cip removal was improved from 89 8 98 9 reflecting the successful synergistic effect of fe and cu in the pef degradation of cip the adsorption of as generated h2o2 onto the well developed surface of the mesoporous bimetallic catalyst facilitated the reduction of fe3 to fe2 and cu2 to cu through fenton and fenton like reactions respectively the reduced forms of the metals are instantly oxidized in the reaction medium to accomplish the cycle of fe3 fe2 and cu2 cu redox pairs eqs 11 14 meanwhile the reaction between fe3 and cu results in the generation of fe2 through eq 15 thereby accelerating the production of oh 20 in other words the co existence of fe and cu on the surface of activated biochar accelerates the process of electron transfer in the reaction environment providing an appropriate condition for the generation of hydrogen peroxide and reactive radical species 11 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ho2 h 12 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 13 cu2 h2o2 cu ho2 h 14 cu h2o2 cu2 oh oh 15 fe3 cu cu2 fe2 further ramping up or stepping up of cu fe mass ratio from 1 1 to 2 1 reduced the final removal efficiency of cip more than 5 this decline in catalyst performance was observed by other researchers and can be explained by the unstable nature of cu activating agents which are easily scavenged at higher concentrations 26 45 47 nonetheless all bimetallic catalysts achieved better cip removal efficiencies than monometallic catalysts the concentration decays are also analyzed by means of kinetic equations in all cases a linear relationship between ln ccip t ccip 0 and electrolysis time min was found considering a pseudo first order reaction for cip removal as presented in the inset panels of fig 5 as depicted in table 3 the reaction rate constant of fecu 2 abc was 0 03686 min 1 which is higher than that of other composites under the same operational conditions since the best catalytic performance for the pef process was obtained for the catalyst with cu fe mass ratio of 1 1 fecu 2 abc was selected as the catalyst to investigate the effect of other parameters for subsequent experiments 3 2 2 effect of initial ph to assess the effect of initial ph value as one of the major influencing factors in the fenton based processes the degradation efficiency of cip was measured under different initial ph levels 2 9 it was found that cip removal efficiency increased by increasing the initial ph from 2 0 3 0 while it was decreased when ph rose from 3 0 9 0 the same pattern was obtained for the reaction rate constant of cip removal efficiency as depicted in the insert panel of fig 6 and table 3 unlike homogeneous fenton reaction the performance of fecu 2 abc was not highly dependent on ph values in fact while using the bimetallic heterogeneous catalyst cip removal efficiency was located between 85 1 and 100 over a wide ph range of 3 7 within 120 min of reaction the reaction medium at ph of 2 favors the generation of hydroxyoxidanium h3o2 preventing the effective production of hydroxyl radicals 48 as expected the best performance occurred at ph 3 which is the ideal acidic media in which the oxidative capacity of oh radicals is at its highest point besides the detachment and ionization of catalyst particles from the surface of catalyst at a highly acidic environment lead to the prevalence of homogeneous fenton and fenton like reactions over their heterogeneous parallels this situation is unfavorable as it can jeopardize the reusability of the catalyst and enhance the risk of iron precipitation during the neutralization process on the other hand the comparative productivity of the fecu abc based heterogeneous system at ph 5 8 is ascribed to the marginal precipitation of catalyst and contributory effect of cu the precipitation of iron with increasing alkalinity is the major performance deteriorating feature of the traditional homogeneous ef process the application of heterogeneous catalysts minimizes iron precipitation by concentrating the reaction on the surface of the catalyst rather than the bulk of the solution this can be explained by the deprotonation of strong acidic sites in the structure of the catalyst which results in the formation of acidic microenvironments near the surface of catalyst particles 20 49 moreover according to the literature the introduced cu metals exhibit superior catalytic activity at ph values higher than 4 5 boosting the synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts at natural ph 50 these two effects can compensate for the lower production and oxidation activity of oh species at higher ph values 25 since working at near neutral ph appears to carry less risk of metal leakage and sludge production during the process the experiments were done at the neutral ph value of cip solution without any adjustment 3 2 3 effect of catalyst dosage catalyst dosage plays an important role in the efficiency of the pef process since it determines the availability of active catalyst sites and controls the production of oh radicals fig 7 indicates the impact of catalyst dosage on the cip removal efficiency by the pef process there is a positive correlation between catalyst dosage and removal efficiency fig 7 clearly shows that the photo electro degradation of cip initially increased as the fecu 2 abc dosage in fact it was increased from 0 5 g l to 1 g l and then decreased when the catalyst amount was beyond1 g l the results of the kinetic analysis exhibited the same trend as the reaction rate constant it was initially increased from 0 01392 min 1 to 0 03686 min 1 and then declined to 0 02811 min 1 for catalyst dosage of 1 25 g l it clearly indicates that increasing the catalyst dosage provides more accessible active sites on the surface of the catalyst to generate oxidative radical species accelerating the degradation reaction furthermore the excessive presence of the catalyst in the reaction medium increases the chance of oh scavenging reactions initiated by catalyst sits eqs 16 17 51 52 16 fe2 oh fe3 oh 17 cu oh cu2 oh the highest removal efficiency was observed at a catalyst concentration of 1 g l 98 95 as a result this dosage was fixed as the optimum level and used in all subsequent experiments 3 2 4 effect of electrical current in the ef based processes electrical current supplies the needed power to drive the electrochemical generation of h2o2 the effect of applied electrical current was investigated by varying the electrical current from 50 ma to 600 ma as shown in fig 8 it can be seen that at its lower values the electrical current can largely affect the degradation of cip while it was not successful to appreciably improve the productivity of the heterogeneous pef process at higher electrical current values there was a clear improvement in the removal efficiency of cip from 85 2 100 when the applied electrical current increased from50 ma to 400 ma after 120 min of reaction fig 8 a likewise the reaction rate constant was increased from 0 01624 min 1 to 0 06359 min 1 when the electrical current increased from 50 ma to 400 ma table 3 accordingly the final toc removal after 8 h of reaction obviously increased from 56 2 93 1 when the applied electrical current varied between the aforementioned values fig 8 b this can be explained by the fact that the initial enhancement in the electrical current increases the number of electrons in the aqueous medium promoting the electro generation of h2o2 and hydroxyl radical nevertheless a further increase in the quantity of electrical current is destructive since it launches a series of parasitic reactions through the unnecessary production of h2o2 a high concentration of electro generated h2o2 has scavenging effects on oh radicals eqs 18 19 and favors the formation of hydroperoxyl radical ooh with lower oxidation capability than hydroxyl radicals 31 the reduction of h2o2at the surface of the cathode eq 20 and four electron reduction eq 21 reactions are other negative side reactions preventing the ideal performance of the pef system 53 the obtained results for the accumulation of oh radicals are in agreement with this theory as depicted in fig s3 when the electrical current was increased from 50 ma to 400 ma the final concentration of accumulated oh radicals was increased from 38 13 μm to 50 05 μm nonetheless the dominance of scavenging reactions at higher currents negatively affected the generation of oh radicals 18 h2o2 oh ooh h2o 19 oh ooh h2o o2 20 h2o2 2h 2e h2o 21 o2 4h 4e 2h2o the observed decline in the reaction rate constant for the electrical current of 600 ma table 3 confirms the aforementioned facts it is also worth mentioning that during the first 4 h of the reaction the toc removal efficiency possessed a fast ascending profile although insignificant changes have been observed for further extending in reaction time the possible explanation for this pattern may be attributed to the recalcitrant nature of organic intermediates produced during the mineralization of cip 7 the transitions of mce values calculated from eq 7 are depicted in fig 8 c during the early stages of the experiments mce displayed a relatively sharp increase before reaching its optimum value intimating high speed mineralization of intermediates by the action of the applied bimetallic heterogeneous catalyst contrarily the gradual progressive drop of mce at extended electrolysis time is connected with the production of short chain organic intermediates with hardly destroyable structures the observed drop in the mce with the increase of electrical current is due to the acceleration of the above mentioned parasitic reactions consuming the electro generated hydroxyl radicals as specified by the obtained results the electrical current of 400 ma was the most effective current intensity for the present heterogeneous pef system with a maximum removal efficiency of 100 and mineralization of 93 1 for 30 mg l of cip 3 2 5 effect of the cip initial concentration the effect of pollutant concentration on the pef process for cip degradation was studied by varying the cip dosage from 15 mg l to 60 mg l as shown in fig 9 there is an inverse correlation between the removal efficiency of the pef reaction and the initial concentration of the pollutant the final cip removal efficiency of the reaction was gradually decreased from 100 to 90 0 with increasing the cip concentration from 15 to 60 mg l according to these results the reaction rate constant was decreased from 0 07329 min 1 to 0 01955 min 1 when the cip initial concentration increased from 15 mg l to 60 mg l in fact an adequate number of oh radicals are available to degrade cip and produce the intermediates at low cip concentrations on the other side the shortage of oxidizing agents prevents the complete elimination of the target pollutant when an excessive amount of cip molecules is available moreover congestion of pollutant in the reaction medium heightens the risk of catalyst deactivation by blocking the active sites 54 nonetheless the bimetallic heterogeneous catalyst synthesized in this research demonstrated high performance by removing to 45 mg l of cip after 2 h of reaction under natural ph 3 3 comparative assessment of cip removal and mineralization efficiencies to precisely monitor the potential of different treatment technologies in the mass reduction of the toxic organic pollutants a sequence of comparison study was conducted by treating 500 ml of 45 mg l cip solution in 50 mm na2so4 by heterogeneous pef process as well as by heterogeneous ef process homogeneous ef process using 0 2 mm feso4 7h2o and anodic oxidation at the electrical current of 400 ma up to 480 min 1 g l of fecu 2 abc catalyst was added to the reaction medium for heterogeneous reactions as observed in figs 10 a b the adsorption process exhibited the lowest efficiency by eliminating 8 5 of cip and 10 of toc within 120 min and 480 min of reaction time respectively furthermore very slow removal and mineralization rates were found through the electro generation of oh by water oxidation reaction onto the surface of pt anode during the anodic oxidation process and in the absence of any form of catalyst 22 pt h2o pt oh h e 15 8 of cip and 18 1 of toc were removed after 120 min and 480 min of the anodic oxidation reaction this conveys that the number of physisorbed pt oh radicals originated from eq 22 at the surface of the anode in fact they were not adequate to treat antibiotic pollution within a reasonable amount of time conversely fig 10 b also represented a very fast and complete cip mineralization by homogeneous pef process at ph of 3 the optimum acidity of homogeneous ef process and heterogeneous pef processes at ph of 5 8 similarly these two processes possessed almost equivalent toc removal after 480 min of reaction the remarkable performance of the heterogeneous ef process at near neutral ph is connected with the synergistic effect of fe and cu and well dispersion of active sites onto the surface of porous activated biochar which enhanced oxidative destruction of organic pollutants in fact cu2 ions are more reactive towards oh radicals than fe3 during the oxidation process of carboxylate intermediates 55 the maximum removal of homogeneous pef dropped up to 75 1 and 72 1 for cip and toc when ph increased from 3 to 5 8 these results indicate that against the heterogeneous pef process the soluble form of the catalyst is not able to maintain its efficacy over a wide range of ph moreover the final cip and toc removal respectively dropped by 90 and 87 2 for heterogeneous ef process compared with the pef process so this indicates the significant role of uv radiation in the degradation process aside from promoting the continuous regeneration of fe2 and hydroxyl radicals uv photons can accelerate the mineralization process through the photo decarboxylation of fe3 carboxylate intermediates eq 23 56 23 fe oocr 2 hυ fe2 co2 r table 4 shows a comparison between the synthesized bimetallic catalyst potential prepared in this research with the literature according to this table the developed fecu abc catalyst has competitive oxidative activity towards cip over a wider range of ph this outstanding performance is related to the excellent distribution of a large number of active sites onto the surface of activated biochar and synergistic effects between iron and copper as fenton and fenton like catalysts to investigate the viability of pef process based on fecu abc heterogeneous catalyst from a practical point of view the removal efficiency of 45 mg l of cip dissolved in tap water river water obtained from karaj river alborz province iran and a real sample of pharmaceutical wastewater obtained from osvah pharmaceutical company tehran iran was studied the characteristics of this wastewater are reported in table s1 as shown in fig 10 c the cip removal data for 120 min were at 100 99 8 and 91 74 for tap water river water and pharmaceutical wastewater respectively furthermore the lower efficiency of the pef process for removing cip from the wastewater matrix is related to the high concentration of dissolved organic matter which can filter the active light and compete with cip molecules over oh radicals through the non selective oxidation process in general the bimetallic activated biochar composite demonstrated a remarkable catalytic performance to efficiently remove cip at nearly circum neutral ph 3 4 recyclability of the catalyst the stability of the synthesized composite was monitored over 5 consecutive cycles to investigate the stability of the catalyst experiments were conducted at ph 3 since acidic condition increases the chance of fe and cu detachment and ionization from the surface of the catalyst 20 after each operation cycle the solid catalyst was removed from the reactor washed with distilled water and dried under n2 to inhibit additional oxidation in the air as shown in fig 10 d the final cip removal data at the end of each run were at 100 95 12 93 76 91 55 and 90 1 respectively the degradation efficiency of cip still was more than 90 after five consecutive runs confirming the adequate stability and reusability of composite over the cip degradation besides the noticed reduction in oxidative activity may be due to the metallic active site leakage and the active site blockage due to the accumulation of the intermediate adsorbed onto the surface of catalyst 57 the concentrations of leached fe and cu ions were analyzed using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy perkin elmer analyst 400 the highest amounts of fe and cu ions were at 0 07 and 0 05 mg l respectively less than 0 15 catalyst leaching in the first cycle and then declined to lower than 0 05 mg l for the subsequent experiments 3 5 intermediates and mineralization pathways of cip to better understand the degradation process of cip lcms was conducted to identify the produced intermediates through the heterogeneous pef process complication and multistage degradation process of cip encompassed the formation and subsequent destruction of intermediates several reactive sites existence on the cip molecules and the simultaneous action of various oxidizing agents in the reaction environment may be proposed as degradation paths of the intermediates fig 11 shows 10 intermediates identification produced during the possible mechanisms the details of detected intermediates were presented in table s2 analysis of lcms fragmentations and comparing with previous literature corroborated the chemical structure of these components through path 1 the piperazine ring of cip was ruptured through oh attack intermediates a with double aldehyde group production further oxidation of compound a by electron holes and hydroxyl radicals resulted in the formation of intermediates b with mono aldehyde moiety the loss of the second aldehyde group on the open piperazine ring converted intermediate b into compound c 58 the intermediate d was generated through the separation of one ethylamine group from intermediate c with a fully opened piperazine ring 59 component e was appeared by subsequent defluorination of d path 2 was started by the generation of f through direct hydroxylation of the aromatic ring of cip 52 intermediate f can undergo further addition of oh group or decarboxylation to process g and h respectively 60 intermediate i was the product of the oh f substitution process of g this path proceeded through the oxidation of i to j after carboxylic release from quinolone moiety pathway 3 was initiated through the substitution of f group by hydroxyl group to produce k in the next step the oxidation of the piperazine ring by oh radicals resulted in the formation of l 61 furthermore the compounds d and g were not detected by lcms analysis due to having a short lifetime and impulsive degradation 59 60 short chain carboxylic acids such as oxalic oxamic and formic acids and then co2 h2o nh4 f and no3 are final products of mineralization processes 4 conclusions in this study a catalyst based on cu and fe bimetallic oxide particles was successfully synthesized the low cost and eco friendly naoh activated biochar obtained from agricultural waste provided a well structured porous matrix for hosting the catalyst particles the materials were characterized by sem edx bet xrd xps and ftir analyses then the bimetallic composite was efficiently applied as a heterogeneous catalyst for the decomposition of ciprofloxacin antibiotic by the pef process the recent composite displayed as excellent ph insensitive catalyst by removing 45 mg l cip without any ph control within 2 h of reaction experimental results confirmed that the heterogeneous catalyst at natural ph showed competitive mineralization with the conventional homogeneous pef process at the acidic condition the intermediates byproducts of cip were determined and a plausible degradation mechanism was proposed moreover low metal leaching verified the structural stability of the synthesized catalyst by justifying its economical and practical applications furthermore the successful elimination of cip from tap water river water and a real sample of pharmaceutical wastewater confirmed the superb performance of the catalyst declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this
