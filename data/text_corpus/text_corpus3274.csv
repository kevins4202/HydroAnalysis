16370,groundwater is one of our most important resources however groundwater ecosystems are among the most understudied habitats of the planet earth studies on groundwater organisms are hampered by the difficult accessibility of species the lack of morphological differentiation and the limitation for laboratory cultures one important approach to overcome these shortcomings is to provide sensitive genetic methods to unravel patterns of biodiversity population structure and gene flow in natural populations in this study we present five sets of microsatellite markers developed for the isopods asellus aquaticus and proasellus slavus the cyclopoides paracyclops fimbriatus and acanthocyclops sensitivus and the harpacticoide bryocamptus echinatus crustacea two of these species were subjected to detailed population genetic analyses we studied 501 specimens of asellus aquaticus from four different regions in northern germany using nine microsatellite markers and 70 specimens of bryocamptus echinatus using nine microsatellite markers from three different sampling sites in south western germany our results show that genetic diversity is high a aquaticus 10 to 20 and b echinatus 4 to 18 alleles per locus among populations of aquatic invertebrates populations are highly differentiated fst 0 2 and genetic differentiation was associated with geographic patterns

microsatellite markers microsatellite markers were tested using 38 to 501 individuals and three to 23 populations of the five target species table 1 all microsatellite markers developed by ecogenics were used except for aa10 pf03 pf05 br07and br08 because of technical inconsistencies and ac03 ac04 due to overlapping fragment sizes for each species we found polymorphic loci ranging from 6 8 to 19 7 alleles per locus table 1 intraspecific variation in the number of alleles ranged in a aquaticus from ten to 20 and in b echinatus from four to 18 alleles per locus table 2 rarefaction analysis revealed that five loci were sufficient to identify 95 of all genotypes in a aquaticus and b echinatus fig 1 d e all populations showed lower observed ho than expected levels of heterozygosity he and less than 50 of all loci exhibited significant deviations from hardy weinberg equilibrium table 3 3 2 genetic differentiation of populations and gene flow two of the five target species have been subjected to a population genetic analysis covering 23 a aquaticus populations in four regions five populations from falkensee four from kiel four from eiderstedt and ten from grevesmühlen and three populations of b echinatus fig 1a table 3 in general both species showed a significant and very large divergence among populations a aquaticus fst 0 20 and b echinatus fst 0 27 largest variation was found within populations 80 in a aquaticus and 91 in b echinatus amova in a majority of populations 74 and 100 a aquaticus and b echinatus respectively one to eight private alleles were found with a higher average for b echinatus 7 than a aquaticus 2 4 see table 3 the strong population differentiation is also visible in the dapc analysis showing a number of populations without any overlap and roughly reflecting geographic location of populations fig 1f g for example populations of a aquaticus in the regions falkensee and eiderstedt form separated genetic clusters in contrast populations of the regions grevesmühlen and kiel largely overlap whereas both regions are largely differentiated from populations of the region eiderstedt and falkensee fig 1f similar patterns of genetic differentiation are also found on lower geographic scales meters among three closely located spring populations of b echinatus the hydrogeological information of b echinatus populations suggests that springs eus19 and eus20 are fed by the same aquifer but spring eus18 by a different aquifer however we cannot rule out a potential contact between both aquifers populations eus19 and eus20 show a low but detectable level of genetic differentiation despite low geographical differentiation 30 m population eus18 exhibits a higher level of differentiation with either eus19 or eus20 and a higher geographic distance 150 m fig 1g large genetic variation of a aquaticus and b echinatus populations allowed successful assignment of individuals to source populations using three different assignment approaches see methods section the amount and the direction of gene flow among populations were estimated if at least two of the three assignment tests revealed identical results fig 1b c table 4 a and b for example all the individuals of population eid3 n 28 were assigned to their source population whereas 14 3 of the individuals of population eid9 were assigned to population eid6 indicating recent gene flow among these populations a lower level of gene flow was detected among other populations eid6 eid8 and eid9 fig 1b a similar differential pattern of gene flow was found in all other regions falkensee kiel and grevesmühlen data not presented as well as among populations of b echinatus table 4b fig 1c 4 discussion recent studies on gene flow population differentiation and phylogeography of subterranean invertebrates are just scratching the surface of subterranean species diversity e g matthews et al 2020 only a few marker systems have been developed and applied to groundwater species in order to access intraspecific variation cryptic diversity and population size estimates asmyhr et al 2014a asmyhr et al 2014b capderrey et al 2013 meleg et al 2013 niemiller et al 2017 our study aims to fill this gap of knowledge in several ways first we provide a microsatellite tool kit for five different aquatic invertebrate species including two groundwater species secondly we evaluate for a aquaticus and b echinatus these marker sets for population structure analyses even among neighboring populations and thirdly we address their potential applications in groundwater management microsatellite marker sets for five aquatic invertebrate species were based on 8 11 variable loci allele number varied largely between species some species showed 5 11 alleles p slavus whereas other species showed higher values 11 45 p fimbriatus and a higher difference among loci table 1 similar levels of variation are found in other groundwater species e g proasellus walteri 5 30 capderrey et al 2013 and chydaekata sp 2 18 finston et al 2009 rejecting the view that subterranean organisms are characterized by low genetic diversity balázs et al 2020 guzik et al 2021 malard et al 2017 most studies on population genetic patterns of subterranean invertebrates focused on large geographic scales 10 to 1000 km whereas local differentiation was rarely addressed asmyhr et al 2014a meleg et al 2013 murphy et al 2010 trontelj et al 2009 we identified significant genetic differentiation among 23 a aquaticus populations fst 0 2 even across small geographic distances among b echinatus populations several meters in addition heterozygosity deficiencies and deviations from hwe suggest limitations to gene flow these results raise the question if the previously reported strong genetic differentiation across large geographic distances may reflect a general pattern originating from large differentiation across small scales trontelj et al 2009 whether these strong population differentiation among subterranean invertebrates is caused by dispersal limitation e g hydrological patterns isolation by environment reduction of gene flow among ecologically divergent habitats due to local adaptation or isolation by colonization e g founder events monopolization remains open for future research de meester et al 2002 orsini et al 2013 in comparison aquatic organisms of rivers lakes and wetlands are subjected to a number of dispersal mechanisms even across large geographical distances which are entirely lacking in groundwater systems for example dispersal via migrating waterfowl or human made structures such as artificial waterways surface traffic etc de meester et al 2002 green and figuerola 2005 waterkeyn et al 2010 thus aquatic populations of surface waters seem to exhibit except for high mountain or desert ponds lower levels of genetic differentiation than subterranean populations however due to the low number of studies on groundwater species a final evaluation requires a more balanced data set due to the high level of genetic differentiation among groundwater species cook and herczeg 2000 and this study but the low or difficult to detect level of morphological differentiation karanovic et al 2016 future development of markers need to be based on solid species delineations and the consideration of cryptic species bradford et al 2010 eme et al 2018 pfenninger and schwenk 2007 our studies using mtdna barcoding in combination with dna microsatellites detected several cases of cryptic groundwater species schwenk unpublished data which indicates that groundwater species might be characterized by limited geographic distribution and higher genetic differentiation as other aquatic species of rivers and lakes the level of genetic variation within species however was in all five species a aquaticus p slavus p fimbriatus a sensitivus and b echinatus sufficiently high table 3 suggesting no signs of local isolation or genetic drift although groundwater species seem to share rather strong patterns of community e g matthews et al 2020 and population structure balázs et al 2020 and this study our population genetic analyses document a sufficiently high level of gene flow at least among neighboring populations thus we were able to reveal the potential direction and amount of gene flow among populations this information was used to reconstruct the main dispersal events in natural systems e g aquifers or in man made water supply networks fig 1b c both examples as well as additional studies on p slavus and a sensitivus van den berg stein unpublished results revealed that dispersal patterns matched very well with hydrogeological patterns thus genetic tracers represent a powerful tool to unravel natural or human made unknown underground pathways current and future applications of these techniques have the potential to provide a significant contribution to biomonitoring detection of unknown water pathways surface water leakage and to assess the impact of human mediated stressors chemicals temperature and land use on ground and drinking water quality in light of current concern about the fate of subterranean ecosystems mammola et al 2019 investigating biodiversity pattern and local genetic differentiation of groundwater species is essential central questions are what factors determine subterranean dispersal and biodiversity which environmental crisis of the new millennium such as pollution stochastic climate and water level changes habitat loss etc alters dispersal patterns which methodological tool set is required to monitor groundwater communities and to predict changes in ecosystem function and loss of ecosystem services di lorenzo et al 2019 mammola et al 2020 sacco 2020 using molecular ecological approaches such as microsatellite and mtdna analyses of groundwater invertebrates to trace gene flow and to unravel hydrological connections in natural and drinking water extraction systems provides a powerful tool to address the questions raised above for example palandačić et al 2012a 2012b applied this approach using a fish species i e delminichtys adpersus cyprinidae as a biological tracer we developed a similar approach however using several invertebrates based on dna microsatellite analysis named stygotracing which allows to reveal the flow of water without causing unintended side effects using classical approaches such as the application of radioactive isotopes or fluorescent dyes van den berg stein et al 2019 although some methods using stable water isotopes négrel et al 2011 electric conductivity white 1994 or temperature james et al 2000 as tracers are equally harmless to the environment as stygotracing biological tracers provide a number of advantages firstly organisms not only reveal the level of gene flow among populations but they also provide additional information about the environment given information on ecological niches are available secondly genetic markers allow to estimate several important parameters to evaluate e g the number of migrants per generation the effective population sizes and a differentiation between ancient or recent migration events thirdly more advanced techniques using genome sequencing or transcriptomics facilitate identification of functional genes responsible for local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental challenges these and other molecular genetic approaches are bound to significantly improve our understanding of natural and man made groundwater systems 5 conclusion development and application of high resolution genetic microsatellite markers for five different aquatic invertebrate species provide a powerful tool to assess population structure and gene flow in largely unexplored habitats all species are highly variable and genetic markers enabled genetic identification of individuals the application of our marker systems to several a aquaticus and b echinatus populations revealed significant genetic differentiation among populations and regions fst 0 2 however neighboring populations share low levels of gene flow less than three migrants per generation in addition this study shows as demonstrated in the case of b echinatus how powerful genetic detection methods unravel hidden natural or human build groundwater structures and patterns

microsatellite markers microsatellite markers were tested using 38 to 501 individuals and three to 23 populations of the five target species table 1 all microsatellite markers developed by ecogenics were used except for aa10 pf03 pf05 br07and br08 because of technical inconsistencies and ac03 ac04 due to overlapping fragment sizes for each species we found polymorphic loci ranging from 6 8 to 19 7 alleles per locus table 1 intraspecific variation in the number of alleles ranged in a aquaticus from ten to 20 and in b echinatus from four to 18 alleles per locus table 2 rarefaction analysis revealed that five loci were sufficient to identify 95 of all genotypes in a aquaticus and b echinatus fig 1 d e all populations showed lower observed ho than expected levels of heterozygosity he and less than 50 of all loci exhibited significant deviations from hardy weinberg equilibrium table 3 3 2 genetic differentiation of populations and gene flow two of the five target species have been subjected to a population genetic analysis covering 23 a aquaticus populations in four regions five populations from falkensee four from kiel four from eiderstedt and ten from grevesmühlen and three populations of b echinatus fig 1a table 3 in general both species showed a significant and very large divergence among populations a aquaticus fst 0 20 and b echinatus fst 0 27 largest variation was found within populations 80 in a aquaticus and 91 in b echinatus amova in a majority of populations 74 and 100 a aquaticus and b echinatus respectively one to eight private alleles were found with a higher average for b echinatus 7 than a aquaticus 2 4 see table 3 the strong population differentiation is also visible in the dapc analysis showing a number of populations without any overlap and roughly reflecting geographic location of populations fig 1f g for example populations of a aquaticus in the regions falkensee and eiderstedt form separated genetic clusters in contrast populations of the regions grevesmühlen and kiel largely overlap whereas both regions are largely differentiated from populations of the region eiderstedt and falkensee fig 1f similar patterns of genetic differentiation are also found on lower geographic scales meters among three closely located spring populations of b echinatus the hydrogeological information of b echinatus populations suggests that springs eus19 and eus20 are fed by the same aquifer but spring eus18 by a different aquifer however we cannot rule out a potential contact between both aquifers populations eus19 and eus20 show a low but detectable level of genetic differentiation despite low geographical differentiation 30 m population eus18 exhibits a higher level of differentiation with either eus19 or eus20 and a higher geographic distance 150 m fig 1g large genetic variation of a aquaticus and b echinatus populations allowed successful assignment of individuals to source populations using three different assignment approaches see methods section the amount and the direction of gene flow among populations were estimated if at least two of the three assignment tests revealed identical results fig 1b c table 4 a and b for example all the individuals of population eid3 n 28 were assigned to their source population whereas 14 3 of the individuals of population eid9 were assigned to population eid6 indicating recent gene flow among these populations a lower level of gene flow was detected among other populations eid6 eid8 and eid9 fig 1b a similar differential pattern of gene flow was found in all other regions falkensee kiel and grevesmühlen data not presented as well as among populations of b echinatus table 4b fig 1c 4 discussion recent studies on gene flow population differentiation and phylogeography of subterranean invertebrates are just scratching the surface of subterranean species diversity e g matthews et al 2020 only a few marker systems have been developed and applied to groundwater species in order to access intraspecific variation cryptic diversity and population size estimates asmyhr et al 2014a asmyhr et al 2014b capderrey et al 2013 meleg et al 2013 niemiller et al 2017 our study aims to fill this gap of knowledge in several ways first we provide a microsatellite tool kit for five different aquatic invertebrate species including two groundwater species secondly we evaluate for a aquaticus and b echinatus these marker sets for population structure analyses even among neighboring populations and thirdly we address their potential applications in groundwater management microsatellite marker sets for five aquatic invertebrate species were based on 8 11 variable loci allele number varied largely between species some species showed 5 11 alleles p slavus whereas other species showed higher values 11 45 p fimbriatus and a higher difference among loci table 1 similar levels of variation are found in other groundwater species e g proasellus walteri 5 30 capderrey et al 2013 and chydaekata sp 2 18 finston et al 2009 rejecting the view that subterranean organisms are characterized by low genetic diversity balázs et al 2020 guzik et al 2021 malard et al 2017 most studies on population genetic patterns of subterranean invertebrates focused on large geographic scales 10 to 1000 km whereas local differentiation was rarely addressed asmyhr et al 2014a meleg et al 2013 murphy et al 2010 trontelj et al 2009 we identified significant genetic differentiation among 23 a aquaticus populations fst 0 2 even across small geographic distances among b echinatus populations several meters in addition heterozygosity deficiencies and deviations from hwe suggest limitations to gene flow these results raise the question if the previously reported strong genetic differentiation across large geographic distances may reflect a general pattern originating from large differentiation across small scales trontelj et al 2009 whether these strong population differentiation among subterranean invertebrates is caused by dispersal limitation e g hydrological patterns isolation by environment reduction of gene flow among ecologically divergent habitats due to local adaptation or isolation by colonization e g founder events monopolization remains open for future research de meester et al 2002 orsini et al 2013 in comparison aquatic organisms of rivers lakes and wetlands are subjected to a number of dispersal mechanisms even across large geographical distances which are entirely lacking in groundwater systems for example dispersal via migrating waterfowl or human made structures such as artificial waterways surface traffic etc de meester et al 2002 green and figuerola 2005 waterkeyn et al 2010 thus aquatic populations of surface waters seem to exhibit except for high mountain or desert ponds lower levels of genetic differentiation than subterranean populations however due to the low number of studies on groundwater species a final evaluation requires a more balanced data set due to the high level of genetic differentiation among groundwater species cook and herczeg 2000 and this study but the low or difficult to detect level of morphological differentiation karanovic et al 2016 future development of markers need to be based on solid species delineations and the consideration of cryptic species bradford et al 2010 eme et al 2018 pfenninger and schwenk 2007 our studies using mtdna barcoding in combination with dna microsatellites detected several cases of cryptic groundwater species schwenk unpublished data which indicates that groundwater species might be characterized by limited geographic distribution and higher genetic differentiation as other aquatic species of rivers and lakes the level of genetic variation within species however was in all five species a aquaticus p slavus p fimbriatus a sensitivus and b echinatus sufficiently high table 3 suggesting no signs of local isolation or genetic drift although groundwater species seem to share rather strong patterns of community e g matthews et al 2020 and population structure balázs et al 2020 and this study our population genetic analyses document a sufficiently high level of gene flow at least among neighboring populations thus we were able to reveal the potential direction and amount of gene flow among populations this information was used to reconstruct the main dispersal events in natural systems e g aquifers or in man made water supply networks fig 1b c both examples as well as additional studies on p slavus and a sensitivus van den berg stein unpublished results revealed that dispersal patterns matched very well with hydrogeological patterns thus genetic tracers represent a powerful tool to unravel natural or human made unknown underground pathways current and future applications of these techniques have the potential to provide a significant contribution to biomonitoring detection of unknown water pathways surface water leakage and to assess the impact of human mediated stressors chemicals temperature and land use on ground and drinking water quality in light of current concern about the fate of subterranean ecosystems mammola et al 2019 investigating biodiversity pattern and local genetic differentiation of groundwater species is essential central questions are what factors determine subterranean dispersal and biodiversity which environmental crisis of the new millennium such as pollution stochastic climate and water level changes habitat loss etc alters dispersal patterns which methodological tool set is required to monitor groundwater communities and to predict changes in ecosystem function and loss of ecosystem services di lorenzo et al 2019 mammola et al 2020 sacco 2020 using molecular ecological approaches such as microsatellite and mtdna analyses of groundwater invertebrates to trace gene flow and to unravel hydrological connections in natural and drinking water extraction systems provides a powerful tool to address the questions raised above for example palandačić et al 2012a 2012b applied this approach using a fish species i e delminichtys adpersus cyprinidae as a biological tracer we developed a similar approach however using several invertebrates based on dna microsatellite analysis named stygotracing which allows to reveal the flow of water without causing unintended side effects using classical approaches such as the application of radioactive isotopes or fluorescent dyes van den berg stein et al 2019 although some methods using stable water isotopes négrel et al 2011 electric conductivity white 1994 or temperature james et al 2000 as tracers are equally harmless to the environment as stygotracing biological tracers provide a number of advantages firstly organisms not only reveal the level of gene flow among populations but they also provide additional information about the environment given information on ecological niches are available secondly genetic markers allow to estimate several important parameters to evaluate e g the number of migrants per generation the effective population sizes and a differentiation between ancient or recent migration events thirdly more advanced techniques using genome sequencing or transcriptomics facilitate identification of functional genes responsible for local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental challenges these and other molecular genetic approaches are bound to significantly improve our understanding of natural and man made groundwater systems 5 conclusion development and application of high resolution genetic microsatellite markers for five different aquatic invertebrate species provide a powerful tool to assess population structure and gene flow in largely unexplored habitats all species are highly variable and genetic markers enabled genetic identification of individuals the application of our marker systems to several a aquaticus and b echinatus populations revealed significant genetic differentiation among populations and regions fst 0 2 however neighboring populations share low levels of gene flow less than three migrants per generation in addition this study shows as demonstrated in the case of b echinatus how powerful genetic detection methods unravel hidden natural or human build groundwater structures and patterns

16371,granule based partial denitrification pd is a technology that can supply stable nitrite for applying anaerobic ammonia oxidation in wastewater treatment and triclosan tcs is a frequently detected antibacterial agent in wastewater treatment plants therefore it is possible that tcs could enter into wastewater that is treated using pd technology however the active microorganisms responsible for pd and tcs removing in granule based pd system have not been clearly identified and it is currently not clear how tcs affects the pd process in this study the impacts of tcs on pd performance pd microbial community antibiotic resistance genes args active pd bacteria and tcs degrading bacteria in a granule based pd system were investigated 3 mg l tcs had adverse influence on pd process but pd system could recover gradually after inhibiting of 10 days after a period of domestication pd granular sludge could achieve 10 66 of tcs degradation efficiency and 43 62 of tcs adsorption efficiency microbes might increase their resistance to tcs by increasing the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances and the secretion of protein might play a more pivotal role than the secretion of polysaccharides in resisting tcs the short term shock of tcs might cause the propagation of acra 03 while the long term operation of tcs could propagate fabk and inti1 dna stable isotope probing assay indicated that thauera was active pd bacteria and tcs degrading bacteria in the granule based pd system and it could contribute to nitrite accumulation and tcs degradation simultaneously graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords partial denitrification triclosan antibiotic resistance genes dna stable isotope probing active partial denitrifying bacteria active triclosan degrading bacteria 1 introduction the anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox has been extensively identified as a novel autotrophic and cost effective biotechnology for wastewater treatment kartal et al 2010 it is necessary to acquire nitrite for applying anammox process through partial nitrification oxidizing ammonia to nitrite and partial denitrification pd reducing nitrate to nitrite nevertheless it is difficult to keep the steady nitrite accumulation in partial nitrification recent studies reported the accumulation of nitrite during denitrification cao et al 2013 du et al 2016 and cao et al 2013 found that pd process can achieve over 80 nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio ntr and keep long term stabilization there are many environmental factors which affect nitrite accumulation in pd process such as carbon to nitrogen ratio c n carbon sources type ph temperature nitrate concentration and sludge type cao et al 2013 to date many researchers concerned at pd of floc sludge cao et al 2013 and biofilm gao et al 2019 while a few researches focused on pd of granular sludge granular sludge a self immobilized microbial consortium containing different functional microorganisms is widely applied under anaerobic and aerobic condition liu and tay 2004 winkler et al 2018 pd process based on the granular sludge presented advantages over the conventional activated sludge such as higher sludge settling performance harboring microbial community better at degradation of toxic substances and more excretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps to defend toxicity due to its unique layered structure granular sludge might provide a beneficial environment for the growth of denitrifying bacteria that can transform nitrate to nitrite and the resistance to toxicity substances such as triclosan tcs previous studies indicated that some denitrifying bacteria can reduce nitrate to nitrite as the only product can be called as pd bacteria such as staphylococcus martienssen and schöps 1999 and rhodobacter lee et al 2002 which were also often found in granular sludge and the unique formation mode of granular sludge could cause the enrichment of these denitrifying bacteria therefore granular sludge was used to start pd process in this study there are four strains thauera sp dnt 1 thauera aminoaromaticaa thauera terpenicaa and thauera phenylaceticaa can be called as conditional pd bacteria with no transcription of nirs genes coding reduction of nitrite to nitrogen gas under the presence of nitrate which can reduce nitrate to nitrite when all nitrate was reduced these strains could further reduce nitrite to nitrogen gas liu et al 2013 however it was still unclear that the denitrifying bacteria in pd system could only transform nitrate to nitrite pd bacteria or reduce nitrate to nitrite under certain conditions conditional pd bacteria tcs as a broad spectrum antibacterial agent is widely used in personal care products moreover tcs not only can be found in cosmetics toothpastes and soaps but also widely detected in many environments such as sediments soil and surface water so it presents certain study significances halden and paull 2005 in addition tcs is considered to be related with the emergence and spread of several antibiotic resistance genes args which have potential risks to the environment and human health lu et al 2018 with the covid 19 outbreak the usage of tcs rises dramatically resulting in higher concentrations of tcs flowing into sewage systems lu et al 2021 therefore it is possible that tcs of mg l level could enter into wastewater that is treated using pd technology because tcs not only has potential environmental impacts but also has endocrine and developmental reproductive effects in human the removal of tcs has attracted rising attentions it has been reported that tcs can be biodegraded in various systems including sediments wastewater activated sludge and axenic cultures of microorganisms zhang et al 2020 indicated that the addition of tcs can decrease the abundance of nitrite oxidizing bacteria in a nitrifying sequencing batch reactor sbr and achieve partial nitrification however the impacts of tcs on pd microbial community structure and the fate of tcs in granule based pd system were still unclear meanwhile tcs degrading microorganisms involved in pd system were also unclear dna stable isotope probing dna sip could identify functional bacteria in mixed complex system and the core of dna sip is incorporating stable isotopes 15n or 13c into the bacterial dna by assimilating the labelled compound in substrate radajewski et al 2000 the labelled dna is isolated through isopycnic ultracentrifugation and then the bacteria harbored the 15n or 13c label are identified by using next generation sequencing cupples 2016 xing et al 2018 used dna sip to identify the active denitrifiers in a combined microelectrolysis and found that thermomonas like phylotypes are labelled by 13c bicarbonate while thauera like and comamonas like phylotypes are labelled by 13c acetate in addition some researchers applied dna sip to identify tcs degrading bacteria in the nitrifying sbr and lab scale anoxic oxic system and found that the genus amaricoccus and methylobacillus are the major tcs degraders respectively dai et al 2020 jia et al 2020 however the active bacteria involved in a granule based pd system of removing tcs were not clear the relationships between pd bacteria and tcs degrading bacteria were also unknown and it was unclear whether there were bacteria that could simultaneously achieve the pd process and remove tcs the purposes of this study were to achieve pd based on granular sludge explore the removal of tcs in granule based pd system and reveal the active microorganisms involved in pd process and tcs degrading process in addition the shifts of microorganisms and args during pd process and the impacts of tcs on pd performance pd microbial community structure and tcs related args in granule based pd system were also investigated this study combined dna sip and high throughput sequencing to identify the active pd bacteria and tcs degrading bacteria and the relationships among active pd bacteria tcs degrading bacteria and args were also investigated by network analysis this work might help to reveal the microorganism involved in both pd and tcs degradation and provide a theoretical direction for pd and tcs removal in wastewater biological treatment process based on granular sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 set up and operation of experiment a lab scale sbr with 3 l effective volume was operated to study the impacts of tcs on pd which has a volume exchange ratio of 60 the seeding aerobic granular sludge ags was obtained from a pilot scale ags sbr of gaobeidian wwtp beijing china li et al 2020b the synthetic nitrate wastewater including nano3 cacl2 2h2o mgso4 7h2o kh2po4 and trace element solution in a bucket and additional carbon source ch3ch2coona in another bucket were added into the sbr respectively granule based pd sbr was operated for eight cycles each day and each cycle 3 h included 6 min of synthetic wastewater feeding 1 min of carbon source adding 40 min of anoxic reaction 2 min of settling 3 min of decanting and 128 min of idle period granule based pd sbr was operated for 160 days with three stages in phase i 1 31 day influent nitrate and chemical oxygen demand cod concentration were 35 and 105 mg l respectively and the corresponding c n was 3 in phase ii 32 98 day influent nitrate and cod concentration were increased to 105 and 315 mg l respectively and the corresponding ntr was maintained at 72 24 in phase iii 99 160 3 mg l tcs was added to granule based pd sbr which was performed to explore the impacts of tcs on pd the details of analytical methods of cod nitrite nitrate mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss sludge volume index svi average diameter and eps including loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps and the calculation of total inorganic nitrogen tin ntr integrity coefficient and the mass balance of tcs were summarized in methods s1 in addition six sludge samples were gathered on day 0 30 90 100 120 and 160 for average diameter measure eps measure and dna extraction which named as seed d30 d90 d100 d120 and d160 respectively and the details of sampling dna extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr were also shown in methods s2 2 2 dna sip incubation isopycnic centrifugation and gradient fractionation after achieving an effective tcs degradation at the end of 3 mg l tcs dosing stage dna sip assay was applied to explore the active pd bacteria and tcs degrading bacteria in granule based pd sbr fig 1 collected granular sludge was washed three times with deionized water and transferred to conical flasks for dna sip incubation with 200 ml synthetic wastewater for identifying pd bacteria and 50 ml synthetic wastewater for identifying tcs degrading bacteria respectively the synthetic wastewater for pd and tcs degrading dna sip incubation were summarized at table s2 in addition 13c labelled propionate 13ch3 13ch2 13coona 99 purity and tcs all c labeled 99 purity were purchased from cambridge isotope laboratories cil usa which was used for pd and tcs degrading dna sip incubation respectively four treatments were fed with the following substrates a 12ch3 12ch2 12coona and nitrate control pd dna sip incubation b 13ch3 13ch2 13coona and nitrate 13c labelled pd dna sip incubation c 12c tcs and nitrate control tcs dna sip incubation d 13c tcs and nitrate 13c labelled tcs dna sip incubation equivalent 12ch3 12ch2 12coona and 13ch3 13ch2 13coona or 12c tcs and 13c tcs as the sole carbon source were added into microcosms of control or labelled treatments respectively the culture cycle was eight for pd dna sip incubation and one for tcs degrading dna sip incubation each incubation time was 4 h for pd dna sip incubation and 3 days for tcs degrading dna sip incubation in water bath shaker at 25 c when nitrate or tcs was degraded completely in the system one cycle of incubation ended after briefly settling and supernatant decanting the granular sludge samples were added into new synthetic wastewater to generate a new cycle of reaction respectively the time course incubation of pd dna sip incubation and tcs degrading dna sip incubation were applied in order to ensure that as little as possible cross feeding occurred and the experiment of labeling active functional bacteria with suitable and shorter incubation time was according to guo et al 2018 and lolas et al 2012 respectively all the treatments were set up in duplicate and granular sludge were collected and freeze dried after the end of culture then the freeze dried sludges were further conducted to dna extraction ultracentrifugation layering and purification the detailed steps were presented in methods s3 in addition control treatment only nitrate and tcs no propionate was set up to explore the label of 13c could perform denitrification process that used no3 n in order to evaluate the dna sip incubation of pd and further identify active denitrifying bacteria pd bacteria or conditioned pd bacteria each fraction after purifying was used to quantify the abundance of narg and nirs gene of 12c carbon and 13c carbon dna by qpcr and the reaction procedure was consistent with the qpcr in methods s2 2 3 high throughput sequencing and biological information analysis the heavy 12c and 13c dna samples 3 5 layered fractions cscl buoyant density ranged at 1 73 1 76 g l from isopycnic centrifugation were performed to sequence bacterial 16s rrna gene v3 v4 regions at allwegene technology co ltd beijing china using illumina miseq pe300 sequencer illumina usa in addition six sludge dna samples from granule based pd sbr were also sequenced and the original sequences of 10 dna samples including four sip dna samples and six sludge dna samples could be found in sequence read archive sra database with the number of prjna 664473 after sequencing chimera removal operational taxonomic units otus division and diversity calculation were analyzed by quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime1 pipeline caporaso et al 2011 in detail alpha diversity containing shannon chao1 observed species goods coverage and simpson index were calculated and beta diversity including principal coordinate analysis pcoa and cluster analysis ca were also generated based on weighted unifrac distance metrics in addition tbtools was used for venn analysis chen et al 2020 and linear discriminant analysis lda lda score of 2 0 alpha value of 0 05 effect size lefse was applied to clarify the distinct variants in specific bacteria between 0 mg l tcs and 3 mg l tcs stages the interactions among functional bacteria mobile genetic elements mges and args and the co occurrence modes among args were identified by spearman s rank correlation coefficients during no tcs and 3 mg l tcs processes after that cytoscape 3 8 2 was implemented to establish the network visualization to track the latent hosts of mges and args the significant variance between 0 mg l tcs and 3 mg l tcs stages were evaluated using one way analysis of variance anova in addition the computational details of relative enrichment from dna sip incubation were shown in methods s4 in brief enrichment of a specific taxonomic group was determined by dividing its relative copy numbers from a 13c density range by its relative copy numbers from the corresponding 12c density range the relative copy numbers and enrichment were calculated as follows relative copy numbers ra 16s rrna gene copies relative enrichment r 13c r 12c where ra is the relative abundance of taxon specific reads in the defined cscl density ranges 1 7365 1 7604 g l 16s rrna gene copies is the number of 16s rrna gene copies in the same cscl density ranges and r 13c and r 12c are the relative copy numbers of 13c and 12c samples respectively all taxa that showed a relative enrichment 100 in at least one treatment or time point were considered as 13c labeled 3 results and discussion 3 1 start up and performance of granule based pd sbr fig 2 depicts the variations of influent and effluent concentration of nitrate nitrite and tcs as illustrated in fig 2a and b the average tin removal efficiency and ntr in phase i were only 26 34 and 39 53 respectively while after increasing the influent cod and nitrate to 315 and 105 mg l respectively the effluent nitrite concentration achieved 83 01 mg l and the corresponding ntr increased to 72 24 at the end of phase ii the effluent content of nitrate rose to 64 15 mg l after the addition of 3 mg l tcs and the corresponding tin removal efficiency and ntr were 22 55 and 29 04 fig 2a and b respectively after 9 days of tcs addition the effluent nitrate gradually declined to 7 35 mg l and the corresponding ntr increased to 56 41 these results revealed that 3 mg l tcs could inhibit denitrification but it could recover gradually which was consistent with gao et al 2019 fig 2c depicts the n transformation results during entire operation period in phase i 11 97 of nitrate was transformed to nitrite and 41 51 of nitrate was transformed to nitrogen gas while 46 52 of nitrate was discharged into drainage in phase ii most of nitrate 64 74 was transformed to nitrite while only 32 21 and 3 05 of nitrate was transformed to nitrogen gas and discharged into drainage respectively in phase iii only 0 76 of nitrate was transformed to nitrite after adding 3 mg l tcs of 3 days while 13 97 and 85 27 of nitrate was converted to nitrogen gas and drawn off respectively and then the proportion of nitrate was transformed to nitrite nitrogen gas and drawn off changed to 43 51 37 03 and 19 47 after adaptation to tcs respectively these results indicated that long term addition of tcs could cause the transformation of pd process to complete denitrification process in the granule based pd sbr in summary the initial dosage of 3 mg l tcs could inhibit denitrification and decrease nitrite accumulation while granule based pd sbr could recover gradually after inhibiting of 10 days the influent and effluent tcs concentration of granule based pd sbr were further measured and the mass balance of tcs at the beginning and end of phase iii was conducted to expose the fate of tcs as shown in fig 2d the removal efficiency of tcs rose from 26 41 to 54 28 after the operation of 60 days furthermore tcs degradation efficiency and tcs adsorption efficiency increased from 1 82 and 24 59 to 10 66 and 43 62 respectively zhang et al 2020 studied the impacts of different tcs concentration on nitrifying sbr after 145 days of the activated sludge acclimating to tcs tcs removal efficiency gradually increases from 87 70 to 98 50 which was similar to this study it revealed that after a period of domestication the granular sludge in pd sbr could acclimate to 3 mg l tcs and the increase of tcs degradation efficiency caused the recovery of denitrification performance in pd sbr the reason for the increase of tcs degradation efficiency was further explained by eps and microbial dynamics 3 2 variations of eps in granule based pd sbr in order to explore the defense mechanism of pd sbrs against tcs and the response of granular sludge to tcs the variations of eps in all samples were investigated as shown in fig s1a and 1b the tb eps content was always greater than the lb eps content during the entire operational period both the lb eps and tb eps content decreased firstly and then increased after adding 3 mg l tcs and the lb eps and tb eps contents decreased from 93 61 and 114 08 to 31 87 and 80 85 mg g vss with the ntr increasing from 2 10 to 72 24 during the operation of 98 days in phase i and ii respectively it seemed that the decrease of eps during 0 mg l tcs was caused by the decrease of lb eps and it was also mainly influenced by ntr microbes may be inhibited by the toxic effect of free nitrous acid to some extent wu et al 2018 affecting their secretion of eps therefore with the ntr increasing both the pn and ps concentration decreased after adding 3 mg l tcs the lb eps and tb eps content rose from 31 87 and 80 85 to 80 22 and 240 81 mg g vss respectively the pn and ps concentration in tb eps rose from 68 69 and 12 16 to 191 35 and 49 46 mg g vss while in lb eps the pn and ps content slightly increased from 26 63 and 5 24 to 68 95 and 11 27 mg g vss respectively this result indicated that the increase of eps at 3 mg l tcs was mainly caused by the increase of tb eps 76 79 was caused by tb while only 23 21 was caused by lb and microorganisms may produce eps to resist tcs gao et al 2019 the inoculated ags have high eps content mcswain et al 2005 and once they came into anoxic environment from aerobic environment some aerobic bacteria might be inactivated which led to the death of eps related bacteria and then caused the decrease of eps concentration on day 30 after a period of acclimatization the growth of anoxic bacteria caused the eps content to remain stable after adding 3 mg l tcs denitrification in granule based pd system was immediately suppressed fig 2a and the corresponding tcs biodegradation was only 1 82 fig 2d and the concentration of eps did not increase immediately it seemed that the addition of tcs could not only inhibit denitrification but also inhibit eps secretion a pervious study found that high concentration of tcs can destroy cell membranes and interfere with pn and lipid synthesis middleton and salierno 2013 resulting in the decrease of eps secretion as the tcs biodegradation increased to 10 66 the concentration of eps increased gradually eps can protect cells from toxicity caused by intracellular uptake or direct adsorption on the cell surface birch and bachofen 1990 these results indicated that the increasing of ntr during pd process led to the decreasing of eps secretion of granular sludge while the addition of tcs could promote the eps secretion after a period of adaptation moreover the pn ps in lb eps and tb eps at 0 mg l tcs was lower than those at 3 mg l tcs demonstrating that pn was induced after the exposure of bacteria to tcs and pn was more easily secreted than ps in brief microbes might increase their resistance to tcs by increasing the secretion of eps and pn might play a more important role than ps in resisting tcs the relationships between eps contents and functional microorganism were further evaluated p 0 05 as shown in table s4 pn in tb eps was positively correlated with tcs degradation and tcs adsorption indicating tcs degradation efficiency increased with the increasing of eps content and the increased tcs degradation efficiency might improve denitrification performance of pd sbr 3 3 variations of denitrifying bacteria and tcs related args in granule based pd sbr to better evaluate the impacts of tcs on denitrifying bacteria total bacteria and denitrifying functional genes narg nirs and nosz were measured by qpcr for denitrification narg nirs and nosz encode genes for nitrate reductase no3 n no2 n nitrite reductase no2 n no and nitrous oxide reductase n2o n2 respectively as demonstrated in fig s2a there was no significant difference in 16s narg nirs and nosz genes between 0 mg l tcs and 3 mg l tcs concretely the absolute abundance of 16s rrna gene showed a rising trend p 0 039 based on one way anova increasing from 2 33 1012 to 4 32 1012 copies g sludge the average copy numbers of narg 3 16 1010 copies g sludge was lower than nirs and nosz 4 30 1011 and 5 05 1011 copies g sludge respectively during the entire process the absolute abundance of narg declined from 7 67 1010 to 7 37 109 copies g sludge after adding 3 mg l tcs p 0 012 based on one way anova a previous study found that 1 mg l tcs can inhibit narg in both floccular sludge and biofilm gao et al 2019 which was similar to this study in addition the absolute abundance of nirs and nosz gene decreased from 1 13 1012 and 1 36 1012 to 3 05 1011 and 3 52 1011 copies g sludge after adding 3 mg l tcs p 0 003 and 0 0003 based on one way anova and then increased to 7 19 1011 and 6 16 1011 copies g sludge p 0 007 and 0 024 based on one way anova respectively nirs and nosz gene were proved to transform nitrite and nitrous oxide to nitric oxide and nitrogen respectively therefore the variations of them explained the nitrite transformation rate in pd system first increased from 11 97 to 64 74 and then decreased to 43 51 fig 2c ht qpcr was further used to explore the transmission mechanism of tcs on antibiotic resistome in pd system and all the values of args and mges presented in fig 3 a were shown as log2 copies g dry sludge in present work 13 tcs related args with two mechanisms of multidrug efflux pump acra 02 acra 03 acrb 01 adea adej mexb and mexf and antibiotic target alteration fabi q fabi1 fabi2 fabk pafabi and pafabv and five mges with integrons inti1 and inti3 transposons tnpa 04 and tp614 and insertion sequences is613 were quantified as shown in fig s2c the variation of args showed a decreasing trend during the entire operation the abundance of args and mges during 3 mg l tcs were significantly lower than those at 0 mg l p 0 05 concretely the most abundant args in seed was mexf its abundance was 35 62 and it was only detected in seed fig 3a in addition the abundance of acra 03 and mexb increased from 0 to 25 46 and 30 01 with the ntr increasing from 2 10 to 72 24 respectively these results indicated that high ntr might cause the propagation of acra 03 and mexb and the potential reason was that free nitrous acid might influence several microbial hosts of args and promote the co selection for acra 03 and mexb conversely the variation trend of acrb 01 fabi1 fabi2 fabk and pafabi showed decreasing tendency during pd process after the addition of 3 mg l tcs most args decreased including adej mexb and pafabv it seemed that 3 mg l tcs might directly kill the host microorganisms that carried those args resulting in the reduction of those args in addition the abundance of acra 03 sharply increased from 25 46 to 26 53 after adding 3 mg l tcs and then decreased to 24 64 after a long period of tcs domestication while fabk was enriched at the end of 3 mg l tcs it indicated that the short term shocks of tcs might cause the propagation of acra 03 while the long term operation of tcs could propagate fabk it seemed that microorganisms in pd sbr could gain additional resistance by excreting antibiotics such as tcs at the initial dosing stage of tcs sun et al 2014 and then they could interfere with or limit antibiotic interaction to enhance resistance at the end of tcs adding stage poole 2002 tcs resistance mechanism of granule based pd system shifted from multidrug efflux pump initial stage to antibiotic target alteration final stage during the tcs loading period as shown in fig 3a inti1 inti3 is613 and tp614 increased with the ntr increasing indicating high ntr could propagate those mges aquimonas was enriched fig 4 in the high ntr phase therefore the enrichment of its possible potential hosts of some mges is613 or inti3 fig 6c might lead to the increase of is613 and inti3 in addition the co selection effect between acra 03 and tp614 could be observed in present system fig 3b which might be the reason of increase of tp614 after adding 3 mg l tcs inti1 first declined from 38 51 to 37 63 and then increased to 39 28 after a long period of tcs domestication but the abundance of inti3 is613 and tp614 sharply decreased from 34 38 32 01 and 28 54 to 30 77 28 74 and 27 59 respectively in summary most of args and megs could be attenuated after adding tcs while the short term shocks of tcs might cause the propagation of acra 03 and the long term operation of tcs could propagate fabk and inti1 mges could carry args and transfer them through hgt among different bacteria and the tcs resistance mechanism shifted from multidrug efflux pump initial stage to antibiotic target alteration final stage during 3 mg l tcs dosing stage the correlations among tcs denitrifying bacteria mges and args were further analyzed by network analysis and the results were shown in fig 3b the relationships of most phylotypes were negative tcs and denitrifying bacteria were negatively correlated with most of args and mges while tcs had positive correlation with 16s nosz and nirs genes which was similar to the results of qpcr fig s2 it was proved that the long term addition of tcs had no obvious inhibitory impacts on denitrification of this system but promoted the reaction from nitrite to nitrogen in addition acrb 01 and adej genes were positively correlated with fabi2 indicating that the co selection of two kinds of resistance mechanism on the same genetic elements potentially occurred in granule based pd system which would affect the persistence and proliferation of args the multidrug efflux pump related args had more complex interactions with tcs denitrifying bacteria and mges than antibiotic target alteration related args indicating the main resistance mechanism in granule based pd sbr was multidrug efflux pump 3 4 variations of microbial community structure in granule based pd sbr the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was performed to investigate the shifts of microbial community structure under the presence or absence of tcs and long term exposure to tcs as shown in fig 4a venn analysis indicated that only 6 22 141 out of 2266 otu were shared by all samples it indicated that bacterial community structure of pd sbr was significant different under tcs pressure which was consistent with gao et al 2019 in addition there were 27 84 426 out of 1530 otu shared by seed and d90 meanwhile 13 33 204 out of 1530 otu were shared by seed and d160 respectively remarkably only 9 02 138 out of 1530 otu shared by d90 the end of pd process and d160 the end of 3 mg l tcs adding stage it seemed that the microbial community between 0 mg l tcs and 3 mg l tcs stages were significantly different which was also supported by pcoa results fig s4a overall the change of the microbial community in the pd process was dynamic but the introduction of 3 mg l tcs made the overall direction of the dynamic evolution mutated and under the continuous action of tcs selective pressure it continuously affected the microbial community structure the relative abundance of the phyla of all samples at least greater than 1 are shown in fig s4b proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the primary phylum the relative abundance of them ranged from 37 23 and 8 17 to 57 26 and 36 84 respectively in addition chloroflexi and actinobacteria showed decreasing tendency while proteobacteria and bacteroidetes showed increasing tendency with the ntr increasing from 2 10 to 72 24 du et al 2016 found that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes have high proportions of 75 90 and 9 41 when the system has high ntr respectively these results indicated that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes might be beneficial for the conversion of nitrate to nitrite after adding 3 mg l tcs proteobacteria and firmicutes immediately increased from 46 68 and 1 10 to 57 26 and 17 91 respectively it seemed that short term exposure of tcs could stimulate the growth of proteobacteria and firmicutes conversely bacteroidetes sharply decreased from 36 84 to 8 17 after adding 3 mg l tcs but increased to 33 56 after a long period of tcs domestication these results indicated that short term exposure of tcs enriched proteobacteria and firmicutes while bacteroidetes was enriched after a long period of tcs domestication to further reveal the impacts of tcs on microbial community structure abundant genera one sample had the relative abundance at least greater than 1 in each sample were investigated fig 4b with the ntr increasing from 2 10 to 72 24 the relative abundance of haliangium defluviicoccus and dermatophilus decreased from 6 72 4 81 and 14 29 to 0 0 11 and 0 57 respectively inversely ca competibacter hydrogenophaga thauera and flavobacterium increased from 6 15 2 29 1 63 and 1 28 to 12 49 6 59 9 27 and 28 08 during pd process respectively it was clearly that ca competibacter hydrogenophaga thauera and flavobacterium were denitrifying bacteria and the abundance of them exhibited increasing trend during pd process showing that they might be the main pd bacteria which could transform nitrate to nitrite after the addition of 3 mg l tcs pseudomonas and fusibacter rose from 0 03 and 0 39 to 41 35 and 12 81 and then decreased to 2 58 and 2 25 after a long period of tcs domestication respectively the concentration of mlss mlvss and particle size of granular sludges decreased from 13246 10862 and 1099 to 7856 mg l 5813 mg l and 667 μm after adding tcs table s3 indicating that the granular sludges was crashed to some extent however the integrity coefficient of granular sludges was maintained at 97 37 99 32 indicating tcs pressure was the main attribution affecting pd performance and microbial community variation previous study also reported that tcs can cause crushing of ags li et al 2020a which was similar to this study after that pseudomonas might be released from the inner of granular sludges and contacted the substrate or tcs more sufficiently in addition pseudomonas is also an eps secreting bacteria orgad et al 2011 so it could protect itself in the environment where tcs exists in view of the above reasons pseudomonas was largely enriched after tcs dosing and had higher relative abundance than other bacteria after a period of adaptation these enriched bacteria ultimately might not be able to resist the long term toxic effects of tcs therefore they gradually decreased it seemed that pseudomonas and fusibacter could be enriched at the initial shock load of 3 mg l tcs but their breeding was significantly weakened under the long term pressure of tcs in addition thauera and flavobacterium decreased from 9 27 and 28 08 to 6 62 and 4 34 after short term exposure of tcs and increased to 18 93 and 30 72 after a long period of tcs domestication respectively overall abundant thauera and flavobacterium ensured pd performance of system meanwhile after adding tcs their abundance increased with the tcs degradation efficiency increasing from 1 82 to 10 66 respectively both thauera and flavobacterium might be potential pd bacteria and tcs degrading bacteria the specific differential bacteria in 0 mg l tcs and 3 mg l tcs stages were further identified by lefse as shown in fig 4c 65 bacteria were significantly enriched in 0 mg l tcs and 3 mg l tcs stages α 0 05 lda score 2 0 prominently phylum flrmicutes and chloroflexi were remarkably enriched during 3 mg l tcs and 0 mg l tcs stages respectively some family such as pseudomonadaceae erysipelothrix pamily xii and peptostreptoqiccaceae were markedly enriched during 3 mg l tcs stage while family nitrosomonadaceae thiotrkhaceae flavobacteriaceae anaerolineaceae dermatophilaceae cytophagaceae and rhodospirillaceae were enriched during 0 mg l tcs stages pseudomonas a9 fuslbacter q erysipelotrichia v and acetoanaerobium s were dominant discriminating genera during 3 mg l tcs stage while ca competibacter b8 dermatophilus b hydrogenophaga a1 and defluviicoccus y were the main discrepant genera during 0 mg l tcs stages overall it indicated that tcs could cause dramatically different bacterial community structures 3 5 community composition of active pd bacteria and tcs degrading bacteria to explore whether the denitrifying bacteria in pd system were pd bacteria or conditional pd bacteria dna sip of denitrifying bacteria was conducted the influent and effluent cod nitrate and nitrite concentration of each cycle were measured for evaluating the denitrification activity in pd dna sip incubation fig s5 shows the results of denitrification activity with or without sodium propionate all no3 n was completely removed after 4 h reaction under the presence of sodium propionate while no3 n concentration had no variation during 4 h reaction under the absence of sodium propionate these results indicated that denitrifying bacteria used sodium propionate to remove no3 n therefore labeling of 13c could perform denitrification process that used nitrate as depicted in fig 5 a and b the average effluent concentration of cod and nitrate of each treatment were 12 00 and 6 96 mg l and the average cod and nitrate removal efficiency were 80 34 and 70 56 respectively most nitrate was reverted to nitrite and the average effluent nitrite concentration and ntr were 16 74 mg l and 66 02 respectively fig s3a showed the changes of cod nitrate and nitrite concentration in a typical incubation cycle after 4 h reaction the effluent nitrate concentration was 0 54 mg l and the corresponding ntr was 66 40 these results illustrated that high pd activity was achieved in all microcosms during pd dna sip incubation in addition the 13c labelled dna from the microcosms native dna was separated by cscl density gradient centrifugation and then the narg and nirs genes of denitrifying bacteria throughout the whole buoyant density fractions were also quantified as shown in fig 5c and d the highest copy numbers of narg gene of 12c carbon and 13c carbon samples separated and the cscl buoyant density of the peak of narg gene of 12c carbon and 13c carbon samples were 1 7212 and 1 7289 g l respectively it seemed that the peak of narg gene gradually shifted to heavy dna fractions although the cscl buoyant density of the peak of narg gene of 12c carbon and 13c carbon samples was not an obvious separation fig 5c the peaks of nirs gene of 12c carbon and 13c carbon samples completely overlapped fig 5d indicating 13c carbon was labelled subsequent results of microbial community structure of 12c carbon and 13c carbon samples could also confirm that 13c carbon was labelled overall active pd bacteria was labelled and further indicated that the labelled bacteria were pd bacteria rather than conditional pd bacteria to further explore the active pd bacteria and tcs degrading bacteria dna sip combined with bacteria 16s qpcr assay and high throughput sequencing of heavy dna from 13c carbon tcs and 12c carbon tcs were conducted as depicted in fig 6 a and b three bacterial genera were concentrated in the heavy dna of 13c carbon while 10 bacterial genera were concentrated in the heavy dna of 13c tcs as for carbon sip fig 6a the dominant genus in 13c carbon sample was thauera 81 21 which was greater than 73 23 in 12c carbon sample it showed that thauera was the main active pd bacteria in this study in addition aquimonas was also concentrated in the heavy dna of 13c carbon sample the relative abundance of aquimonas in 13c carbon sample were 1 17 which was greater than 0 93 in 12c carbon sample specially the bacterial genus with the highest relative enrichment was pasteurella 47665 36 and its relative abundance was 1 30 in 13c carbon sample which was greater than 0 01 in 12c carbon sample these results indicated that aquimonas and pasteurella might contribute to achieve pd in this system as for tcs sip fig 6b the dominant genus in 13c tcs sample was also thauera 30 27 which was greater than 24 99 in 12c tcs sample it revealed that thauera was also the main active tcs degrading bacteria in this study in particular the relative enrichment of sphingomonas was 1266 79 and its relative abundance was 10 44 in 13c tcs sample which was greater than 1 77 in 12c tcs sample sphingomonas is isolated from activated sludge of a wwtp which has a fine degradation effect on tcs mulla et al 2016 and in this study it played an important role in removing tcs in addition the relative enrichment of aquimonas bdellovibrio mangroviflexus sphingobium vadinbc27 fluviicola pseudoxanthomonas gemmobacter and flavobacterium were 462 88 439 91 428 77 320 52 260 58 186 11 167 94 149 42 and 113 68 respectively indicating they were also enriched in the heavy dna of 13c tcs sample and benefitted the removal of tcs specially thauera was proved to be both active pd bacteria and active tcs degrading bacteria in present work it seemed that thauera could contribute to nitrite accumulation and tcs degradation simultaneously it had been reported that thauera not only exhibit a higher abundance of nitrate reductase including narg and napa than nitrite reductase including nirs which can occur incomplete denitrification and transform nitrate to nitrite qian et al 2019 but also describe as important aromatic compound degraders mao et al 2010 so it could transform nitrate to nitrite and degrade tcs at the same time in conclusion dna sip assay showed that pasteurella and sphingomonas led the transformation of nitrate and degradation of tcs in the granule based pd sbr respectively while thauera could contribute to nitrite accumulation and tcs degradation simultaneously the incubation time in this study might not be the most suitable and more suitable incubation time could be investigated in the future 4 conclusions long term addition of tcs could cause the transformation of pd process to complete denitrification process in the granule based pd sbr granular sludge could resist tcs toxicity by secreting more eps and tcs removal efficiency achieved 54 28 at the end of 3 mg l tcs in addition tcs resistance mechanism of granule based pd system shifted from multidrug efflux pump initial stage to antibiotic target alteration final stage during the tcs loading period dna sip assay indicated that thauera could contribute to nitrite accumulation and tcs degradation simultaneously this study

16371,granule based partial denitrification pd is a technology that can supply stable nitrite for applying anaerobic ammonia oxidation in wastewater treatment and triclosan tcs is a frequently detected antibacterial agent in wastewater treatment plants therefore it is possible that tcs could enter into wastewater that is treated using pd technology however the active microorganisms responsible for pd and tcs removing in granule based pd system have not been clearly identified and it is currently not clear how tcs affects the pd process in this study the impacts of tcs on pd performance pd microbial community antibiotic resistance genes args active pd bacteria and tcs degrading bacteria in a granule based pd system were investigated 3 mg l tcs had adverse influence on pd process but pd system could recover gradually after inhibiting of 10 days after a period of domestication pd granular sludge could achieve 10 66 of tcs degradation efficiency and 43 62 of tcs adsorption efficiency microbes might increase their resistance to tcs by increasing the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances and the secretion of protein might play a more pivotal role than the secretion of polysaccharides in resisting tcs the short term shock of tcs might cause the propagation of acra 03 while the long term operation of tcs could propagate fabk and inti1 dna stable isotope probing assay indicated that thauera was active pd bacteria and tcs degrading bacteria in the granule based pd system and it could contribute to nitrite accumulation and tcs degradation simultaneously graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords partial denitrification triclosan antibiotic resistance genes dna stable isotope probing active partial denitrifying bacteria active triclosan degrading bacteria 1 introduction the anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox has been extensively identified as a novel autotrophic and cost effective biotechnology for wastewater treatment kartal et al 2010 it is necessary to acquire nitrite for applying anammox process through partial nitrification oxidizing ammonia to nitrite and partial denitrification pd reducing nitrate to nitrite nevertheless it is difficult to keep the steady nitrite accumulation in partial nitrification recent studies reported the accumulation of nitrite during denitrification cao et al 2013 du et al 2016 and cao et al 2013 found that pd process can achieve over 80 nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio ntr and keep long term stabilization there are many environmental factors which affect nitrite accumulation in pd process such as carbon to nitrogen ratio c n carbon sources type ph temperature nitrate concentration and sludge type cao et al 2013 to date many researchers concerned at pd of floc sludge cao et al 2013 and biofilm gao et al 2019 while a few researches focused on pd of granular sludge granular sludge a self immobilized microbial consortium containing different functional microorganisms is widely applied under anaerobic and aerobic condition liu and tay 2004 winkler et al 2018 pd process based on the granular sludge presented advantages over the conventional activated sludge such as higher sludge settling performance harboring microbial community better at degradation of toxic substances and more excretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps to defend toxicity due to its unique layered structure granular sludge might provide a beneficial environment for the growth of denitrifying bacteria that can transform nitrate to nitrite and the resistance to toxicity substances such as triclosan tcs previous studies indicated that some denitrifying bacteria can reduce nitrate to nitrite as the only product can be called as pd bacteria such as staphylococcus martienssen and schöps 1999 and rhodobacter lee et al 2002 which were also often found in granular sludge and the unique formation mode of granular sludge could cause the enrichment of these denitrifying bacteria therefore granular sludge was used to start pd process in this study there are four strains thauera sp dnt 1 thauera aminoaromaticaa thauera terpenicaa and thauera phenylaceticaa can be called as conditional pd bacteria with no transcription of nirs genes coding reduction of nitrite to nitrogen gas under the presence of nitrate which can reduce nitrate to nitrite when all nitrate was reduced these strains could further reduce nitrite to nitrogen gas liu et al 2013 however it was still unclear that the denitrifying bacteria in pd system could only transform nitrate to nitrite pd bacteria or reduce nitrate to nitrite under certain conditions conditional pd bacteria tcs as a broad spectrum antibacterial agent is widely used in personal care products moreover tcs not only can be found in cosmetics toothpastes and soaps but also widely detected in many environments such as sediments soil and surface water so it presents certain study significances halden and paull 2005 in addition tcs is considered to be related with the emergence and spread of several antibiotic resistance genes args which have potential risks to the environment and human health lu et al 2018 with the covid 19 outbreak the usage of tcs rises dramatically resulting in higher concentrations of tcs flowing into sewage systems lu et al 2021 therefore it is possible that tcs of mg l level could enter into wastewater that is treated using pd technology because tcs not only has potential environmental impacts but also has endocrine and developmental reproductive effects in human the removal of tcs has attracted rising attentions it has been reported that tcs can be biodegraded in various systems including sediments wastewater activated sludge and axenic cultures of microorganisms zhang et al 2020 indicated that the addition of tcs can decrease the abundance of nitrite oxidizing bacteria in a nitrifying sequencing batch reactor sbr and achieve partial nitrification however the impacts of tcs on pd microbial community structure and the fate of tcs in granule based pd system were still unclear meanwhile tcs degrading microorganisms involved in pd system were also unclear dna stable isotope probing dna sip could identify functional bacteria in mixed complex system and the core of dna sip is incorporating stable isotopes 15n or 13c into the bacterial dna by assimilating the labelled compound in substrate radajewski et al 2000 the labelled dna is isolated through isopycnic ultracentrifugation and then the bacteria harbored the 15n or 13c label are identified by using next generation sequencing cupples 2016 xing et al 2018 used dna sip to identify the active denitrifiers in a combined microelectrolysis and found that thermomonas like phylotypes are labelled by 13c bicarbonate while thauera like and comamonas like phylotypes are labelled by 13c acetate in addition some researchers applied dna sip to identify tcs degrading bacteria in the nitrifying sbr and lab scale anoxic oxic system and found that the genus amaricoccus and methylobacillus are the major tcs degraders respectively dai et al 2020 jia et al 2020 however the active bacteria involved in a granule based pd system of removing tcs were not clear the relationships between pd bacteria and tcs degrading bacteria were also unknown and it was unclear whether there were bacteria that could simultaneously achieve the pd process and remove tcs the purposes of this study were to achieve pd based on granular sludge explore the removal of tcs in granule based pd system and reveal the active microorganisms involved in pd process and tcs degrading process in addition the shifts of microorganisms and args during pd process and the impacts of tcs on pd performance pd microbial community structure and tcs related args in granule based pd system were also investigated this study combined dna sip and high throughput sequencing to identify the active pd bacteria and tcs degrading bacteria and the relationships among active pd bacteria tcs degrading bacteria and args were also investigated by network analysis this work might help to reveal the microorganism involved in both pd and tcs degradation and provide a theoretical direction for pd and tcs removal in wastewater biological treatment process based on granular sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 set up and operation of experiment a lab scale sbr with 3 l effective volume was operated to study the impacts of tcs on pd which has a volume exchange ratio of 60 the seeding aerobic granular sludge ags was obtained from a pilot scale ags sbr of gaobeidian wwtp beijing china li et al 2020b the synthetic nitrate wastewater including nano3 cacl2 2h2o mgso4 7h2o kh2po4 and trace element solution in a bucket and additional carbon source ch3ch2coona in another bucket were added into the sbr respectively granule based pd sbr was operated for eight cycles each day and each cycle 3 h included 6 min of synthetic wastewater feeding 1 min of carbon source adding 40 min of anoxic reaction 2 min of settling 3 min of decanting and 128 min of idle period granule based pd sbr was operated for 160 days with three stages in phase i 1 31 day influent nitrate and chemical oxygen demand cod concentration were 35 and 105 mg l respectively and the corresponding c n was 3 in phase ii 32 98 day influent nitrate and cod concentration were increased to 105 and 315 mg l respectively and the corresponding ntr was maintained at 72 24 in phase iii 99 160 3 mg l tcs was added to granule based pd sbr which was performed to explore the impacts of tcs on pd the details of analytical methods of cod nitrite nitrate mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss sludge volume index svi average diameter and eps including loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps and the calculation of total inorganic nitrogen tin ntr integrity coefficient and the mass balance of tcs were summarized in methods s1 in addition six sludge samples were gathered on day 0 30 90 100 120 and 160 for average diameter measure eps measure and dna extraction which named as seed d30 d90 d100 d120 and d160 respectively and the details of sampling dna extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr were also shown in methods s2 2 2 dna sip incubation isopycnic centrifugation and gradient fractionation after achieving an effective tcs degradation at the end of 3 mg l tcs dosing stage dna sip assay was applied to explore the active pd bacteria and tcs degrading bacteria in granule based pd sbr fig 1 collected granular sludge was washed three times with deionized water and transferred to conical flasks for dna sip incubation with 200 ml synthetic wastewater for identifying pd bacteria and 50 ml synthetic wastewater for identifying tcs degrading bacteria respectively the synthetic wastewater for pd and tcs degrading dna sip incubation were summarized at table s2 in addition 13c labelled propionate 13ch3 13ch2 13coona 99 purity and tcs all c labeled 99 purity were purchased from cambridge isotope laboratories cil usa which was used for pd and tcs degrading dna sip incubation respectively four treatments were fed with the following substrates a 12ch3 12ch2 12coona and nitrate control pd dna sip incubation b 13ch3 13ch2 13coona and nitrate 13c labelled pd dna sip incubation c 12c tcs and nitrate control tcs dna sip incubation d 13c tcs and nitrate 13c labelled tcs dna sip incubation equivalent 12ch3 12ch2 12coona and 13ch3 13ch2 13coona or 12c tcs and 13c tcs as the sole carbon source were added into microcosms of control or labelled treatments respectively the culture cycle was eight for pd dna sip incubation and one for tcs degrading dna sip incubation each incubation time was 4 h for pd dna sip incubation and 3 days for tcs degrading dna sip incubation in water bath shaker at 25 c when nitrate or tcs was degraded completely in the system one cycle of incubation ended after briefly settling and supernatant decanting the granular sludge samples were added into new synthetic wastewater to generate a new cycle of reaction respectively the time course incubation of pd dna sip incubation and tcs degrading dna sip incubation were applied in order to ensure that as little as possible cross feeding occurred and the experiment of labeling active functional bacteria with suitable and shorter incubation time was according to guo et al 2018 and lolas et al 2012 respectively all the treatments were set up in duplicate and granular sludge were collected and freeze dried after the end of culture then the freeze dried sludges were further conducted to dna extraction ultracentrifugation layering and purification the detailed steps were presented in methods s3 in addition control treatment only nitrate and tcs no propionate was set up to explore the label of 13c could perform denitrification process that used no3 n in order to evaluate the dna sip incubation of pd and further identify active denitrifying bacteria pd bacteria or conditioned pd bacteria each fraction after purifying was used to quantify the abundance of narg and nirs gene of 12c carbon and 13c carbon dna by qpcr and the reaction procedure was consistent with the qpcr in methods s2 2 3 high throughput sequencing and biological information analysis the heavy 12c and 13c dna samples 3 5 layered fractions cscl buoyant density ranged at 1 73 1 76 g l from isopycnic centrifugation were performed to sequence bacterial 16s rrna gene v3 v4 regions at allwegene technology co ltd beijing china using illumina miseq pe300 sequencer illumina usa in addition six sludge dna samples from granule based pd sbr were also sequenced and the original sequences of 10 dna samples including four sip dna samples and six sludge dna samples could be found in sequence read archive sra database with the number of prjna 664473 after sequencing chimera removal operational taxonomic units otus division and diversity calculation were analyzed by quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime1 pipeline caporaso et al 2011 in detail alpha diversity containing shannon chao1 observed species goods coverage and simpson index were calculated and beta diversity including principal coordinate analysis pcoa and cluster analysis ca were also generated based on weighted unifrac distance metrics in addition tbtools was used for venn analysis chen et al 2020 and linear discriminant analysis lda lda score of 2 0 alpha value of 0 05 effect size lefse was applied to clarify the distinct variants in specific bacteria between 0 mg l tcs and 3 mg l tcs stages the interactions among functional bacteria mobile genetic elements mges and args and the co occurrence modes among args were identified by spearman s rank correlation coefficients during no tcs and 3 mg l tcs processes after that cytoscape 3 8 2 was implemented to establish the network visualization to track the latent hosts of mges and args the significant variance between 0 mg l tcs and 3 mg l tcs stages were evaluated using one way analysis of variance anova in addition the computational details of relative enrichment from dna sip incubation were shown in methods s4 in brief enrichment of a specific taxonomic group was determined by dividing its relative copy numbers from a 13c density range by its relative copy numbers from the corresponding 12c density range the relative copy numbers and enrichment were calculated as follows relative copy numbers ra 16s rrna gene copies relative enrichment r 13c r 12c where ra is the relative abundance of taxon specific reads in the defined cscl density ranges 1 7365 1 7604 g l 16s rrna gene copies is the number of 16s rrna gene copies in the same cscl density ranges and r 13c and r 12c are the relative copy numbers of 13c and 12c samples respectively all taxa that showed a relative enrichment 100 in at least one treatment or time point were considered as 13c labeled 3 results and discussion 3 1 start up and performance of granule based pd sbr fig 2 depicts the variations of influent and effluent concentration of nitrate nitrite and tcs as illustrated in fig 2a and b the average tin removal efficiency and ntr in phase i were only 26 34 and 39 53 respectively while after increasing the influent cod and nitrate to 315 and 105 mg l respectively the effluent nitrite concentration achieved 83 01 mg l and the corresponding ntr increased to 72 24 at the end of phase ii the effluent content of nitrate rose to 64 15 mg l after the addition of 3 mg l tcs and the corresponding tin removal efficiency and ntr were 22 55 and 29 04 fig 2a and b respectively after 9 days of tcs addition the effluent nitrate gradually declined to 7 35 mg l and the corresponding ntr increased to 56 41 these results revealed that 3 mg l tcs could inhibit denitrification but it could recover gradually which was consistent with gao et al 2019 fig 2c depicts the n transformation results during entire operation period in phase i 11 97 of nitrate was transformed to nitrite and 41 51 of nitrate was transformed to nitrogen gas while 46 52 of nitrate was discharged into drainage in phase ii most of nitrate 64 74 was transformed to nitrite while only 32 21 and 3 05 of nitrate was transformed to nitrogen gas and discharged into drainage respectively in phase iii only 0 76 of nitrate was transformed to nitrite after adding 3 mg l tcs of 3 days while 13 97 and 85 27 of nitrate was converted to nitrogen gas and drawn off respectively and then the proportion of nitrate was transformed to nitrite nitrogen gas and drawn off changed to 43 51 37 03 and 19 47 after adaptation to tcs respectively these results indicated that long term addition of tcs could cause the transformation of pd process to complete denitrification process in the granule based pd sbr in summary the initial dosage of 3 mg l tcs could inhibit denitrification and decrease nitrite accumulation while granule based pd sbr could recover gradually after inhibiting of 10 days the influent and effluent tcs concentration of granule based pd sbr were further measured and the mass balance of tcs at the beginning and end of phase iii was conducted to expose the fate of tcs as shown in fig 2d the removal efficiency of tcs rose from 26 41 to 54 28 after the operation of 60 days furthermore tcs degradation efficiency and tcs adsorption efficiency increased from 1 82 and 24 59 to 10 66 and 43 62 respectively zhang et al 2020 studied the impacts of different tcs concentration on nitrifying sbr after 145 days of the activated sludge acclimating to tcs tcs removal efficiency gradually increases from 87 70 to 98 50 which was similar to this study it revealed that after a period of domestication the granular sludge in pd sbr could acclimate to 3 mg l tcs and the increase of tcs degradation efficiency caused the recovery of denitrification performance in pd sbr the reason for the increase of tcs degradation efficiency was further explained by eps and microbial dynamics 3 2 variations of eps in granule based pd sbr in order to explore the defense mechanism of pd sbrs against tcs and the response of granular sludge to tcs the variations of eps in all samples were investigated as shown in fig s1a and 1b the tb eps content was always greater than the lb eps content during the entire operational period both the lb eps and tb eps content decreased firstly and then increased after adding 3 mg l tcs and the lb eps and tb eps contents decreased from 93 61 and 114 08 to 31 87 and 80 85 mg g vss with the ntr increasing from 2 10 to 72 24 during the operation of 98 days in phase i and ii respectively it seemed that the decrease of eps during 0 mg l tcs was caused by the decrease of lb eps and it was also mainly influenced by ntr microbes may be inhibited by the toxic effect of free nitrous acid to some extent wu et al 2018 affecting their secretion of eps therefore with the ntr increasing both the pn and ps concentration decreased after adding 3 mg l tcs the lb eps and tb eps content rose from 31 87 and 80 85 to 80 22 and 240 81 mg g vss respectively the pn and ps concentration in tb eps rose from 68 69 and 12 16 to 191 35 and 49 46 mg g vss while in lb eps the pn and ps content slightly increased from 26 63 and 5 24 to 68 95 and 11 27 mg g vss respectively this result indicated that the increase of eps at 3 mg l tcs was mainly caused by the increase of tb eps 76 79 was caused by tb while only 23 21 was caused by lb and microorganisms may produce eps to resist tcs gao et al 2019 the inoculated ags have high eps content mcswain et al 2005 and once they came into anoxic environment from aerobic environment some aerobic bacteria might be inactivated which led to the death of eps related bacteria and then caused the decrease of eps concentration on day 30 after a period of acclimatization the growth of anoxic bacteria caused the eps content to remain stable after adding 3 mg l tcs denitrification in granule based pd system was immediately suppressed fig 2a and the corresponding tcs biodegradation was only 1 82 fig 2d and the concentration of eps did not increase immediately it seemed that the addition of tcs could not only inhibit denitrification but also inhibit eps secretion a pervious study found that high concentration of tcs can destroy cell membranes and interfere with pn and lipid synthesis middleton and salierno 2013 resulting in the decrease of eps secretion as the tcs biodegradation increased to 10 66 the concentration of eps increased gradually eps can protect cells from toxicity caused by intracellular uptake or direct adsorption on the cell surface birch and bachofen 1990 these results indicated that the increasing of ntr during pd process led to the decreasing of eps secretion of granular sludge while the addition of tcs could promote the eps secretion after a period of adaptation moreover the pn ps in lb eps and tb eps at 0 mg l tcs was lower than those at 3 mg l tcs demonstrating that pn was induced after the exposure of bacteria to tcs and pn was more easily secreted than ps in brief microbes might increase their resistance to tcs by increasing the secretion of eps and pn might play a more important role than ps in resisting tcs the relationships between eps contents and functional microorganism were further evaluated p 0 05 as shown in table s4 pn in tb eps was positively correlated with tcs degradation and tcs adsorption indicating tcs degradation efficiency increased with the increasing of eps content and the increased tcs degradation efficiency might improve denitrification performance of pd sbr 3 3 variations of denitrifying bacteria and tcs related args in granule based pd sbr to better evaluate the impacts of tcs on denitrifying bacteria total bacteria and denitrifying functional genes narg nirs and nosz were measured by qpcr for denitrification narg nirs and nosz encode genes for nitrate reductase no3 n no2 n nitrite reductase no2 n no and nitrous oxide reductase n2o n2 respectively as demonstrated in fig s2a there was no significant difference in 16s narg nirs and nosz genes between 0 mg l tcs and 3 mg l tcs concretely the absolute abundance of 16s rrna gene showed a rising trend p 0 039 based on one way anova increasing from 2 33 1012 to 4 32 1012 copies g sludge the average copy numbers of narg 3 16 1010 copies g sludge was lower than nirs and nosz 4 30 1011 and 5 05 1011 copies g sludge respectively during the entire process the absolute abundance of narg declined from 7 67 1010 to 7 37 109 copies g sludge after adding 3 mg l tcs p 0 012 based on one way anova a previous study found that 1 mg l tcs can inhibit narg in both floccular sludge and biofilm gao et al 2019 which was similar to this study in addition the absolute abundance of nirs and nosz gene decreased from 1 13 1012 and 1 36 1012 to 3 05 1011 and 3 52 1011 copies g sludge after adding 3 mg l tcs p 0 003 and 0 0003 based on one way anova and then increased to 7 19 1011 and 6 16 1011 copies g sludge p 0 007 and 0 024 based on one way anova respectively nirs and nosz gene were proved to transform nitrite and nitrous oxide to nitric oxide and nitrogen respectively therefore the variations of them explained the nitrite transformation rate in pd system first increased from 11 97 to 64 74 and then decreased to 43 51 fig 2c ht qpcr was further used to explore the transmission mechanism of tcs on antibiotic resistome in pd system and all the values of args and mges presented in fig 3 a were shown as log2 copies g dry sludge in present work 13 tcs related args with two mechanisms of multidrug efflux pump acra 02 acra 03 acrb 01 adea adej mexb and mexf and antibiotic target alteration fabi q fabi1 fabi2 fabk pafabi and pafabv and five mges with integrons inti1 and inti3 transposons tnpa 04 and tp614 and insertion sequences is613 were quantified as shown in fig s2c the variation of args showed a decreasing trend during the entire operation the abundance of args and mges during 3 mg l tcs were significantly lower than those at 0 mg l p 0 05 concretely the most abundant args in seed was mexf its abundance was 35 62 and it was only detected in seed fig 3a in addition the abundance of acra 03 and mexb increased from 0 to 25 46 and 30 01 with the ntr increasing from 2 10 to 72 24 respectively these results indicated that high ntr might cause the propagation of acra 03 and mexb and the potential reason was that free nitrous acid might influence several microbial hosts of args and promote the co selection for acra 03 and mexb conversely the variation trend of acrb 01 fabi1 fabi2 fabk and pafabi showed decreasing tendency during pd process after the addition of 3 mg l tcs most args decreased including adej mexb and pafabv it seemed that 3 mg l tcs might directly kill the host microorganisms that carried those args resulting in the reduction of those args in addition the abundance of acra 03 sharply increased from 25 46 to 26 53 after adding 3 mg l tcs and then decreased to 24 64 after a long period of tcs domestication while fabk was enriched at the end of 3 mg l tcs it indicated that the short term shocks of tcs might cause the propagation of acra 03 while the long term operation of tcs could propagate fabk it seemed that microorganisms in pd sbr could gain additional resistance by excreting antibiotics such as tcs at the initial dosing stage of tcs sun et al 2014 and then they could interfere with or limit antibiotic interaction to enhance resistance at the end of tcs adding stage poole 2002 tcs resistance mechanism of granule based pd system shifted from multidrug efflux pump initial stage to antibiotic target alteration final stage during the tcs loading period as shown in fig 3a inti1 inti3 is613 and tp614 increased with the ntr increasing indicating high ntr could propagate those mges aquimonas was enriched fig 4 in the high ntr phase therefore the enrichment of its possible potential hosts of some mges is613 or inti3 fig 6c might lead to the increase of is613 and inti3 in addition the co selection effect between acra 03 and tp614 could be observed in present system fig 3b which might be the reason of increase of tp614 after adding 3 mg l tcs inti1 first declined from 38 51 to 37 63 and then increased to 39 28 after a long period of tcs domestication but the abundance of inti3 is613 and tp614 sharply decreased from 34 38 32 01 and 28 54 to 30 77 28 74 and 27 59 respectively in summary most of args and megs could be attenuated after adding tcs while the short term shocks of tcs might cause the propagation of acra 03 and the long term operation of tcs could propagate fabk and inti1 mges could carry args and transfer them through hgt among different bacteria and the tcs resistance mechanism shifted from multidrug efflux pump initial stage to antibiotic target alteration final stage during 3 mg l tcs dosing stage the correlations among tcs denitrifying bacteria mges and args were further analyzed by network analysis and the results were shown in fig 3b the relationships of most phylotypes were negative tcs and denitrifying bacteria were negatively correlated with most of args and mges while tcs had positive correlation with 16s nosz and nirs genes which was similar to the results of qpcr fig s2 it was proved that the long term addition of tcs had no obvious inhibitory impacts on denitrification of this system but promoted the reaction from nitrite to nitrogen in addition acrb 01 and adej genes were positively correlated with fabi2 indicating that the co selection of two kinds of resistance mechanism on the same genetic elements potentially occurred in granule based pd system which would affect the persistence and proliferation of args the multidrug efflux pump related args had more complex interactions with tcs denitrifying bacteria and mges than antibiotic target alteration related args indicating the main resistance mechanism in granule based pd sbr was multidrug efflux pump 3 4 variations of microbial community structure in granule based pd sbr the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was performed to investigate the shifts of microbial community structure under the presence or absence of tcs and long term exposure to tcs as shown in fig 4a venn analysis indicated that only 6 22 141 out of 2266 otu were shared by all samples it indicated that bacterial community structure of pd sbr was significant different under tcs pressure which was consistent with gao et al 2019 in addition there were 27 84 426 out of 1530 otu shared by seed and d90 meanwhile 13 33 204 out of 1530 otu were shared by seed and d160 respectively remarkably only 9 02 138 out of 1530 otu shared by d90 the end of pd process and d160 the end of 3 mg l tcs adding stage it seemed that the microbial community between 0 mg l tcs and 3 mg l tcs stages were significantly different which was also supported by pcoa results fig s4a overall the change of the microbial community in the pd process was dynamic but the introduction of 3 mg l tcs made the overall direction of the dynamic evolution mutated and under the continuous action of tcs selective pressure it continuously affected the microbial community structure the relative abundance of the phyla of all samples at least greater than 1 are shown in fig s4b proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the primary phylum the relative abundance of them ranged from 37 23 and 8 17 to 57 26 and 36 84 respectively in addition chloroflexi and actinobacteria showed decreasing tendency while proteobacteria and bacteroidetes showed increasing tendency with the ntr increasing from 2 10 to 72 24 du et al 2016 found that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes have high proportions of 75 90 and 9 41 when the system has high ntr respectively these results indicated that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes might be beneficial for the conversion of nitrate to nitrite after adding 3 mg l tcs proteobacteria and firmicutes immediately increased from 46 68 and 1 10 to 57 26 and 17 91 respectively it seemed that short term exposure of tcs could stimulate the growth of proteobacteria and firmicutes conversely bacteroidetes sharply decreased from 36 84 to 8 17 after adding 3 mg l tcs but increased to 33 56 after a long period of tcs domestication these results indicated that short term exposure of tcs enriched proteobacteria and firmicutes while bacteroidetes was enriched after a long period of tcs domestication to further reveal the impacts of tcs on microbial community structure abundant genera one sample had the relative abundance at least greater than 1 in each sample were investigated fig 4b with the ntr increasing from 2 10 to 72 24 the relative abundance of haliangium defluviicoccus and dermatophilus decreased from 6 72 4 81 and 14 29 to 0 0 11 and 0 57 respectively inversely ca competibacter hydrogenophaga thauera and flavobacterium increased from 6 15 2 29 1 63 and 1 28 to 12 49 6 59 9 27 and 28 08 during pd process respectively it was clearly that ca competibacter hydrogenophaga thauera and flavobacterium were denitrifying bacteria and the abundance of them exhibited increasing trend during pd process showing that they might be the main pd bacteria which could transform nitrate to nitrite after the addition of 3 mg l tcs pseudomonas and fusibacter rose from 0 03 and 0 39 to 41 35 and 12 81 and then decreased to 2 58 and 2 25 after a long period of tcs domestication respectively the concentration of mlss mlvss and particle size of granular sludges decreased from 13246 10862 and 1099 to 7856 mg l 5813 mg l and 667 μm after adding tcs table s3 indicating that the granular sludges was crashed to some extent however the integrity coefficient of granular sludges was maintained at 97 37 99 32 indicating tcs pressure was the main attribution affecting pd performance and microbial community variation previous study also reported that tcs can cause crushing of ags li et al 2020a which was similar to this study after that pseudomonas might be released from the inner of granular sludges and contacted the substrate or tcs more sufficiently in addition pseudomonas is also an eps secreting bacteria orgad et al 2011 so it could protect itself in the environment where tcs exists in view of the above reasons pseudomonas was largely enriched after tcs dosing and had higher relative abundance than other bacteria after a period of adaptation these enriched bacteria ultimately might not be able to resist the long term toxic effects of tcs therefore they gradually decreased it seemed that pseudomonas and fusibacter could be enriched at the initial shock load of 3 mg l tcs but their breeding was significantly weakened under the long term pressure of tcs in addition thauera and flavobacterium decreased from 9 27 and 28 08 to 6 62 and 4 34 after short term exposure of tcs and increased to 18 93 and 30 72 after a long period of tcs domestication respectively overall abundant thauera and flavobacterium ensured pd performance of system meanwhile after adding tcs their abundance increased with the tcs degradation efficiency increasing from 1 82 to 10 66 respectively both thauera and flavobacterium might be potential pd bacteria and tcs degrading bacteria the specific differential bacteria in 0 mg l tcs and 3 mg l tcs stages were further identified by lefse as shown in fig 4c 65 bacteria were significantly enriched in 0 mg l tcs and 3 mg l tcs stages α 0 05 lda score 2 0 prominently phylum flrmicutes and chloroflexi were remarkably enriched during 3 mg l tcs and 0 mg l tcs stages respectively some family such as pseudomonadaceae erysipelothrix pamily xii and peptostreptoqiccaceae were markedly enriched during 3 mg l tcs stage while family nitrosomonadaceae thiotrkhaceae flavobacteriaceae anaerolineaceae dermatophilaceae cytophagaceae and rhodospirillaceae were enriched during 0 mg l tcs stages pseudomonas a9 fuslbacter q erysipelotrichia v and acetoanaerobium s were dominant discriminating genera during 3 mg l tcs stage while ca competibacter b8 dermatophilus b hydrogenophaga a1 and defluviicoccus y were the main discrepant genera during 0 mg l tcs stages overall it indicated that tcs could cause dramatically different bacterial community structures 3 5 community composition of active pd bacteria and tcs degrading bacteria to explore whether the denitrifying bacteria in pd system were pd bacteria or conditional pd bacteria dna sip of denitrifying bacteria was conducted the influent and effluent cod nitrate and nitrite concentration of each cycle were measured for evaluating the denitrification activity in pd dna sip incubation fig s5 shows the results of denitrification activity with or without sodium propionate all no3 n was completely removed after 4 h reaction under the presence of sodium propionate while no3 n concentration had no variation during 4 h reaction under the absence of sodium propionate these results indicated that denitrifying bacteria used sodium propionate to remove no3 n therefore labeling of 13c could perform denitrification process that used nitrate as depicted in fig 5 a and b the average effluent concentration of cod and nitrate of each treatment were 12 00 and 6 96 mg l and the average cod and nitrate removal efficiency were 80 34 and 70 56 respectively most nitrate was reverted to nitrite and the average effluent nitrite concentration and ntr were 16 74 mg l and 66 02 respectively fig s3a showed the changes of cod nitrate and nitrite concentration in a typical incubation cycle after 4 h reaction the effluent nitrate concentration was 0 54 mg l and the corresponding ntr was 66 40 these results illustrated that high pd activity was achieved in all microcosms during pd dna sip incubation in addition the 13c labelled dna from the microcosms native dna was separated by cscl density gradient centrifugation and then the narg and nirs genes of denitrifying bacteria throughout the whole buoyant density fractions were also quantified as shown in fig 5c and d the highest copy numbers of narg gene of 12c carbon and 13c carbon samples separated and the cscl buoyant density of the peak of narg gene of 12c carbon and 13c carbon samples were 1 7212 and 1 7289 g l respectively it seemed that the peak of narg gene gradually shifted to heavy dna fractions although the cscl buoyant density of the peak of narg gene of 12c carbon and 13c carbon samples was not an obvious separation fig 5c the peaks of nirs gene of 12c carbon and 13c carbon samples completely overlapped fig 5d indicating 13c carbon was labelled subsequent results of microbial community structure of 12c carbon and 13c carbon samples could also confirm that 13c carbon was labelled overall active pd bacteria was labelled and further indicated that the labelled bacteria were pd bacteria rather than conditional pd bacteria to further explore the active pd bacteria and tcs degrading bacteria dna sip combined with bacteria 16s qpcr assay and high throughput sequencing of heavy dna from 13c carbon tcs and 12c carbon tcs were conducted as depicted in fig 6 a and b three bacterial genera were concentrated in the heavy dna of 13c carbon while 10 bacterial genera were concentrated in the heavy dna of 13c tcs as for carbon sip fig 6a the dominant genus in 13c carbon sample was thauera 81 21 which was greater than 73 23 in 12c carbon sample it showed that thauera was the main active pd bacteria in this study in addition aquimonas was also concentrated in the heavy dna of 13c carbon sample the relative abundance of aquimonas in 13c carbon sample were 1 17 which was greater than 0 93 in 12c carbon sample specially the bacterial genus with the highest relative enrichment was pasteurella 47665 36 and its relative abundance was 1 30 in 13c carbon sample which was greater than 0 01 in 12c carbon sample these results indicated that aquimonas and pasteurella might contribute to achieve pd in this system as for tcs sip fig 6b the dominant genus in 13c tcs sample was also thauera 30 27 which was greater than 24 99 in 12c tcs sample it revealed that thauera was also the main active tcs degrading bacteria in this study in particular the relative enrichment of sphingomonas was 1266 79 and its relative abundance was 10 44 in 13c tcs sample which was greater than 1 77 in 12c tcs sample sphingomonas is isolated from activated sludge of a wwtp which has a fine degradation effect on tcs mulla et al 2016 and in this study it played an important role in removing tcs in addition the relative enrichment of aquimonas bdellovibrio mangroviflexus sphingobium vadinbc27 fluviicola pseudoxanthomonas gemmobacter and flavobacterium were 462 88 439 91 428 77 320 52 260 58 186 11 167 94 149 42 and 113 68 respectively indicating they were also enriched in the heavy dna of 13c tcs sample and benefitted the removal of tcs specially thauera was proved to be both active pd bacteria and active tcs degrading bacteria in present work it seemed that thauera could contribute to nitrite accumulation and tcs degradation simultaneously it had been reported that thauera not only exhibit a higher abundance of nitrate reductase including narg and napa than nitrite reductase including nirs which can occur incomplete denitrification and transform nitrate to nitrite qian et al 2019 but also describe as important aromatic compound degraders mao et al 2010 so it could transform nitrate to nitrite and degrade tcs at the same time in conclusion dna sip assay showed that pasteurella and sphingomonas led the transformation of nitrate and degradation of tcs in the granule based pd sbr respectively while thauera could contribute to nitrite accumulation and tcs degradation simultaneously the incubation time in this study might not be the most suitable and more suitable incubation time could be investigated in the future 4 conclusions long term addition of tcs could cause the transformation of pd process to complete denitrification process in the granule based pd sbr granular sludge could resist tcs toxicity by secreting more eps and tcs removal efficiency achieved 54 28 at the end of 3 mg l tcs in addition tcs resistance mechanism of granule based pd system shifted from multidrug efflux pump initial stage to antibiotic target alteration final stage during the tcs loading period dna sip assay indicated that thauera could contribute to nitrite accumulation and tcs degradation simultaneously this study

16372,ozonation is nowadays a widely used method in drinking water treatment for disinfection and pollutant control however transformation products of ozonation can be more toxic than their parent compounds therefore the knowledge of the reaction mechanisms and product formation is essential for a safe application different analytical methods such as high resolution mass spectrometry hrms and compound specific isotope analysis csia can be applied to elucidate products and primary attack positions of oxidation agents such as ozone during the investigation of the ozonation of phenolic compounds in water by csia a reaction rate depending carbon isotope fractionation was observed the fractionation strongly depends on the phenol speciation with decreasing ph values and reaction rates 105 m 1 s 1 the isotope enrichment factor ε increases ε is between 5 2 and 1 0 for faster reactions 105 m 1 s 1 the carbon isotope enrichment was not significant anymore ε is between 1 0 and 0 based on these data a concept to correlate isotope enrichment factors with kinetic data for aromatic compounds is proposed the additional investigation of aliphatic double and triple bonds did not fit this correlation suggesting different rate limiting steps however double and triple bond showed a similar enrichment factor which implies the same rate limiting step in the reaction with ozone the monodentate addition of ozone image graphical abstract keywords isotope effect oxidation ozonation phenol reaction rate constant kinetic 1 introduction ozone o3 is a strong oxidant which reacts rapidly with electron rich moieties such as activated alkenes amines and aromatic rings von gunten 2003 these moieties are commonly present in dissolved organic matter dom and trace organic compounds trocs tentscher et al 2018 however full mineralization of trocs is seldomly achieved thus the formation of transformation by products tps is an essential issue in the application of o3 for disinfection and abatement of trocs von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in many cases tps are more biodegradable and less toxic than their parent compound but in some cases they are even more toxic and environmentally harmful hübner et al 2015 knoop et al 2018 a prominent case in point is the formation of nitrosamines in ozone applied wastewater treatment von gunten 2018 due to these possible adverse effects of ozonation in depth knowledge of the involved processes and reaction mechanism especially about the formation of tps is mandatory in many cases this cannot be done by product studies alone because on the one hand different reaction mechanisms may form the same tps and on the other hand possible isobaric tps cannot be distinguished or verified schmidt and jochmann 2012 in such cases compound specific isotope analysis csia can be applied as a complementary tool the measurement of isotopic fractionation of trocs can give insights into the reaction mechanisms as it allows distinguishing between different degradation processes of trocs elsner 2010 hunkeler et al 2008 maier et al 2016 when using csia the natural abundance isotope ratio of compounds is measured during the course of a degradation reaction the isotopic value changes and thus an isotopic fractionation can be observed it has to be noted that during a reaction the electronic structure of the molecule and the potential energy surfaces will not change and only the rate of the reaction is affected such an isotopic fractionation has its origin in different bond dissociation energies of the heavy and light isotopologues involved this difference in isotopologue energy results in differing reaction rates which is called a kinetic isotope effect kie for small molecules in which all isotopes are located in the same reactive position the isotopic fractionation in terms of a fractionation factor αkin is directly related to the kie by eq 1 eq 1 α l k h k 1 k i e where l k is the reaction rate constant of the light isotope and h k that of the heavy respectively in cases in which non reacting positions and intramolecular competition have to be taken into account it is possible to estimate kie from kinetic isotopic fractionation factors in terms of apparent kinetic isotope effects akie if l k h k 1 we talk about a normal isotope effect and in case of l k h k 1 the isotope effect is inverse in case of a carbon normal isotope effect the lighter isotope e g 12c reacts faster than the heavier isotope e g 13c consequently the ratio of 13c to 12c in the remaining compound fraction increases as the reaction proceeds elsner et al 2005 hence csia is a tool that allows fostering the fundamental understanding of reaction mechanisms which is important for predicting tps a case in point is the reaction of sulfamethoxazole smx with o3 o3 can attack smx either at the aromatic ring or at the anilinic nitrogen products of these reactions would have the same exact masses and are difficult to distinguish by high resolution mass spectrometry however by using csia it could be shown that at ph 8 o3 presumably attacks at the nitrogen since no c isotopic fractionation was observed additionally there was a change in the mechanism at ph 3 as indicated by a significant c isotopic fractionation willach et al 2017 furthermore maier et al 2014 investigated the oxidation of diclofenac by different model systems o3 can attack diclofenac at the secondary amine or the aromatic ring they determined for ozonation an inverse nitrogen isotope fractionation and no significant isotope fractionation of carbon although they found products for the attack at the aromatic ring i e diclofenac 2 5 iminoquinone the inverse nitrogen isotope fractionation confirmed the attack at the aromatic ring maier et al 2014 smx and diclofenac are compounds with more than one reactive position which results in a complex system another study of willach et al 2020 investigated the ozonation of smaller compounds benzene derivatives which have only the aromatic ring as the point of attack for benzene and some of its derivatives an enrichment of the heavy carbon isotope in the reactions with o3 was found these results show that the reaction of aromatic compounds with o3 may result in carbon isotopic fractionation willach et al 2020 in the present study we used phenols as well investigated probe compounds representing dom dom in a typical concentration of 10 mg l 1 contains phenolic moieties at between 10 and 13 µm which leads to these moieties being the main reaction partners of o3 in water treatment tentscher et al 2018 additionally phenolic moieties are part of many trocs in natural water and wastewater effluents but the concentration is typically much lower than in dom tentscher et al 2018 von gunten 2018 the reaction of phenol with o3 involves only carbon atoms it has been investigated by many studies and a reaction mechanism has been postulated mvula and von sonntag 2003 ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 the mechanism is described in supporting information si in text s1 o3 reacts fast with the deprotonated phenol referred as phenolate below k phenolate 1 4 109 m 1 s 1

in table s4 in si tert buoh was added in all experiments to scavenge 95 of the oh radicals which may be formed in the reaction of the phenols with o3 since in this study the focus is on the direct

lighter isotopes r r of the compounds was compared to the r of the international reference material vpdb and resulted in the delta value δ13c eq 2 schmidt and jochmann 2012 eq 2 δ 13 c r p h e n o l r v p d b r v p d b using the rayleigh equation eq 3 the enrichment factor ε is calculated schmidt and jochmann 2012 eq 3 ln 1 δ 13 c 1 δ 13 c 0 ε ln c c 0 with δ13c0 as the delta value of phenols without adding o3 and c as the concentration of phenols c0 without o3 dosage here ε is determined as the slope of a rayleigh plot and as usual expressed in permil figs s9 s12 in si the uncertainty of ε is the 95 confidence interval of the slope in this study the enrichment factor is used and not the apparent kinetic isotope effect akie for the akie the point of attack and the number of similar reactive positions were necessary willach et al 2020 this information is not clear for the reaction of ozone with phenols 3 results and discussion the reported reaction mechanism of o3 with phenol by mvula and von sonntag 2003 shows that o3 reacts with carbon atoms of the aromatic ring preferring the addition reaction at the para or ortho position therefore a significant isotopic effect of carbon was expected to determine this isotopic effect for phenol three different approaches were investigated two of them used an established method based on a comparison of isotope labeled phenol with unlabeled phenol the natural isotope abundance of 13c is 1 1 so the enrichment effect of 13c is in a very small range therefore a completely labeled phenol was used to ensure that the heavy 13c is present at the reaction site which increases the measured effect isotope labeling approaches are commonly used for the investigation of reaction mechanisms and pathways which need standard analytical equipment gc ms and lc uv for example it has been used successfully for the investigation of persulfate based oxidation of cyclohexane in the third approach the natural isotope abundance was determined by csia which requires the use of an irms the first approach was the determination of the reaction rate constant of phenol 13c6 and unlabeled phenol by competition kinetics as a competitor meph was used because of having a comparable reaction rate constant k obs meph o3 1 6 106 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 tentscher et al 2018 the determined reaction rate constants are shown in fig 1 a however the difference between the mean values of triplicates was not significant the deviation of triplicates of the determined reaction rate constants ranged from 0 22 to 12 consequently with this approach the determination of isotopic fractionation is not possible second a direct comparison of unlabeled phenol with phenol 13c6 was done where both compounds were degraded with o3 in the same sample it was expected that the lighter phenol unlabeled phenol would be faster degraded than the heavier phenol phenol 13c6 however the difference again was not significant fig 1b black squares ph 7 hence both phenols reacted at the same nominal rate with o3 slope of 1 00 0 03 this can be explained by the high reaction rate of the phenolate species which is close to the diffusion controlled limit the reaction rate constant of phenol is slower than the phenolate and it is conceivable that an isotope effect may be more pronounced therefore the same approach was performed at a ph of 2 0 0 1 at this ph only phenol reacted with o3 however the slope was 0 98 0 10 fig 1 gray triangles ph 2 so the isotope fractionation could not be discerned by this approach too in conclusion with standard analytical equipment and methods the determination of the isotopic fractionation of the ozonation of phenols was not possible the third approach used csia to determine the change of the isotopic ratio to this end all further experiments were analyzed by gc irms phenol and olefins or lc irms substituted phenols in fig 2 left the change of δ13c at different o3 dosages at a range of ph values for unsubstituted phenol is shown for ph 7 2 and 10 3 no significant change of δ13c of phenol with o3 was detectable δδ13c 0 5 turnover of phenol was 60 which shows that the degradation happened fig s13 in si with decreasing ph the change of δ13c becomes more pronounced ph 2 3 δδ13c 6 7 normal isotope effect the calculated ε values for all ph values are shown in fig 2 right with decreasing ph the absolute value of ε increases these results suggest that ozonation of the two phenol species involves different isotopic enrichment and therefore different rate limiting steps in their reaction mechanism could be possible i e phenol has an ε of about 5 2 0 3 while phenolate has no significant ε this difference can be explained by the different reaction kinetics of the two species phenol reacts with a reaction rate of about 1 3 104 m 1 s 1 while phenolate has a rate close to the diffusion limit 109 m 1 s 1 mvula and von sonntag 2003 hence in the case of phenolate any kinetic discrimination of heavy isotope bearing molecules becomes insignificant a similar effect was reported by joe wong and maher 2020 they showed that a faster redox reaction i e electron transfer induces less kinetic isotope fractionation joe wong and maher 2020 however in the case of phenol ε was significant since k is way below the diffusion controlled reaction rate the lower the ph the higher the fraction of phenol that is involved in o3 reactions at ph 7 2 more than 99 of o3 react with phenolate fo3 phenolate 0 99 but at ph 2 3 97 of o3 react with phenol fo3 phenolate 0 03 at the reactivity pk a 3 87 fo3 phenolate is 0 50 and indeed the ε is the average of the two species ε 2 6 with this approach a model calculation is possible and ε for each ph could be calculated εobs eq 4 eq 4 ε o b s 1 1 10 r p k a 10 p h ε a h 1 1 1 10 r p k a 10 p h ε a with εah as the ε of the protonated species and εa as the ε of the deprotonated species additionally rpk a represents the reactivity pk a of the substance with o3 the dashed curve in fig 2 right was calculated by applying eq 4 for phenol and is very similar to the red curve indicating the fraction of o3 reacting with phenolate these results suggest that the faster a reaction of o3 becomes the less pronounced is the isotopic fractionation additionally substituents on the aromatic ring of phenol change the electron density of the ring electron withdrawing substituents e g cl decrease the electron density of the ring and result in a lower reaction rate constant with o3 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 on the contrary electron donating substituents e g ch3 or och3 increase the electron density and activate the ring resulting in a higher reaction rate constant with o3 hoigné and bader 1983 consequently the reaction rate constants of the protonated species with o3 increase in the order cph phenol meph and mxph k cph o3 6 102 m 1 s 1 k phenol o3 1 3 103 m 1 s 1 k meph o3 3 104 m 1 s k mxph o3 4 7 105 m 1 s 1 tentscher

were estimated with quantum chemical calculations the latter are marked with an asterisk above all determined 13c enrichment factors plotted vs the observed reaction rate constants k obs for the investigated phenols and further data from other studies maier et al 2016 willach et al 2017 willach et al 2020 on ozonation of aromatic rings are collectively shown in fig 3 in fig 3 reaction rate constants can be organized in three groups which are highlighted with the colors green orange and red the green color marks a group of reaction rate constants which hardly show a correlation of reaction kinetics vs enrichment factor this zone comprises compounds with reaction rate constants lower than 103 m 1 s 1 which also exhibit the highest isotope enrichment amongst the investigated compounds divergent is only anisole and phenol at ph 2 3 with reaction kinetics in the range of 103 105 m 1 s 1 orange group the isotope fractionation decreases with increasing reaction rate constant reactions of aromatic compounds with ozone with reaction rate constants faster than 105 m 1 s 1 do not display a significant enrichment of 13c in the remaining compound anymore red group the concept developed above correlating ε and reaction kinetics in ozone reactions is well supported by the compiled data from literature shown in fig 3 benzene and its derivates have reaction rate constants lower than 103 m 1 s 1 and a similar enrichment factor 4 6 3 7 willach et al 2020 smx reacts faster with o3 4 8 104 m 1 s 1 at ph 3 and shows a smaller enrichment of 13c 2 2 0 1 willach et al 2017 in the case of diclofenac no significant 13c enrichment was determined because the reaction rate constant with o3 is higher than 105 m 1 s 1 6 8 105 m 1 s 1 which explains the finding in the study of maier et al 2016 3 buten 2 ol and 3 butyn 2 ol c c double and triple bond react in the same order of magnitude with o3 104 m 1 s 1 and also have the same enrichment factor ε 3 buten 2 ol 5 9 0 5 ε 3 butyn 2 ol 5 9 0 4 these values do not fit into the concept shown above although the reaction rate constant is higher than 103 m 1 s 1 the enrichment factor is more negative than for the protonated phenol 5 2 0 3 these results can be explained with the differentreaction mechanism of aromatic and olefinic compounds that is o3 reacts with olefinic compounds via the criegee mechanism while aromatic compounds may also react via oxygen transfer and electron transfer however this point surely needs a more thorough investigation on the other hand the same enrichment factor for 3 buten 2 ol and 3 butyn 2 ol implies the same rate limiting step in the reaction with o3 for 3 buten 2 ol monodentate addition of o3 to the double bond has been shown dowideit and von sonntag 1998 for 3 butyn 2 ol no experimental evidence is yet available but a quantum mechanical calculation suggested the same reaction mechanism cremer et al 2001 this is consistent with the here presented data on isotope enrichment in the rate limiting step 4 conclusions the enrichment factor of the reaction of phenols with o3 depends on the ph value and therefore on their speciation this result underlines the importance of ph for oxidative transformation of trocs at the current point it is impossible to disentangle with the shown data if with the shifting speciation a change in reaction mechanism occurs the enrichment factor can be correlated with the ratio of reaction rate constants for the two species e g phenolate reacts six orders of magnitude faster than phenol the faster a reaction of o3 is the less pronounced the isotopic fractionation becomes in this study a limit of reaction rate constant for determination of isotopic fractionation of aromatic compound was observed at about 105 m 1 s 1 above this limit the difference between the reaction of o3 with the heavy isotope and the light isotope cannot be measured by the presented approach at rate constants below 103 m 1s 1 a distinct but rather constant isotope enrichment factor was observed overall this information could be used to test experimentally determined rate constants for plausibility furthermore following the work of willach et al 2020 stable isotope analysis may also be used to test for the relevance of direct ozonation vs oh radical based reactions since the latter do not show a measureable isotope fractionation in the reaction with aromatic compounds willach et al 2020 this differentiation is of the utmost importance in the investigation and use of oxidative processes commonly used in water treatment however to reinforce the introduced concept further studies of the reaction of o3 with a larger set of aromatic model compounds are necessary these studies should also include stable isotope analysis of other elements than carbon in a dual isotope approach that may allow further mechanistic insights into this important reaction in water treatment supporting information available additional information

16372,ozonation is nowadays a widely used method in drinking water treatment for disinfection and pollutant control however transformation products of ozonation can be more toxic than their parent compounds therefore the knowledge of the reaction mechanisms and product formation is essential for a safe application different analytical methods such as high resolution mass spectrometry hrms and compound specific isotope analysis csia can be applied to elucidate products and primary attack positions of oxidation agents such as ozone during the investigation of the ozonation of phenolic compounds in water by csia a reaction rate depending carbon isotope fractionation was observed the fractionation strongly depends on the phenol speciation with decreasing ph values and reaction rates 105 m 1 s 1 the isotope enrichment factor ε increases ε is between 5 2 and 1 0 for faster reactions 105 m 1 s 1 the carbon isotope enrichment was not significant anymore ε is between 1 0 and 0 based on these data a concept to correlate isotope enrichment factors with kinetic data for aromatic compounds is proposed the additional investigation of aliphatic double and triple bonds did not fit this correlation suggesting different rate limiting steps however double and triple bond showed a similar enrichment factor which implies the same rate limiting step in the reaction with ozone the monodentate addition of ozone image graphical abstract keywords isotope effect oxidation ozonation phenol reaction rate constant kinetic 1 introduction ozone o3 is a strong oxidant which reacts rapidly with electron rich moieties such as activated alkenes amines and aromatic rings von gunten 2003 these moieties are commonly present in dissolved organic matter dom and trace organic compounds trocs tentscher et al 2018 however full mineralization of trocs is seldomly achieved thus the formation of transformation by products tps is an essential issue in the application of o3 for disinfection and abatement of trocs von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in many cases tps are more biodegradable and less toxic than their parent compound but in some cases they are even more toxic and environmentally harmful hübner et al 2015 knoop et al 2018 a prominent case in point is the formation of nitrosamines in ozone applied wastewater treatment von gunten 2018 due to these possible adverse effects of ozonation in depth knowledge of the involved processes and reaction mechanism especially about the formation of tps is mandatory in many cases this cannot be done by product studies alone because on the one hand different reaction mechanisms may form the same tps and on the other hand possible isobaric tps cannot be distinguished or verified schmidt and jochmann 2012 in such cases compound specific isotope analysis csia can be applied as a complementary tool the measurement of isotopic fractionation of trocs can give insights into the reaction mechanisms as it allows distinguishing between different degradation processes of trocs elsner 2010 hunkeler et al 2008 maier et al 2016 when using csia the natural abundance isotope ratio of compounds is measured during the course of a degradation reaction the isotopic value changes and thus an isotopic fractionation can be observed it has to be noted that during a reaction the electronic structure of the molecule and the potential energy surfaces will not change and only the rate of the reaction is affected such an isotopic fractionation has its origin in different bond dissociation energies of the heavy and light isotopologues involved this difference in isotopologue energy results in differing reaction rates which is called a kinetic isotope effect kie for small molecules in which all isotopes are located in the same reactive position the isotopic fractionation in terms of a fractionation factor αkin is directly related to the kie by eq 1 eq 1 α l k h k 1 k i e where l k is the reaction rate constant of the light isotope and h k that of the heavy respectively in cases in which non reacting positions and intramolecular competition have to be taken into account it is possible to estimate kie from kinetic isotopic fractionation factors in terms of apparent kinetic isotope effects akie if l k h k 1 we talk about a normal isotope effect and in case of l k h k 1 the isotope effect is inverse in case of a carbon normal isotope effect the lighter isotope e g 12c reacts faster than the heavier isotope e g 13c consequently the ratio of 13c to 12c in the remaining compound fraction increases as the reaction proceeds elsner et al 2005 hence csia is a tool that allows fostering the fundamental understanding of reaction mechanisms which is important for predicting tps a case in point is the reaction of sulfamethoxazole smx with o3 o3 can attack smx either at the aromatic ring or at the anilinic nitrogen products of these reactions would have the same exact masses and are difficult to distinguish by high resolution mass spectrometry however by using csia it could be shown that at ph 8 o3 presumably attacks at the nitrogen since no c isotopic fractionation was observed additionally there was a change in the mechanism at ph 3 as indicated by a significant c isotopic fractionation willach et al 2017 furthermore maier et al 2014 investigated the oxidation of diclofenac by different model systems o3 can attack diclofenac at the secondary amine or the aromatic ring they determined for ozonation an inverse nitrogen isotope fractionation and no significant isotope fractionation of carbon although they found products for the attack at the aromatic ring i e diclofenac 2 5 iminoquinone the inverse nitrogen isotope fractionation confirmed the attack at the aromatic ring maier et al 2014 smx and diclofenac are compounds with more than one reactive position which results in a complex system another study of willach et al 2020 investigated the ozonation of smaller compounds benzene derivatives which have only the aromatic ring as the point of attack for benzene and some of its derivatives an enrichment of the heavy carbon isotope in the reactions with o3 was found these results show that the reaction of aromatic compounds with o3 may result in carbon isotopic fractionation willach et al 2020 in the present study we used phenols as well investigated probe compounds representing dom dom in a typical concentration of 10 mg l 1 contains phenolic moieties at between 10 and 13 µm which leads to these moieties being the main reaction partners of o3 in water treatment tentscher et al 2018 additionally phenolic moieties are part of many trocs in natural water and wastewater effluents but the concentration is typically much lower than in dom tentscher et al 2018 von gunten 2018 the reaction of phenol with o3 involves only carbon atoms it has been investigated by many studies and a reaction mechanism has been postulated mvula and von sonntag 2003 ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 the mechanism is described in supporting information si in text s1 o3 reacts fast with the deprotonated phenol referred as phenolate below k phenolate 1 4 109 m 1 s 1 mvula and von sonntag 2003 and moderately with protonated phenol referred as phenol below k phenol 1 3 104 m 1 s 1 mvula and von sonntag 2003 which results in a reaction with phenolate at a normal ph for drinking water treatment 7 5 the aim of this study was to demonstrate for the first time as a proof of concept the correlation of ozone reaction kinetics with the extent of observed isotope

adjusted for different ph values and in the case of phenols tert butanol tert buoh which were placed in a 20 ml headspace vial at room temperature the initial concentrations of the compounds are shown in table s4 in si tert buoh was added in all experiments to scavenge 95 of the oh radicals which may be formed in the reaction of the phenols with o3 since in this study the focus is on the direct reaction of o3 with phenols the concentration of tert buoh is shown in table s5 and was calculated by eq s1 in si only the experiments for 3 buten 2 ol and 3 butyn 2 ol were performed in the absence of the radical scavenger at ph 2 00 0 05 at this ph the reaction of o3 with h2o2 which can be formed in the reaction of o3 with olefins and is the precursor for oh radicals is slow k obs h2o2 o3 1 09

with o3 than phenol k o3 phenol 1 3 103 m 1 s 1 the fractions of species are shown in fig s2 in si von gunten 2003 for that reason the experiments for phenol were performed at ph 2 3 3 2 4 1 4 9 6 0 7 2 and 10 2 the fraction of o3 which reacts with the phenols depends on the pk a values and the species specific reaction rate constants these values for the substituted phenols are shown in figs s3 s5

2006 in brief a compound competitor which has a similar reaction rate constant as the compound under study is added to the sample to yield approximately the same concentration as the compound under study after the reaction with a substoichiometric concentration of o3 the concentration ratio of the two compounds is determined this ratio is multiplied by the know reaction rate constant of the

lighter isotopes r r of the compounds was compared to the r of the international reference material vpdb and resulted in the delta value δ13c eq 2 schmidt and jochmann 2012 eq 2 δ 13 c r p h e n o l r v p d b r v p d b using the rayleigh equation eq 3 the enrichment factor ε is calculated schmidt and jochmann 2012 eq 3 ln 1 δ 13 c 1 δ 13 c 0 ε ln c c 0 with δ13c0 as the delta value of phenols without adding o3 and c as the concentration of phenols c0 without o3 dosage here ε is determined as the slope of a rayleigh plot and as usual expressed in permil figs s9 s12 in si the uncertainty of ε is the 95 confidence interval of the slope in this study the enrichment factor is used and not the apparent kinetic isotope effect akie for the akie the point of attack and the number of similar reactive positions were necessary willach et al 2020 this information is not clear for the reaction of ozone with phenols 3 results and discussion the reported reaction mechanism of o3 with phenol by mvula and von sonntag 2003 shows that o3 reacts with carbon atoms of the aromatic ring preferring the addition reaction at the para or ortho position therefore a significant isotopic effect of carbon was expected to determine this isotopic effect for phenol three different approaches were investigated two of them used an established method based on a comparison of isotope labeled phenol with unlabeled phenol the natural isotope abundance of 13c is 1 1 so the enrichment effect of 13c is in a very small range therefore a completely labeled phenol was used to ensure that the heavy 13c is present at the reaction site which increases the measured effect isotope labeling approaches are commonly used for the investigation of reaction mechanisms and pathways which need standard analytical equipment gc ms and lc uv for example it has been used successfully for the investigation of persulfate based oxidation of cyclohexane in the third approach the natural isotope abundance was determined by csia which requires the use of an irms the first approach was the determination of the reaction rate constant of phenol 13c6 and unlabeled phenol by competition kinetics as a competitor meph was used because of having a comparable reaction rate constant k obs meph o3 1 6 106 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 tentscher et al 2018 the determined reaction rate constants are shown in fig 1 a however the difference between the mean values of triplicates was not significant the deviation of triplicates of the determined reaction rate constants ranged from 0 22 to 12 consequently with this approach the determination of isotopic fractionation is not possible second a direct comparison of unlabeled phenol with phenol 13c6 was done where both compounds were degraded with o3 in the same sample it was expected that the lighter phenol unlabeled phenol would be faster degraded than the heavier phenol phenol 13c6 however the difference again was not significant fig 1b black squares ph 7 hence both phenols reacted at the same nominal rate with o3 slope of 1 00 0 03 this can be explained by the high reaction rate of the phenolate species which is close to the diffusion controlled limit the reaction rate constant of phenol is slower than the phenolate and it is conceivable that an isotope effect may be more pronounced therefore the same approach was performed at a ph of 2 0 0 1 at this ph only phenol reacted with o3 however the slope was 0 98 0 10 fig 1 gray triangles ph 2 so the isotope fractionation could not be discerned by this approach too in conclusion with standard analytical equipment and methods the determination of the isotopic fractionation of the ozonation of phenols was not possible the third approach used csia to determine the change of the isotopic ratio to this end all further experiments were analyzed by gc irms phenol and olefins or lc irms substituted phenols in fig 2 left the change of δ13c at different o3 dosages at a range of ph values for unsubstituted phenol is shown for ph 7 2 and 10 3 no significant change of δ13c of phenol with o3 was detectable δδ13c 0 5 turnover of phenol was 60 which shows that the degradation happened fig s13 in si with decreasing ph the change of δ13c becomes more pronounced ph 2 3 δδ13c 6 7 normal isotope effect the calculated ε values for all ph values are shown in fig 2 right with decreasing ph the absolute value of ε increases these results suggest that ozonation of the two phenol species involves different isotopic enrichment and therefore different rate limiting steps in their reaction mechanism could be possible i e phenol has an ε of about 5 2 0 3 while phenolate has no significant ε this difference can be explained by the different reaction kinetics of the two species phenol reacts with a reaction rate of about 1 3 104 m 1 s 1 while phenolate has a rate close to the diffusion limit 109 m 1 s 1 mvula and von sonntag 2003 hence in the case of phenolate any kinetic discrimination of heavy isotope bearing molecules becomes insignificant a similar effect was reported by joe wong and maher 2020 they showed that a faster redox reaction i e electron transfer induces less kinetic isotope fractionation joe wong and maher 2020 however in the case of phenol ε was significant since k is way below the diffusion controlled reaction rate the lower the ph the higher the fraction of phenol that is involved in o3 reactions at ph 7 2 more than 99 of o3 react with phenolate fo3 phenolate 0 99 but at ph 2 3 97 of o3 react with phenol fo3 phenolate 0 03 at the reactivity pk a 3 87 fo3 phenolate is 0 50 and indeed the ε is the average of the two species ε 2 6 with this approach a model calculation is possible and ε for each ph could be calculated εobs eq 4 eq 4 ε o b s 1 1 10 r p k a 10 p h ε a h 1 1 1 10 r p k a 10 p h ε a with εah as the ε of the protonated species and εa as the ε of the deprotonated species additionally rpk a represents the reactivity pk a of the substance with o3 the dashed curve in fig 2 right was calculated by applying eq 4 for phenol and is very similar to the red curve indicating the fraction of o3 reacting with phenolate these results suggest that the faster a reaction of o3 becomes the less pronounced is the isotopic fractionation additionally substituents on the aromatic ring of phenol change the electron density of the ring electron withdrawing substituents e g cl decrease the electron density of the ring and result in a lower reaction rate constant with o3 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 on the contrary electron donating substituents e g ch3 or och3 increase the electron density and activate the ring resulting in a higher reaction rate constant with o3 hoigné and bader 1983 consequently the reaction rate constants of the protonated species with o3 increase in the order cph phenol meph and mxph k cph o3 6 102 m 1 s 1 k phenol o3 1 3 103 m 1 s 1 k meph o3 3 104 m 1 s k mxph o3 4 7 105 m 1 s 1 tentscher et al 2018 the deprotonated species of the four compounds react all very fast with o3 and the difference among the four compounds becomes much smaller than for the protonated species k cph o3 6 108 m

were estimated with quantum chemical calculations the latter are marked with an asterisk above all determined 13c enrichment factors plotted vs the observed reaction rate constants k obs for the investigated phenols and further data from other studies maier et al 2016 willach et al 2017 willach et al 2020 on ozonation of aromatic rings are collectively shown in fig 3 in fig 3 reaction rate constants can be organized in three groups which are highlighted with the colors green orange and red the green color marks a group of reaction rate constants which hardly show a correlation of reaction kinetics vs enrichment factor this zone comprises compounds with reaction rate constants lower than 103 m 1 s 1 which also exhibit the highest isotope enrichment amongst the investigated compounds divergent is only anisole and phenol at ph 2 3 with reaction kinetics in the range of 103 105 m 1 s 1 orange group the isotope fractionation decreases with increasing reaction rate constant reactions of aromatic compounds with ozone with reaction rate constants faster than 105 m 1 s 1 do not display a significant enrichment of 13c in the remaining compound anymore red group the concept developed above correlating ε and reaction kinetics in ozone reactions is well supported by the compiled data from literature shown in fig 3 benzene and its derivates have reaction rate constants lower than 103 m 1 s 1 and a similar enrichment factor 4 6 3 7 willach et al 2020 smx reacts faster with o3 4 8 104 m 1 s 1 at ph 3 and shows a smaller enrichment of 13c 2 2 0 1 willach et al 2017 in the case of diclofenac no significant 13c enrichment was determined because the reaction rate constant with o3 is higher than 105 m 1 s 1 6 8 105 m 1 s 1 which explains the finding in the study of maier et al 2016 3 buten 2 ol and 3 butyn 2 ol c c double and triple bond react in the same order of magnitude with o3 104 m 1 s 1 and also have the same enrichment factor ε 3 buten 2 ol 5 9 0 5 ε 3 butyn 2 ol 5 9 0 4 these values do not fit into the concept shown above although the reaction rate constant is higher than 103 m 1 s 1 the enrichment factor is more negative than for the protonated phenol 5 2 0 3 these results can be explained with the differentreaction mechanism of aromatic and olefinic compounds that is o3 reacts with olefinic compounds via the criegee mechanism while aromatic compounds may also react via oxygen transfer and electron transfer however this point surely needs a more thorough investigation on the other hand the same enrichment factor for 3 buten 2 ol and 3 butyn 2 ol implies the same rate limiting step in the reaction with o3 for 3 buten 2 ol monodentate addition of o3 to the double bond has been shown dowideit and von sonntag 1998 for 3 butyn 2 ol no experimental evidence is yet available but a quantum mechanical calculation suggested the same reaction mechanism cremer et al 2001 this is consistent with the here presented data on isotope enrichment in the rate limiting step 4 conclusions the enrichment factor of the reaction of phenols with o3 depends on the ph value and therefore on their speciation this result underlines the importance of ph for oxidative transformation of trocs at the current point it is impossible to disentangle with the shown data if with the shifting speciation a change in reaction mechanism occurs the enrichment factor can be correlated with the ratio of reaction rate constants for the two species e g phenolate reacts six orders of magnitude faster than phenol the faster a reaction of o3 is the less pronounced the isotopic fractionation becomes in this study a limit of reaction rate constant for determination of isotopic fractionation of aromatic compound was observed at about 105 m 1 s 1 above this limit the difference between the reaction of o3 with the heavy isotope and the light isotope cannot be measured by the presented approach at rate constants below 103 m 1s 1 a distinct but rather constant isotope enrichment factor was observed overall this information could be used to test experimentally determined rate constants for plausibility furthermore following the work of willach et al 2020 stable isotope analysis may also be used to test for the relevance of direct ozonation vs oh radical based reactions since the latter do not show a measureable isotope fractionation in the reaction with aromatic compounds willach et al 2020 this differentiation is of the utmost importance in the investigation and use of oxidative processes commonly used in water treatment however to reinforce the introduced concept further studies of the reaction of o3 with a larger set of aromatic model compounds are necessary these studies should also include stable isotope analysis of other elements than carbon in a dual isotope approach that may allow further mechanistic insights into this important reaction in water treatment supporting information available additional information

16373,in this study the simultaneous removal mechanism of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args was investigated using the novel ultraviolet peracetic acid uv paa combination disinfection process and conventional disinfection processes were also applied for comparison the results showed that uv paa disinfection with a high uv dosage uv paa h was most effective for the removal of tetracyclines quinolones macrolides and β lactams their average removal efficiencies ranged from 25 7 to 100 while naclo disinfection was effective for the removal of sulfonamides 81 6 the majority of args were well removed after the uv paa h disinfection while specific genes including tetb tetc erma and bla tem significantly increased after naclo disinfection in addition β lactam resistance genes 35 9 and macrolides resistance genes 12 0 remarkably augmented after uv naclo disinfection the highly reactive oxidation species generated from uv paa process including hydroxyl radicals oh and carbon centered organic radicals r c were responsible for the elimination of antibiotics and args correlation analysis showed that tetracycline sulfonamide and macrolide antibiotics removal showed a positive correlation with the corresponding args and a low dose of antibiotic residues played an important role in the distribution of args metagenomic sequencing analysis showed that uv paa disinfection could not only greatly decrease the abundance of resistant bacteria but also downregulate the expression of key functional genes involved in args propagation and inhibit the signal transduction of the host bacteria underlying that its removal mechanism was quite different from that of naclo based disinfection processes our study provides valuable information for understanding the simultaneous removal mechanism of antibiotics and args in wastewater during the disinfection processes especially for the novel uv paa combination process graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotics antibiotic resistance genes ultraviolet peracetic acid disinfection 1 introduction antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args have been considered emerging contaminants and their disseminations are becoming an urgent public health concern méndez et al 2017 wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been reported to be an important reservoir for antibiotics and args su et al 2017 the refractory characteristics of antibiotics resulted biological treatment are ineffective for their removal leading to their frequent detection in the secondary effluent of wwtps gao et al 2012 wang and chen 2020 reported that antibiotics could induce a large number of resistant strains and resistant genes causing args to also be widely detected in secondary effluent thus the disinfection process before discharge is thought to be critical for the removal of antibiotics and args during the wastewater treatment process among the conventional disinfection processes chlorination based processes have been widely used due to their excellent bactericidal capability and economical treatment cost antibiotics such as sulfonamides tetracyclines and macrolides have been reported to have good removal efficiencies during chlorination based disinfection processes cheng et al 2022 in addition because chlorination based processes can destroy the structural integrity of the cell surface by reacting with its components the n terminal amino acids of peptidoglycan located on the cell membranes these processes are considered as efficient methods for eliminating args dodd 2012 however the removal efficiency largely depends on the available chlorine concentration when low doses of chlorine are applied args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb can not be well eliminated guo et al 2015 correspondingly the dissemination of args is enhanced because the frequency of conjugative transfer is promoted by 2 5 fold under low chlorine conditions with an increasing chlorine concentration the removal of args increased zheng et al 2017 while undesired disinfection byproducts dbps such as haloacetic acid trihalomethane n nitrosodimethylamine etc generated during the disinfection process are also increased dou et al 2021 wang et al 2021 in addition to their safety risks dbps also facilitate the horizontal gene transfer hgt of args by altering the cell permeability of bacteria guo et al 2015 therefore chlorination based disinfection processes have certain limitations in eliminating args in wastewater parallel to chlorination based disinfection processes ultraviolet uv based disinfection processes have also been reported to have good removal efficiencies for antibiotics and args and they do not generate harmful dbps dodd 2012 yan et al 2021 zheng et al 2017 zhuang et al 2015 uv irradiation inactivates bacteria mainly by causing dna deactivation via pyrimidine dimerization and it has no measurable effect on the cell membrane dodd 2012 thus to obtain an excellent removal efficiency a very high uv dose is required zhuang et al 2015 reported that 2 48 2 74 log reductions in args were achieved when a uv dose of 12477 mj cm2 was adopted this uv dose is several hundred times that adopted in real wwtps and it is not feasible thus it is urgent to explore uv based combination processes to improve the elimination efficiency of both antibiotics and args while lowering the treatment cost and reducing the safety risk caused by dbps among the uv based combination processes uv h2o2 and uv persulfate uv ps have been widely investigated thus far michael et al 2020 sharma et al 2019 good removal efficiencies of args including sul1 sul2 tetm bla oxa a bla tem bla shv and bla kpc 3 have been achieved in these combination systems moreover sharma et al 2019 indicated that uv ps had advantages over uv h2o2 for eliminating antibiotics and args because in addition to hydroxyl radicals oh so4 also participated in the uv ps system in addition to h2o2 and ps peracetic acid paa also has a high oxidation capacity and can be used as an alternative method for wastewater disinfection recently a uv paa combination system was studied as a novel and promising method for removing emerging contaminants especially antibiotics rizzo et al 2019 wang et al 2021 yan et al 2021 besides oh carbon centered organic radicals r c with highly reactive performance are also generated in the uv paa system our previous studies indicated that higher mineralization rates of antibiotics were achieved in the uv paa system compared to other combination systems such as uv h2o2 and uv ps wang et al 2021 yan et al 2021 in addition a combination uv paa process also showed high disinfection efficiency for enteric bacteria including fecal coliforms escherichia coli and enterococcus spp hassaballah et al 2019 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 however to the best of our knowledge previous studies have mainly focused on using uv paa combination process either to enhance the inactivation of pathogens or to improve the removal of antibiotics and args have seldom been considered in this study the simultaneous removal of antibiotics and args in the secondary effluent of wwtps was thoroughly investigated during the uv paa disinfection process and conventional disinfection processes such as uv naclo and uv naclo were adopted for comparison specifically 5 classes of antibiotics including tetracyclines sulfonamides quinolones macrolides and β lactams 14 kinds and 21 kinds of corresponding args were investigated then the correlation between the removal of antibiotics and args after different disinfection processes was analyzed finally metagenomic analysis was conducted to gain insights into the simultaneous reduction mechanism of antibiotics and args including the microbial structure host bacteria differential expression of functional genes and metabolic pathways it is of great significance to fully understand the simultaneous removal mechanism of antibiotics and args in wastewater during disinfection processes especially for the novel uv paa combination process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals five classes of antibiotics

meter uv b beijing shida photoelectric technology co ltd china a detailed description of the operation of the system can be found in our previous study yan et al 2021 for the solo paa disinfection process the initial paa concentration was controlled at 8 mg l and the reaction time was 24 min for the uv paa combination system paa concentration was reduced to 4 mg l and the uv dosage was controlled at 18 mj cm2 or 108 mj cm2 by adjusting the illumination time to 1 min and 6 min which were called uv paa l and uv paa h respectively for the uv irradiation system alone the uv dosage was set at 36 mj cm2 and 216 mj cm2 by changing the exposure time from 2 min to 12 min and they are called uv l and uv h respectively in addition a relatively high naclo concentration of 15 mg l reaction time 24 min and low naclo concentration of 3 92 mg l reaction time 6 min were chosen for the solo naclo and uv naclo disinfection respectively to make a quantitative comparison the uv dosage and molar concentration of naclo and paa were controlled the same under uv paa h and uv naclo disinfection processes during the solo paa and naclo disinfection processes the uv lamp in the reactor was turned off while the other conditions were kept the same after the reaction na2s2o3 was added to the solution to terminate the reaction then the water samples were filtered through a glass fiber filter gf f

detailed information is supplied in text s2 2 8 data processing the data were analyzed by originpro 2018c originlab corporation ma usa one way analysis of variance anova was used to test the significance of the results correlations of the antibiotics and args were evaluated by spearman correlation analysis using spss ibm spss statistics 25 a p value of 0 05 was regarded as statistically significant principal component analysis pca combined with influencing factors was applied with r software microsoft version 3 3 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of antibiotics the concentrations of antibiotics in the raw secondary effluent and after different disinfection processes are shown in table 1 a total of 14 antibiotics were detected in the secondary effluent and they belong to five classes including tetracyclines sulfonamides quinolones macrolides and β lactams among the 14 detected antibiotics the concentrations of smm cln and ofl ranked in the top three in the raw secondary wastewater and they belong to sulfonamides macrolides and quinolones respectively their concentrations were 615 06 39 98 ng l 279 20 19 54 ng l and 150 86 10 56 ng l respectively these three classes of antibiotics are widely used in china in addition to being used to treat human and animal diseases they are also used as a feed supplement at low concentrations to promote the growth of livestock dou et al 2021 due to the refractory characteristics of these antibiotics they could not be well degraded during the biological treatment processes in wwtps resulting in high residuals in the final secondary wastewater in contrast to other classes tetracyclines in the influent of this wwtp were very low and their concentrations in the secondary effluent only ranged from 0 15 0 01 ng l to 1 10 0 08 ng l conventional disinfection processes such as uv naclo and uv naclo were effective for removing tetracyclines these results are consistent with ao et al s study 2021 which also found that tetracyclines could be well removed during conventional disinfection processes however the removal efficiencies of tetracyclines by conventional disinfection processes were much lower than those of novel uv paa combination processes the tetracyclines detected including tch ctc and dch could be completely removed after uv paa while only 69 5 72 5 and 87 9 of tetracyclines were removed after uv l naclo and uv naclo disinfection fig 1 the uv dose naclo concentration and uv naclo concentration used in this study were similar to the actual doses or concentrations used in wwtps the removal of quinolones by different disinfection processes was similar to that of tetracyclines uv paa had a significant advantage in removing quinolones in contrast to conventional disinfection processes and solo paa disinfection their average removal efficiencies ranged from 57 2 to 70 3 after uv naclo and uv naclo disinfection and only 31 5 of quinolones were removed after solo paa disinfection during the solo uv and paa disinfection direct uv photolysis and paa oxidation mainly contributed to the degradation of antibiotics yan et al 2021 reported that uv photolysis was selective for the removal of antibiotics suggesting that the removal efficiencies ranged a lot among different antibiotics in addition ao et al 2021 and chen et al 2021 implied that the oxidation capacity of paa itself was limited if it was not effectively activated and this resulted in poor removal efficiency of refractory quinolones during the solo paa disinfection when paa was activated by uv irradiation a notable increase in removal efficiency was achieved and 69 7 and 93 9 of quinolones were removed after uv paa l and uv paa h disinfection respectively it was due to that the large amounts of reactive oxidation radicals formed in the uv paa combination system and the results were confirmed by epr with spin trap of dmpo fig s2 a in addition to oh ch3 was also detected in the uv paa combination system moreover the peak intensities of oh and ch3 were stronger in the uv paa h system than in the uv paa l system as dmpo is a relatively weak spin trap and to provide more convincing evidence for reactive radicals the advanced spin trap of dippmpo was used during the uv paa h disinfection fig s2 b the simulation based fitting of spectra of reactive radicals was confirmed through analysis of the hyperfine splittings from phosphors αp nitrogen αn and protons αh the simulation based fitting of spectra confirmed that besides oh and ch3 ch3oo and ch3coo also appeared during uv paa h disinfection eqs 1 3 table s3 the highly reactive radicals generated during uv paa combination disinfection resulted in higher removal efficiencies of antibiotics especially at higher uv activation conditions uv paa h in addition the selective of uv photolysis also appeared for β lactams removal their average removal efficiencies were only 3 8 and 36 8 under uv l and uv h disinfection respectively although their average removal efficiencies increased after naclo and uv naclo disinfection to 69 0 and 75 9 respectively compared to solo uv disinfection their removal efficiencies were still much lower than under uv paa h conditions 95 6 additionally the overall removal efficiencies of macrolides were low regardless of whether conventional disinfection processes were applied or the novel uv paa combination process was applied between 3 2 and 25 7 due to their refractory characteristics yan et al 2021 however the highest removal efficiency of macrolides was achieved under uv paa h disinfection conditions 25 7 1 c h 3 c o o o h h v c h 3 c o o o h 2 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o 2 3 c h 3 o 2 c h 3 o o therefore the novel uv paa combination process especially under uv paa h conditions was more effective for removing four classes of antibiotics except sulfonamides than conventional disinfection processes for sulfonamides best removal efficiency was achieved after naclo disinfection 81 6 their average removal efficiencies after uv l uv h paa uv paa l uv paa h and uv naclo disinfection were 1 9 7 8 6 3 14 2 35 8 and 43 7 respectively chamberlain and adams 2006 also reported that sulfonamides were prone to be oxidized by chlorination based oxidation systems however it largely depends on the available chlorine concentration during the solo naclo disinfection relative high concentration of naclo was adopted 15 mg l while its concentration was reduced to 3 92 mg l under uv naclo disinfection in order to make a comparable comparison with uv paa h conditions when low dose of naclo was applied under uv naclo disinfection the amount of hclo generated from the hydrolysis of naclo also sharply reduced and this finally resulted in a significant decline of the removal efficiency of sulfonamides cesare et al 2016 chamberlain and adams 2006 in addition from the perspective of dbps chlorination based disinfection processes including naclo and uv naclo adopted here have great disadvantages besides conventional halogenated dbps emerging nitrosamine dbps could also be formed after chlorination based disinfection dou et al 2021 in contrast dbps formed from paa based disinfection processes are mainly some organic acids which have no significant impact on the environment therefore a uv paa combination disinfection process is a promising method not only because the majority of antibiotics could be well removed after uv paa disinfection but also because the risks caused by dbps could be significantly reduced 3 2 removal of args in addition to antibiotics args removal by different disinfection processes was also evaluated fig 2 fig 2 a shows that the majority of detected args increased after uv l and paa disinfection and the overall removal efficiencies of the args via antibiotic classes ranged from 0 6 to 30 6 and from 13 6 to 40 6 respectively fig 2 b mckinney and pruden 2012 and zhang et al 2017 suggested that disinfectants at subinhibitory concentrations such as uv at low dosages could promote the conjugation transfer of args resulting in an increase in args after disinfection in addition the higher proliferation of args after paa disinfection might be related to the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane zhang et al 2017 indicated that bacteria adapt their membrane permeability by modulating the expression of outer membrane proteins omps and they play important roles in pore formation and hgt of donor and recipient bacteria this was confirmed by omp analysis in this study and the results are shown in table 2 the relative abundances of functional genes including k03286 k05807 k06142 and k017713 were much higher after uv l and paa disinfection alone than after other disinfection processes the enhanced expression of membrane proteins plays a vital role in augmenting membrane permeability causing antibiotic resistance dissemination via the horizontal transfer of args fig 2 a also shows that after uv paa h disinfection only sul2 and tetc slightly increased and the abundances of the other args significantly decreased the average removal efficiencies of the args via antibiotic classes after uv paa h disinfection ranged from 3 2 to 38 9 which was higher than that of uv h disinfection fig 2 b in the uv paa h process large amounts of reactive oxidation species including oh ch3coo ch3oo and ch3 were generated and they destroyed the integrity of the cell structure which resulted in good removal of the majority of args table s3 cellular structures or components such as carbon carbon double bonds and thiol groups were destructed under the attack of oh and r c and the functionality of the plasmid dna was influenced zhang et al 2019 plasmids are mobile genetic elements mges and a key dna pool for hgt i e transformation transduction and conjugation once bacteria plasmids were destroyed by oh and r c the transmissions of args were hindered and this finally resulted in the good removals of args under uv paa disinfection zhang et al 2020 also indicated that multiple mechanisms are present under uv paa disinfection besides uv irradiation paa and reactive radicals a synergistic effect among all of these mechanisms could potentially be involved in microorganism inactivation in contrast to uv paa h disinfection after naclo disinfection the sul1 and sul2 genes effectively removed while the abundances of tetb tetc erma and bla tem significantly increased the reason was that naclo could effectively reduce the host bacteria of sulfonamide resistance genes which was more beneficial to remove sul1 and sul2 compared with uv paa h it was confirmed by the results of following host bacteria and quorum sensing analysis see section 3 4 and 3 5 in addition the abundances of tetb tetc erma and bla tem only slightly increased after uv naclo disinfection since naclo concentration adopted in this combination disinfection was much lower than that of solo naclo disinfection while their abundances were still much higher than that of uv paa h disinfection dodd et al 2012 indicated that although chlorination is considered an efficient method for inactivating some args since it could readily penetrate the cell membrane and further oxidize nucleic acids and other intracellular components it was not effective for tetracycline and erythromycin resistance genes tetb tetc and bla tem were typically found in plasmid dna tripathi et al 2012 which was responsible for the transmission of args by hgt caused by naclo or uv naclo disinfection moreover the dbps generated from the chlorination process could also promote antibiotic resistance via oxidative stress and sos response related pathway mediated mutations especially those enriched for repeated and frequent mutations in genes involved in chromosome replication li et al 2016a erma was found exclusively on the chromosome nawaz et al 1999 and the increase of erma might due to frequent mutations caused by dbps during naclo or uv naclo disinfection for the overall removal of the args via antibiotic classes naclo disinfection could reduce args belonging to tetracyclines 7 7 sulfonamides 51 4 quinolones 60 8 and macrolides 32 5 but it augmented β lactam resistance genes 13 3 fig 2 b in addition after uv naclo combination disinfection besides β lactam resistance genes 35 9 the macrolides resistance genes also augmented 12 0 available chlorine concentration adopted during uv naclo disinfection was only 1 3 of the solo naclo disinfection and low doses of chlorine could promote bacterial hgt and thus increased the spread of args such as macrolides resistance genes guo et al 2015 in summary through comprehensive analysis the removals of specific args and overall removal efficiencies of args via antibiotic classes uv paa h disinfection was more effective for the removal of tetracycline macrolide and β lactam resistance genes while naclo disinfection was more effective for the removal of sulfonamide and quinolone resistance genes in addition β lactam resistance genes and macrolides resistance genes via antibiotic classes remarkably augmented after uv naclo disinfection 3 3 correlation analysis of the removal of antibiotics and args spearman correlation was conducted between the removal of 14 detected antibiotics and 21 args and the results are shown in table 3 the results showed that among the 294 values 55 values showed a significant correlation and marked in table 3 which accounted for approximately 20 the correlation between antibiotics and args was not consistent in previous studies li et al 2016b ma et al 2020 sheng et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 ma et al 2020 sheng et al 2018 and zhao et al 2019 reported that higher concentrations of antibiotics tetracycline erythromycin sulfadiazine etc could increase the abundance of args in contrast li et al 2016b reported that the majority of the correlations between antibiotics and args showed no statistical significance in this study among the 5 classes of antibiotics quinolones and β lactam antibiotics did not show any correlation with the corresponding arg subtype while tetracyclines sulfonamides and macrolide antibiotics were positively correlated with the corresponding args especially for macrolides nearly half of the coefficients showed significant correlations 7 15 suggesting that the removal of macrolide antibiotics could promote the reduction of args encode resistance to macrolide types erea erma ermb ermf and mefa furthermore the relationship between antibiotic residues and the relative abundance of all args was analyzed based on pca fig 3 the results showed that sulfonamides including smx smm and sdz had the most significant impact on the arg distribution sun et al 2019 reported that sulfonamides could promote the conjugative transfer frequency and finally accelerate the distribution of args although the concentrations of smx and sdz were relatively low the smm concentration was the highest among all of the detected antibiotics in the raw secondary effluent even after disinfection table 1 ben et al 2019 and sun et al 2019 reported that the distribution of sulfonamides was related to sulfonamides concentrations because high concentrations of sulfonamide could not only accelerate the emergence of args by enhancing mutation frequency but also promote the dissemination of args since they enhanced bacterial communication by increasing the number of pili at the group level fig 3 also suggested that besides sulfonamides pgk rtm and amx concentrations also greatly influenced the distribution of args while their concentrations were much lower than that of smm thus an in depth study between low dose antibiotic residuals and the distribution of args still needs to be conducted in the future 3 4 the microbial structure and hosts of args the bacterial community is considered as one of the main drivers of arg changes thus bacterial community variations before and after disinfection were further analyzed to determine the removal mechanism of args the beta diversity of microbial communities before and after disinfection is shown in fig s3 the results showed that compared to the raw secondary effluent the microbial communities only slightly changed after the uv paa and uv paa combination disinfection processes however after naclo and uv naclo disinfection the microbial structure significantly changed feng et al 2021 suggested that reactive oxidation species generated during the disinfection processes tended to kill sensitive bacteria or select for arbs that have a competitive advantage under exposure conditions which resulted in a change in the composition of the microbial communities and finally affected the incidence of args reactive oxidation species generated during the disinfection processes should play a key role in changes in the microbial community and args hypochlorous acid is the main reactive oxidation species under naclo based disinfection and oh and or r c are the main reactive oxidation species under uv or paa based disinfection yan et al 2021 fig s4 also showed that the microbial mass 16s rrna gene after naclo disinfection was significantly lower than those of uv paa tests these all suggested that the mechanism of naclo based disinfection would be expected to be obviously different from uv or paa based disinfection processes bacterial communities determined at the phylum and class level were analyzed fig 4 a and fig s5 a the relative abundances ranked in the top three at the phylum level were the same both before and after disinfection including proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes their relative abundances in the raw secondary effluent before disinfection were 57 2 13 7 and 8 1 respectively their relative abundances only slightly changed after uv or paa based disinfection ranging from 58 1 to 60 1 from 10 0 to 14 0 and from 6 8 to 8 2 respectively however the relative abundances of proteobacteria and actinobacteria varied after naclo based disinfection the relative abundances of proteobacteria decreased from 57 2 to 42 6 and to 48 6 after naclo and uv naclo disinfection respectively while actinobacteria increased from 13 7 to 18 4 and to 15 2 respectively proteobacteria and actinobacteria are two of the common nitrification phyla in activated sludge and contain bacterial groups that are responsible for nutrient removal wang et al 2021 in addition the top 15 microbial communities at the class level were analyzed and the results are shown in fig 4 a the relative abundances of betaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria ranked in the top three at the class level and these microorganisms belong to proteobacteria the results for the microbial community at the class level were consistent with phylum level and these microorganisms were apparently reduced after naclo disinfection however after uv naclo disinfection the elimination of these three microorganisms were not apparent it might due to the significant reduction of available chlorine concentration under uv naclo combination disinfection compared to that of solo naclo disinfection the host bacteria of typical arg types at the phylum level and class level were analyzed accordingly and the results are shown in fig s5 b and fig 4 b respectively the hosts of args mainly exist in proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and verrucomicrobia and proteobacteria is the most important host of typical args moreover proteobacteria is the only host of sulfonamide and β lactam resistance genes feng et al 2021 indicated that the most of genes in proteobacteria were predicted to be related to hgt thus an effective reduction of proteobacteria might be the primary reason for the removal of typical args the results of the analysis of the hosts of args at the class level showed that gammaproteobacteria 31 55 bacteroidia 27 76 and bacilli 15 13 were the main hosts for tetracycline resistance genes in the raw secondary effluent fig 4 b and the hosts varied greatly after uv paa h naclo and uv naclo disinfection after uv paa h disinfection the relative contribution by bacteroidia slightly reduced to 21 73 and its contribution by gammaproteobacteria was significantly reduced to 9 04 moreover bacilli was not detected at all in contrast the relative contributions of bacteroidia and bacilli significantly increased to 39 50 and 30 29 after naclo disinfection respectively while gammaproteobacteria was not detected bacteroidia and bacilli were the main hosts for tetracycline resistance genes and the increase in these bacteria after naclo disinfection resulted in an increase in some args such as tetb and tetc fig 2 a however after uv naclo disinfection the relative contributions of bacteroidia and bacilli only slightly increased to 28 51 and 23 63 respectively thus the available chlorine concentration significantly influenced the host bacteria of tetracycline resistance genes in addition to being the main hosts for tetracycline resistance genes gammaproteobacteria is also the main host for sulfonamides and quinolones and it was not significantly changed after different disinfection processes in addition deltaproteobacteria is one of the main hosts for both macrolide and β lactam resistance genes and after uv paa h disinfection its relative contribution significantly decreased from 17 48 to 4 03 and from 58 09 to 6 16 respectively meanwhile the relative contribution by alphaproteobacteria increased to 43 04 and 67 06 for macrolide and β lactam resistance genes respectively after naclo disinfection thus alphaproteobacteria are the main hosts for macrolide and β lactam resistance genes explaining why the removal efficiencies of macrolides and β lactams are better under uv paa h conditions than that under naclo disinfection conditions furthermore the hosts of args were analyzed at the genus level focusing on the contributions of different genera on the typical arg types fig 5 bacteroides was the most contributing genus of args resisting tetracyclines in all tests except for paa disinfection and prevotella exhibited the highest contribution to paa disinfection zhang et al 2016 also reported that bacteroides was the only host for tetracycline resistance genes such as tetx in addition to bacteroides and prevotella streptococcus was also the main contributing genus of args resisting tetracyclines because it was the second contributing genus after naclo and uv naclo disinfection fig s6 shows that these three genera were obviously increased after paa disinfection compared with the control tests raw secondary effluent indicating that paa could promote the proliferation of the hosts of args resistant to tetracyclines these results implied that the removal of tetracycline resistance genes was closely related to the bacteria mentioned above as the worst removal of tetracycline resistance genes 16 4 was obtained under the conditions of paa disinfection oxidative stress caused by paa was likely to promote antibiotic resistance related pathways mediated mutations and hgt via reactive oxidation species mediated induction of multidrug efflux systems zhang et al 2017 therefore the tetracycline resistance genes could be continuously reproduced thereby increasing the abundance of resistance genes in addition uv paa h disinfection showed significant reductions in the performance of bacteroides prevotella and streptococcus especially for bacteroides and prevotella which was in accordance with the qpcr results of typical args fig 2 b as the best removal of tetracycline resistance genes was achieved under the conditions of uv paa h disinfection furthermore acinetobacter and pseudomonas were the main host bacteria of sulfonamide and quinolone resistance genes respectively it has been reported that actinobacteria were most related to args including sul1 and qnrs and pseudomonas has been confirmed as a carrier of multiple args chen et al 2019 fig s6 shows significant decreases in the abundance of acinetobacter and pseudomonas after naclo disinfection which is an important reason for why the efficacy of sulfonamide and quinolone resistance genes removal was achieved under the conditions of naclo disinfection 51 4 and 60 8 respectively fig 2 b moreover naclo disinfection also changed the types of host bacteria for example verrucomicrobium nevakia and escherichia became the host bacteria of quinolones and sinorhizobium became the host bacteria of macrolides and β lactams this may be due to the exposure of dbps generated from naclo disinfection li et al 2016a reported that dbps generated during naclo disinfection seemed to enrich for repeated and frequent mutations in genes involved in chromosome replication such as pros prolyl trna synthetase and gyra dna gyrase naclo disinfection could increase the signal transduction between bacterial communities in addition to eliminating a portion of the host bacteria thereby increasing the species of resistant bacteria of typical args however when naclo concentration was lowered to from 15 mg l to 3 92 mg l under uv naclo disinfection the generation of dbps also sharply reduced and this resulting in host bacteria and their contributions were similar to that of solo uv disinfection conditions 3 5 gene expression and metabolic pathways related to typical args to further investigate the regulatory mechanism of different disinfection processes on args the main metabolic pathways and related genes of typical resistance types were analyzed table 2 and fig s7 k05595 marc is one of the genes encoding multiple antibiotic resistance proteins that act in signaling and cellular processes as transporters k08151 teta is a tetracycline resistance protein affiliated with the h antiporter 1 dha1 family k18555 qnr and k16907 encode resistance proteins and atp binding proteins in the quinolone transport system pasca et al 2004 k19061 mrx and k18230 tylc are macrolide resistance proteins and atp binding proteins in the macrolide transport system respectively roberts 2008 in addition to the tetracycline resistance proteins the relative abundances of the other genes were all downregulated after uv paa disinfection however only k18555 was downregulated under naclo based disinfection conditions this implied that the mechanisms for the removal of typical args might be different under the conditions of uv paa and naclo based disinfection uv paa disinfection regulated the expression of key genes involved in arg propagation while naclo based disinfection probably removed the args by smashing the dna of the bacteria rather than by downregulating bacterial proteins ko01501 is a metabolic pathway of β lactam resistance that contains a large number of genes fig s7 showed that uv paa disinfection reduced the relative abundance of ko01501 while naclo and uv naclo disinfection promoted the metabolic pathway of β lactam resistance these results were consistent with the removal of β lactam resistance genes fig 2 b it has been reported that metabolic pathways such as a two component regulatory system and quorum sensing played an important role in the transfer of args huang et al 2018 the genes k07636 phor k07652 vick and k13584 ctra are involved in the two component system which regulates the bacterial resistance to antibiotics similarly uv paa disinfection especially under high dose conditions uv paa h downregulates these genes fig s7 thus inhibiting the expression of arg related genes and metabolic pathways reducing arg propagation quorum sensing is a cell cell communication process that enables bacteria to obtain information about the cell density and species composition of the local community and adjust their gene expression profiles accordingly papenfort and bassler 2016 in this study the signal transduction in quorum sensing metabolic pathways of the two hosts pseudomonas and escherichia coli were analyzed in depth fig 6 autoinducers such as acyl homoserine lactones ahls autoinducers 1 ai 1 and autoinducers 2 ai 2 are common signaling molecules for quorum sensing sun et al 2019 fig 6 showed that the biosynthetic proteins of the bacteria first synthesize the signaling molecules ai 1 and ai 2 and then respond to membrane proteins to enter the cell to regulate the abundance of sensing proteins the relative abundance of k06193 phna and k04750 phnb was decreased after uv paa disinfection thus inhibiting the signal transduction of the host bacteria of args however the relative abundance of the sensing protein k08321 lsrf was enhanced after naclo and uv naclo disinfection indicating that naclo and uv naclo disinfection probably promoted the gene expression of escherichia coli therefore it can be concluded that uv driven advanced oxidation with paa could inhibit the expression of arg related genes and pathways resulting in effective arg elimination 4 conclusion the uv paa h process was effective for the removal of tetracyclines quinolones macrolides and β lactams and their average removal efficiencies ranged from 25 7 to 100 however naclo disinfection was most effective for the removal of sulfonamides 81 6 and only 35 8 of sulfonamides were removed after uv paa h disinfection tetb tetc erma and bla tem significantly increased after naclo disinfection and β lactam resistance genes 35 9 and macrolides resistance genes 12 0 remarkably augmented after uv naclo combination disinfection conversely the majority of args could be removed after uv paa h disinfection the good removal efficiencies of antibiotics and args by uv paa h disinfection was due to the generation of highly reactive oxidation species such as oh and r c there was a positive correlation between the removal of tetracycline sulfonamide and macrolide antibiotics and the corresponding args the abundance of resistant bacteria was greatly decreased and the expression of key functional genes involved in arg propagation was downregulated after uv paa disinfection which inhibited the signal transduction of the host bacteria these findings can provide valuable information for understanding the simultaneous removal mechanism of antibiotics and args in wastewater during disinfection processes especially for the

16373,in this study the simultaneous removal mechanism of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args was investigated using the novel ultraviolet peracetic acid uv paa combination disinfection process and conventional disinfection processes were also applied for comparison the results showed that uv paa disinfection with a high uv dosage uv paa h was most effective for the removal of tetracyclines quinolones macrolides and β lactams their average removal efficiencies ranged from 25 7 to 100 while naclo disinfection was effective for the removal of sulfonamides 81 6 the majority of args were well removed after the uv paa h disinfection while specific genes including tetb tetc erma and bla tem significantly increased after naclo disinfection in addition β lactam resistance genes 35 9 and macrolides resistance genes 12 0 remarkably augmented after uv naclo disinfection the highly reactive oxidation species generated from uv paa process including hydroxyl radicals oh and carbon centered organic radicals r c were responsible for the elimination of antibiotics and args correlation analysis showed that tetracycline sulfonamide and macrolide antibiotics removal showed a positive correlation with the corresponding args and a low dose of antibiotic residues played an important role in the distribution of args metagenomic sequencing analysis showed that uv paa disinfection could not only greatly decrease the abundance of resistant bacteria but also downregulate the expression of key functional genes involved in args propagation and inhibit the signal transduction of the host bacteria underlying that its removal mechanism was quite different from that of naclo based disinfection processes our study provides valuable information for understanding the simultaneous removal mechanism of antibiotics and args in wastewater during the disinfection processes especially for the novel uv paa combination process graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotics antibiotic resistance genes ultraviolet peracetic acid disinfection 1 introduction antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args have been considered emerging contaminants and their disseminations are becoming an urgent public health concern méndez et al 2017 wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been reported to be an important reservoir for antibiotics and args su et al 2017 the refractory characteristics of antibiotics resulted biological treatment are ineffective for their removal leading to their frequent detection in the secondary effluent of wwtps gao et al 2012 wang and chen 2020 reported that antibiotics could induce a large number of resistant strains and resistant genes causing args to also be widely detected in secondary effluent thus the disinfection process before discharge is thought to be critical for the removal of antibiotics and args during the wastewater treatment process among the conventional disinfection processes chlorination based processes have been widely used due to their excellent bactericidal capability and economical treatment cost antibiotics such as sulfonamides tetracyclines and macrolides have been reported to have good removal efficiencies during chlorination based disinfection processes cheng et al 2022 in addition because chlorination based processes can destroy the structural integrity of the cell surface by reacting with its components the n terminal amino acids of peptidoglycan located on the cell membranes these processes are considered as efficient methods for eliminating args dodd 2012 however the removal efficiency largely depends on the available chlorine concentration when low doses of chlorine are applied args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb can not be well eliminated guo et al 2015 correspondingly the dissemination of args is enhanced because the frequency of conjugative transfer is promoted by 2 5 fold under low chlorine conditions with an increasing chlorine concentration the removal of args increased zheng et al 2017 while undesired disinfection byproducts dbps such as haloacetic acid trihalomethane n nitrosodimethylamine etc generated during the disinfection process are also increased dou et al 2021 wang et al 2021 in addition to their safety risks dbps also facilitate the horizontal gene transfer hgt of args by altering the cell permeability of bacteria guo et al 2015 therefore chlorination based disinfection processes have certain limitations in eliminating args in wastewater parallel to chlorination based disinfection processes ultraviolet uv based disinfection processes have also been reported to have good removal efficiencies for antibiotics and args and they do not generate harmful dbps dodd 2012 yan et al 2021 zheng et al 2017 zhuang et al 2015 uv irradiation inactivates bacteria mainly by causing dna deactivation via pyrimidine dimerization and it has no measurable effect on the cell membrane dodd 2012 thus to obtain an excellent removal efficiency a very high uv dose is required zhuang et al 2015 reported that 2 48 2 74 log reductions in args were achieved when a uv dose of 12477 mj cm2 was adopted this uv dose is several hundred times that adopted in real wwtps and it is not feasible thus it is urgent to explore uv based combination processes to improve the elimination efficiency of both antibiotics and args while lowering the treatment cost and reducing the safety risk caused by dbps among the uv based combination processes uv h2o2 and uv persulfate uv ps have been widely investigated thus far michael et al 2020 sharma et al 2019 good removal efficiencies of args including sul1 sul2 tetm bla oxa a bla tem bla shv and bla kpc 3 have been achieved in these combination systems moreover sharma et al 2019 indicated that uv ps had advantages over uv h2o2 for eliminating antibiotics and args because in addition to hydroxyl radicals oh so4 also participated in the uv ps system in addition to h2o2 and ps peracetic acid paa also has a high oxidation capacity and can be used as an alternative method for wastewater disinfection recently a uv paa combination system was studied as a novel and promising method for removing emerging contaminants especially antibiotics rizzo et al 2019 wang et al 2021 yan et al 2021 besides oh carbon centered organic radicals r c with highly reactive performance are also generated in the uv paa system our previous studies indicated that higher mineralization rates of antibiotics were achieved in the uv paa system compared to other combination systems such as uv h2o2 and uv ps wang et al 2021 yan et al 2021 in addition a combination uv paa process also showed high disinfection efficiency for enteric bacteria including fecal coliforms escherichia coli and enterococcus spp hassaballah et al 2019 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 however to the best of our knowledge previous studies have mainly focused on using uv paa combination process either to enhance the inactivation of pathogens or to improve the removal of antibiotics and args have seldom been considered in this study the simultaneous removal of antibiotics and args in the secondary effluent of wwtps was thoroughly investigated during the uv paa disinfection process and conventional disinfection processes such as uv naclo and uv naclo were adopted for comparison specifically 5 classes of antibiotics including tetracyclines sulfonamides quinolones macrolides and β lactams 14 kinds and 21 kinds of corresponding args were investigated then the correlation between the removal of antibiotics and args after different disinfection processes was analyzed finally metagenomic analysis was conducted to gain insights into the simultaneous reduction mechanism of antibiotics and args including the microbial structure host bacteria differential expression of functional genes and metabolic pathways it is of great significance to fully understand the simultaneous removal mechanism of antibiotics and args in wastewater during disinfection processes especially for the novel uv paa combination process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals five classes of antibiotics tetracyclines sulfonamides quinolones macrolides and β lactams were investigated in this study specifically among the 5 classes of antibiotics 14 antibiotics including tetracycline hydrochloride tch

quartz well the distance between low pressure mercury lamp and reaction columns was fixed at 15 cm and the radiation intensity was 0 30 mw cm2 at 254 nm which was measured by an ultraviolet radiation meter uv b beijing shida photoelectric technology co ltd china a detailed description of the operation of the system can be found in our previous study yan et al 2021 for the solo paa disinfection process the initial paa concentration was controlled at 8 mg l and the reaction time was 24 min for the uv paa combination system paa concentration was reduced to 4 mg l and the uv dosage was controlled at 18 mj cm2 or 108 mj cm2 by adjusting the illumination time to 1 min and 6 min which were called uv paa l and uv paa h respectively for the uv irradiation system alone the uv dosage was set at 36 mj cm2 and 216 mj cm2 by changing the exposure time from 2 min to 12 min and they are called uv l and uv h respectively in addition a relatively high naclo concentration of 15 mg l reaction time 24 min and low naclo concentration of 3 92 mg l reaction time 6 min were chosen for the solo naclo and uv naclo disinfection respectively to make a quantitative comparison the uv dosage and molar concentration of naclo and paa were controlled the same under uv paa h and uv naclo disinfection processes during the solo paa and naclo disinfection processes the uv lamp in the reactor was turned off while the other conditions were kept the same after the reaction na2s2o3 was added to the solution to terminate the reaction then the water samples were filtered through a glass fiber filter gf f

detailed information is supplied in text s2 2 8 data processing the data were analyzed by originpro 2018c originlab corporation ma usa one way analysis of variance anova was used to test the significance of the results correlations of the antibiotics and args were evaluated by spearman correlation analysis using spss ibm spss statistics 25 a p value of 0 05 was regarded as statistically significant principal component analysis pca combined with influencing factors was applied with r software microsoft version 3 3 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of antibiotics the concentrations of antibiotics in the raw secondary effluent and after different disinfection processes are shown in table 1 a total of 14 antibiotics were detected in the secondary effluent and they belong to five classes including tetracyclines sulfonamides quinolones macrolides and β lactams among the 14 detected antibiotics the concentrations of smm cln and ofl ranked in the top three in the raw secondary wastewater and they belong to sulfonamides macrolides and quinolones respectively their concentrations were 615 06 39 98 ng l 279 20 19 54 ng l and 150 86 10 56 ng l respectively these three classes of antibiotics are widely used in china in addition to being used to treat human and animal diseases they are also used as a feed supplement at low concentrations to promote the growth of livestock dou et al 2021 due to the refractory characteristics of these antibiotics they could not be well degraded during the biological treatment processes in wwtps resulting in high residuals in the final secondary wastewater in contrast to other classes tetracyclines in the influent of this wwtp were very low and their concentrations in the secondary effluent only ranged from 0 15 0 01 ng l to 1 10 0 08 ng l conventional disinfection processes such as uv naclo and uv naclo were effective for removing tetracyclines these results are consistent with ao et al s study 2021 which also found that tetracyclines could be well removed during conventional disinfection processes however the removal efficiencies of tetracyclines by conventional disinfection processes were much lower than those of novel uv paa combination processes the tetracyclines detected including tch ctc and dch could be completely removed after uv paa while only 69 5 72 5 and 87 9 of tetracyclines were removed after uv l naclo and uv naclo disinfection fig 1 the uv dose naclo concentration and uv naclo concentration used in this study were similar to the actual doses or concentrations used in wwtps the removal of quinolones by different disinfection processes was similar to that of tetracyclines uv paa had a significant advantage in removing quinolones in contrast to conventional disinfection processes and solo paa disinfection their average removal efficiencies ranged from 57 2 to 70 3 after uv naclo and uv naclo disinfection and only 31 5 of quinolones were removed after solo paa disinfection during the solo uv and paa disinfection direct uv photolysis and paa oxidation mainly contributed to the degradation of antibiotics yan et al 2021 reported that uv photolysis was selective for the removal of antibiotics suggesting that the removal efficiencies ranged a lot among different antibiotics in addition ao et al 2021 and chen et al 2021 implied that the oxidation capacity of paa itself was limited if it was not effectively activated and this resulted in poor removal efficiency of refractory quinolones during the solo paa disinfection when paa was activated by uv irradiation a notable increase in removal efficiency was achieved and 69 7 and 93 9 of quinolones were removed after uv paa l and uv paa h disinfection respectively it was due to that the large amounts of reactive oxidation radicals formed in the uv paa combination system and the results were confirmed by epr with spin trap of dmpo fig s2 a in addition to oh ch3 was also detected in the uv paa combination system moreover the peak intensities of oh and ch3 were stronger in the uv paa h system than in the uv paa l system as dmpo is a relatively weak spin trap and to provide more convincing evidence for reactive radicals the advanced spin trap of dippmpo was used during the uv paa h disinfection fig s2 b the simulation based fitting of spectra of reactive radicals was confirmed through analysis of the hyperfine splittings from phosphors αp nitrogen αn and protons αh the simulation based fitting of spectra confirmed that besides oh and ch3 ch3oo and ch3coo also appeared during uv paa h disinfection eqs 1 3 table s3 the highly reactive radicals generated during uv paa combination disinfection resulted in higher removal efficiencies of antibiotics especially at higher uv activation conditions uv paa h in addition the selective of uv photolysis also appeared for β lactams removal their average removal efficiencies were only 3 8 and 36 8 under uv l and uv h disinfection respectively although their average removal efficiencies increased after naclo and uv naclo disinfection to 69 0 and 75 9 respectively compared to solo uv disinfection their removal efficiencies were still much lower than under uv paa h conditions 95 6 additionally the overall removal efficiencies of macrolides were low regardless of whether conventional disinfection processes were applied or the novel uv paa combination process was applied between 3 2 and 25 7 due to their refractory characteristics yan et al 2021 however the highest removal efficiency of macrolides was achieved under uv paa h disinfection conditions 25 7 1 c h 3 c o o o h h v c h 3 c o o o h 2 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o 2 3 c h 3 o 2 c h 3 o o therefore the novel uv paa combination process especially under uv paa h conditions was more effective for removing four classes of antibiotics except sulfonamides than conventional disinfection processes for sulfonamides best removal efficiency was achieved after naclo disinfection 81 6 their average removal efficiencies after uv l uv h paa uv paa l uv paa h and uv naclo disinfection were 1 9 7 8 6 3 14 2 35 8 and 43 7 respectively chamberlain and adams 2006 also reported that sulfonamides were prone to be oxidized by chlorination based oxidation systems however it largely depends on the available chlorine concentration during the solo naclo disinfection relative high concentration of naclo was adopted 15 mg l while its concentration was reduced to 3 92 mg l under uv naclo disinfection in order to make a comparable comparison with uv paa h conditions when low dose of naclo was applied under uv naclo disinfection the amount of hclo generated from the hydrolysis of naclo also sharply reduced and this finally resulted in a significant decline of the removal efficiency of sulfonamides cesare et al 2016 chamberlain and adams 2006 in addition from the perspective of dbps chlorination based disinfection processes including naclo and uv naclo adopted here have great disadvantages besides conventional halogenated dbps emerging nitrosamine dbps could also be formed after chlorination based disinfection dou et al 2021 in contrast dbps formed from paa based disinfection processes are mainly some organic acids which have no significant impact on the environment therefore a uv paa combination disinfection process is a promising method not only because the majority of antibiotics could be well removed after uv paa disinfection but also because the risks caused by dbps could be significantly reduced 3 2 removal of args in addition to antibiotics args removal by different disinfection processes was also evaluated fig 2 fig 2 a shows that the majority of detected args increased after uv l and paa disinfection and the overall removal efficiencies of the args via antibiotic classes ranged from 0 6 to 30 6 and from 13 6 to 40 6 respectively fig 2 b mckinney and pruden 2012 and zhang et al 2017 suggested that disinfectants at subinhibitory concentrations such as uv at low dosages could promote the conjugation transfer of args resulting in an increase in args after disinfection in addition the higher proliferation of args after paa disinfection might be related to the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane zhang et al 2017 indicated that bacteria adapt their membrane permeability by modulating the expression of outer membrane proteins omps and they play important roles in pore formation and hgt of donor and recipient bacteria this was confirmed by omp analysis in this study and the results are shown in table 2 the relative abundances of functional genes including k03286 k05807 k06142 and k017713 were much higher after uv l and paa disinfection alone than after other disinfection processes the enhanced expression of membrane proteins plays a vital role in augmenting membrane permeability causing antibiotic resistance dissemination via the horizontal transfer of args fig 2 a also shows that after uv paa h disinfection only sul2 and tetc slightly increased and the abundances of the other args significantly decreased the average removal efficiencies of the args via antibiotic classes after uv paa h disinfection ranged from 3 2 to 38 9 which was higher than that of uv h disinfection fig 2 b in the uv paa h process large amounts of reactive oxidation species including oh ch3coo ch3oo and ch3 were generated and they destroyed the integrity of the cell structure which resulted in good removal of the majority of args table s3 cellular structures or components such as carbon carbon double bonds and thiol groups were destructed under the attack of oh and r c and the functionality of the plasmid dna was influenced zhang et al 2019 plasmids are mobile genetic elements mges and a key dna pool for hgt i e transformation transduction and conjugation once bacteria plasmids were destroyed by oh and r c the transmissions of args were hindered and this finally resulted in the good removals of args under uv paa disinfection zhang et al 2020 also indicated that multiple mechanisms are present under uv paa disinfection besides uv irradiation paa and reactive radicals a synergistic effect among all of these mechanisms could potentially be involved in microorganism inactivation in contrast to uv paa h disinfection after naclo disinfection the sul1 and sul2 genes effectively removed while the abundances of tetb tetc erma and bla tem significantly increased the reason was that naclo could effectively reduce the host bacteria of sulfonamide resistance genes which was more beneficial to remove sul1 and sul2 compared with uv paa h it was confirmed by the results of following host bacteria and quorum sensing analysis see section 3 4 and 3 5 in addition the abundances of tetb tetc erma and bla tem only slightly increased after uv naclo disinfection since naclo concentration adopted in this combination disinfection was much lower than that of solo naclo disinfection while their abundances were still much higher than that of uv paa h disinfection dodd et al 2012 indicated that although chlorination is considered an efficient method for inactivating some args since it could readily penetrate the cell membrane and further oxidize nucleic acids and other intracellular components it was not effective for tetracycline and erythromycin resistance genes tetb tetc and bla tem were typically found in plasmid dna tripathi et al 2012 which was responsible for the transmission of args by hgt caused by naclo or uv naclo disinfection moreover the dbps generated from the chlorination process could also promote antibiotic resistance via oxidative stress and sos response related pathway mediated mutations especially those enriched for repeated and frequent mutations in genes involved in chromosome replication li et al 2016a erma was found exclusively on the chromosome nawaz et al 1999 and the increase of erma might due to frequent mutations caused by dbps during naclo or uv naclo disinfection for the overall removal of the args via antibiotic classes naclo disinfection could reduce args belonging to tetracyclines 7 7 sulfonamides 51 4 quinolones 60 8 and macrolides 32 5 but it augmented β lactam resistance genes 13 3 fig 2 b in addition after uv naclo combination disinfection besides β lactam resistance genes 35 9 the macrolides resistance genes also augmented 12 0 available chlorine concentration adopted during uv naclo disinfection was only 1 3 of the solo naclo disinfection and low doses of chlorine could promote bacterial hgt and thus increased the spread of args such as macrolides resistance genes guo et al 2015 in summary through comprehensive analysis the removals of specific args and overall removal efficiencies of args via antibiotic classes uv paa h disinfection was more effective for the removal of tetracycline macrolide and β lactam resistance genes while naclo disinfection was more effective for the removal of sulfonamide and quinolone resistance genes in addition β lactam resistance genes and macrolides resistance genes via antibiotic classes remarkably augmented after uv naclo disinfection 3 3 correlation analysis of the removal of antibiotics and args spearman correlation was conducted between the removal of 14 detected antibiotics and 21 args and the results are shown in table 3 the results showed that among the 294 values 55 values showed a significant correlation and marked in table 3 which accounted for approximately 20 the correlation between antibiotics and args was not consistent in previous studies li et al 2016b ma et al 2020 sheng et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 ma et al 2020 sheng et al 2018 and zhao et al 2019 reported that higher concentrations of antibiotics tetracycline erythromycin sulfadiazine etc could increase the abundance of args in contrast li et al 2016b reported that the majority of the correlations between antibiotics and args showed no statistical significance in this study among the 5 classes of antibiotics quinolones and β lactam antibiotics did not show any correlation with the corresponding arg subtype while tetracyclines sulfonamides and macrolide antibiotics were positively correlated with the corresponding args especially for macrolides nearly half of the coefficients showed significant correlations 7 15 suggesting that the removal of macrolide antibiotics could promote the reduction of args encode resistance to macrolide types erea erma ermb ermf and mefa furthermore the relationship between antibiotic residues and the relative abundance of all args was analyzed based on pca fig 3 the results showed that sulfonamides including smx smm and sdz had the most significant impact on the arg distribution sun et al 2019 reported that sulfonamides could promote the conjugative transfer frequency and finally accelerate the distribution of args although the concentrations of smx and sdz were relatively low the smm concentration was the highest among all of the detected antibiotics in the raw secondary effluent even after disinfection table 1 ben et al 2019 and sun et al 2019 reported that the distribution of sulfonamides was related to sulfonamides concentrations because high concentrations of sulfonamide could not only accelerate the emergence of args by enhancing mutation frequency but also promote the dissemination of args since they enhanced bacterial communication by increasing the number of pili at the group level fig 3 also suggested that besides sulfonamides pgk rtm and amx concentrations also greatly influenced the distribution of args while their concentrations were much lower than that of smm thus an in depth study between low dose antibiotic residuals and the distribution of args still needs to be conducted in the future 3 4 the microbial structure and hosts of args the bacterial community is considered as one of the main drivers of arg changes thus bacterial community variations before and after disinfection were further analyzed to determine the removal mechanism of args the beta diversity of microbial communities before and after disinfection is shown in fig s3 the results showed that compared to the raw secondary effluent the microbial communities only slightly changed after the uv paa and uv paa combination disinfection processes however after naclo and uv naclo disinfection the microbial structure significantly changed feng et al 2021 suggested that reactive oxidation species generated during the disinfection processes tended to kill sensitive bacteria or select for arbs that have a competitive advantage under exposure conditions which resulted in a change in the composition of the microbial communities and finally affected the incidence of args reactive oxidation species generated during the disinfection processes should play a key role in changes in the microbial community and args hypochlorous acid is the main reactive oxidation species under naclo based disinfection and oh and or r c are the main reactive oxidation species under uv or paa based disinfection yan et al 2021 fig s4 also showed that the microbial mass 16s rrna gene after naclo disinfection was significantly lower than those of uv paa tests these all suggested that the mechanism of naclo based disinfection would be expected to be obviously different from uv or paa based disinfection processes bacterial communities determined at the phylum and class level were analyzed fig 4 a and fig s5 a the relative abundances ranked in the top three at the phylum level were the same both before and after disinfection including proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes their relative abundances in the raw secondary effluent before disinfection were 57 2 13 7 and 8 1 respectively their relative abundances only slightly changed after uv or paa based disinfection ranging from 58 1 to 60 1 from 10 0 to 14 0 and from 6 8 to 8 2 respectively however the relative abundances of proteobacteria and actinobacteria varied after naclo based disinfection the relative abundances of proteobacteria decreased from 57 2 to 42 6 and to 48 6 after naclo and uv naclo disinfection respectively while actinobacteria increased from 13 7 to 18 4 and to 15 2 respectively proteobacteria and actinobacteria are two of the common nitrification phyla in activated sludge and contain bacterial groups that are responsible for nutrient removal wang et al 2021 in addition the top 15 microbial communities at the class level were analyzed and the results are shown in fig 4 a the relative abundances of betaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria ranked in the top three at the class level and these microorganisms belong to proteobacteria the results for the microbial community at the class level were consistent with phylum level and these microorganisms were apparently reduced after naclo disinfection however after uv naclo disinfection the elimination of these three microorganisms were not apparent it might due to the significant reduction of available chlorine concentration under uv naclo combination disinfection compared to that of solo naclo disinfection the host bacteria of typical arg types at the phylum level and class level were analyzed accordingly and the results are shown in fig s5 b and fig 4 b respectively the hosts of args mainly exist in proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and verrucomicrobia and proteobacteria is the most important host of typical args moreover proteobacteria is the only host of sulfonamide and β lactam resistance genes feng et al 2021 indicated that the most of genes in proteobacteria were predicted to be related to hgt thus an effective reduction of proteobacteria might be the primary reason for the removal of typical args the results of the analysis of the hosts of args at the class level showed that gammaproteobacteria 31 55 bacteroidia 27 76 and bacilli 15 13 were the main hosts for tetracycline resistance genes in the raw secondary effluent fig 4 b and the hosts varied greatly after uv paa h naclo and uv naclo disinfection after uv paa h disinfection the relative contribution by bacteroidia slightly reduced to 21 73 and its contribution by gammaproteobacteria was significantly reduced to 9 04 moreover bacilli was not detected at all in contrast the relative contributions of bacteroidia and bacilli significantly increased to 39 50 and 30 29 after naclo disinfection respectively while gammaproteobacteria was not detected bacteroidia and bacilli were the main hosts for tetracycline resistance genes and the increase in these bacteria after naclo disinfection resulted in an increase in some args such as tetb and tetc fig 2 a however after uv naclo disinfection the relative contributions of bacteroidia and bacilli only slightly increased to 28 51 and 23 63 respectively thus the available chlorine concentration significantly influenced the host bacteria of tetracycline resistance genes in addition to being the main hosts for tetracycline resistance genes gammaproteobacteria is also the main host for sulfonamides and quinolones and it was not significantly changed after different disinfection processes in addition deltaproteobacteria is one of the main hosts for both macrolide and β lactam resistance genes and after uv paa h disinfection its relative contribution significantly decreased from 17 48 to 4 03 and from 58 09 to 6 16 respectively meanwhile the relative contribution by alphaproteobacteria increased to 43 04 and 67 06 for macrolide and β lactam resistance genes respectively after naclo disinfection thus alphaproteobacteria are the main hosts for macrolide and β lactam resistance genes explaining why the removal efficiencies of macrolides and β lactams are better under uv paa h conditions than that under naclo disinfection conditions furthermore the hosts of args were analyzed at the genus level focusing on the contributions of different genera on the typical arg types fig 5 bacteroides was the most contributing genus of args resisting tetracyclines in all tests except for paa disinfection and prevotella exhibited the highest contribution to paa disinfection zhang et al 2016 also reported that bacteroides was the only host for tetracycline resistance genes such as tetx in addition to bacteroides and prevotella streptococcus was also the main contributing genus of args resisting tetracyclines because it was the second contributing genus after naclo and uv naclo disinfection fig s6 shows that these three genera were obviously increased after paa disinfection compared with the control tests raw secondary effluent indicating that paa could promote the proliferation of the hosts of args resistant to tetracyclines these results implied that the removal of tetracycline resistance genes was closely related to the bacteria mentioned above as the worst removal of tetracycline resistance genes 16 4 was obtained under the conditions of paa disinfection oxidative stress caused by paa was likely to promote antibiotic resistance related pathways mediated mutations and hgt via reactive oxidation species mediated induction of multidrug efflux systems zhang et al 2017 therefore the tetracycline resistance genes could be continuously reproduced thereby increasing the abundance of resistance genes in addition uv paa h disinfection showed significant reductions in the performance of bacteroides prevotella and streptococcus especially for bacteroides and prevotella which was in accordance with the qpcr results of typical args fig 2 b as the best removal of tetracycline resistance genes was achieved under the conditions of uv paa h disinfection furthermore acinetobacter and pseudomonas were the main host bacteria of sulfonamide and quinolone resistance genes respectively it has been reported that actinobacteria were most related to args including sul1 and qnrs and pseudomonas has been confirmed as a carrier of multiple args chen et al 2019 fig s6 shows significant decreases in the abundance of acinetobacter and pseudomonas after naclo disinfection which is an important reason for why the efficacy of sulfonamide and quinolone resistance genes removal was achieved under the conditions of naclo disinfection 51 4 and 60 8 respectively fig 2 b moreover naclo disinfection also changed the types of host bacteria for example verrucomicrobium nevakia and escherichia became the host bacteria of quinolones and sinorhizobium became the host bacteria of macrolides and β lactams this may be due to the exposure of dbps generated from naclo disinfection li et al 2016a reported that dbps generated during naclo disinfection seemed to enrich for repeated and frequent mutations in genes involved in chromosome replication such as pros prolyl trna synthetase and gyra dna gyrase naclo disinfection could increase the signal transduction between bacterial communities in addition to eliminating a portion of the host bacteria thereby increasing the species of resistant bacteria of typical args however when naclo concentration was lowered to from 15 mg l to 3 92 mg l under uv naclo disinfection the generation of dbps also sharply reduced and this resulting in host bacteria and their contributions were similar to that of solo uv disinfection conditions 3 5 gene expression and metabolic pathways related to typical args to further investigate the regulatory mechanism of different disinfection processes on args the main metabolic pathways and related genes of typical resistance types were analyzed table 2 and fig s7 k05595 marc is one of the genes encoding multiple antibiotic resistance proteins that act in signaling and cellular processes as transporters k08151 teta is a tetracycline resistance protein affiliated with the h antiporter 1 dha1 family k18555 qnr and k16907 encode resistance proteins and atp binding proteins in the quinolone transport system pasca et al 2004 k19061 mrx and k18230 tylc are macrolide resistance proteins and atp binding proteins in the macrolide transport system respectively roberts 2008 in addition to the tetracycline resistance proteins the relative abundances of the other genes were all downregulated after uv paa disinfection however only k18555 was downregulated under naclo based disinfection conditions this implied that the mechanisms for the removal of typical args might be different under the conditions of uv paa and naclo based disinfection uv paa disinfection regulated the expression of key genes involved in arg propagation while naclo based disinfection probably removed the args by smashing the dna of the bacteria rather than by downregulating bacterial proteins ko01501 is a metabolic pathway of β lactam resistance that contains a large number of genes fig s7 showed that uv paa disinfection reduced the relative abundance of ko01501 while naclo and uv naclo disinfection promoted the metabolic pathway of β lactam resistance these results were consistent with the removal of β lactam resistance genes fig 2 b it has been reported that metabolic pathways such as a two component regulatory system and quorum sensing played an important role in the transfer of args huang et al 2018 the genes k07636 phor k07652 vick and k13584 ctra are involved in the two component system which regulates the bacterial resistance to antibiotics similarly uv paa disinfection especially under high dose conditions uv paa h downregulates these genes fig s7 thus inhibiting the expression of arg related genes and metabolic pathways reducing arg propagation quorum sensing is a cell cell communication process that enables bacteria to obtain information about the cell density and species composition of the local community and adjust their gene expression profiles accordingly papenfort and bassler 2016 in this study the signal transduction in quorum sensing metabolic pathways of the two hosts pseudomonas and escherichia coli were analyzed in depth fig 6 autoinducers such as acyl homoserine lactones ahls autoinducers 1 ai 1 and autoinducers 2 ai 2 are common signaling molecules for quorum sensing sun et al 2019 fig 6 showed that the biosynthetic proteins of the bacteria first synthesize the signaling molecules ai 1 and ai 2 and then respond to membrane proteins to enter the cell to regulate the abundance of sensing proteins the relative abundance of k06193 phna and k04750 phnb was decreased after uv paa disinfection thus inhibiting the signal transduction of the host bacteria of args however the relative abundance of the sensing protein k08321 lsrf was enhanced after naclo and uv naclo disinfection indicating that naclo and uv naclo disinfection probably promoted the gene expression of escherichia coli therefore it can be concluded that uv driven advanced oxidation with paa could inhibit the expression of arg related genes and pathways resulting in effective arg elimination 4 conclusion the uv paa h process was effective for the removal of tetracyclines quinolones macrolides and β lactams and their average removal efficiencies ranged from 25 7 to 100 however naclo disinfection was most effective for the removal of sulfonamides 81 6 and only 35 8 of sulfonamides were removed after uv paa h disinfection tetb tetc erma and bla tem significantly increased after naclo disinfection and β lactam resistance genes 35 9 and macrolides resistance genes 12 0 remarkably augmented after uv naclo combination disinfection conversely the majority of args could be removed after uv paa h disinfection the good removal efficiencies of antibiotics and args by uv paa h disinfection was due to the generation of highly reactive oxidation species such as oh and r c there was a positive correlation between the removal of tetracycline sulfonamide and macrolide antibiotics and the corresponding args the abundance of resistant bacteria was greatly decreased and the expression of key functional genes involved in arg propagation was downregulated after uv paa disinfection which inhibited the signal transduction of the host bacteria these findings can provide valuable information for understanding the simultaneous removal mechanism of antibiotics and args in wastewater during disinfection processes especially for the

16374,eutrophication substantially influences the community structure of aquatic organisms and has become a major threat to biodiversity however whether eutrophication is linked to homogenization of microbial communities and the possible underlying mechanisms are poorly understood here we studied bacterial and fungal communities from water and sediments of 40 shallow lakes in the yangtze huaihe river basin a representative area characterized by intensifying eutrophication in china and further examined the beta diversity patterns and underlying mechanisms under eutrophication conditions our results indicate that eutrophication generally caused biotic homogenization of bacterial and fungal communities in both habitats showing decreased community variations for the sites with a higher trophic state index tsi in the two habitats community dissimilarities were positively correlated with tsi changes for both taxonomic groups while the local contribution to beta diversity lcbd remarkably declined with increasing tsi for the fungal community these phenomena were consistent with the pivotal importance of the tsi in statistically accounting for beta diversity of bacterial and fungal communities in both habitats in addition we found that physicochemical factors such as water temperature and ph were also important for bacterial and fungal communities in water while heavy metal elements were important for the communities in sediments interestingly generalist species rather than specialist species were revealed to more dominantly affect the variations in beta diversity along the trophic gradient which were quantified by bray curtis dissimilarity and lcbd collectively our findings reveal the importance of generalist species in contributing to the change of beta diversity of microbial communities along trophic gradients which have profound implications for a comprehensive understanding of the effects of eutrophication on microbial community graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biotic homogenization eutrophication generalist species local contributions to beta diversity lcbd beta diversity 1 introduction eutrophication has become a global aquatic environmental issue often resulting in the swamping of lakes deterioration of water quality loss of diversity and changes of ecosystem structure and function alexander et al 2017 ansari et al 2010 one of the main consequences caused by eutrophication is biotic homogenization mckinney and lockwood 1999 a complex process in which the compositional similarity between communities increases otto et al 2020 as has previously been observed in macroorganisms such as fish menezes et al 2015 macrophytes salgado et al 2018 macroinvertebrates donohue et al 2009 and zooplankton liu et al 2020b theoretically the occurrence of biotic homogenization could be simply summarized as the following three aspects 1 extinction of native species 2 invasion of widespread nonnative species and 3 range expansion of native generalists mckinney and lockwood 2001 olden et al 2004 for example in the case of fish it has been reported that worldwide freshwater fish homogenization is strongly driven by the species translocated within a realm and by only a few nonnative generalists whereas most nonnative species contribute to the differentiation effect toussaint et al 2016 similarly the increased community similarity of aquatic macrophytes may be caused by invasive species via their own presence in multiple sites and influence on the composition of native species muthukrishnan et al 2020 however current understandings of homogenization of aquatic biological communities particularly microbes remain elusive biotic homogenization can be quantified by beta diversity which can be calculated using the dissimilarity indices such as bray curtis and jaccard dissimilarity bray and curtis 1957 jaccard 1900 and the ecological uniqueness of local site legendre and de caceres 2013 the selection of indicators is important for quantifying biotic homogenization because they can capture different aspects of information about the community petsch 2016 the most straightforward and commonly used beta diversity indicator for quantifying biotic homogenization is the dissimilarity index among which the bray curtis and jaccard dissimilarity are used most frequently in homogenization studies baeten et al 2012 jaccard s dissimilarity index is used most frequently for occurrence data while the bray curtis dissimilarity index is appropriate for the data with abundance information olden and rooney 2006 biotic homogenization can be measured by comparing the dissimilarity among biological communities at two distinct times or the average pairwise dissimilarity between sites in different environmental states and the degree of homogenization can be evaluated by comparing the change rate of the dissimilarity index with temporal or spatial distance petsch 2016 in addition as another beta diversity that is based on each local site local contributions to beta diversity lcbd are proposed to quantify the community uniqueness of each site a lower lcbd value indicates a site with a smaller difference in species composition legendre and de caceres 2013 the lcbd can explain the site from a biological conservation perspective and large lcbd values represent the sites of high conservation values legendre 2014 thus although rarely used to quantify biotic homogenization in literature we proposed that the lcbd could be a complementary metric to pairwise similarity to help understand biotic homogenization and provide a theoretical reference for ecological conservation here we studied bacterial and fungal communities from water and sediments of 40 shallow lakes in the yangtze huaihe river basin china and investigated the patterns of beta diversity quantified by the pairwise similarity and lcbd along the trophic gradient this basin has the most abundant water sources in china with the highest density of lakes and number of freshwater lakes it is an area with a relatively high level of urbanization and agricultural development li et al 2019 due to extensive human activities and accelerated urbanization it has become a representative area characterized by increasing eutrophication liu et al 2020a our main aims were to determine the following questions 1 are there general patterns of beta diversity along the trophic gradient for bacteria and fungi in water and sediments if so do these patterns prove the existence of biological homogenization 2 what are the main environmental drivers of microbial community compositions considering eutrophication heavy metal pollution or other physicochemical factors 3 what kind of species that is specialists or generalists contribute more to beta diversity and explain the observed biological homogenization 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling from august to september 2019 we collected paired samples from water and surface sediments at 98 sites in 40 lakes in the yangtze huaihe river basin china 28 55 33 29 n 113 00 119 80 e fig 1 a we selected 1 4 sampling sites according to the area of each lake and avoided the sites with obvious human disturbance such as dredging hydrological engineering and cage aquaculture at each site the water from the upper 50 cm lake surface layer was collected with the schindler sampler and then the surface sediment 0 1 cm was collected with a 6 cm diameter gravity core it should be noted that surface sediments could not be retrieved with our sampling cores in several sites and thus we finally obtained 98 and 80 samples for water and sediment habitats respectively in situ latitude and longitude were recorded using a gps device we measured environmental variables using a portable multiparameter water quality analyzer proplus ysi usa including water depth wd water conductivity spc ph transparency sd turbidity tub dissolved oxygen do and water temperature wt after thorough mixing all samples were placed in sealed containers and stored at 20 c before further analysis including dna extraction and chemical analyses for the water sample analysis we used the unfiltered water to analyze the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp and the filtered water with a 0 7 μm gff membrane to measure the dissolved total nitrogen dtn ammonium nitrogen nh4 nitrate nitrogen no3 nitrite nitrogen no2 dissolved total phosphorus dtp and dissolved phosphate ion po4 3 we measured main ions such as k na ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 using ion chromatography dionex dx 600 usa in addition chlorophyll a chl a was extracted by acetone solution and quantified by spectrophotometry steinman et al 2017 for surface sediments 0 7 g freeze dried sediment was mixed with 30 ml of deionized water followed by ultrasonic treatment for 2 h and centrifugation at 4 000 rpm for 40 min the centrifuged supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane to obtain the sediment extract the ammonium nitrogen nh4 nitrate nitrogen no3 nitrite nitrogen no2 total phosphorus tp dissolved phosphate ion po4 3 and dissolved total organic carbon doc of the sediment extract were measured the conductivity spc and ph were obtained by measuring the liquid obtained by mixing 0 3 g freeze dried sample with 6 ml of deionized water in addition we used icp aes to measure metal elements including al ba be k mg mn na ca fe sr ti v zn cr co ni cu as mo cd sb tl and pb to evaluate the trophic status of each site we calculated a trophic state index tsi based on the concentrations of tn tp chl a and sd in the water environment carlson 1977 zhang et al 2018b specifically the calculation of the tsi was as follows 1 tsi 0 326 tsi chl a 0 219 tsi tn 0 230 tsi tp 0 225 tsi sd 2 tsi chl a 10 2 5 1 086 ln chl a 3 tsi tp 10 9 436 1 624 ln tp 4 tsi tn 10 5 453 1 694 ln tn 5 tsi sd 10 5 118 1 94 ln sd where tsi chl a tsi tn tsi tp and tsi sd are the trophic state index in relation to chl a mg l tn mg l tp mg l and sd m respectively five trophic levels were defined oligotrophic tsi 30 mesotrophic 30 tsi 50 slightly eutrophic 50 tsi 60 moderately eutrophic 60 tsi 70 and highly eutrophic tsi 70 huo et al 2013 for detailed information on the environmental variables of the four trophic groups see supporting information tables s1 and s2 for water and sediments respectively 2 2 sequence analyses we extracted the bacterial and fungal dna from the filtered water and sediment samples using a fastdna spin kit for soil mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions for bacteria the v4 region of 16s rrna genes was amplified in triplicate by pcr with primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 for fungi the its2 region was amplified using primers gits7f 5 gtgartcatcgartctttg 3 and its4r 5 tcctccgcttattgatatgc 3 the pcr products of triplicate reactions were combined and quantified with picogreen eugene or usa and pooled in equal molar amounts to maximize the even sequencing efforts for all samples the pooled mixture was purified with a qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen science germantown md usa and requantified with picogreen sample libraries for sequencing were prepared according to the miseq reagent kit preparation guide illumina san diego ca usa and sequenced on the illumina miseq platform for bacteria the sequences were processed using the script pick open reference otus py in qiime v1 9 1 caporaso et al 2010b sequences longer than 450 bp were denoised with the denoiser algorithm reeder and knight 2010 and clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a 97 similarity level with the seed based uclust algorithm edgar 2010 representative sequences were extracted from each otu and a sequence alignment was performed with pynast caporaso et al 2010a and a taxonomy assignment was performed using the greengenes database desantis et al 2006 for fungi the clustering of otus was the same as for bacteria whereas taxonomic identification of each otu was determined using the unite database nilsson et al 2019 finally the bacterial and fungal sequences were both rarefied at the minimum sequence abundance to ensure that the biodiversity was not influenced by variation in abundance or sampling intensity 2 3 statistical analyses first we performed kruskal wallis and wilcoxon tests to examine the significant differences in each environmental variable for water or sediment samples across different trophic groups in addition the linear and quadratic models were used to explore the relationships between the tsi and nutrient related environmental variables in water tn dtn nh4 no3 no2 tp dtp po4 3 chl a and sd and sediment nh4 no3 no2 tp and po4 3 environments and the better models were selected based on lower values of the akaike information criterion aic yamaoka et al 1978 to analyze the bacterial and fungal community composition we visualized the relative abundances of the top 10 bacterial and fungal phyla in four sample types and explored the relationships between the tsi and relative abundance of these phyla with linear or quadratic models based on the lower value of aic yamaoka et al 1978 second we explored the differences between different trophic groups of bacterial and fungal community structures in water and sediment samples by nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds based on the bray curtis similarity we tested for homogeneity of dispersion using the permutational analysis of multivariate dispersions permdisp anderson et al 2006 which assessed the within group differences using the average value of the individual observation distances to the centroid of the own group in addition we calculated the mean values of beta diversity for each trophic group based on the bray curtis similarity anderson et al 2006 and compared them by kruskal wallis and wilcoxon tests we also used kruskal wallis and wilcoxon tests to determine the variation in alpha diversity across different trophic groups namely the species richness pielou s evenness pielou 1966 shannon shannon 1948 and chao1 chao 1984 indices third to explore the patterns of beta diversity we calculated the bray curtis dissimilarity among different sites and lcbd for each site legendre and de caceres 2013 mantel tests were used to determine the relationships between the tsi change and bray curtis dissimilarity matrices with pearson s correlation and 999 permutations the turnover rate of communities was calculated as the slope of the ordinary least squares regression line fitted to the relationship between the tsi distance and community dissimilarity additionally we explored the relationships between the tsi distance and bray curtis dissimilarity for each trophic group using mantel tests and compared the turnover rate of communities for each trophic group linear or quadratic models were applied to analyze the relationships between lcbd and tsi and the most appropriate models were selected based on aic yamaoka et al 1978 fourth to analyze the important drivers of beta diversity we used distance based redundancy analysis db rda legendre and anderson 1999 multiple regression on distance matrices mrm legendre et al 1994 and multiple linear regression mlr before these analyses we excluded the variables with pearson s correlation coefficients larger than 0 7 leathwick et al 2006 rda was used to select the important drivers for community composition with hellinger transformation legendre and gallagher 2001 mrm analyses were conducted to quantify the relative importance of the environmental variables on the bray curtis distance for bacteria and fungi all environmental variables were z score standardized i e mean 0 sd 1 before the mrm analyses as these standardizations can make the importance of all environmental variables comparable we chose the final models using forward selection of explanatory variables based on aic that best accounted for variation in beta diversity and used the partial regression coefficients of these variables as the measure of the relative importance of variables on response variables furthermore mlr was employed to examine environmental drivers of lcbd for the mlr analyses the selection method of the final models was similar to mrm and the partial regression coefficients of each variable were used to compare the effect of each variable on the lcbd finally to test to what degree the homogenization is affected by generalist and specialist species we estimated each species niche breadth along the tsi gradients that is tsi range size by the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum of species tsi values across all samples and then gradually removed the species with large or small niche breadths from the observed communities i e tsi range size respectively wang et al 2020 for each taxonomic group in both water and sediments we classified the species into 20 range size categories according to their tsi range size for example for generalist species we removed the species starting from the category of the largest tsi range size for the observed community and then recalculated the bray curtis dissimilarity and lcbd respectively we used the bray curtis dissimilarity as the response variable for all subcommunities and assessed the effects of tsi on beta diversity in each scenario by linear models and mrm analyses the slopes in the linear model and partial regression coefficients of tsi in the mrm model were used to quantify the effects of removal of generalist species on the degrees of biotic homogenization additionally we selected the lcbd as response variables and linear models and mlr analyses were used to determine the influences of the tsi on beta diversity for all sub communities the effects of generalist species removal on the degrees of biotic homogenization can be compared by the slopes in the linear model and partial regression coefficients of tsi in the mlr model we used the novel approach to explore the relative importance of generalists and specialists on biotic homogenization which has no specific bias in thresholds in relative abundance and or species occurrence for selecting or grouping species to confirm the reliability of our results we also classified the species into 20 categories based on levins niche breadth b levins 1968 a traditional niche breadth index and then performed the same analyses furthermore we divided all species into generalist neutral taxa and specialist groups according to neutral model sloan et al 2006 and explored the relationships for each group between the tsi distance and bray curtis dissimilarity and between lcbd and tsi using mantel tests and linear models respectively more detailed information about traditional statistical analyses based on levins niche breadth supplementary materials and methods and the corresponding results figs s1 s4 are provided in supplementary materials moreover we calculated the species contribution of beta diversity scbd to verify the importance of generalist and specialist species to biotic homogenization legendre and de caceres 2013 we quantified the relative contributions of deterministic processes and stochastic processes by using null model analysis based on the raup crick metric of beta diversity βrc chase et al 2011 for all sub communities we were unable to distinguish detailed ecological processes combining both phylogenetic beta diversity and βrc ning et al 2020 stegen et al 2015 because the its based fungal phylogenetic information is not reliable schoch et al 2012 all of the above statistical analyses were conducted with stats v3 6 0 base v3 6 0 mass v7 3 54 ripley et al 2013 circlize v0 4 13 gu et al 2014 vegan v2 5 7 oksanen et al 2013 and adespatial 0 3 14 in r 3 6 0 3 results the 98 sampling sites had a mean tsi of 60 13 ranging from 38 62 to 76 89 and most sites were eutrophic according to a tsi threshold larger than 50 zhang et al 2018b we categorized the sites into four trophic groups based on the calculated tsi mesotrophic 30 tsi 50 19 sites slightly eutrophic 50 tsi 60 24 sites moderately eutrophic 60 tsi 70 42 sites and highly eutrophic tsi 70 13 sites we found that the environmental variables related to eutrophication or nutrient levels generally showed significant relationships with tsi in both water and sediment habitats fig s5 p 0 05 for instance chlorophyll a total nitrogen and dissolved total nitrogen in water tended to increase with increasing tsi while the transparency decreased the phosphorus content in water total phosphorus dissolved total phosphorus and dissolved po4 3 and sediments total phosphorus and dissolved po4 3 exhibited consistent u shaped patterns along the tsi gradient reaching a minimum at tsi values between 45 and 60 however the dissolved nh4 no3 and no2 showed non significant patterns for both habitats fig s5 p 0 05 furthermore the above variables of both habitats generally supported the classification of trophic groups by showing significant differences among the four groups tables s1 and s2 p 0 05 the main phyla of the two taxonomic groups also showed predictable patterns along the tsi gradient for bacteria the most abundant phyla in water were proteobacteria and actinobacteria followed by bacteroidetes while proteobacteria was most abundant in sediments followed by chloroflexi fig 1b in water the relative abundances of chlamydiae and planctomycetes increased with tsi fig s6 p 0 05 in sediments the relative abundance of acidobacteria and actinobacteria in sediments decreased with increasing tsi while that of bacteroidetes increased toward high tsi fig s6 p 0 05 for fungi the most abundant phylum in both habitats was ascomycota followed by basidiomycota in water and by rozellomycota and basidiomycota in sediments fig 1b the relative abundances of ascomycota basidiomycota and chytridiomycota in sediments and ascomycota in water decreased with increasing tsi fig s6 p 0 05 along the trophic gradient we observed taxonomic homogenization for bacteria and fungi bacterial and fungal communities in water and sediments generally became more clustered in highly eutrophic lakes measured by the distance to group centroid fig 2 a table s3 such a phenomenon can be supported by the average bray curtis dissimilarity for each trophic group which showed lower values in highly eutrophic lakes than in lakes with lower trophic status table s4 moreover the average richness increased toward higher trophic groups for bacteria and fungi in water but not in sediments table s5 the taxonomic homogenizations were also confirmed by quantifying the changes in beta diversity indicated by the lcbd and bray curtis dissimilarity along tsi for bacteria or fungi in both habitats there were consistent environmental distance decay relationships along tsi changes fig 2b p 0 05 and the communities in mesotrophic lakes showed the fastest turnover rates with the highest slopes fig s7 in both habitats lcbd showed significantly negative correlations with the tsi for fungi fig 2c p 0 01 but non significant correlations for bacteria fig 2c p 0 05 the tsi was further revealed to be a primary driver of bacterial and fungal community compositions in water or sediments we used rda to select environmental variables affecting bacterial and fungal community compositions and mrm analyses and multiple linear regressions for lcbd to investigate the drivers of beta diversity pairwise dissimilarity and lcbd in these three analyses tsi was generally selected as a significant predictor for both taxonomic groups in water and sediments fig 3 although the first and second axes of the rda wb 10 8 and 4 8 sb 6 7 and 4 5 wf 4 2 and 3 0 sf 5 6 and 4 5 only explained a small amount of the variation observed and r2 values of the final models of the mrm wb 0 211 sb 0 393 wf 0 180 sf 0 190 and multiple regression wb 0 295 sb 0 395 wf 0 167 sf 0 319 were also low fig 3 additionally rda analyses showed that ph and water temperature were the main drivers for both bacterial and fungal communities in water while water depth ph and nh4 and metal elements such as mo were the main drivers for sediment communities fig 3a notably the community composition in water was significantly impacted by the turbidity for bacteria and the dissolved total phosphorus for fungi while the community composition in sediments was significantly impacted by the dissolved organic carbon for bacteria and the total phosphorus for fungi fig 3a in line with the rda results mrm analyses revealed that community dissimilarity was largely driven by water temperature and ph for bacteria and fungi in water and by metal elements water depth ph and nh4 for sediments in the multiple linear regression for lcbd the most important drivers were water temperature and tsi for bacteria in water followed by the potassium and electrical conductivity while tsi was a driver for fungi in water followed by potassium fig 3c in sediments the most important driver was aluminum for the bacterial lcbd followed by nickel while the nh4 and tsi were the most important drivers for fungi generalist species quantified by large tsi range sizes generally showed stronger environmental affinity along the trophic gradient and contributed more to biotic taxonomic homogenizations for instance the slopes of the relationships between the community dissimilarity and tsi changes decreased when generalist species were gradually removed for bacteria and fungi in both habitats except for bacteria in sediments figs 4 a and s8a in the mrm analyses the removal of generalist species resulted in lower absolute values of the partial regression coefficients of tsi with the exception of bacteria in sediments fig 4b the above importance of generalist species to the beta diversity was further supported by the sequential removal of specialist species which showed that the slopes of the relationships between the community dissimilarity and tsi changes or partial regression coefficients of tsi in mrm analyses increased albeit very slightly except for bacteria in sediments fig s9a and b therefore biotic homogenization with increasing tsi is largely driven by generalist species rather than specialist species notably when we used the lcbd to quantify beta diversity the results were highly consistent with the above results using pairwise dissimilarity for instance the removal of generalist species led to decreased slopes of the relationships between lcbd and tsi and lower absolute values of the partial regression of tsi in multiple regression analyses except for bacteria in sediments fig 4c and d while the removal of specialist species resulted in the increase of above two parameters for both taxonomic groups in water but not in sediments fig s9c and d these results indicate that generalist species contribute more to the decreases in ecological uniqueness along the trophic gradient and lcbd is a valuable indicator to reveal biological homogenization at regional scales additionally deterministic processes generally decreased when generalist species were removed but increased when specialist species were removed albeit very slightly fig s10 4 discussion rapid eutrophication of natural freshwater environments has become a major global concern threatening water environmental quality and biodiversity ansari et al 2010 kiersztyn et al 2019 understanding the effects of eutrophication on microbes is crucial for aquatic ecosystems falkowski et al 2008 due to their key roles in biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem functioning in this study we used pairwise dissimilarity and lcbd to explore the beta diversity patterns for bacterial and fungal communities in lake water and sediments along the trophic gradient and investigated the drivers underlying the observed beta diversity we conclude three main findings 1 eutrophication causes the alteration of physicochemical factors and leads to bacterial and fungal community homogenization 2 although the tsi plays pivotal roles in bacterial and fungal community variation other physicochemical variables and heavy metal elements have nonnegligible influences 3 generalist species generally explain more variations in beta diversity along the tsi gradient and contribute more strongly to biotic homogenization we generally observed biotic homogenization toward high trophic levels for bacterial and fungal communities in both water and sediments which is supported by several lines of evidence first there were reduced similarities among bacterial and fungal communities with higher trophic status this is indicated by a more concentrated cluster in highly eutrophic lakes than in other trophic statuses in ordination plots fig 2a which is the predominant approach to quantify biotic homogenization with the dispersion metric calculated by the distance to group centroid in permdisp analysis hawkins et al 2015 holman et al 2021 huber et al 2020 second there were generally lower mean dissimilarities for bacteria or fungi in both water and sediments in the highly eutrophic lake group suggesting that the overall trend of community composition became similar along with the intensification of eutrophication finally there were significant declines in lcbd with increasing tsi for fungi such patterns have also been documented for macroorganisms such as the benthic macroinvertebrates in 41 lakes of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze and huaihe rivers zhang et al 2018a and fish communities in 53 danish lakes menezes et al 2015 for macroorganisms the mechanisms of biotic homogenization are generally explored from three aspects 1 extinction of native species 2 invasion of widespread nonnative species and 3 range expansion of native generalists holmes and webster 2010 muthukrishnan et al 2020 villeger et al 2011 however it is challenging to apply these three mechanisms for microbes largely due to the lack of feasibility in a clear definition of native and nonnative species we thus developed an approach by gradual removal of generalists from observed communities which could provide a scenario to mimic the gradual extinction of generalists to some extent and examine the roles of generalists in biotic homogenization we proposed that the observed biotic homogenization caused by eutrophication may primarily result from the following three reasons first habitat heterogeneity referring to the spatial and temporal variations in environmental variables shade et al 2008 could be the main cause of biotic homogenization this is because the habitat heterogeneity is a major determinant of beta diversity astorga et al 2014 and its reduction suggests fewer niches available in an ecosystem shade et al 2008 increased competition among species for limited resources and possible extinction of competitively inferior native species macrophytes can provide habitats and food for other organisms and have vital roles in structuring communities in aquatic environments declerck et al 2005 in highly eutrophic systems the loss of macrophytes and subsequent dominance of phytoplankton tend to decrease the overall habitat heterogeneity second environmental filtering has a high probability of being a powerful mechanism for biotic homogenization because harsh environments such as eutrophication could decrease the importance of stochastic processes in structuring assemblages leading to biotic homogenization mcgoff et al 2013 zhang et al 2018a environmental filtering tends to exclude more sensitive species and favor more adapted pollution tolerant species ultimately leading to biotic homogenization via the range expansion of pollution tolerant species and the decline or extinction of pollution intolerant species third eutrophication can result in homogenization by regulating interspecies interactions langenheder and jurgens 2001 for instance interactions between phytoplankton and bacteria have been shown to influence bacterioplankton community composition currie 1990 paver et al 2013 su et al 2017 phytoplankton can play a vital role in shaping the bacterial community by providing a source of organic matter as dissolved organic carbon produced by different species of phytoplankton leads to selection for different bacterial communities that have different utilization capacities for organic matter li et al 2017 sarmento and gasol 2012 additionally phytoplankton can also negatively affect the bacterial community through nutrient competition rivkin and anderson 1997 our results reveal that eutrophication plays a vital role in microbial community composition and beta diversity in water and sediments which may be driven by multiple environmental variables the microbial community composition is influenced by environmental variables related to nutrient enrichment such as organic carbon ph and heavy metals dissolved organic carbon produced by the photosynthesis of phytoplankton is an important carbon source for planktonic bacteria cole et al 1982 eutrophication causes the production of large amounts of algae derived organic matter leading to changes in organic mass sources and influencing bacterial community structure han et al 2020 additionally ph is a major environmental driver of the microbial community by regulating the relative importance and interplay between niche related and neutral processes ren et al 2015 nutrient enrichment tends to accompany heavy metal pollution in many human impacted aquatic ecosystems jaiswal and pandey 2019 heavy metals often exhibit negative impacts on microbial community such as the declines in microbial diversity and enzyme activities hoostal et al 2008 moreover the responses of microbial community structure and function to heavy metals may be stronger than those to nutrient enrichment zhang et al 2021 on the other hand microbial community composition can be synergistically driven by eutrophication and other environmental variables such as temperature it has been reported that the effect of temperature on species richness is greatest at extreme nutrient levels whereas the effects of nutrients on species richness are strongest at intermediate temperatures wang et al 2016 moreover slight warming may not significantly change the bacterial community composition in the mesocosms by itself but the bacterial community composition shifts when warming acts in concert with nutrient enrichment ren et al 2017 it should be noted that nutrients and temperature may influence lake microbial communities largely independently schulhof et al 2020 collectively the microbial community structure is the combined effect of multiple environmental variables but knowledge on the interaction mechanisms of these factors remains poor most importantly we observed that generalist species with larger tsi range size may contribute more to beta diversity than specialists and play a key role in biotic homogenization along trophic gradients the importance of generalists is also supported by the metric scbd which was higher than that of specialists fig s11 this importance may be explained by the following reasons first our collected samples covered a relatively large trophic gradient along which nutrient enrichment conditions could result in a decline in the competitive advantage of specialists leading to the dominance of generalists in community assembly cook et al 2018 generalist species can tolerate a wide environmental range such that they have a decreased probability of local extinction in the whole study area szekely and langenheder 2014 and the variation in beta diversity may be mainly due to the change in their own relative abundance fig s12 second specialist species usually occur in specific habitats and are low in abundance lindh et al 2016 they are more sensitive to environmental changes than generalists and very slight environmental changes may cause the loss of species monard et al 2016 in addition we found that there was a lower proportion of deterministic processes in community assembly for specialists fig s10 which indicates that species gain and loss are likely to result from stochastic processes such as random birth and death events jiao et al 2020 such frequent species gain and loss is likely responsible for the low contribution of specialists to variations in beta diversity leading to the relatively stable uniqueness of specialist community compositions at all sites with consistently high dissimilarity between any two sites collectively most of the variations in beta diversity are attributed to the response of generalists to eutrophication and thus generalists could be better indicator species of lake trophic status than specialists 5 conclusion to our knowledge our findings for the first time revealed the occurrence of biotic homogenization of microbes in water and sediments along trophic gradients this suggests that biotic impoverishment might become more severe in the coming years if eutrophication is not effectively improved therefore we believe that further observation of the microbial community under eutrophication is necessary the mechanism of biotic homogenization caused by eutrophication should be identified before biotic impoverishment worsens moreover our study reveals that generalist species contribute more to the variation in beta diversity than specialist species to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the effects of eutrophication on the microbial community we suggest that generalists and specialists should be distinguished to explore the mechanism of variation in beta diversity in future studies data availability the 16s rrna sequences were deposited in the node project under accession number

16374,eutrophication substantially influences the community structure of aquatic organisms and has become a major threat to biodiversity however whether eutrophication is linked to homogenization of microbial communities and the possible underlying mechanisms are poorly understood here we studied bacterial and fungal communities from water and sediments of 40 shallow lakes in the yangtze huaihe river basin a representative area characterized by intensifying eutrophication in china and further examined the beta diversity patterns and underlying mechanisms under eutrophication conditions our results indicate that eutrophication generally caused biotic homogenization of bacterial and fungal communities in both habitats showing decreased community variations for the sites with a higher trophic state index tsi in the two habitats community dissimilarities were positively correlated with tsi changes for both taxonomic groups while the local contribution to beta diversity lcbd remarkably declined with increasing tsi for the fungal community these phenomena were consistent with the pivotal importance of the tsi in statistically accounting for beta diversity of bacterial and fungal communities in both habitats in addition we found that physicochemical factors such as water temperature and ph were also important for bacterial and fungal communities in water while heavy metal elements were important for the communities in sediments interestingly generalist species rather than specialist species were revealed to more dominantly affect the variations in beta diversity along the trophic gradient which were quantified by bray curtis dissimilarity and lcbd collectively our findings reveal the importance of generalist species in contributing to the change of beta diversity of microbial communities along trophic gradients which have profound implications for a comprehensive understanding of the effects of eutrophication on microbial community graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biotic homogenization eutrophication generalist species local contributions to beta diversity lcbd beta diversity 1 introduction eutrophication has become a global aquatic environmental issue often resulting in the swamping of lakes deterioration of water quality loss of diversity and changes of ecosystem structure and function alexander et al 2017 ansari et al 2010 one of the main consequences caused by eutrophication is biotic homogenization mckinney and lockwood 1999 a complex process in which the compositional similarity between communities increases otto et al 2020 as has previously been observed in macroorganisms such as fish menezes et al 2015 macrophytes salgado et al 2018 macroinvertebrates donohue et al 2009 and zooplankton liu et al 2020b theoretically the occurrence of biotic homogenization could be simply summarized as the following three aspects 1 extinction of native species 2 invasion of widespread nonnative species and 3 range expansion of native generalists mckinney and lockwood 2001 olden et al 2004 for example in the case of fish it has been reported that worldwide freshwater fish homogenization is strongly driven by the species translocated within a realm and by only a few nonnative generalists whereas most nonnative species contribute to the differentiation effect toussaint et al 2016 similarly the increased community similarity of aquatic macrophytes may be caused by invasive species via their own presence in multiple sites and influence on the composition of native species muthukrishnan et al 2020 however current understandings of homogenization of aquatic biological communities particularly microbes remain elusive biotic homogenization can be quantified by beta diversity which can be calculated using the dissimilarity indices such as bray curtis and jaccard dissimilarity bray and curtis 1957 jaccard 1900 and the ecological uniqueness of local site legendre and de caceres 2013 the selection of indicators is important for quantifying biotic homogenization because they can capture different aspects of information about the community petsch 2016 the most straightforward and commonly used beta diversity indicator for quantifying biotic homogenization is the dissimilarity index among which the bray curtis and jaccard dissimilarity are used most frequently in homogenization studies baeten et al 2012 jaccard s dissimilarity index is used most frequently for occurrence data while the bray curtis dissimilarity index is appropriate for the data with abundance information olden and rooney 2006 biotic homogenization can be measured by comparing the dissimilarity among biological communities at two distinct times or the average pairwise dissimilarity between sites in different environmental states and the degree of homogenization can be evaluated by comparing the change rate of the dissimilarity index with temporal or spatial distance petsch 2016 in addition as another beta diversity that is based on each local site local contributions to beta diversity lcbd are proposed to quantify the community uniqueness of each site a lower lcbd value indicates a site with a smaller difference in species composition legendre and de caceres 2013 the lcbd can explain the site from a biological conservation perspective and large lcbd values represent the sites of high conservation values legendre 2014 thus although rarely used to quantify biotic homogenization in literature we proposed that the lcbd could be a complementary metric to pairwise similarity to help understand biotic homogenization and provide a theoretical reference for ecological conservation here we studied bacterial and fungal communities from water and sediments of 40 shallow lakes in the yangtze huaihe river basin china and investigated the patterns of beta diversity quantified by the pairwise similarity and lcbd along the trophic gradient this basin has the most abundant water sources in china with the highest density of lakes and number of freshwater lakes it is an area with a relatively high level of urbanization and agricultural development li et al 2019 due to extensive human activities and accelerated urbanization it has become a representative area characterized by increasing eutrophication liu et al 2020a our main aims were to determine the following questions 1 are there general patterns of beta diversity along the trophic gradient for bacteria and fungi in water and sediments if so do these patterns prove the existence of biological homogenization 2 what are the main environmental drivers of microbial community compositions considering eutrophication heavy metal pollution or other physicochemical factors 3 what kind of species that is specialists or generalists contribute more to beta diversity and explain the observed biological homogenization 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling from august to september 2019 we collected paired samples from water and surface sediments at 98 sites in 40 lakes in the yangtze huaihe river basin china 28 55 33 29 n 113 00 119 80 e fig 1 a we selected 1 4 sampling sites according to the area of each lake and avoided the sites with obvious human disturbance such as dredging hydrological engineering and cage aquaculture at each site the water from the upper 50 cm lake surface layer was collected with the schindler sampler and then the surface sediment 0 1 cm was collected with a 6 cm diameter gravity core it should be noted that surface sediments could not be retrieved with our sampling cores in several sites and thus we finally obtained 98 and 80 samples for water and sediment habitats respectively in situ latitude and longitude were recorded using a gps device we measured environmental variables using a portable multiparameter water quality analyzer proplus ysi usa including water depth wd water conductivity spc ph transparency sd turbidity tub dissolved oxygen do and water temperature wt after thorough mixing all samples were placed in sealed containers and stored at 20 c before further analysis including dna extraction and chemical analyses for the water sample analysis we used the unfiltered water to analyze the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp and the filtered water with a 0 7 μm gff membrane to measure the dissolved total nitrogen dtn ammonium nitrogen nh4 nitrate nitrogen no3 nitrite nitrogen no2 dissolved total phosphorus dtp and dissolved phosphate ion po4 3 we measured main ions such as k na ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 using ion chromatography dionex dx 600 usa in addition chlorophyll a chl a was extracted by acetone solution and quantified by spectrophotometry steinman et al 2017 for surface sediments 0 7 g freeze dried sediment was mixed with 30 ml of deionized water followed by ultrasonic treatment for 2 h and centrifugation at 4 000 rpm for 40 min the centrifuged supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane to obtain the sediment extract the ammonium nitrogen nh4 nitrate nitrogen no3 nitrite nitrogen no2 total phosphorus tp dissolved phosphate ion po4 3 and dissolved total organic carbon doc of the sediment extract were measured the conductivity spc and ph were obtained by measuring the liquid obtained by mixing 0 3 g freeze dried sample with 6 ml of deionized water in addition we used icp aes to measure metal elements including al ba be k mg mn na ca fe sr ti v zn cr co ni cu as mo cd sb tl and pb to evaluate the trophic status of each site we calculated a trophic state index tsi based on the concentrations of tn tp chl a and sd in the water environment carlson 1977 zhang et al 2018b specifically the calculation of the tsi was as follows 1 tsi 0 326 tsi chl a 0 219 tsi tn 0 230 tsi tp 0 225 tsi sd 2 tsi chl a 10 2 5 1 086 ln chl a 3 tsi tp 10 9 436 1 624 ln tp 4 tsi tn 10 5 453 1 694 ln tn 5 tsi sd 10 5 118 1 94 ln sd where tsi chl a tsi tn tsi tp and tsi sd are the trophic state index in relation to chl a mg l tn mg l tp mg l and sd m respectively five trophic levels were defined oligotrophic tsi 30 mesotrophic 30 tsi 50 slightly eutrophic 50 tsi 60 moderately eutrophic 60 tsi 70 and highly eutrophic tsi 70 huo et al 2013 for detailed information on the environmental variables of the four trophic groups see supporting information tables s1 and s2 for water and sediments respectively 2 2 sequence analyses we extracted the bacterial and fungal dna from the filtered water and sediment samples using a fastdna spin kit for soil mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions for bacteria the v4 region of 16s rrna genes was amplified in triplicate by pcr with primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 for fungi the its2 region was amplified using primers gits7f 5 gtgartcatcgartctttg 3 and its4r 5 tcctccgcttattgatatgc 3 the pcr products of triplicate reactions were combined and quantified with picogreen eugene or usa and pooled in equal molar amounts to maximize the even sequencing efforts for all samples the pooled mixture was purified with a qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen science germantown md usa and requantified with picogreen sample libraries for sequencing were prepared according to the miseq reagent kit preparation guide illumina san diego ca usa and sequenced on the illumina miseq platform for bacteria the sequences were processed using the script pick open reference otus py in qiime v1 9 1 caporaso et al 2010b sequences longer than 450 bp were denoised with the denoiser algorithm reeder and knight 2010 and clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a 97 similarity level with the seed based uclust algorithm edgar 2010 representative sequences were extracted from each otu and a sequence alignment was performed with pynast caporaso et al 2010a and a taxonomy assignment was performed using the greengenes database desantis et al 2006 for fungi the clustering of otus was the same as for bacteria whereas taxonomic identification of each otu was determined using the unite database nilsson et al 2019 finally the bacterial and fungal sequences were both rarefied at the minimum sequence abundance to ensure that the biodiversity was not influenced by variation in abundance or sampling intensity 2 3 statistical analyses first we performed kruskal wallis and wilcoxon tests to examine the significant differences in each environmental variable for water or sediment samples across different trophic groups in addition the linear and quadratic models were used to explore the relationships between the tsi and nutrient related environmental variables in water tn dtn nh4 no3 no2 tp dtp po4 3 chl a and sd and sediment nh4 no3 no2 tp and po4 3 environments and the better models were selected based on lower values of the akaike information criterion aic yamaoka et al 1978 to analyze the bacterial and fungal community composition we visualized the relative abundances of the top 10 bacterial and fungal phyla in four sample types and explored the relationships between the tsi and relative abundance of these phyla with linear or quadratic models based on the lower value of aic yamaoka et al 1978 second we explored the differences between different trophic groups of bacterial and fungal community structures in water and sediment samples by nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds based on the bray curtis similarity we tested for homogeneity of dispersion using the permutational analysis of multivariate dispersions permdisp anderson et al 2006 which assessed the within group differences using the average value of the individual observation distances to the centroid of the own group in addition we calculated the mean values of beta diversity for each trophic group based on the bray curtis similarity anderson et al 2006 and compared them by kruskal wallis and wilcoxon tests we also used kruskal wallis and wilcoxon tests to determine the variation in alpha diversity across different trophic groups namely the species richness pielou s evenness pielou 1966 shannon shannon 1948 and chao1 chao 1984 indices third to explore the patterns of beta diversity we calculated the bray curtis dissimilarity among different sites and lcbd for each site legendre and de caceres 2013 mantel tests were used to determine the relationships between the tsi change and bray curtis dissimilarity matrices with pearson s correlation and 999 permutations the turnover rate of communities was calculated as the slope of the ordinary least squares regression line fitted to the relationship between the tsi distance and community dissimilarity additionally we explored the relationships between the tsi distance and bray curtis dissimilarity for each trophic group using mantel tests and compared the turnover rate of communities for each trophic group linear or quadratic models were applied to analyze the relationships between lcbd and tsi and the most appropriate models were selected based on aic yamaoka et al 1978 fourth to analyze the important drivers of beta diversity we used distance based redundancy analysis db rda legendre and anderson 1999 multiple regression on distance matrices mrm legendre et al 1994 and multiple linear regression mlr before these analyses we excluded the variables with pearson s correlation coefficients larger than 0 7 leathwick et al 2006 rda was used to select the important drivers for community composition with hellinger transformation legendre and gallagher 2001 mrm analyses were conducted to quantify the relative importance of the environmental variables on the bray curtis distance for bacteria and fungi all environmental variables were z score standardized i e mean 0 sd 1 before the mrm analyses as these standardizations can make the importance of all environmental variables comparable we chose the final models using forward selection of explanatory variables based on aic that best accounted for variation in beta diversity and used the partial regression coefficients of these variables as the measure of the relative importance of variables on response variables furthermore mlr was employed to examine environmental drivers of lcbd for the mlr analyses the selection method of the final models was similar to mrm and the partial regression coefficients of each variable were used to compare the effect of each variable on the lcbd finally to test to what degree the homogenization is affected by generalist and specialist species we estimated each species niche breadth along the tsi gradients that is tsi range size by the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum of species tsi values across all samples and then gradually removed the species with large or small niche breadths from the observed communities i e tsi range size respectively wang et al 2020 for each taxonomic group in both water and sediments we classified the species into 20 range size categories according to their tsi range size for example for generalist species we removed the species starting from the category of the largest tsi range size for the observed community and then recalculated the bray curtis dissimilarity and lcbd respectively we used the bray curtis dissimilarity as the response variable for all subcommunities and assessed the effects of tsi on beta diversity in each scenario by linear models and mrm analyses the slopes in the linear model and partial regression coefficients of tsi in the mrm model were used to quantify the effects of removal of generalist species on the degrees of biotic homogenization additionally we selected the lcbd as response variables and linear models and mlr analyses were used to determine the influences of the tsi on beta diversity for all sub communities the effects of generalist species removal on the degrees of biotic homogenization can be compared by the slopes in the linear model and partial regression coefficients of tsi in the mlr model we used the novel approach to explore the relative importance of generalists and specialists on biotic homogenization which has no specific bias in thresholds in relative abundance and or species occurrence for selecting or grouping species to confirm the reliability of our results we also classified the species into 20 categories based on levins niche breadth b levins 1968 a traditional niche breadth index and then performed the same analyses furthermore we divided all species into generalist neutral taxa and specialist groups according to neutral model sloan et al 2006 and explored the relationships for each group between the tsi distance and bray curtis dissimilarity and between lcbd and tsi using mantel tests and linear models respectively more detailed information about traditional statistical analyses based on levins niche breadth supplementary materials and methods and the corresponding results figs s1 s4 are provided in supplementary materials moreover we calculated the species contribution of beta diversity scbd to verify the importance of generalist and specialist species to biotic homogenization legendre and de caceres 2013 we quantified the relative contributions of deterministic processes and stochastic processes by using null model analysis based on the raup crick metric of beta diversity βrc chase et al 2011 for all sub communities we were unable to distinguish detailed ecological processes combining both phylogenetic beta diversity and βrc ning et al 2020 stegen et al 2015 because the its based fungal phylogenetic information is not reliable schoch et al 2012 all of the above statistical analyses were conducted with stats v3 6 0 base v3 6 0 mass v7 3 54 ripley et al 2013 circlize v0 4 13 gu et al 2014 vegan v2 5 7 oksanen et al 2013 and adespatial 0 3 14 in r 3 6 0 3 results the 98 sampling sites had a mean tsi of 60 13 ranging from 38 62 to 76 89 and most sites were eutrophic according to a tsi threshold larger than 50 zhang et al 2018b we categorized the sites into four trophic groups based on the calculated tsi mesotrophic 30 tsi 50 19 sites slightly eutrophic 50 tsi 60 24 sites moderately eutrophic 60 tsi 70 42 sites and highly eutrophic tsi 70 13 sites we found that the environmental variables related to eutrophication or nutrient levels generally showed significant relationships with tsi in both water and sediment habitats fig s5 p 0 05 for instance chlorophyll a total nitrogen and dissolved total nitrogen in water tended to increase with increasing tsi while the transparency decreased the phosphorus content in water total phosphorus dissolved total phosphorus and dissolved po4 3 and sediments total phosphorus and dissolved po4 3 exhibited consistent u shaped patterns along the tsi gradient reaching a minimum at tsi values between 45 and 60 however the dissolved nh4 no3 and no2 showed non significant patterns for both habitats fig s5 p 0 05 furthermore the above variables of both habitats generally supported the classification of trophic groups by showing significant differences among the four groups tables s1 and s2 p 0 05 the main phyla of the two taxonomic groups also showed predictable patterns along the tsi gradient for bacteria the most abundant phyla in water were proteobacteria and actinobacteria followed by bacteroidetes while proteobacteria was most abundant in sediments followed by chloroflexi fig 1b in water the relative abundances of chlamydiae and planctomycetes increased with tsi fig s6 p 0 05 in sediments the relative abundance of acidobacteria and actinobacteria in sediments decreased with increasing tsi while that of bacteroidetes increased toward high tsi fig s6 p 0 05 for fungi the most abundant phylum in both habitats was ascomycota followed by basidiomycota in water and by rozellomycota and basidiomycota in sediments fig 1b the relative abundances of ascomycota basidiomycota and chytridiomycota in sediments and ascomycota in water decreased with increasing tsi fig s6 p 0 05 along the trophic gradient we observed taxonomic homogenization for bacteria and fungi bacterial and fungal communities in water and sediments generally became more clustered in highly eutrophic lakes measured by the distance to group centroid fig 2 a table s3 such a phenomenon can be supported by the average bray curtis dissimilarity for each trophic group which showed lower values in highly eutrophic lakes than in lakes with lower trophic status table s4 moreover the average richness increased toward higher trophic groups for bacteria and fungi in water but not in sediments table s5 the taxonomic homogenizations were also confirmed by quantifying the changes in beta diversity indicated by the lcbd and bray curtis dissimilarity along tsi for bacteria or fungi in both habitats there were consistent environmental distance decay relationships along tsi changes fig 2b p 0 05 and the communities in mesotrophic lakes showed the fastest turnover rates with the highest slopes fig s7 in both habitats lcbd showed significantly negative correlations with the tsi for fungi fig 2c p 0 01 but non significant correlations for bacteria fig 2c p 0 05 the tsi was further revealed to be a primary driver of bacterial and fungal community compositions in water or sediments we used rda to select environmental variables affecting bacterial and fungal community compositions and mrm analyses and multiple linear regressions for lcbd to investigate the drivers of beta diversity pairwise dissimilarity and lcbd in these three analyses tsi was generally selected as a significant predictor for both taxonomic groups in water and sediments fig 3 although the first and second axes of the rda wb 10 8 and 4 8 sb 6 7 and 4 5 wf 4 2 and 3 0 sf 5 6 and 4 5 only explained a small amount of the variation observed and r2 values of the final models of the mrm wb 0 211 sb 0 393 wf 0 180 sf 0 190 and multiple regression wb 0 295 sb 0 395 wf 0 167 sf 0 319 were also low fig 3 additionally rda analyses showed that ph and water temperature were the main drivers for both bacterial and fungal communities in water while water depth ph and nh4 and metal elements such as mo were the main drivers for sediment communities fig 3a notably the community composition in water was significantly impacted by the turbidity for bacteria and the dissolved total phosphorus for fungi while the community composition in sediments was significantly impacted by the dissolved organic carbon for bacteria and the total phosphorus for fungi fig 3a in line with the rda results mrm analyses revealed that community dissimilarity was largely driven by water temperature and ph for bacteria and fungi in water and by metal elements water depth ph and nh4 for sediments in the multiple linear regression for lcbd the most important drivers were water temperature and tsi for bacteria in water followed by the potassium and electrical conductivity while tsi was a driver for fungi in water followed by potassium fig 3c in sediments the most important driver was aluminum for the bacterial lcbd followed by nickel while the nh4 and tsi were the most important drivers for fungi generalist species quantified by large tsi range sizes generally showed stronger environmental affinity along the trophic gradient and contributed more to biotic taxonomic homogenizations for instance the slopes of the relationships between the community dissimilarity and tsi changes decreased when generalist species were gradually removed for bacteria and fungi in both habitats except for bacteria in sediments figs 4 a and s8a in the mrm analyses the removal of generalist species resulted in lower absolute values of the partial regression coefficients of tsi with the exception of bacteria in sediments fig 4b the above importance of generalist species to the beta diversity was further supported by the sequential removal of specialist species which showed that the slopes of the relationships between the community dissimilarity and tsi changes or partial regression coefficients of tsi in mrm analyses increased albeit very slightly except for bacteria in sediments fig s9a and b therefore biotic homogenization with increasing tsi is largely driven by generalist species rather than specialist species notably when we used the lcbd to quantify beta diversity the results were highly consistent with the above results using pairwise dissimilarity for instance the removal of generalist species led to decreased slopes of the relationships between lcbd and tsi and lower absolute values of the partial regression of tsi in multiple regression analyses except for bacteria in sediments fig 4c and d while the removal of specialist species resulted in the increase of above two parameters for both taxonomic groups in water but not in sediments fig s9c and d these results indicate that generalist species contribute more to the decreases in ecological uniqueness along the trophic gradient and lcbd is a valuable indicator to reveal biological homogenization at regional scales additionally deterministic processes generally decreased when generalist species were removed but increased when specialist species were removed albeit very slightly fig s10 4 discussion rapid eutrophication of natural freshwater environments has become a major global concern threatening water environmental quality and biodiversity ansari et al 2010 kiersztyn et al 2019 understanding the effects of eutrophication on microbes is crucial for aquatic ecosystems falkowski et al 2008 due to their key roles in biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem functioning in this study we used pairwise dissimilarity and lcbd to explore the beta diversity patterns for bacterial and fungal communities in lake water and sediments along the trophic gradient and investigated the drivers underlying the observed beta diversity we conclude three main findings 1 eutrophication causes the alteration of physicochemical factors and leads to bacterial and fungal community homogenization 2 although the tsi plays pivotal roles in bacterial and fungal community variation other physicochemical variables and heavy metal elements have nonnegligible influences 3 generalist species generally explain more variations in beta diversity along the tsi gradient and contribute more strongly to biotic homogenization we generally observed biotic homogenization toward high trophic levels for bacterial and fungal communities in both water and sediments which is supported by several lines of evidence first there were reduced similarities among bacterial and fungal communities with higher trophic status this is indicated by a more concentrated cluster in highly eutrophic lakes than in other trophic statuses in ordination plots fig 2a which is the predominant approach to quantify biotic homogenization with the dispersion metric calculated by the distance to group centroid in permdisp analysis hawkins et al 2015 holman et al 2021 huber et al 2020 second there were generally lower mean dissimilarities for bacteria or fungi in both water and sediments in the highly eutrophic lake group suggesting that the overall trend of community composition became similar along with the intensification of eutrophication finally there were significant declines in lcbd with increasing tsi for fungi such patterns have also been documented for macroorganisms such as the benthic macroinvertebrates in 41 lakes of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze and huaihe rivers zhang et al 2018a and fish communities in 53 danish lakes menezes et al 2015 for macroorganisms the mechanisms of biotic homogenization are generally explored from three aspects 1 extinction of native species 2 invasion of widespread nonnative species and 3 range expansion of native generalists holmes and webster 2010 muthukrishnan et al 2020 villeger et al 2011 however it is challenging to apply these three mechanisms for microbes largely due to the lack of feasibility in a clear definition of native and nonnative species we thus developed an approach by gradual removal of generalists from observed communities which could provide a scenario to mimic the gradual extinction of generalists to some extent and examine the roles of generalists in biotic homogenization we proposed that the observed biotic homogenization caused by eutrophication may primarily result from the following three reasons first habitat heterogeneity referring to the spatial and temporal variations in environmental variables shade et al 2008 could be the main cause of biotic homogenization this is because the habitat heterogeneity is a major determinant of beta diversity astorga et al 2014 and its reduction suggests fewer niches available in an ecosystem shade et al 2008 increased competition among species for limited resources and possible extinction of competitively inferior native species macrophytes can provide habitats and food for other organisms and have vital roles in structuring communities in aquatic environments declerck et al 2005 in highly eutrophic systems the loss of macrophytes and subsequent dominance of phytoplankton tend to decrease the overall habitat heterogeneity second environmental filtering has a high probability of being a powerful mechanism for biotic homogenization because harsh environments such as eutrophication could decrease the importance of stochastic processes in structuring assemblages leading to biotic homogenization mcgoff et al 2013 zhang et al 2018a environmental filtering tends to exclude more sensitive species and favor more adapted pollution tolerant species ultimately leading to biotic homogenization via the range expansion of pollution tolerant species and the decline or extinction of pollution intolerant species third eutrophication can result in homogenization by regulating interspecies interactions langenheder and jurgens 2001 for instance interactions between phytoplankton and bacteria have been shown to influence bacterioplankton community composition currie 1990 paver et al 2013 su et al 2017 phytoplankton can play a vital role in shaping the bacterial community by providing a source of organic matter as dissolved organic carbon produced by different species of phytoplankton leads to selection for different bacterial communities that have different utilization capacities for organic matter li et al 2017 sarmento and gasol 2012 additionally phytoplankton can also negatively affect the bacterial community through nutrient competition rivkin and anderson 1997 our results reveal that eutrophication plays a vital role in microbial community composition and beta diversity in water and sediments which may be driven by multiple environmental variables the microbial community composition is influenced by environmental variables related to nutrient enrichment such as organic carbon ph and heavy metals dissolved organic carbon produced by the photosynthesis of phytoplankton is an important carbon source for planktonic bacteria cole et al 1982 eutrophication causes the production of large amounts of algae derived organic matter leading to changes in organic mass sources and influencing bacterial community structure han et al 2020 additionally ph is a major environmental driver of the microbial community by regulating the relative importance and interplay between niche related and neutral processes ren et al 2015 nutrient enrichment tends to accompany heavy metal pollution in many human impacted aquatic ecosystems jaiswal and pandey 2019 heavy metals often exhibit negative impacts on microbial community such as the declines in microbial diversity and enzyme activities hoostal et al 2008 moreover the responses of microbial community structure and function to heavy metals may be stronger than those to nutrient enrichment zhang et al 2021 on the other hand microbial community composition can be synergistically driven by eutrophication and other environmental variables such as temperature it has been reported that the effect of temperature on species richness is greatest at extreme nutrient levels whereas the effects of nutrients on species richness are strongest at intermediate temperatures wang et al 2016 moreover slight warming may not significantly change the bacterial community composition in the mesocosms by itself but the bacterial community composition shifts when warming acts in concert with nutrient enrichment ren et al 2017 it should be noted that nutrients and temperature may influence lake microbial communities largely independently schulhof et al 2020 collectively the microbial community structure is the combined effect of multiple environmental variables but knowledge on the interaction mechanisms of these factors remains poor most importantly we observed that generalist species with larger tsi range size may contribute more to beta diversity than specialists and play a key role in biotic homogenization along trophic gradients the importance of generalists is also supported by the metric scbd which was higher than that of specialists fig s11 this importance may be explained by the following reasons first our collected samples covered a relatively large trophic gradient along which nutrient enrichment conditions could result in a decline in the competitive advantage of specialists leading to the dominance of generalists in community assembly cook et al 2018 generalist species can tolerate a wide environmental range such that they have a decreased probability of local extinction in the whole study area szekely and langenheder 2014 and the variation in beta diversity may be mainly due to the change in their own relative abundance fig s12 second specialist species usually occur in specific habitats and are low in abundance lindh et al 2016 they are more sensitive to environmental changes than generalists and very slight environmental changes may cause the loss of species monard et al 2016 in addition we found that there was a lower proportion of deterministic processes in community assembly for specialists fig s10 which indicates that species gain and loss are likely to result from stochastic processes such as random birth and death events jiao et al 2020 such frequent species gain and loss is likely responsible for the low contribution of specialists to variations in beta diversity leading to the relatively stable uniqueness of specialist community compositions at all sites with consistently high dissimilarity between any two sites collectively most of the variations in beta diversity are attributed to the response of generalists to eutrophication and thus generalists could be better indicator species of lake trophic status than specialists 5 conclusion to our knowledge our findings for the first time revealed the occurrence of biotic homogenization of microbes in water and sediments along trophic gradients this suggests that biotic impoverishment might become more severe in the coming years if eutrophication is not effectively improved therefore we believe that further observation of the microbial community under eutrophication is necessary the mechanism of biotic homogenization caused by eutrophication should be identified before biotic impoverishment worsens moreover our study reveals that generalist species contribute more to the variation in beta diversity than specialist species to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the effects of eutrophication on the microbial community we suggest that generalists and specialists should be distinguished to explore the mechanism of variation in beta diversity in future studies data availability the 16s rrna sequences were deposited in the node project under accession number
