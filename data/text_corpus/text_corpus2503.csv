12515,treatment with ultraviolet uv light is a common option for inactivating waterborne organisms the mercury vapor lamps conventionally used as a source of uv c light for water disinfection are eventually replaced by light emitter diodes leds in the middle term due to their higher efficiency and lack of hazardous materials nonetheless biological mechanisms for repairing uv damage caused by the uv treatment are some of its significant undesirable features the objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the uv resistance and the reactivation degree in different strains of e coli and e faecalis treated with a flow through reactor equipped with leds with an emission range between 265 and 285 nm the treated organisms were subjected to various illumination regimes after the uv irradiation the results obtained indicated that intraspecific differences between the strains of e coli were greater than the interspecific differences with respect to e faecalis in terms of uv resistance and repairing potential the uv doses necessary to achieve four log reductions ranged from 10 2 to 16 3 mj cm 2 for e coli and from 11 1 to 11 4 for mj cm 2 for e faecalis dark repair was not observed within 24 h after the uv irradiation whereas the degree of photorepair depended on both the bacteria strain and the applied uv dose the exposure of the irradiated organisms to an illuminated environment entailed and increasing between the 18 and the 160 of the uv dose required to achieve four log reductions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water disinfection ultraviolet inactivation light emitting diodes leds photoreactivation fecal bacteria data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irradiation with uv light is used for water disinfection in a variety of application fields such as water purification and wastewater reclamation as well as other specific purposes like the treatment of aquaculture effluents and ballast water 1 3 the uv light in the uv c 200 280 nm range interacts with the cell dna and primarily causes the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers that interfere with the dna replication and consequently prevent the cells from reproducing 4 additionally the uv c light induces oxidative damage on other cell structures such as membranes and proteins 5 6 the advantages of the uv treatment with respect to other disinfection technologies include the absence of chemicals that facilitates the treatment application avoids the need for storing potentially hazardous materials and limits the generation of disinfection by products 7 8 on the other hand using uv irradiation for water disinfection has some undesirable features including the lack of a residual disinfection effect and the potential of dna reparation by the treated organisms 9 the uv dna damage repairing mechanisms involve photoreactivation and dark repair the former is an ancestral repair system that is extensively present in organisms in which the photolyase enzyme is activated by the energy of photons with wavelengths from 330 to 480 nm and specifically binds to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and reverses the damage 10 on the other hand the latter is a process that is independent from the light that replaces the damaged dna with new undamaged nucleotides 11 between both of the processes photoreactivation is the major one in terms of the amount of damage that can be repaired 12 the existence of these repairing mechanisms may compromise the quality of the uv treated water due to a dependence of the treatment efficacy on the post treatment illumination conditions the conventional sources of uv light based on mercury vapor are destinated to be replaced by the recently developed uv c light emitter diodes leds in the middle term 13 the current primary disadvantage of uv c leds is their low power conversion into uv light although this occurrence is being addressed in order to increase their feasibility for the water disinfection treatment 14 on the other hand using leds for water disinfection has numerous advantages such as the absence of mercury in their construction higher energy efficiency longer lifetime no need for a warming up period and greater flexibility in the wavelength of emissions and the design of reactors 15 16 recent studies revealed that treatment with varying wavelengths within the uv c spectrum induces different responses in the treated organisms in regard to their uv resistance and their uv damage repair potential 17 18 in addition the survival response to the uv treatment is determined by a set of factors that includes the use of different indicator organisms uv devices and manipulation procedures although the most studied microorganism in water disinfection is escherichia coli because it is the reference microorganism in biology the selected strain for evaluating the treatment can be a crucial parameter 19 the organism enterococcus faecalis is also a bacterial indicator in some specific fields such as the treatment of industrial effluents and ballast water 20 in general the uv resistance of e faecalis is greater than e coli when using traditional mercury uv c lamps 21 this poses a fundamental question regarding the relevance of adopting e coli as a surrogate for water borne pathogenic bacteria for uv disinfection 22 similarly the type of uv device used for treatment determines the survival responses in the tested organisms generally uv inactivation of microorganisms is believed to adhere to the bunsen roscoe photochemical principle it states that the photochemical inactivation depends only on the total energy dose following a time dose reciprocity 23 24 however there may be discrepancies in time dose reciprocity 25 in this context the type of uv reactor that is used may have a certain influence on the treatment outcome in fact the same organisms subjected to the same experimental procedures demonstrated different inactivation kinetics after their irradiation with either a collimated beam reactor or a flow through reactor 26 finally factors such as the growth phase and the pretreatment conditions of the target organisms also influence the survival response by the treated organisms 27 29 this variability in the survival response hinders the comparison of the results from different studies and is thus a concern for the integration of their outcomes in the overall scenario the objective in this study is to quantify the uv resistance and the reactivation degree in different strains of e coli and e faecalis the target organisms were subjected to different uv doses using a flow through reactor equipped with leds with emission between 265 and 285 nm the concentration of viable organisms was measured immediately after the uv irradiation and following an incubation period of 24 h under either an illuminated or dark environment the inactivation curves were fitted into inactivation models to determine the kinetics parameters which allowed the quantitative comparison of the uv resistance and damage repair potential between the different organisms and post treatment conditions that were tested 2 material and methods 2 1 target organisms and microbiological procedures four strains of e coli atcc 11775 atcc 11229 atcc 8739 and atcc 23716 k12 wildtype and two strains of e faecalis atcc 19443 and atcc 27285 were used and compared in this study they were acquired from the spanish type culture collection cect in a lyophilized format the organisms were reactivated in recommended culture medium i e tryptic soy broth scharlab barcelona spain for e coli and brain heart infusion broth scharlab for e faecalis and incubated for 24 h at 37 c aliquots of 1 ml were subsequently sub cultured into fresh medium and again incubated for 24 h the resulting cultures were placed into eppendorf vials and centrifugated at 3000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was discarded and 1 ml of glycerol water 50 50 was added to every vial pellets were stirred resuspended and subsequently stored in a freezer at 20 c for preparing the experimental inoculum one vial with the bacterial suspension was taken from the freezer and reactivated following the same described protocol with a minimum of one and a maximum of three sub culturing steps upon centrifugation the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of distilled water with an added 1 5 ml per liter of phosphate buffer at ph 7 20 the bacterial inoculum was combined with 20 l of buffered distilled water in the plastic deposit attached to the experimental rig see section 2 2 for experimental setup the organisms acclimated for 40 min after which the bacterial concentration was between 1 3 106 and 2 6 106 cfu ml 1 except for e coli atcc 11229 with a mean concentration of 3 4 105 cfu ml 1 after the treatment samples were subjected to membrane filtration 30 agar plating and incubation procedures in order to determine the bacterial concentration depending on the uv dose that was applied volumes between 10 5 and 100 ml were filtered through cellulose acetate membrane with a pore size of 0 45 μm pall corporation ny usa volumes below 1 ml were achieved by ten fold dilutions of the original sample membranes were plated in petri plates with specific chromogenic agar i e microinstant colinstant chromogenic agar scharlab for e coli and slanetz and bartley agar scharlab with a ttc indicator for e faecalis these were incubated at 37 c for 24 h for the e coli and for 48 h in the case of e faecalis colony forming units were counted after the incubation and divided between the filtered volume for determining the bacterial concentration 2 2 uv reactor description and experimental procedure uv treatment was applied by means of a flow through reactor photolab led275 0 4c apria systems s l cantabria spain mounted onto a laboratory experimental rig which consisted of a 20 l plastic deposit a peristaltic pump and the reactor the reactor was equipped with 40 leds with 10 5 mw and emission was between 265 and 275 nm uvc with a maximum of 275 nm leds were distributed in four rows along a square section structure that was placed longitudinally at the center of the reactor they were separated from the target water by a quartz sleeve forming an annular configuration with an irradiated water volume of 0 36 l the uv dose that was applied to the samples was calculated as the product of the mean intensity i m and the exposure time according to previous biodosimetry and actinometry experiments the mean intensity i m provided by the reactor with 100 power was 0 86 mw cm 2 for target water with 275 nm transmittance of 95 31 the optimum range of flow rates was from 55 l h 1 exposure time of 23 6 s and uv dose of 20 3 mj cm 2 to 230 l h 1 exposure time of 5 7 s and uv dose of 4 9 mj cm 2 to achieve uv doses below this value the power of the leds was reduced to a minimum of 20 the uv treatment was applied in an experimental series of samples collected at various flow rates and thus subjected to different uv doses three experimental series were performed for each bacterial strain the samples in the same experimental series came from the same 20 l of inoculated water prior to the experiments the experimental rig was cleaned with water to which hypochlorite was added and it was subsequently rinsed with tap water for the treatment application the uv lamp was switched on and the target water was pumped at a flow rate below 55 l h 1 when the hydraulic system was full of water and the outlet flow was stable the flow rate was increased to a minimum of 55 l h 1 and its exact value was measured with a cylinder and a timer once measured the flow rate a minimum volume of 2 l of treated water was wasted to ensure that the taken sample was not mixed with previous samples or rinse water at this moment the sample was taken at the reactor outlet higher uv doses were first applied in order to avoid contamination of the tubing following the reactor which could affect the subsequent samples after taking the sample the flow rate was increased and the procedure was repeated when all of the treated samples were taken the uv lamp was turned off and the control was taken at the same flow rate as the last treated sample the 20 l of target water allowed taking five treated samples and the control three samples of 250 ml were taken in borosilicate flasks for each applied uv dose each flask was subjected to a different analysis one of the flasks was immediately subjected to membrane filtration and incubation for determining the bacterial concentration the other two flasks one of them covered with aluminum foil dark conditions were incubated for 24 h in a climate room at 20 c under white light 36 μeinstein m 2 s 1 for 24 h after the incubation samples were subjected to membrane filtration and incubation procedures in order to determine the bacterial concentration 2 3 data treatment the survival in every sample was obtained as the quotient between the bacterial concentration in that sample and the mean concentration of the control on the day of the experiment day 0 from the same experimental series survival data from the three experimental series from one determined strain and one determined post treatment condition i e 0 days 1 day under light and 1 day in dark were merged to obtain the inactivation curve represented as log s with respect to the uv dose that was applied inactivation curves were then fitted to inactivation kinetic models using the ginafit tool for ms excel 32 additionally p values for the different model parameters were determined using the sigmaplot v 11 0 software the inactivation kinetics parameters were utilized for calculating the uv doses necessary to achieve n log reductions of the initial concentration d n values of d n were employed as a comparative parameter for the treatment efficacy among the different bacterial strains and post treatment conditions the percentage of photoreactivation p was calculated for each bacterial strain that was tested according to eq 1 in which n pr is the bacteria concentration in samples incubated for 24 h under illumination n is the bacteria concentration in samples measured immediately after the uv irradiation and n 0 is the initial bacterial concentration 33 1 p 100 n pr n n 0 n for determining the existence of significant differences between bacterial strains and post treatment conditions the data corresponding to the inactivation curves were subjected to a two way ancova analysis statgraphics centurion xvi ver 16 1 03 using log s as the dependent variable uv dose as the covariate and the bacterial strain and post treatment conditions as qualitative factors similarly the percentage of photoreactivation was subjected to the same analysis using p as the dependent variable the uv dose as a covariate and the bacterial strain as a qualitative factor 3 results 3 1 features and comparison of the inactivation curves the inactivation curves obtained in this study depicted a shoulder region with a low uv dose and a tail was absent in the experimental range of uv doses fig 1 therefore the inactivation curves accorded with a log linear shoulder model eq 2 in which s survival at a given uv dose s 0 survival in absence of uv irradiation sl shoulder length k inactivation rate d uv dose 2 s s 0 e k d e k sl 1 e k d e k sl 1 the inactivation achieved with 24 h of incubation in darkness was similar to that achieved without incubation indicating that the dark repair is practically negligible on the contrary the inactivation achieved after 24 h incubation in light conditions was lower than that without incubation in all of the cases which reveals the importance of the photorepair in these bacterial strains the inactivation curves also revealed differences between the uv resistance and the effect by illuminated post treatment conditions in the different strains of e coli according to the level of inactivation achieved for the various uv doses that were applied inactivation curves data were analyzed using a two way ancova with one interaction term using log s as the dependent variable uv dose as covariate and bacterial strain and dark post treatment condition as factors with one interaction term for both factors the analysis indicated that the uv dose strain and post treatment condition as well as the interaction between the strain and post treatment condition were significant in the determination of log s p 0 001 the same analysis divided the tested strains into four homogenous groups table 1 groups a and b contained the strains of e coli atcc 11775 and atcc 11229 as well as the two strains of e faecalis the two other strains of e coli atcc 8739 and atcc 23716 were each distributed in the two homogenous groups of c and d the analysis divided the post treatment conditions into two groups group a contained the absence of incubation and incubation for 24 h in darkness whereas group b contained the incubation for 24 h under the light these results confirm the existence of more intraspecific than interspecific differences in terms of their uv resistance and photoreactivation features as well as the negligibility of the dark repair and the significance of the photoreactivation 3 2 analysis of the inactivation kinetics parameters the inactivation curves were fitted according to the log linear shoulder model the inactivation kinetics parameters that were obtained allowed quantitatively evaluating the uv treatment efficacy and the importance of the reactivation processes the log s 0 indicates the survival of the organisms in absence of uv irradiation for incubated samples the log s 0 quantifies the impact of the incubation on the bacterial survival the values of the log s 0 were not significant p value 0 05 in all but three of the cases fig 2 top the three significant values of the log s were obtained with 24 h incubations under light for the strains of e coli atcc 11775 0 12 0 05 p value 0 034 and atcc 23716 0 15 0 06 p value 0 015 and the strain of e faecalis atcc 27285 0 09 0 03 p value 0 004 according to these log s 0 values the maximum significant mortality due to the incubation was 29 of the organisms whereas the uv irradiation reached several log reductions this implies that the mortality due to the incubation was negligible in comparison with the inactivation due to the uv treatment the parameter sl indicates the section of the curve in which the inactivation rate is below the maximum value in general the sl increases in the case of 24 h incubation under light implying a reduction of the treatment efficacy finally the value of k indicates the inactivation rate once the uv dose exceeds the shoulder phase the 24 h incubation in dark conditions did not cause relevant changes in k values with respect to the samples without incubations whereas the incubation under light decreased the k in all cases fig 2 bottom the uv resistance and reactivation features for each bacterial strain that was tested were examined according to the uv dose required to achieve four log reductions from the initial concentration d 4 this was calculated using the three inactivation kinetics parameters obtained in the log linear shoulder model fitting table 2 according to the d 4 values the most uv resistant strains were e coli atcc 8739 and e coli atcc 23716 the remainder of the e coli and e faecalis strains reported similar uv resistance in general with one exception the d 4 values decreased slightly in the samples that were incubated for 24 h in the dark although with minimal differences with regards to the samples that were not incubated conversely the d 4 increased considerably if the samples were exposed to the light after the uv treatment due to photoreactivation a d 4 increase was especially relevant in both e faecalis strains and e coli atcc 8739 whereas the strain that was less affected by the photoreactivation was e coli atcc 23716 3 3 percentage of photoreactivation of the different bacterial strains the percentage of photoreactivation p decreased according to the uv dose that was applied fig 3 the maximum percentage of detected photoreactivation was 48 and was reached by e faecalis atcc 27285 treated with 2 7 mj cm 2 the two way ancova analysis applied to the log p data with the uv dose as the covariate and the bacterial strain as the qualitative factor divided the six bacterial strains into three groups table 3 three species of e coli atcc 11229 atcc 11775 and atcc 23716 were classified as similar in terms of dependence of percentage of reactivation with respect to the uv dose that was applied both strains of e faecalis were classified as a different group with respect to the three mentioned e coli strains the remaining strain of e coli atcc 8739 was more similar to e faecalis than to the other e coli strains p decreased with the applied uv dose according to a log linear relationship a e b d the uv dose required limiting the photoreactivation into the 1 ranged from 6 5 up to 23 2 mj cm 2 obtained for e coli atcc 11229 and e coli atcc 8739 respectively once four log reductions from the initial bacterial concentration were achieved p varied between the 0 05 obtained for e coli atcc 23716 and the 12 3 determined for e faecalis atcc 19433 4 discussion 4 1 inactivation kinetics the inactivation curves obtained in this study depicted a shoulder region at a low uv dose and a tail was absent in the experimental range of uv doses fig 1 although the inactivation curves are based on the classic model 34 in which the log s decreases linearly with the uv dose that is applied the appearance of variants such as shouldering and tailing are frequent in disinfection procedures 35 the causes of both phenomena are a matter of debate 21 shouldering in the inactivation curves fig 1 corresponds to a lower inactivation rate with low uv doses that is attributed to multitarget kinetics and the need of cumulative damage to inactivate the cell 36 37 studies 31 found that the inactivation curves for e coli atcc 8739 were similar for a treatment applied with a collimated beam reactor with lower intensity and longer exposure times and a flow through reactor that applies higher intensity in shorter exposure times at a wavelength of 275 nm however the inactivation curve for e faecalis showed a longer shoulder when treated with the collimated beam reactor this fact may be relevant in the design and optimization of uv reactors on the other hand the causes of tailing are stated as the presence of a resistant subpopulation hydraulic issues in treatment with recirculation and shielding by suspended solids and flocs as well as the achievement of inactivation levels that are close to the detection limit 21 38 42 in previous studies using e coli atcc 11229 and e faecalis atcc 27285 in buffered distilled water and irradiation with conventional low pressure mercury lamps the occurrence of shouldering and tailing depended on the uv device that was used inactivation curves obtained using a collimated beam reactor lacked a shoulder but depicted tailing whereas the curves obtained using a flow through reactor showed a shoulder and tailing was not observed in the experimental range of uv doses up to 30 mj cm 2 26 43 shoulders and tails have also been observed using uv led treatment on e coli 17 18 the relationship between uv intensity and exposure time also defined the inactivating efficacy by the treatment for one determined dose 23 in this context the cause of the shouldering and absence of tailing within the experimental range of uv doses can be attributed to the features of the uv device used for the treatment such as hydraulics and uv intensity distribution 4 2 uv resistance in the different bacterial strains the results that were obtained revealed significant differences in the uv resistance between the different strains of e coli in some of them their resistance was more similar to e faecalis than to the other strains of the same species the uv resistance has traditionally been attributed to morphological and physiological bacterial features in the case of gram positive bacteria the conventional thought is that the structure of the outer membrane behaves as a shield against the uv radiation and provides higher uv resistance with respect to the gram negative bacteria 19 44 45 the differences in uv resistance between different strains of the same species can be due to the presence or absence of reca protein 46 the total amount of genetic material with respect to the other strains 47 and the amount of enzymes produced to protect them from oxidative stress 48 additionally the uv resistance is dependent on culturing and experimental conditions such as the growth phase of the irradiated organisms 49 the ph of the acid medium 50 and the uv device that is used 5 19 23 these facts imply the necessity of comparing similar strains under identical experimental conditions to suitably assess the uv treatment efficacy the six bacterial strains tested in this study were subjected to the same experimental procedure therefore the differences between them are attributed to features of the proper strain the type e coli strain atcc 11775 and the strain atcc 11229 that are commonly used as indicators in disinfection studies were both the most sensitive strains on the contrary the strain of e coli atcc 23716 also known as k12 wildtype had relatively greater uv resistance and the strain of e coli atcc 8739 demonstrated the greatest resistance to the uv treatment with respect to the rest of the e coli strains the uv resistance in e coli atcc 23716 is well known and attributed to the presence and expression of the reca gen and the lower amount of genetic material 47 51 52 on the other hand the strain e coli atcc 8739 is endorsed in different studies as a surrogate or indicator organism for evaluating the uv treatment on bacteria due to its high resistance to the uv light at 254 nm 53 55 the results obtained in this study regarding uv resistance and photorepair potential confirm the suitability of e coli atcc 8739 for providing conservative estimations of the inactivation with leds emitting at 275 nm both strains of e faecalis showed relatively high sensitivity to the irradiation at 275 nm the values of the d 4 obtained in this study using uv c leds for irradiation were 10 2 mj cm 2 for e coli atcc 11229 and 11 4 mj cm 2 for e faecalis atcc 27285 however previous experimentation using similar strains procedures and conditions but utilizing a conventional lp hg uv c lamp reported d 4 values of 17 9 mj cm 2 for e coli atcc 11229 and 31 2 mj cm 2 for e faecalis atcc 27285 26 the comparison between both studies revealed a reduction of the d 4 values and thus greater inactivating efficacy with similar uv doses using uv c leds with respect to the lp hg uv c lamp additionally the uv resistance of e coli and e faecalis was more similar between them when they were treated with leds emitting in the range 265 285 nm whereas the uv resistance of e faecalis is considerably higher if the treatment is applied with conventional mercury uv lamps 21 26 this similarity in the uv resistance by e coli and e faecalis treated with uv leds supports the fact that irradiation at 275 nm involves damaging other cell structures in addition to the dna damage recent studies revealed that irradiation at 265 and 285 nm do not significantly affect the cell membrane integrity 56 however aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan and tyrosine have a peak absorption at approximately 280 nm 57 58 therefore the irradiation in this wavelength range can excite and destroy the proteins 59 in this context the irradiation at different wavelengths effectuates different damaging mechanisms that may change the established outlook on the bacteria uv resistance 4 3 implications of the repairing mechanisms in the uv treatment of waterborne bacteria the results that were obtained showed that the treatment with leds emitting in the range between 265 and 285 nm did not prevent the bacteria from repairing part of the damage received if the bacteria were exposed to the light after the treatment the percentage of photoreactivation was dependent on the uv dose that was applied with those between 6 5 and 23 2 mj cm 2 repairing 1 of the organisms in accordance with the value of approximately 11 mj cm 2 obtained for natural e coli irradiated with low pressure mercury lamps 33 however it is stated in different studies that the irradiation with leds emitting at a wavelength closer to 285 nm reduces the photoreactivation percentage with respect to a wavelength that is more approximate to 254 nm 17 18 60 in this study the irradiated samples were exposed to the light in a culture chamber for maximizing the possibilities of photorepair however the photoreactivation rate depends on the environment in which the irradiated water is stored 61 62 in the case of storing in sunlight there is a compromise between the photoreactivation and the further inactivation due to the uv a and uv b radiation respectively 63 there was an absence of dark repair within the 24 h following the uv irradiation which is similar to previous studies 18 60 these facts substantiate the need of considering the destination of the water once it is treated which requires applying increased uv doses for maintaining the achievement of 4 log reductions if the treated water is exposed to an illuminated environment upon the irradiation table 2 in this context the bacterial strains contained in the treated water define the increase on the uv dose requiring applying a uv dose 160 higher in the most extreme case which corresponds to the strain e faecalis atcc 19433 the evolution of the treated bacteria once it is released into the environment depends on a series of processes i e reproduction reactivation and repair 64 reproduction is defined as the increase in bacterial population due to their ability to reproduce this fact was not observed in the samples stored in darkness for 24 h the reproduction of fecal bacteria in a nonhost environment depends on factors such as the availability of nutrients and the temperature and this is not frequent in most environmental conditions 65 reactivation refers to the viable but non culturable vbnc organisms that become fully viable in this context the absence of increasing the number of culturable cells in the dark stored samples indicated a lack of reactivation within 24 h following the treatment repair refers to the processes of dna damage reversal such as photoreactivation and dark repair the results obtained in this study indicated that the dark repair was not relevant within the 24 h following the treatment whereas the photoreactivation was dependent on the bacterial strain and the uv dose that was applied this should be considered if the treated water is exposed to an illuminated environment upon the uv irradiation however it is known that a delay of 3 h in the light exposure after the uv irradiation noticeably reduces the photoreactivation fractions 29 therefore this dark delay can be introduced as part of the water treatment for preventing risks due to the photoreactivation the significant differences between the bacterial strains of e coli regarding their uv resistance and photoreactivation features imply that the selection of an appropriate indicator organism is critical for obtaining suitable and useful information in the research and trials of uv disinfection devices in practical terms the properties of the uv light source and the post treatment condition of the target water are two important factors in the choice of the proper test organism an appropriate indicator should have high uv resistance to ensure that its inactivation entails the inactivation of weaker organisms in parallel the indicator organism should have high photoreactivation potential in the event that the treated water will be exposed to environmental light upon treatment whereas the organisms e faecalis are a suitable indicator for the conventional hg lamps due to the higher resistance with respect to e coli 21 it was observed that the differences in their uv resistance are reduced by using leds emitting in the 265 285 nm range in the context of led uv disinfection the strain of e coli atcc 8739 is a suitable indicator since it requires higher uv doses for its inactivation table 2 in comparison to the rest of e coli and e faecalis strains 5 conclusions in this study four strains of e coli and two strains of e faecalis were subjected to uv irradiation using a flow through reactor equipped with uv c leds emitting between 265 and 285 nm the objective was to compare their uv resistance and determine their potential for uv damage repair the inactivation curves were fitted with log linear shoulder kinetics which implies a lower inactivation rate at low uv doses tailing was absent in the range of uv doses up to 20 mj cm 2 reaching inactivation levels greater than six log reductions without a loss of efficacy the determination of the viable cell concentration upon the uv irradiation indicated the existence of significant differences in the uv resistance of the bacterial strains that were tested with intraspecific differences that prevail over those that are interspecific according to the comparison of the data obtained in this study with previous studies using the same bacterial strains and experimental procedures the uv treatment with leds emitting between 265 and 285 nm was more effective than the treatment with conventional mercury uv c lamps for the same applied doses in addition the greater uv resistance in e faecalis with respect to e coli that is traditionally observed in the treatment with the mercury uv c lamps was reduced by the use of an led uv source the obtained results indicated that the dark repair was negligible within 24 h following the uv irradiation whereas the photoreactivation was relevant and dependent on the bacterial strain that was tested and the uv dose that was applied regarding the photoreactivation potential noticeable differences were observed between the tested strains with e coli atcc 23716 k12 showing the lowest percentage of photoreactivation and e faecalis atcc 19433 showing the greatest in practice the photoreactivation implies the necessity of applying greater uv doses to maintain the inactivation level that was achieved with the irradiation in the event that the treated water will be exposed to an illuminated environment in terms of the uv dose required to achieve four log reductions the strain e coli atcc 8739 was the most resistant strain when the treated water was exposed to either an illuminated or a dark environment declaration of competing interest the authors

12515,treatment with ultraviolet uv light is a common option for inactivating waterborne organisms the mercury vapor lamps conventionally used as a source of uv c light for water disinfection are

not observed within 24 h after the uv irradiation whereas the degree of photorepair depended on both the bacteria strain and the applied uv dose the exposure of the irradiated organisms to an illuminated environment entailed and increasing between the 18 and the 160 of the uv dose required to achieve four log reductions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water disinfection ultraviolet inactivation light emitting diodes leds photoreactivation fecal bacteria data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irradiation with uv light is used for water disinfection in a variety of application fields such as water purification and wastewater reclamation as well as other specific purposes like the treatment of aquaculture effluents and ballast water 1 3 the uv light in the uv c 200 280 nm range interacts with the cell dna and primarily causes the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers that interfere with the dna replication and consequently prevent the cells from reproducing 4 additionally the uv c light induces oxidative damage on other cell structures such as membranes and proteins 5 6 the advantages of the uv treatment with respect to other disinfection technologies include the absence of chemicals that facilitates the treatment application avoids the need for storing potentially hazardous materials and limits the generation of disinfection by products 7 8 on the other hand using uv irradiation for water disinfection has some undesirable features including the lack of a residual disinfection effect and the potential of dna reparation by the treated organisms 9 the uv dna damage repairing mechanisms involve photoreactivation and dark repair the former is an ancestral repair system that is extensively present in organisms in which the photolyase enzyme is activated by the energy of photons with wavelengths from 330 to 480 nm and specifically binds to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and reverses the damage 10 on the other hand the latter is a process that is independent from the light that replaces the damaged dna with new undamaged nucleotides 11 between both of the processes photoreactivation is the major one in terms of the amount of damage that can be repaired 12 the existence of these repairing mechanisms may compromise the quality of the uv treated water due to a dependence of the treatment efficacy on the post treatment illumination conditions the conventional sources of uv light based on mercury vapor are destinated to be replaced by the recently developed uv c light emitter diodes leds in the middle term 13 the current primary disadvantage of uv c leds is their low power conversion into uv light although this occurrence is being addressed in order to increase their feasibility for the water disinfection treatment 14 on the other hand using leds for water disinfection has numerous advantages such as the absence of mercury in their construction higher energy efficiency longer lifetime no need for a warming up period and greater flexibility in the wavelength of emissions and the design of reactors 15 16 recent studies revealed that treatment with varying wavelengths within the uv c spectrum induces different responses in the treated organisms in regard to their uv resistance and their uv damage repair potential 17 18 in addition the survival response to the uv treatment is determined by a set of factors that includes the use of different indicator organisms uv devices and manipulation procedures although the most studied microorganism in water disinfection is escherichia coli because it is the reference microorganism in biology the selected strain for evaluating the treatment can be a crucial parameter 19 the organism enterococcus faecalis is also a bacterial indicator in some specific fields such as the treatment of industrial effluents and ballast water 20 in general the uv resistance of e faecalis is greater than e coli when using traditional mercury uv c lamps 21 this poses a fundamental question regarding the relevance of adopting e coli as a surrogate for water borne pathogenic bacteria for uv disinfection 22 similarly the type of uv device used for treatment determines the survival responses in the tested organisms generally uv inactivation of microorganisms is believed to adhere to the bunsen roscoe photochemical principle it states that the photochemical inactivation depends only on the total energy dose following a time dose reciprocity 23 24 however there may be discrepancies in time dose reciprocity 25 in this context the type of uv reactor that is used may have a certain influence on the treatment outcome in fact the same organisms subjected to the same experimental procedures demonstrated different inactivation kinetics after their irradiation with either a collimated beam reactor or a flow through reactor 26 finally factors such as the growth phase and the pretreatment conditions of the target organisms also influence the survival response by the treated organisms 27 29 this variability in the survival response hinders the comparison of the results from different studies and is thus a concern for the integration of their outcomes in the overall scenario the objective in this study is to quantify the uv resistance and the reactivation degree in different strains of e coli and e faecalis the target organisms were subjected to different uv doses using a flow through reactor equipped with leds with emission between 265 and 285 nm the concentration of viable organisms was measured immediately after the uv irradiation and following an incubation period of 24 h under either an illuminated or dark environment the inactivation curves were fitted into inactivation models to determine the kinetics parameters which allowed the quantitative comparison of the uv resistance and damage repair potential between the different organisms and post treatment conditions that were tested 2 material and methods 2 1 target organisms and microbiological procedures four strains of e coli atcc 11775 atcc 11229 atcc 8739 and atcc 23716 k12 wildtype and two strains of e faecalis atcc 19443 and atcc 27285 were used and compared in this study they were acquired from the spanish type culture collection cect in a lyophilized format the organisms were reactivated in recommended culture medium i e tryptic soy broth scharlab barcelona spain for e coli and brain heart infusion broth scharlab for e faecalis and incubated for 24 h at 37 c aliquots of 1 ml were subsequently sub cultured into fresh medium and again incubated for 24 h the resulting cultures were placed into eppendorf vials and centrifugated at 3000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was discarded and 1 ml of glycerol water 50 50 was added to every vial pellets were stirred resuspended and subsequently stored in a freezer at 20 c for preparing the experimental inoculum one vial with the bacterial suspension was taken from the freezer and reactivated following the same described protocol with a minimum of one and a maximum of three sub culturing steps upon centrifugation the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of distilled water with an added 1 5 ml per liter of phosphate buffer at ph 7 20 the bacterial inoculum was combined with 20 l of buffered distilled water in the plastic deposit attached to the experimental rig see section 2 2 for experimental setup the organisms acclimated for 40 min after which the bacterial concentration was between 1 3 106 and 2 6 106 cfu ml 1 except for e coli atcc 11229 with a mean concentration of 3 4 105 cfu ml 1 after the treatment samples were subjected to membrane filtration 30 agar plating and incubation procedures in order to determine the bacterial concentration depending on the uv dose that was applied volumes between 10 5 and 100 ml were filtered through cellulose acetate membrane with a pore size of 0 45 μm pall corporation ny usa volumes below 1 ml were achieved by ten fold dilutions of the original sample membranes were plated in petri plates with specific chromogenic agar i e microinstant colinstant chromogenic agar scharlab for e coli and slanetz and bartley agar scharlab with a ttc indicator for e faecalis these were incubated at 37 c for 24 h for the e coli and for 48 h in the case of e faecalis colony forming units were counted after the incubation and divided between the filtered volume for determining the bacterial concentration 2 2 uv reactor description and experimental procedure uv treatment was applied by means of a flow through reactor photolab led275 0 4c apria systems s l cantabria spain mounted onto a laboratory experimental rig which consisted of a 20 l plastic deposit a peristaltic pump and the reactor the reactor was equipped with 40 leds with 10 5 mw and emission was between 265 and 275 nm uvc with a maximum of 275 nm leds were distributed in four rows along a square section structure that was placed longitudinally at the center of the reactor they were separated from the target water by a quartz sleeve forming an annular configuration with an irradiated water volume of 0 36 l the uv dose that was applied to the samples was calculated as the product of the mean intensity i m and the exposure time according to previous biodosimetry and actinometry experiments the mean intensity i m provided by the reactor with 100 power was 0 86 mw cm 2 for target water with 275 nm transmittance of 95 31 the optimum range of flow rates was from 55 l h 1 exposure time of 23 6 s and uv dose of 20 3 mj cm 2 to 230 l h 1 exposure time of 5 7 s and uv dose of 4 9 mj cm 2 to achieve uv doses below this value the power of the leds was reduced to a minimum of 20 the uv treatment was applied in an experimental series of samples collected at various flow rates and thus subjected to different uv doses three experimental series were performed for each bacterial strain the samples in the same experimental series came from the same 20 l of inoculated water prior to the experiments the experimental rig was cleaned with water to which hypochlorite was added and it was subsequently rinsed with tap water for the treatment application the uv lamp was switched on and the target water was pumped at a flow rate below 55 l h 1 when the hydraulic system was full of water and the outlet flow was stable the flow rate was increased to a minimum of 55 l h 1 and its exact value was measured with a cylinder and a timer once measured the flow rate a minimum volume of 2 l of treated water was wasted to ensure that the taken sample was not mixed with previous samples or rinse water at this moment the sample was taken at the reactor outlet higher uv doses were first applied in order to avoid contamination of the tubing following the reactor which could affect the subsequent samples after taking the sample the flow rate was increased and the procedure was repeated when all of the treated samples were taken the uv lamp was turned off and the control was taken at the same flow rate as the last treated sample the 20 l of target water allowed taking five treated samples and the control three samples of 250 ml were taken in borosilicate flasks for each applied uv dose each flask was subjected to a different analysis one of the flasks was immediately subjected to membrane filtration and incubation for determining the bacterial concentration the other two flasks one of them covered with aluminum foil dark conditions were incubated for 24 h in a climate room at 20 c under white light 36 μeinstein m 2 s 1 for 24 h after the incubation samples were subjected to membrane filtration and incubation procedures in order to determine the bacterial concentration 2 3 data treatment the survival in every sample was obtained as the quotient between the bacterial concentration in that sample and the mean concentration of the control on the day of the experiment day 0 from the same experimental series survival data from the three experimental series from one determined strain and one determined post treatment condition i e 0 days 1 day under light and 1 day in dark were merged to obtain the inactivation curve represented as log s with respect to the uv dose that was applied inactivation curves were then fitted to inactivation kinetic models using the ginafit tool for ms excel 32 additionally p values for the different model parameters were determined using the sigmaplot v 11 0 software the inactivation kinetics parameters were utilized for calculating the uv doses necessary to achieve n log reductions of the initial concentration d n values of d n were employed as a comparative parameter for the treatment efficacy among the different bacterial strains and post treatment conditions the percentage of photoreactivation p was calculated for each bacterial strain that was tested according to eq 1 in which n pr is the bacteria concentration in samples incubated for 24 h under illumination n is the bacteria concentration in samples measured immediately after the uv irradiation and n 0 is the initial bacterial concentration 33 1 p 100 n pr n n 0 n for determining the existence of significant differences between bacterial strains and post treatment conditions the data corresponding to the inactivation curves were subjected to a two way ancova analysis statgraphics centurion xvi ver 16 1 03 using log s as the dependent variable uv dose as the covariate and the bacterial strain and post treatment conditions as qualitative factors similarly the percentage of photoreactivation was subjected to the same analysis using p as the dependent variable the uv dose as a covariate and the bacterial strain as a qualitative factor 3 results 3 1 features and comparison of the inactivation curves the inactivation curves obtained in this study depicted a shoulder region with a low uv dose and a tail was absent in the experimental range of uv doses fig 1 therefore the inactivation curves accorded with a log linear shoulder model eq 2 in which s survival at a given uv dose s 0 survival in absence of uv irradiation sl shoulder length k inactivation rate d uv dose 2 s s 0 e k d e k sl 1 e k d e k sl 1 the inactivation achieved with 24 h of incubation in darkness was similar to that achieved without incubation indicating that the dark repair is practically negligible on the contrary the inactivation achieved after 24 h incubation in light conditions was lower than that without incubation in all of the cases which reveals the importance of the photorepair in these bacterial strains the inactivation curves also revealed differences between the uv resistance and the effect by illuminated post treatment conditions in the different strains of e coli according to the level of inactivation achieved for the various uv doses that were applied inactivation curves data were analyzed using a two way ancova with one interaction term using log s as the dependent variable uv dose as covariate and bacterial strain and dark post treatment condition as factors with one interaction term for both factors the analysis indicated that the uv dose strain and post treatment condition as well as the interaction between the strain and post treatment condition were significant in the determination of log s p 0 001 the same analysis divided the tested strains into four homogenous groups table 1 groups a and b contained the strains of e coli atcc 11775 and atcc 11229 as well as the two strains of e faecalis the two other strains of e coli atcc 8739 and atcc 23716 were each distributed in the two homogenous groups of c and d the analysis divided the post treatment conditions into two groups group a contained the absence of incubation and incubation for 24 h in darkness whereas group b contained the incubation for 24 h under the light these results confirm the existence of more intraspecific than interspecific differences in terms of their uv resistance and photoreactivation features as well as the negligibility of the dark repair and the significance of the photoreactivation 3 2 analysis of the inactivation kinetics parameters the inactivation curves were fitted according to the log linear shoulder model the inactivation kinetics parameters that were obtained allowed quantitatively evaluating the uv treatment efficacy and the importance of the reactivation processes the log s 0 indicates the survival of the organisms in absence of uv irradiation for incubated samples the log s 0 quantifies the impact of the incubation on the bacterial survival the values of the log s 0 were not significant p value 0 05 in all but three of the cases fig 2 top the three significant values of the log s were obtained with 24 h incubations under light for the strains of e coli atcc 11775 0 12 0 05 p value 0 034 and atcc 23716 0 15 0 06 p value 0 015 and the strain of e faecalis atcc 27285 0 09 0 03 p value 0 004 according to these log s 0 values the maximum significant mortality due to the incubation was 29 of the organisms whereas the uv irradiation reached several log reductions this implies that the mortality due to the incubation was negligible in comparison with the inactivation due to the uv treatment the parameter sl indicates the section of the curve in which the inactivation rate is below the maximum value in general the sl increases in the case of 24 h incubation under light implying a reduction of the treatment efficacy finally the value of k indicates the inactivation rate once the uv dose exceeds the shoulder phase the 24 h incubation in dark conditions did not cause relevant changes in k values with respect to the samples without incubations whereas the incubation under light decreased the k in all cases fig 2 bottom the uv resistance and reactivation features for each bacterial strain that was tested were examined according to the uv dose required to achieve four log reductions from the initial concentration d 4 this was calculated using the three inactivation kinetics parameters obtained in the log linear shoulder model fitting table 2 according to the d 4 values the most uv resistant strains were e coli atcc 8739 and e coli atcc 23716 the remainder of the e coli and e faecalis strains reported similar uv resistance in general with one exception the d 4 values decreased slightly in the samples that were incubated for 24 h in the dark although with minimal differences with regards to the samples that were not incubated conversely the d 4 increased considerably if the samples were exposed to the light after the uv treatment due to photoreactivation a d 4 increase was especially relevant in both e faecalis strains and e coli atcc 8739 whereas the strain that was less affected by the photoreactivation was e coli atcc 23716 3 3 percentage of photoreactivation of the different bacterial strains the percentage of photoreactivation p decreased according to the uv dose that was applied fig 3 the maximum percentage of detected photoreactivation was 48 and was reached by e faecalis atcc 27285 treated with 2 7 mj cm 2 the two way ancova analysis applied to the log p data with the uv dose as the covariate and the bacterial strain as the qualitative factor divided the six bacterial strains into three groups table 3 three species of e coli atcc 11229 atcc 11775 and atcc 23716 were classified as similar in terms of dependence of percentage of reactivation with respect to the uv dose that was applied both strains of e faecalis were classified as a different group with respect to the three mentioned e coli strains the remaining strain of e coli atcc 8739 was more similar to e faecalis than to the other e coli strains p decreased with the applied uv dose according to a log linear relationship a e b d the uv dose required limiting the photoreactivation into the 1 ranged from 6 5 up to 23 2 mj cm 2 obtained for e coli atcc 11229 and e coli atcc 8739 respectively once four log reductions from the initial bacterial concentration were achieved p varied between the 0 05 obtained for e coli atcc 23716 and the 12 3 determined for e faecalis atcc 19433 4 discussion 4 1 inactivation kinetics the inactivation curves obtained in this study depicted a shoulder region at a low uv dose and a tail was absent in the experimental range of uv doses fig 1 although the inactivation curves are based on the classic model 34 in which the log s decreases linearly with the uv dose that is applied the appearance of variants such as shouldering and tailing are frequent in disinfection procedures 35 the causes of both phenomena are a matter of debate 21 shouldering in the inactivation curves fig 1 corresponds to a lower inactivation rate with low uv doses that is attributed to multitarget kinetics and the need of cumulative damage to inactivate the cell 36 37 studies 31 found that the inactivation curves for e coli atcc 8739 were similar for a treatment applied with a collimated beam reactor with lower intensity and longer exposure times and a flow through reactor that applies higher intensity in shorter exposure times at a wavelength of 275 nm however the inactivation curve for e faecalis showed a longer shoulder when treated with the collimated beam reactor this fact may be relevant in the design and optimization of uv reactors on the other hand the causes of tailing are stated as the presence of a resistant subpopulation hydraulic issues in treatment with recirculation and shielding by suspended solids and flocs as well as the achievement of inactivation levels that are close to the detection limit 21 38 42 in previous studies using e coli atcc 11229 and e faecalis atcc 27285 in buffered distilled water and irradiation with conventional low pressure mercury lamps the occurrence of shouldering and tailing depended on the uv device that was used inactivation curves obtained using a collimated beam reactor lacked a shoulder but depicted tailing whereas the curves obtained using a flow through reactor showed a shoulder and tailing was not observed in the experimental range of uv doses up to 30 mj cm 2 26 43 shoulders and tails have also been observed using uv led treatment on e coli 17 18 the relationship between uv intensity and exposure time also defined the inactivating efficacy by the treatment for one determined dose 23 in this context the cause of the shouldering and absence of tailing within the experimental range of uv doses can be attributed to the features of the uv device used for the treatment such as hydraulics and uv intensity distribution 4 2 uv resistance in the different bacterial strains the results that were obtained revealed significant differences in the uv resistance between the different strains of e coli in some of them their resistance was more similar to e faecalis than to the other strains of the same species the uv resistance has traditionally been attributed to morphological and physiological bacterial features in the case of gram positive bacteria the conventional thought is that the structure of the outer membrane behaves as a shield against the uv radiation and provides higher uv resistance with respect to the gram negative bacteria 19 44 45 the differences in uv resistance between different strains of the same species can be due to the presence or absence of reca protein 46 the total amount of genetic material with respect to the other strains 47 and the amount of enzymes produced to protect them from oxidative stress 48 additionally the uv resistance is dependent on culturing and experimental conditions such as the growth phase of the irradiated organisms 49 the ph of the acid medium 50 and the uv device that is used 5 19 23 these facts imply the necessity of comparing similar strains under identical experimental conditions to suitably assess the uv treatment efficacy the six bacterial strains tested in this study were subjected to the same experimental procedure therefore the differences between them are attributed to features of the proper strain the type e coli strain atcc 11775 and the strain atcc 11229 that are commonly used as indicators in disinfection studies were both the most sensitive strains on the contrary the strain of e coli atcc 23716 also known as k12 wildtype had relatively greater uv resistance and the strain of e coli atcc 8739 demonstrated the greatest resistance to the uv treatment with respect to the rest of the e coli strains the uv resistance in e coli atcc 23716 is well known and attributed to the presence and expression of the reca gen and the lower amount of genetic material 47 51 52 on the other hand the strain e coli atcc 8739 is endorsed in different studies as a surrogate or indicator organism for evaluating the uv treatment on bacteria due to its high resistance to the uv light at 254 nm 53 55 the results obtained in this study regarding uv resistance and photorepair potential confirm the suitability of e coli atcc 8739 for providing conservative estimations of the inactivation with leds emitting at 275 nm both strains of e faecalis showed relatively high sensitivity to the irradiation at 275 nm the values of the d 4 obtained in this study using uv c leds for irradiation were 10 2 mj cm 2 for e coli atcc 11229 and 11 4 mj cm 2 for e faecalis atcc 27285 however previous experimentation using similar strains procedures and conditions but utilizing a conventional lp hg uv c lamp reported d 4 values of 17 9 mj cm 2 for e coli atcc 11229 and 31 2 mj cm 2 for e faecalis atcc 27285 26 the comparison between both studies revealed a reduction of the d 4 values and thus greater inactivating efficacy with similar uv doses using uv c leds with respect to the lp hg uv c lamp additionally the uv resistance of e coli and e faecalis was more similar between them when they were treated with leds emitting in the range 265 285 nm whereas the uv resistance of e faecalis is considerably higher if the treatment is applied with conventional mercury uv lamps 21 26 this similarity in the uv resistance by e coli and e faecalis treated with uv leds supports the fact that irradiation at 275 nm involves damaging other cell structures in addition to the dna damage recent studies revealed that irradiation at 265 and 285 nm do not significantly affect the cell membrane integrity 56 however aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan and tyrosine have a peak absorption at approximately 280 nm 57 58 therefore the irradiation in this wavelength range can excite and destroy the proteins 59 in this context the irradiation at different wavelengths effectuates different damaging mechanisms that may change the established outlook on the bacteria uv resistance 4 3 implications of the repairing mechanisms in the uv treatment of waterborne bacteria the results that were obtained showed that the treatment with leds emitting in the range between 265 and 285 nm did not prevent the bacteria from repairing part of the damage received if the bacteria were exposed to the light after the treatment the percentage of photoreactivation was dependent on the uv dose that was applied with those between 6 5 and 23 2 mj cm 2 repairing 1 of the organisms in accordance with the value of approximately 11 mj cm 2 obtained for natural e coli irradiated with low pressure mercury lamps 33 however it is stated in different studies that the irradiation with leds emitting at a wavelength closer to 285 nm reduces the photoreactivation percentage with respect to a wavelength that is more approximate to 254 nm 17 18 60 in this study the irradiated samples were exposed to the light in a culture chamber for maximizing the possibilities of photorepair however the photoreactivation rate depends on the environment in which the irradiated water is stored 61 62 in the case of storing in sunlight there is a compromise between the photoreactivation and the further inactivation due to the uv a and uv b radiation respectively 63 there was an absence of dark repair within the 24 h following the uv irradiation which is similar to previous studies 18 60 these facts substantiate the need of considering the destination of the water once it is treated which requires applying increased uv doses for maintaining the achievement of 4 log reductions if the treated water is exposed to an illuminated environment upon the irradiation table 2 in this context the bacterial strains contained in the treated water define the increase on the uv dose requiring applying a uv dose 160 higher in the most extreme case which corresponds to the strain e faecalis atcc 19433 the evolution of the treated bacteria once it is released into the environment depends on a series of processes i e reproduction reactivation and repair 64 reproduction is defined as the increase in bacterial population due to their ability to reproduce this fact was not observed in the samples stored in darkness for 24 h the reproduction of fecal bacteria in a nonhost environment depends on factors such as the availability of nutrients and the temperature and this is not frequent in most environmental conditions 65 reactivation refers to the viable but non culturable vbnc organisms that become fully viable in this context the absence of increasing the number of culturable cells in the dark stored samples indicated a lack of reactivation within 24 h following the treatment repair refers to the processes of dna damage reversal such as photoreactivation and dark repair the results obtained in this study indicated that the dark repair was not relevant within the 24 h following the treatment whereas the photoreactivation was dependent on the bacterial strain and the uv dose that was applied this should be considered if the treated water is exposed to an illuminated environment upon the uv irradiation however it is known that a delay of 3 h in the light exposure after the uv irradiation noticeably reduces the photoreactivation fractions 29 therefore this dark delay can be introduced as part of the water treatment for preventing risks due to the photoreactivation the significant differences between the bacterial strains of e coli regarding their uv resistance and photoreactivation features imply that the selection of an appropriate indicator organism is critical for obtaining suitable and useful information in the research and trials of uv disinfection devices in practical terms the properties of the uv light source and the post treatment condition of the target water are two important factors in the choice of the proper test organism an appropriate indicator should have high uv resistance to ensure that its inactivation entails the inactivation of weaker organisms in parallel the indicator organism should have high photoreactivation potential in the event that the treated water will be exposed to environmental light upon treatment whereas the organisms e faecalis are a suitable indicator for the conventional hg lamps due to the higher resistance with respect to e coli 21 it was observed that the differences in their uv resistance are reduced by using leds emitting in the 265 285 nm range in the context of led uv disinfection the strain of e coli atcc 8739 is a suitable indicator since it requires higher uv doses for its inactivation table 2 in comparison to the rest of e coli and e faecalis strains 5 conclusions in this study four strains of e coli and two strains of e faecalis were subjected to uv irradiation using a flow through reactor equipped with uv c leds emitting between 265 and 285 nm the objective was to compare their uv resistance and determine their potential for uv damage repair the inactivation curves were fitted with log linear shoulder kinetics which implies a lower inactivation rate at low uv doses tailing was absent in the range of uv doses up to 20 mj cm 2 reaching inactivation levels greater than six log reductions without a loss of efficacy the determination of the viable cell concentration upon the uv irradiation indicated the existence of significant differences in the uv resistance of the bacterial strains that were tested with intraspecific differences that prevail over those that are interspecific according to the comparison of the data obtained in this study with previous studies using the same bacterial strains and experimental procedures the uv treatment with leds emitting between 265 and 285 nm was more effective than the treatment with conventional mercury uv c lamps for the same applied doses in addition the greater uv resistance in e faecalis with respect to e coli that is traditionally observed in the treatment with the mercury uv c lamps was reduced by the use of an led uv source the obtained results indicated that the dark repair was negligible within 24 h following the uv irradiation whereas the photoreactivation was relevant and dependent on the bacterial strain that was tested and the uv dose that was applied regarding the photoreactivation potential noticeable differences were observed between the tested strains with e coli atcc 23716 k12 showing the lowest percentage of photoreactivation and e faecalis atcc 19433 showing the greatest in practice the photoreactivation implies the necessity of applying greater uv doses to maintain the inactivation level that was achieved with the irradiation in the event that the treated water will be exposed to an illuminated environment in terms of the uv dose required to achieve four log reductions the strain e coli atcc 8739 was the most resistant strain when the treated water was exposed to either an illuminated or a dark environment declaration of competing interest the authors

12516,the variability of the sedimentation characteristics of activated sludge is a phenomenon that often occurs in biological wastewater treatment plants deterioration of sedimentation properties requires the application of polyelectrolytes they affect the morphology of sludge flocs facilitating and accelerating their deposition on the other hand the type of reagent used and its dose may affect the quality of the treated wastewater this study investigates the effect of dosing two different cationic polyelectrolytes on the properties of activated sludge and treated wastewater parameters in lab scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs during studies doses of polyelectrolytes that significantly changed activated sludge flocs morphology were applied it caused an improvement of the sludge volume index svi from 42 to even 80 in relation to the control reactor however polymers overdose resulted in the svi increase by 10 14 and obtaining sludge flocs with a highly branched structure difficult to thicken the applied polymers praestol 855bs and superfloc c 18530 did not affect the chemical characteristics of the treated wastewater the only significant effect was observed for the turbidity of the wastewater polymers doses reduced the value of that parameter by 54 64 in addition a simulation of a technological failure for several days was introduced to assess the durability of the produced flocs and their impact on the effectiveness of wastewater treatment the experiment showed that praestol formed stable and durable flocs while for superfloc polymer a slight

polyelectrolytes wastewater treatment flocs morphology data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the activated sludge process is commonly used in most functioning wastewater treatment plants this process is based on multi component bio flocculated flocs consisting of single bacteria and microbial colonies filamentous bacteria organic fibers organic and inorganic particles and components from the wastewater or components produced during the biological process 1 3 they form three activated sludge structure levels bacteria micro colonies and flocs bacteria are tightly bound through a polymeric matrix and form micro colonies the extracellular polymeric substances come from wastewater or the microorganisms metabolism and cell lysis finally polymers and cations link the micro colonies to produce activated sludge flocs 4 the bio flocculation is an active process and depends on physical chemical and biological factors 5 activated sludge flocs in general have a heterogeneous fractal like structure they are bound by various types of intermolecular interactions such as derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo forces van der waals and electrostatic forces non dlvo forces bridging of the eps utilizing divalent trivalent cations hydrophobic interactions and physical entanglement 3 5 6 floc formers are bacteria that bind with each other using eps forming bridges between the neighboring bacteria another type of binding is a network formed by filamentous bacteria under optimal conditions the amount of filamentous and floc forming bacteria is balanced to build up large irregular dense and robust flocs forming effective settling sludge 6 7 the balance between floc forming and filamentous bacteria depends on many factors such as temperature wastewater flow rate and composition but their imbalance causes settling problems 1 8 9 the possibility of spontaneous formation of extensive and dense flocs during bioflocculation processes is a property of activated sludge which can determine the effectiveness of pollutants removal from wastewater and effective solids liquid separation in most wwtps 1 2 10 different parameters can characterize the flocs of activated sludge morphological floc size distribution fractal dimension filament index physical ability to flocculate viscosity hydrophobicity and surface charge and chemical polymeric constituents and metal content 5 the properties of flocs significantly change due to physical e g turbulence in the aeration tanks design and operation of the settlers and chemical biological factors e g degree of bioflocculation wastewater characteristics and composition of the microflora in addition flocs density and strength are influenced by the content of cations and inorganic particles and shear forces in a biological reactor during e g mixing and aeration 3 11 particle size density and floc stability are essential parameters for the settleability of activated sludge the disintegration of weak flocs may increase the number of small flocs or dispersed bacteria in the treated wastewater 2 in turn the shape and structure of the floc can reduce the sludge settling velocity when flocs have a highly irregular shape or an open form 7 the content of polymeric compounds protein humic carbohydrates and the extracted eps in the sludge has a significant positive correlation with the sludge volume index a high concentration of eps in the sludge may cause worse compressibility and settleability of the sludge still high ca mg al and fe contents in the sludge significantly improve both parameters 5 high hydrophobicity and negative surface charge correspond to high svi compressibility and settleability of activated sludge defined by svi and zone settling velocity depend significantly on the floc morphological and physical properties such as the floc s size fractal dimension and filament index 5 the flocs formation process is associated with many problems affecting the operation of wwtps and the effectiveness of wastewater treatment the most common problem is the poor settling characteristics of the activated sludge which results in biomass outflowing with treated wastewater and its worse quality 11 12 it can also cause a decrease in the sludge retention time in bioreactors controlled through excess sludge wastage worsening the efficiency of biological processes 6 the primary sludge settling problems are caused by sludge bulking proliferation of filamentous bacteria and poor flocculation properties 5 the bulking sludge most often requires appropriate chemical agents and changes in the operation of biological reactors e g increased aeration depending on the group of filamentous bacteria in the activated sludge improving floc morphology in actual conditions of wwtps operation is achieved by adding chemicals like multivalent metal salts synthetic polymers and other natural or waste materials 13 15 cainglet et al 16 tested the effectiveness of organic coagulants synthetic cationic polydadmac polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride and polyamines epichlorohydrin dimethylamine and semi synthetic based on chitosan starch and tannins in the process of primary and secondary sedimentation of municipal wastewater treatment the rate of formation and settling of flocs and the efficiency of pollutants removal from wastewater were assessed the results were compared with the inorganic coagulant polyaluminum chloride pac which unfortunately increases the salinity of wastewater and the mass of sludge after the flocculation process the best results during secondary sedimentation were obtained using polyamines with high molecular weight mw and high charge density cd for example the removal of suspended solids was 1 75 and 0 23 mg po4 p 0 07 and 0 01 mg and bod7 6 63 and 0 80 mg per mg of polyamines and pac respectively high flocculation efficiency was also found for pdmac high mw and very high cd and starch a natural polymer with less toxic and easier biodegradable than synthetic polymers al dawery et al 17 obtained similar results examining the effectiveness of inorganic coagulants aluminum sulfate calcium chloride and ferric chloride and organic polyacrylamides with various cd cpam 10 cpam 80 apam 30 during sludge conditioning the cationic cpam 80 with a very high cationicity was the most effective especially in the case of solutions with a ph close to neutral a lower svi faster zone settling and high floc density characterize this polyelectrolyte cationic polyelectrolytes are most often used to condition activated sludge before dewatering to neutralize the negative surface charge of activated sludge flocs 18 19 several studies concern the impact of the structure of cationic polymers their molecular weight and cationicity on the activated sludge flocculation efficiency 20 23 guan et al 23 showed that bridging efficiency increases with increasing polymer chain length leading to the formation of large flocs whereas eriksson et al 22 found that a low cd 10 cationic polyelectrolyte flocculates by bridging forming flocs with a flexible structure allowing the formation of a dense filter cake with high filtration resistance using polyelectrolytes of 40 and 100 cd leads to forming rigid structures conducive to effective filtration guan et al 21 obtained similar results while examining the effect of cationic polyacrylamides charge density on the flocculation mechanism the flocculation mechanism changes along with cd increase at low cd the bridging mechanism dominates while for high cd the neutralization of the negative charge of the activated sludge flocs takes place higher cd polymers require lower doses than lower cd polymers 20 there are also studies examining the effectiveness of cationic polymers in combination with anionic or non ionic substances for example al dawery 17 achieved higher turbidity removal efficiency and better sedimentation properties of activated sludge using sequential dosing of cationic polyacrylamide low mw cpam 10 or high mw cpam 80 and anionic polyacrylamide apam 30 compared to individual polymers the sequential dosing of polymers improved svi by 62 the simultaneous use of cationic polyelectrolyte kp 201c and non ionic polyelectrolyte np 800 led to obtaining larger flocs of conditioned sludge it also caused better dewaterability of the sludge and a lower chance of overdosing the flocculation mechanism explained the process s high efficiency adsorption of the cationic polymer on negatively charged sludge particles and then adsorption of the non ionic polymer on the loops and tails of the cationic polyelectrolyte with hydrogen bonding and van der waals force 24 chemical conditioning of sludge using cationic polymers can also be supported by other substances or physical methods e g ultrasound under the influence of ultrasound polymers can recombine depending on the conditions charge separation or fusion of long chain radicals forming in the ultrasonic field these processes lead to the formation of polymers with different physicochemical properties than the starting chemical compounds 25 yang et al observed a synergistic effect between cpam and synthetic fibers pet pp viscose rayon the water content in the sludge decreased from 96 2 to 65 9 using the cpam dose of 1 mg g ds and pp 0 15 g g ds the authors also showed that adding fibers supported dewatering mainly by breaking the tightly bound eps in addition the presence of fibers increased the rigidity of the structure creating a porous sludge cake with low compressibility 26 wojcik et al noted an increase in the filtration rate of sludge conditioned with cationic polyacrylamide sedifloc 1050cmmw after adding biomass ash the ash did not significantly increase the dewatering efficiency but allowed for the reduction of the polymer dose by half reducing process cost by 30 27 cited literature shows that the polymers are usually applied to remove suspended solids in the initial clarifier and the sewage sludge thickening and dewatering in wwtps however operators have increasingly used this chemical to support the flocculation and sedimentation of activated sludge in secondary settling tanks in recent years therefore we need to answer the following questions to what extent do chemical reagents impact the biochemical wastewater treatment processes what are the dose limits beyond which there are problems in the efficiency of wastewater treatment does the type of polymer matter what are the side effects of that process in this paper the authors have investigated the impact of cationic polyelectrolytes on the properties of activated sludge in laboratory sequencing batch reactors sbrs and basic physical and chemical parameters of treated wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater the tests were carried out using raw wastewater collected from the koszalin municipal wwtp samples were collected twice a week from the screen chamber at the beginning of the technological system each time a fundamental qualitative analysis of municipal wastewater was carried out its results are presented in table 1 2 2 activated sludge activated sludge was collected from an aerobic reactor at the municipal wwtp koszalin poland wwtp uses the activated sludge system with effective biological nutrient removal in the laboratory sludge samples were added to sequential batch reactors sbrs and filled with raw wastewater 1 1 there was no acclimatization period for the sludge adaptation from the flow system to the batch system 2 3 polyelectrolytes two cationic polyelectrolytes commonly used in sewage treatment plants were used in the research praestol 855 bs a copolymer of acrylamide with a cationic acid derivative of very high cationic charge density produced by solenis llc the netherlands as solid granules well dissolving in water superfloc c 18530 polyamine derived from dimethylamine and epichlorohydrin with high molecular weight polymer in emulsion form produced by kemira oyj finland praestol 855 bs praestol is usually used in sludge dewatering processes while superfloc c 18530 superfloc is mainly used to support the flocculation of suspended solids in the primary settling tank working solutions of polyelectrolytes were prepared each day polymers were dosed into the reactors automatically using a dosing pump 10 min before the sedimentation of the activated sludge the polymer solution was stirred on a magnetic stirrer and started 5 min before dosing the whole process was carried out automatically using time programmers 3 research methodology during the first stage of the study a static jar test was carried out to determine the effect of the polymer dose on the morphological changes of activated sludge flocs first activated sludge was collected from the aeration chamber of municipal wwtp koszalin its concentration was determined and then placed in 250 ml conical flasks then polymers were dosed in the range from 0 to 100 mg l after several minutes of mixing part of the sample was poured in a thin layer onto the petri dishes to observe macroscopically and take photographs next sediment flocs in samples were observed under a microscope the second stage of the study was carried out using a laboratory setup of sbrs presented in fig 1 the setup consisted of three sbrs in a parallel system where the first one sbr 1 was always a control reactor the second and third sbrs sbr 2 and sbr 3 were used for conducting tests the sbrs were made of a plexiglass cylinder of 3000 ml working volume 14 cm in diameter and 30 cm in height the exchange volume ratio was 20 the hydraulic retention time was approximately 30 h the sbrs were operated with 4 cycles per day each cycle lasted 6 h and consisted of filling with raw wastewater 0 5 h reaction time 4 5 h mixing 0 5 h aeration 4 0 h settling 0 5 h decanting of treated wastewater 0 25 h idle phase separation of excess sludge 0 25 h the cycle setup and conditions are described in table 2 time controllers were used for automating the operation of sbrs during the research period the reactors sludge age the solids retention time was maintained at 15 days the excess sludge was removed once a day the reactors were operated at room temperature temperature in the reactor was within the range of 19 20 c no adaptation period and maintaining high oxygen concentration in sbrs 4 mgo2 l was intentional activated sludge fine bubble aeration and intensive mixing are conditions that are not conducive to flocculation and agglomeration all reactors were operated under the same conditions the only difference was the dose of polymer in sbr 2 and sbr 3 the first tested polymer was superfloc for each sbr 2 cycle a dose of 5 mg of stock solution per liter was added and for each sbr 3 cycle dose of 30 mg l in the next stage the influence of praestol was tested in sbr 2 dose of 1 mg l and sbr 3 5 mg l such doses were adopted based on the results of the first stage of the study also to simulate the technological problems with the course of the wastewater treatment tests for each polymer were carried out in the following pattern 5 days of regular operation 20 wastewater treatment cycles in sbrs 3 day break sbrs in idle phase after decanting treated wastewater five days of regular operation such a pattern allowed us to assess the influence of polymers during the regular operation of sbrs what happens when there are problems with sbrs and how activated sludge reacts due to the use of actual raw wastewater and their qualitative variability table 1 the obtained results of the influence of polyelectrolytes on the effect of wastewater treatment must be related only to the parameters determined in the control reactor 3 1 analytical methods the following parameters were determined in raw and treated wastewater ph turbidity conductivity total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen n nh4 and orthophosphates the parameters were determined after filtration through a hard paper filter the ph and conductivity were measured using the cyberscan pcd6500 device and turbidity using turb 555ir device the toc and tn were determined using toc analyzer toc vcph with tnm 1 unit from shimadzu the ammonia nitrogen was determined using the direct nesslerization method and the orthophosphates using a colorimetric method with ammonium molybdate on a spectrophotometer uv vis dr 5000 hach activated sludge analysis included observation under a microscope biomass concentration mixed liquor suspended solids sludge settling velocity and settled sludge volume after 30 minute sedimentation v30 the settling properties of the activated sludge were determined using the sludge volume index after 30 minute sedimentation svi30 4 results and discussion during the first stage static tests on the effect of the polyelectrolyte dose on the activated sludge were carried out the dose ranged from 0 to 100 mg l the applied reagents showed high efficiency in binding activated sludge flocs into larger agglomerates within the first few minutes since dosage the test results in figs 2 3 show that optimal dose selection is necessary for a controlled change of the activated sludge flocs characteristics such analyzes allowed for the initial determination of the dose of both polymers we have observed that along with the increase of the reagents dose their chemical impact on the structure of the activated sludge also increases improving or completely changing it various interaction forces were characteristic of the applied polymers which influenced the final flocculation efficiency the dose 5 mg l of praestol polymer shows a strong aggregating effect of activated sludge flocs especially visible under the microscope fig 3 agglomerating effect increases along with the dose however doses higher than 5 mg l have no significant impact on flock formation in the case of superfloc the changes were much less dynamic much higher doses of superfloc polymer are required fig 4 to obtain similar results the dose 5 mg l of praestol brings similar results as the dose 30 mg l of superfloc in microscope image analysis such research was carried out for variable values of the activated sludge concentration obtaining similar results in the range of the adopted concentrations of both polymers in the tested range of polymer doses no changes in the liquid phase of the suspension were observed the ph remained within the range of 6 9 7 1 while the conductivity decreased slightly with the increase of the polymer dose from 1 308 to 1 235 ms cm the analysis of the polymer dose impact on the svi value of the activated sludge showed that the praestol dose of 5 mg l decreased its value from 125 ml g to 83 ml g a further increase in the dose hindered sedimentation and thickening of the sludge due to the formation of extensive flocs svi increased to 95 ml g in the case of superfloc the minimum svi value 76 ml g was obtained for the dose of 30 mg l and a further increase in the polymer dose increased the svi value to 83 ml g analysis of the structure and charge density of both cationic polyelectrolytes used shows that in the case of praestol which has a higher charge density its adsorption on the surface of activated sludge flocs occurs as a result of electrostatic interactions a dominant mechanism and bridging large loose flocs were formed at the lowest dose of the reagent on the other hand superfloc which has a higher molecular weight requires much larger doses to achieve a comparable effect obtained flocs were smaller and more compact but those features of flocs may affect their better compressibility the obtained results are similar to guan et al 21 during activated sludge conditioning with cationic polyacrylamide of high cd the mechanism of charge neutralization dominated when applying polymer with low cd the bridging mechanism is the most important during the flocculation process a polymer with a higher cationicity required a lower dose sun et al 28 investigated the effect of cationic polyacrylamide on the effectiveness of activated sludge dewatering they observed that the flocs produced by charge neutralization have a higher density and smaller size than adsorption bridging moreover as sedimentation progressed the bridging mechanism became dominant and formed large and loose flocs during the second stage of the research reagents were dosed using two doses selected individually for each polymer in the laboratory batch reactors setup dosing took place during each of the 4 sbr cycles per day causing dynamic morphological changes of the flocs in the first days of the research the sedimentation rate of the activated sludge increased along with the polymers dose therefore in the sbr 3 reactor dose 5 mg l such changes were most visible when dosing preastol complete sedimentation of the sludge was achieved within 2 3 min after the mixing and aeration step in the control reactor such a level was not achieved even after 30 min that trend continued throughout the analyzed period fig 4a b the effect of superfloc polymer dosed in a higher concentration showed much lower dynamics of sludge sedimentation changes during the initial period of the study fig 5a however the sludge sedimentation efficiency gradually increased with the test time fig 5b the obtained sludge sedimentation results should be related to mlss which decreased during the first days of the study due to the rapid transition to the batch wastewater treatment system in sbr for series with praestol dosing the most significant changes were observed during the first two days fig 6a after which mlss values ranged from 1 40 to 2 28 g l average 1 87 g l there were no significant differences in mlss values among reactors 1 2 and 3 for the series with superfloc fig 6b mlss values since day one ranged from 2 35 to 3 27 g l average 2 84 g l a noticeable difference was the lower value of the mlss in the sbr 3 reactor which was maintained for most of the test time the microscopic analysis of the activated sludge from sbr reactors during the laboratory tests showed far reaching changes in the structure of the flocs their surface has a negative charge resulting from cell wall construction and is mainly caused by diester amino carboxyl and phosphorus groups 18 the electrokinetic potential of activated sludge collected from 40 municipal and industrial sewage treatment plants ranged from 6 to 12 mv at the same time the nitrosomonas and nitrobacter bacteria responsible for the effective removal of nitrogen compounds from wastewater had a higher surface charge from 12 to 18 mv in addition studies by bennoit et al 18 showed that at a zeta potential higher than 20 mv the destruction of activated sludge flocs takes place significantly reducing the efficiency of sedimentation the negative surface charge of the activated sludge flocs justifies using cationic flocculants to increase the efficiency of their sedimentation surface charge neutralization is one of the possible interaction mechanisms between sludge flocs and polyelectrolytes chains of flocculants especially those with high charge density are stretched due to electrostatic interactions and may adhere to the surface of the flocs more easily 29 for the praestol polymer consolidation of the activated sludge flocs was observed from the first day of the test in the control sample sludge flocs were comminuted and dispersed fig 7 a dose of 1 mg l praestol caused significant improvement of the sludge structure into a more concentrated form and decreased the number of comminuted flocs that effect increased at the polymer dose of 5 mg l as a result huge agglomerates of activated sludge that do not occur in the biological chambers of wastewater treatment plants were created such size of the sludge flocs could only be obtained by using such a high dose of polymer the impact of superfloc on the structure of activated sludge flocs was much less effective fig 8 at the reagent dose of 5 mg l the photos show a slight improvement in the flocs morphology their size and aggregate state the higher dose of the polymer sbr 3 30 mg l significantly improved flocs flocculation observed since the first day of the test higher doses of polymer increase the sedimentation rate of activated sludge flocs but may also deteriorate the efficiency of its thickening in the final stage this effect may be caused by polymer chains extended coverage of sludge flocs that results in an osmotic effect which causes the repulsion of particles and makes it impossible for the water to outflow from the formed polymerized agglomerates 30 the polymer occupies virtually all active sites on the floc surface at too high doses as a result the probability of attaching other sludge flocculates by chain fragments protruding into the solution by bridging decreases bolto et al 29 also proved the possibility of adsorption due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between amide groups of polyacrylamides and hydroxyl groups that phenomenon will affect the value of the sludge control parameter svi it is a standard parameter used to describe the settling characteristics of activated sludge when applying praestol polymer the value of svi immediately decreases fig 9a and then for the highest dose it was stable over the entire test period a slight increase in the final phase of the research may result from the water blockage in the structure of the formed agglomerates as described above the dosing of the superfloc polymer despite the weaker agglomerating effect of the flocs observed under a microscope allowed the formation of flocs that sediment well and thicken without the visible negative overdosing effect fig 9b the morphological characteristic of the sludge is a critical aspect of the wastewater treatment plant operation significantly affecting the final effect of sewage treatment however the treated wastewater quality is the most crucial issue from the point of view of a wwtp operation therefore it is necessary to determine the impact of the reagents on the final effect of wastewater treatment during the research the value of individual parameters of treated wastewater was insignificant but their relation to the control reactor was due to that it was possible to determine the influence of dosed reagents on the effectiveness of biological wastewater treatment under certain conditions the analysis of the basic parameters of treated wastewater in all reactors is presented in tables 3 4 within physical parameters the most significant differences were observed in the turbidity of the wastewater fig 10a b the application of praestol polymer caused a decrease of 58 on average in sbr 2 dose 1 mg l and 60 on average in sbr 3 dose 5 mg l both values were calculated concerning turbidity in sbr 1 control reactor on the other hand superfloc caused the effect not observed for praestol the initial average improvement was 64 in the sbr 3 reactor dose 100 mg l still after a 3 day idle phase a significant deterioration of the turbidity of wastewater was observed it was higher than in the control reactor for two days juang et al 31 also observed a deterioration of sludge sedimentation only a few days after discontinuing the synthetic polymer addition the resulting flocs were in the form of pin flocs the studies on the structure of the activated sludge population showed that the presence of the polymer inhibited the growth of dominant bacteria and a significant floc former ps vesicularis in activated sludge giving a growth advantage to other bacteria e g a hydrophila they also showed that it took more than a month to rebuild the structure of the activated sludge population to its initial state in addition to the causes given by juang 31 the observed phenomenon may be caused by the partial disintegration of the formed flocs and the biodegradation of the carbon polymer components by the activated sludge during the idle phase however the turbidity value gradually decreased with each subsequent test day reaching its level in the control reactor the analysis of chemical parameters of treated wastewater is presented in tables 3 4 and figs 11 12 praestol did not impact the effectiveness of total nitrogen orthophosphates and organic carbon removal from wastewater regardless of its dose in the reactors furthermore there were no differences in the values of the analyzed parameters between the sbr 2 and sbr 3 reactors polymer doses 1 mg l and 5 mg l respectively thus it can be concluded that the reagent used despite its effect on the activated sludge s morphological changes did not influence the chemical parameters of treated wastewater in the case of superfloc a slight improvement in organic carbon removal was observed in sbr 2 and sbr 3 however after the idle phase treated wastewater quality deteriorated in the sbr 3 reactor with the highest polymer dose 30 mg l the concentration of organic carbon ammonium nitrogen and orthophosphates increased due to increased turbidity also excessive occlusion of sludge flocs by the polymer limits oxygen transfer for bacteria which release nutrients under anaerobic conditions when analyzing the obtained test results as a general it should be noted that individual parameters were determined in filtered samples apart from turbidity therefore they do not consider the impurities present in the suspension applied polymers improve the agglomeration of the flocs limiting the occurrence of dispersed particles responsible for the turbidity of the treated sewage thus the final effect of wastewater treatment may be much better than that obtained in the presented results on the other hand the results show that the applied polymers do not significantly affect the course of biochemical processes of wastewater treatment in the analyzed range and conditions however the intentionally introduced idle phases show unfavorable changes in the reactors with the highest dose of superfloc polymer 5 conclusions the polymers in wastewater treatment processes are mainly used for the initial sludge treatment and dewatering processes during the treatment and disposal of sewage sludge however many wwtps support the process of biological sludge flocculation in the bioreactor stage supporting sedimentation and separation of sludge and treated wastewater the research allowed us to determine the influence of the two applied polymers on the wastewater treatment process in large doses and for extended periods additionally the effect of the polymers on the morphology and activity of activated sludge in wastewater treatment was increased by operating the system in several cycles a day batch reactor system the polymers used in the experiments showed various efficiency and dynamics of the flocculation process of activated sludge flocs a praestol dose of 5 mg l allowed complete sludge sedimentation within 2 3 min and reduced svi by 42 superfloc required more time and a higher dose 30 mg l to achieve similar floc agglomeration but in the long term allowed obtaining reduction of svi up to 80 significant morphological changes of sludge flocs did not meaningly affect wastewater treatment s effect in terms of wastewater s chemical parameters however they had a substantial part in improving the sedimentation efficiency and rate and decreasing the transfer of a fine fraction of activated sludge solids into the outflow applied polymers reduced the turbidity of biologically treated wastewater by 60 compared to the control reactor despite significant changes in the structure of activated sludge flocs no important changes in the effectiveness of biological wastewater treatment processes such as dephosphatation or nitrification were observed the durability of this state was checked by introducing problems in the treatment process intentionally induced by interrupting it for three days simulating a problematic situation for the activated sludge such stress did not cause problems with wastewater quality after restarting the reactors with the praestol polymer also the turbidity was maintained at a low level for both doses in those reactors however in the case of the superfloc polymer noticeable deterioration in the quality of treated wastewater after the idle phase was observed for the highest dose such a result may indicate that flocs formed chemically by superfloc are less durable thus the conducted research showed that the temporary use of selected polymers in an sbr even at limit doses of reagents changes significantly flocs morphology but does not deteriorate the biological processes of wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12516,the variability of the sedimentation characteristics of activated sludge is a phenomenon that often occurs in biological wastewater treatment plants deterioration of sedimentation properties requires the application of polyelectrolytes they affect the morphology of sludge flocs facilitating and accelerating their deposition on the other hand the type of reagent used and its dose may affect the quality of the treated wastewater this study investigates the effect of dosing two different cationic polyelectrolytes on the properties of activated sludge and treated wastewater parameters in lab scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs during studies doses of polyelectrolytes that significantly changed activated sludge flocs morphology were applied it caused an improvement of the sludge volume index svi from 42 to even 80 in relation to the control reactor however polymers overdose resulted in the svi increase by 10 14 and obtaining sludge flocs with a highly branched structure difficult to thicken the applied polymers praestol 855bs and superfloc c 18530 did not affect the chemical characteristics of the treated wastewater the only significant effect was observed for the turbidity of the wastewater polymers doses reduced the value of that parameter by 54 64 in addition a simulation of a technological failure for several days was introduced to assess the durability of the produced flocs and their impact on the effectiveness of wastewater treatment the experiment showed that praestol formed stable and durable flocs while for superfloc polymer a slight temporary deterioration of wastewater quality was observed due to the lower cohesion of the activated sludge graphical abstract unlabelled image abbreviations eps extracellular polymeric substances wwtp wastewater treatment plants svi sludge volume index mw molecular weight cd charge density sbr sequential batch reactor mlss mixed liquor suspended solids keywords activated sludge polyelectrolytes wastewater treatment flocs morphology data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the activated sludge process is commonly used in most functioning wastewater treatment plants this process is based on multi component bio flocculated flocs consisting of single bacteria and microbial colonies filamentous bacteria organic fibers organic and inorganic particles and components from the wastewater or components produced during the biological process 1 3 they form three activated sludge structure levels bacteria micro colonies and flocs bacteria are tightly bound through a polymeric matrix and form micro colonies the extracellular polymeric substances come from wastewater or the microorganisms metabolism and cell lysis finally polymers and cations link the micro colonies to produce activated sludge flocs 4 the bio flocculation is an active process and depends on physical chemical and biological factors 5 activated sludge flocs in general have a heterogeneous fractal like structure they are bound by various types of intermolecular interactions such as derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo forces van der waals and electrostatic forces non dlvo forces bridging of the eps utilizing divalent trivalent cations hydrophobic interactions and physical entanglement 3 5 6 floc formers are bacteria that bind with each other using eps forming bridges between the neighboring bacteria another type of binding is a network formed by filamentous bacteria under optimal conditions the amount of filamentous and floc forming bacteria is balanced to build up large irregular dense and robust flocs forming effective settling sludge 6 7 the balance between floc forming and filamentous bacteria depends on many factors such as temperature wastewater flow rate and composition but their imbalance causes settling problems 1 8 9 the possibility of spontaneous formation of extensive and dense flocs during bioflocculation processes is a property of activated sludge which can determine the effectiveness of pollutants removal from wastewater and effective solids liquid separation in most wwtps 1 2 10 different parameters can characterize the flocs of activated sludge morphological floc size distribution fractal dimension filament index physical ability to flocculate viscosity hydrophobicity and surface charge and chemical polymeric constituents and metal content 5 the properties of flocs significantly change due to physical e g turbulence in the aeration tanks design and operation of the settlers and chemical biological factors e g degree of bioflocculation wastewater characteristics and composition of the microflora in addition flocs density and strength are influenced by the content of cations and inorganic particles and shear forces in a biological reactor during e g mixing and aeration 3 11 particle size density and floc stability are essential parameters for the settleability of activated sludge the disintegration of weak flocs may increase the number of small flocs or dispersed bacteria in the treated wastewater 2 in turn the shape and structure of the floc can reduce the sludge settling velocity when flocs have a highly irregular shape or an open form 7 the content of polymeric compounds protein humic carbohydrates and the extracted eps in the sludge has a significant positive correlation with the sludge volume index a high concentration of eps in the sludge may cause worse compressibility and settleability of the sludge still high ca mg al and fe contents in the sludge significantly improve both parameters 5 high hydrophobicity and negative surface charge correspond to high svi compressibility and settleability of activated sludge defined by svi and zone settling velocity depend significantly on the floc morphological and physical properties such as the floc s size fractal dimension and filament index 5 the flocs formation process is associated with many problems affecting the operation of wwtps and the effectiveness of wastewater treatment the most common problem is the poor settling characteristics of the activated sludge which results in biomass outflowing with treated wastewater and its worse quality 11 12 it can also cause a decrease in the sludge retention time in bioreactors controlled through excess sludge wastage worsening the efficiency of biological processes 6 the primary sludge settling problems are caused by sludge bulking proliferation of filamentous bacteria and poor flocculation properties 5 the bulking sludge most often requires appropriate chemical agents and changes in the operation of biological reactors e g increased aeration depending on the group of filamentous bacteria in the activated sludge improving floc morphology in actual conditions of wwtps operation is achieved by adding chemicals like multivalent metal salts synthetic polymers and other natural or waste materials 13 15 cainglet et al 16 tested the effectiveness of organic coagulants synthetic cationic polydadmac polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride and polyamines epichlorohydrin dimethylamine and semi synthetic based on chitosan starch and tannins in the process of primary and secondary sedimentation of municipal wastewater treatment the rate of formation and settling of flocs and the efficiency of pollutants removal from wastewater were assessed the results were compared with the inorganic coagulant polyaluminum chloride pac which unfortunately increases the salinity of wastewater and the mass of sludge after the flocculation process the best results during secondary sedimentation were obtained using polyamines with high molecular weight mw and high charge density cd for example the removal of suspended solids was 1 75 and 0 23 mg po4 p 0 07 and 0 01 mg and bod7 6 63 and 0 80 mg per mg of polyamines and pac respectively high flocculation efficiency was also found for pdmac high mw and very high cd and starch a natural polymer with less toxic and easier biodegradable than synthetic polymers al dawery et al 17 obtained similar results examining the effectiveness of inorganic coagulants aluminum sulfate calcium chloride and ferric chloride and organic polyacrylamides with various cd cpam 10 cpam 80 apam 30 during sludge conditioning the cationic cpam 80 with a very high cationicity was the most effective especially in the case of solutions with a ph close to neutral a lower svi faster zone settling and high floc density characterize this polyelectrolyte cationic polyelectrolytes are most often used to condition activated sludge before dewatering to neutralize the negative surface charge of activated sludge flocs 18 19 several studies concern the impact of the structure of cationic polymers their molecular weight and cationicity on the activated sludge flocculation efficiency 20 23 guan et al 23 showed that bridging efficiency increases with increasing polymer chain length leading to the formation of large flocs whereas eriksson et al 22 found that a low cd 10 cationic polyelectrolyte flocculates by bridging forming flocs with a flexible structure allowing the formation of a dense filter cake with high filtration resistance using polyelectrolytes of 40 and 100 cd leads to forming rigid structures conducive to effective filtration guan et al 21 obtained similar results while examining the effect of cationic polyacrylamides charge density on the flocculation mechanism the flocculation mechanism changes along with cd increase at low cd the bridging mechanism dominates while for high cd the neutralization of the negative charge of the activated sludge flocs takes place higher cd polymers require lower doses than lower cd polymers 20 there are also studies examining the effectiveness of cationic polymers in combination with anionic or non ionic substances for example al dawery 17 achieved higher turbidity removal efficiency and better sedimentation properties of activated sludge using sequential dosing of cationic polyacrylamide low mw cpam 10 or high mw cpam 80 and anionic polyacrylamide apam 30 compared to individual polymers the sequential dosing of polymers improved svi by 62 the simultaneous use of cationic polyelectrolyte kp 201c and non ionic polyelectrolyte np 800 led to obtaining larger flocs of conditioned sludge it also caused better dewaterability of the sludge and a lower chance of overdosing the flocculation mechanism explained the process s high efficiency adsorption of the cationic polymer on negatively charged sludge particles and then adsorption of the non ionic polymer on the loops and tails of the cationic polyelectrolyte with hydrogen bonding and van der waals force 24 chemical conditioning of sludge using cationic polymers can also be supported by other substances or physical methods e g ultrasound under the influence of ultrasound polymers can recombine depending on the conditions charge separation or fusion of long chain radicals forming in the ultrasonic field these processes lead to the formation of polymers with different physicochemical properties than the starting chemical compounds 25 yang et al observed a synergistic effect between cpam and synthetic fibers pet pp viscose rayon the water content in the sludge decreased from 96 2 to 65 9 using the cpam dose of 1 mg g ds and pp 0 15 g g ds the authors also showed that adding fibers supported dewatering mainly by breaking the tightly bound eps in addition the presence of fibers increased the rigidity of the structure creating a porous sludge cake with low compressibility 26 wojcik et al noted an increase in the filtration rate of sludge conditioned with cationic polyacrylamide sedifloc 1050cmmw after adding biomass ash the ash did not significantly increase the dewatering efficiency but allowed for the reduction of the polymer dose by half reducing process cost by 30 27 cited literature shows that the polymers are usually applied to remove suspended solids in the initial clarifier and the sewage sludge thickening and dewatering in wwtps however operators have increasingly used this chemical to support the flocculation and sedimentation of activated sludge in secondary settling tanks in recent years therefore we need to answer the following questions to what extent do chemical reagents impact the biochemical wastewater treatment processes what are the dose limits beyond which there are problems in the efficiency of wastewater treatment does the type of polymer matter what are the side effects of that process in this paper the authors have investigated the impact of cationic polyelectrolytes on the properties of activated sludge in laboratory sequencing batch reactors sbrs and basic physical and chemical parameters of treated wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater the tests were carried out using raw wastewater collected from the koszalin municipal wwtp samples were collected twice a week from the screen chamber at the beginning of the technological system each time a fundamental qualitative analysis of municipal wastewater was carried out its results are presented in table 1 2 2 activated sludge activated sludge was collected from an aerobic reactor at the municipal wwtp koszalin poland wwtp uses the activated sludge system with effective biological nutrient removal in the laboratory sludge samples were added to sequential batch reactors sbrs and filled with raw wastewater 1 1 there was no acclimatization period for the sludge adaptation from the flow system to the batch system 2 3 polyelectrolytes two cationic polyelectrolytes commonly used in sewage treatment plants were used in the research praestol 855 bs a copolymer of acrylamide with a cationic acid derivative of very high cationic charge density produced by solenis llc the netherlands as solid granules well dissolving in water superfloc c 18530 polyamine derived from dimethylamine and epichlorohydrin with high molecular weight polymer in emulsion form produced by kemira oyj finland praestol 855 bs praestol is usually used in sludge dewatering processes while superfloc c 18530 superfloc is mainly used to support the flocculation of suspended solids in the primary settling tank working solutions of polyelectrolytes were prepared each day polymers were dosed into the reactors automatically using a dosing pump 10 min before the sedimentation of the activated sludge the polymer solution was stirred on a magnetic stirrer and started 5 min before dosing the whole process was carried out automatically using time programmers 3 research methodology during the first stage of the study a static jar test was carried out to determine the effect of the polymer dose on the morphological changes of activated sludge flocs first activated sludge was collected from the aeration chamber of municipal wwtp koszalin its concentration was determined and then placed in 250 ml conical flasks then polymers were dosed in the range from 0 to 100 mg l after several minutes of mixing part of the sample was poured in a thin layer onto the petri dishes to observe macroscopically and take photographs next sediment flocs in samples were observed under a microscope the second stage of the study was carried out using a laboratory setup of sbrs presented in fig 1 the setup consisted of three sbrs in a parallel system where the first one sbr 1 was always a control reactor the second and third sbrs sbr 2 and sbr 3 were used for conducting tests the sbrs were made of a plexiglass cylinder of 3000 ml working volume 14 cm in diameter and 30 cm in height the exchange volume ratio was 20 the hydraulic retention time was approximately 30 h the sbrs were operated with 4 cycles per day each cycle lasted 6 h and consisted of filling with raw wastewater 0 5 h reaction time 4 5 h mixing 0 5 h aeration 4 0 h settling 0 5 h decanting of treated wastewater 0 25 h idle phase separation of excess sludge 0 25 h the cycle setup and conditions are described in table 2 time controllers were used for automating the operation of sbrs during the research period the reactors sludge age the solids retention time was maintained at 15 days the excess sludge was removed once a day the reactors were operated at room temperature temperature in the reactor was within the range of 19 20 c no adaptation period and maintaining high oxygen concentration in sbrs 4 mgo2 l was intentional activated sludge fine bubble aeration and intensive mixing are conditions that are not conducive to flocculation and agglomeration all reactors were operated under the same conditions the only difference was the dose of polymer in sbr 2 and sbr 3 the first tested polymer was superfloc for each sbr 2 cycle a dose of 5 mg of stock solution per liter was added and for each sbr 3 cycle dose of 30 mg l in the next stage the influence of praestol was tested in sbr 2 dose of 1 mg l and sbr 3 5 mg l such doses were adopted based on the results of the first stage of the study also to simulate the technological problems with the course of the wastewater treatment tests for each polymer were carried out in the following pattern 5 days of regular operation 20 wastewater treatment cycles in sbrs 3 day break sbrs in idle phase after decanting treated wastewater five days of regular operation such a pattern allowed us to assess the influence of polymers during the regular operation of sbrs what happens when there are problems with sbrs and how activated sludge reacts due to the use of actual raw wastewater and their qualitative variability table 1 the obtained results of the influence of polyelectrolytes on the effect of wastewater treatment must be related only to the parameters determined in the control reactor 3 1 analytical methods the following parameters were determined in raw and treated wastewater ph turbidity conductivity total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen n nh4 and orthophosphates the parameters were determined after filtration through a hard paper filter the ph and conductivity were measured using the cyberscan pcd6500 device and turbidity using turb 555ir device the toc and tn were determined using toc analyzer toc vcph with tnm 1 unit from shimadzu the ammonia nitrogen was determined using the direct nesslerization method and the orthophosphates using a colorimetric method with ammonium molybdate on a spectrophotometer uv vis dr 5000 hach activated sludge analysis included observation under a microscope biomass concentration mixed liquor suspended solids sludge settling velocity and settled sludge volume after 30 minute sedimentation v30 the settling properties of the activated sludge were determined using the sludge volume index after 30 minute sedimentation svi30 4 results and discussion during the first stage static tests on the effect of the polyelectrolyte dose on the activated sludge were carried out the dose ranged from 0 to 100 mg l the applied reagents showed high efficiency in binding activated sludge flocs into larger agglomerates within the first few minutes since dosage the test results in figs 2 3 show that optimal dose selection is necessary for a controlled change of the activated sludge flocs characteristics such analyzes allowed for the initial determination of the dose of both polymers we have observed that along with the increase of the reagents dose their chemical impact on the structure of the activated sludge also increases improving or completely changing it various interaction forces were characteristic of the applied polymers which influenced the final flocculation efficiency the dose 5 mg l of praestol polymer shows a strong aggregating effect of activated sludge flocs especially visible under the microscope fig 3 agglomerating effect increases along with the dose however doses higher than 5 mg l have no significant impact on flock formation in the case of superfloc the changes were much less dynamic much higher doses of superfloc polymer are required fig 4 to obtain similar results the dose 5 mg l of praestol brings similar results as the dose 30 mg l of superfloc in microscope image analysis such research was carried out for variable values of the activated sludge concentration obtaining similar results in the range of the adopted concentrations of both polymers in the tested range of polymer doses no changes in the liquid phase of the suspension were observed the ph remained within the range of 6 9 7 1 while the conductivity decreased slightly with the increase of the polymer dose from 1 308 to 1 235 ms cm the analysis of the polymer dose impact on the svi value of the activated sludge showed that the praestol dose of 5 mg l decreased its value from 125 ml g to 83 ml g a further increase in the dose hindered sedimentation and thickening of the sludge due to the formation of extensive flocs svi increased to 95 ml g in the case of superfloc the minimum svi value 76 ml g was obtained for the dose of 30 mg l and a further increase in the polymer dose increased the svi value to 83 ml g analysis of the structure and charge density of both cationic polyelectrolytes used shows that in the case of praestol which has a higher charge density its adsorption on the surface of activated sludge flocs occurs as a result of electrostatic interactions a dominant mechanism and bridging large loose flocs were formed at the lowest dose of the reagent on the other hand superfloc which has a higher molecular weight requires much larger doses to achieve a comparable effect obtained flocs were smaller and more compact but those features of flocs may affect their better compressibility the obtained results are similar to guan et al 21 during activated sludge conditioning with cationic polyacrylamide of high cd the mechanism of charge neutralization dominated when applying polymer with low cd the bridging mechanism is the most important during the flocculation process a polymer with a higher cationicity required a lower dose sun et al 28 investigated the effect of cationic polyacrylamide on the effectiveness of activated sludge dewatering they observed that the flocs produced by charge neutralization have a higher density and smaller size than adsorption bridging moreover as sedimentation progressed the bridging mechanism became dominant and formed large and loose flocs during the second stage of the research reagents were dosed using two doses selected individually for each polymer in the laboratory batch reactors setup dosing took place during each of the 4 sbr cycles per day causing dynamic morphological changes of the flocs in the first days of the research the sedimentation rate of the activated sludge increased along with the polymers dose therefore in the sbr 3 reactor dose 5 mg l such changes were most visible when dosing preastol complete sedimentation of the sludge was achieved within 2 3 min after the mixing and aeration step in the control reactor such a level was not achieved even after 30 min that trend continued throughout the analyzed period fig 4a b the effect of superfloc polymer dosed in a higher concentration showed much lower dynamics of sludge sedimentation changes during the initial period of the study fig 5a however the sludge sedimentation efficiency gradually increased with the test time fig 5b the obtained sludge sedimentation results should be related to mlss which decreased during the first days of the study due to the rapid transition to the batch wastewater treatment system in sbr for series with praestol dosing the most significant changes were observed during the first two days fig 6a after which mlss values ranged from 1 40 to 2 28 g l average 1 87 g l there were no significant differences in mlss values among reactors 1 2 and 3 for the series with superfloc fig 6b mlss values since day one ranged from 2 35 to 3 27 g l average 2 84 g l a noticeable difference was the lower value of the mlss in the sbr 3 reactor which was maintained for most of the test time the microscopic analysis of the activated sludge from sbr reactors during the laboratory tests showed far reaching changes in the structure of the flocs their surface has a negative charge resulting from cell wall construction and is mainly caused by diester amino carboxyl and phosphorus groups 18 the electrokinetic potential of activated sludge collected from 40 municipal and industrial sewage treatment plants ranged from 6 to 12 mv at the same time the nitrosomonas and nitrobacter bacteria responsible for the effective removal of nitrogen compounds from wastewater had a higher surface charge from 12 to 18 mv in addition studies by bennoit et al 18 showed that at a zeta potential higher than 20 mv the destruction of activated sludge flocs takes place significantly reducing the efficiency of sedimentation the negative surface charge of the activated sludge flocs justifies using cationic flocculants to increase the efficiency of their sedimentation surface charge neutralization is one of the possible interaction mechanisms between sludge flocs and polyelectrolytes chains of flocculants especially those with high charge density are stretched due to electrostatic interactions and may adhere to the surface of the flocs more easily 29 for the praestol polymer consolidation of the activated sludge flocs was observed from the first day of the test in the control sample sludge flocs were comminuted and dispersed fig 7 a dose of 1 mg l praestol caused significant improvement of the sludge structure into a more concentrated form and decreased the number of comminuted flocs that effect increased at the polymer dose of 5 mg l as a result huge agglomerates of activated sludge that do not occur in the biological chambers of wastewater treatment plants were created such size of the sludge flocs could only be obtained by using such a high dose of polymer the impact of superfloc on the structure of activated sludge flocs was much less effective fig 8 at the reagent dose of 5 mg l the photos show a slight improvement in the flocs morphology their size and aggregate state the higher dose of the polymer sbr 3 30 mg l significantly improved flocs flocculation observed since the first day of the test higher doses of polymer increase the sedimentation rate of activated sludge flocs but may also deteriorate the efficiency of its thickening in the final stage this effect may be caused by polymer chains extended coverage of sludge flocs that results in an osmotic effect which causes the repulsion of particles and makes it impossible for the water to outflow from the formed polymerized agglomerates 30 the polymer occupies virtually all active sites on the floc surface at too high doses as a result the probability of attaching other sludge flocculates by chain fragments protruding into the solution by bridging decreases bolto et al 29 also proved the possibility of adsorption due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between amide groups of polyacrylamides and hydroxyl groups that phenomenon will affect the value of the sludge control parameter svi it is a standard parameter used to describe the settling characteristics of activated sludge when applying praestol polymer the value of svi immediately decreases fig 9a and then for the highest dose it was stable over the entire test period a slight increase in the final phase of the research may result from the water blockage in the structure of the formed agglomerates as described above the dosing of the superfloc polymer despite the weaker agglomerating effect of the flocs observed under a microscope allowed the formation of flocs that sediment well and thicken without the visible negative overdosing effect fig 9b the morphological characteristic of the sludge is a critical aspect of the wastewater treatment plant operation significantly affecting the final effect of sewage treatment however the treated wastewater quality is the most crucial issue from the point of view of a wwtp operation therefore it is necessary to determine the impact of the reagents on the final effect of wastewater treatment during the research the value of individual parameters of treated wastewater was insignificant but their relation to the control reactor was due to that it was possible to determine the influence of dosed reagents on the effectiveness of biological wastewater treatment under certain conditions the analysis of the basic parameters of treated wastewater in all reactors is presented in tables 3 4 within physical parameters the most significant differences were observed in the turbidity of the wastewater fig 10a b the application of praestol polymer caused a decrease of 58 on average in sbr 2 dose 1 mg l and 60 on average in sbr 3 dose 5 mg l both values were calculated concerning turbidity in sbr 1 control reactor on the other hand superfloc caused the effect not observed for praestol the initial average improvement was 64 in the sbr 3 reactor dose 100 mg l still after a 3 day idle phase a significant deterioration of the turbidity of wastewater was observed it was higher than in the control reactor for two days juang et al 31 also observed a deterioration of sludge sedimentation only a few days after discontinuing the synthetic polymer addition the resulting flocs were in the form of pin flocs the studies on the structure of the activated sludge population showed that the presence of the polymer inhibited the growth of dominant bacteria and a significant floc former ps vesicularis in activated sludge giving a growth advantage to other bacteria e g a hydrophila they also showed that it took more than a month to rebuild the structure of the activated sludge population to its initial state in addition to the causes given by juang 31 the observed phenomenon may be caused by the partial disintegration of the formed flocs and the biodegradation of the carbon polymer components by the activated sludge during the idle phase however the turbidity value gradually decreased with each subsequent test day reaching its level in the control reactor the analysis of chemical parameters of treated wastewater is presented in tables 3 4 and figs 11 12 praestol did not impact the effectiveness of total nitrogen orthophosphates and organic carbon removal from wastewater regardless of its dose in the reactors furthermore there were no differences in the values of the analyzed parameters between the sbr 2 and sbr 3 reactors polymer doses 1 mg l and 5 mg l respectively thus it can be concluded that the reagent used despite its effect on the activated sludge s morphological changes did not influence the chemical parameters of treated wastewater in the case of superfloc a slight improvement in organic carbon removal was observed in sbr 2 and sbr 3 however after the idle phase treated wastewater quality deteriorated in the sbr 3 reactor with the highest polymer dose 30 mg l the concentration of organic carbon ammonium nitrogen and orthophosphates increased due to increased turbidity also excessive occlusion of sludge flocs by the polymer limits oxygen transfer for bacteria which release nutrients under anaerobic conditions when analyzing the obtained test results as a general it should be noted that individual parameters were determined in filtered samples apart from turbidity therefore they do not consider the impurities present in the suspension applied polymers improve the agglomeration of the flocs limiting the occurrence of dispersed particles responsible for the turbidity of the treated sewage thus the final effect of wastewater treatment may be much better than that obtained in the presented results on the other hand the results show that the applied polymers do not significantly affect the course of biochemical processes of wastewater treatment in the analyzed range and conditions however the intentionally introduced idle phases show unfavorable changes in the reactors with the highest dose of superfloc polymer 5 conclusions the polymers in wastewater treatment processes are mainly used for the initial sludge treatment and dewatering processes during the treatment and disposal of sewage sludge however many wwtps support the process of biological sludge flocculation in the bioreactor stage supporting sedimentation and separation of sludge and treated wastewater the research allowed us to determine the influence of the two applied polymers on the wastewater treatment process in large doses and for extended periods additionally the effect of the polymers on the morphology and activity of activated sludge in wastewater treatment was increased by operating the system in several cycles a day batch reactor system the polymers used in the experiments showed various efficiency and dynamics of the flocculation process of activated sludge flocs a praestol dose of 5 mg l allowed complete sludge sedimentation within 2 3 min and reduced svi by 42 superfloc required more time and a higher dose 30 mg l to achieve similar floc agglomeration but in the long term allowed obtaining reduction of svi up to 80 significant morphological changes of sludge flocs did not meaningly affect wastewater treatment s effect in terms of wastewater s chemical parameters however they had a substantial part in improving the sedimentation efficiency and rate and decreasing the transfer of a fine fraction of activated sludge solids into the outflow applied polymers reduced the turbidity of biologically treated wastewater by 60 compared to the control reactor despite significant changes in the structure of activated sludge flocs no important changes in the effectiveness of biological wastewater treatment processes such as dephosphatation or nitrification were observed the durability of this state was checked by introducing problems in the treatment process intentionally induced by interrupting it for three days simulating a problematic situation for the activated sludge such stress did not cause problems with wastewater quality after restarting the reactors with the praestol polymer also the turbidity was maintained at a low level for both doses in those reactors however in the case of the superfloc polymer noticeable deterioration in the quality of treated wastewater after the idle phase was observed for the highest dose such a result may indicate that flocs formed chemically by superfloc are less durable thus the conducted research showed that the temporary use of selected polymers in an sbr even at limit doses of reagents changes significantly flocs morphology but does not deteriorate the biological processes of wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12517,in this work activated carbon nanoparticles ac at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 wt were used to prepare polyethersulfone nanofiltration membranes the effectiveness of these membranes in separating lignin from black liquor bl was evaluated under various operating conditions the addition of ac improved all desirable properties for instance water permeability was increased by 57 50 with the addition of 1 ac and surface hydrophilicity was improved by reducing the contact angle from 66 8 to 55 2 for 0 5 ac based membranes compared to simple polymeric membranes for bl filtration 0 1 ac based membranes offered the highest flux with an improvement of 120 at 24 bar and high lignin rejection compared to simple polymeric membranes in addition these membranes exhibited the highest water permeability recovery of 98 02 when used for bl filtration followed by cleaning during optimization tests of the main operating variables temperature pressure and ph using 0 1 ac based membranes it was found that extremely high conditions for each variable resulted in decreased performance in terms of fouling and lignin rejection the best performance of these membranes in terms of flux lignin rejection and fouling resistance was observed around 40 c 20 bar and 11 5 ph within the studied range in this study a new application for ac based nf membranes was established for the separation of lignin from bl the results of this study also showed that under optimal conditions the performance of ac based 0 1 membranes was improved for the efficient separation of lignin from bl with lower membrane fouling keywords activated carbon nanoparticles experimental design kraft black liquor lignin separation nanofiltration data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the search for clean and renewable resources is becoming a major concern worldwide due to the depletion of fossil fuel reserves and the irreparable damage their use is causing to the environment the development of biorefinery and circular economy concepts has shown that polyphenolic biopolymers like lignin holds significant potential for valorization 1 3 lignin accounts for 20 30 of lignocellulosic biomass and can be used as a feedstock for a variety of biomaterials that can be used as alternatives to petroleum based products 4 5 the consumption of lignocellulosic biomass in the pulp and paper industry is very high for example in 2021 european paper industries alone consumed 152 16 million m3 of wood biomass 6 in these industries the lignocellulosic biomass is delignified to produce cellulosic pulp using various pulping techniques the most popular of which is the kraft pulping process the spent pulping liquor or black liquor bl generated by this process contains both inorganic pulping chemicals and under explored but high potential organic materials such as lignin and hemicelluloses in the traditional pulp and paper industry the dissolved organic content of bl is used to meet energy needs by incinerating it in recovery boilers 4 although it is a compound with high energy potential however its separation from bl can increase its applicability as it can be transformed into a wide and diverse range of products among the various products that can be made from lignin includes bio dispersants flocculants carbon fibers resins adsorbents nanoparticles and thermoplastic materials 3 7 11 thus the incorporation of lignin isolation into the pulp industry may provide a more viable and industrially attractive solution for these industries however isolation of lignin from bl is still challenging due to its heterogeneity polydispersity and amorphous and robust structure in this context membrane filtration has proven to be a promising technology to concentrate separate the organic components of bl this allows to produce high purity fractions with controlled molecular weight distribution depending on the molecular weight cut off pore size of the membranes which are suitable for a variety of applications without further processing 12 15 in addition to concentrating the organic components of bl it is possible to recover the low molecular weight components like severely degraded organic compounds and inorganic pulping chemicals by selecting the right molecular weight cut off membranes 16 18 these can be subjected to the standard chemical recovery process which can help in maintaining the balance of cooking chemicals and the economic feasibility of the pulping process in case of membrane separation processes the membranes materials influence their performance that subsequently affects the economics of the separation process for instance polymeric membranes provide desirable separation efficiency but they suffer from high fouling and low stability when exposed to the severe conditions of bl i e high temperature and high ph 13 19 20 these limitations can be overcome by modifying polymeric membranes using suitable treatments or nanoparticles often referred as mixed matrix membranes mmm although the application of conventional membranes and mmm has been extensively studied to fractionate or concentrate a variety of liquids and gaseous feeds generated from various industries such as food dairy and textiles 21 26 however their application in fractionation of bl a biopolymers rich streams is still limited rashidi et al 2017 reported the use of graphene oxide membranes prepared on a microporous polyethersulfone pes support for nanofiltration nf of bl under extreme operating conditions of temperature 70 85 c and ph 12 27 in a similar study valderrama et al 2021 prepared modified polysulfone psf nf membranes with a selective hydrophilized layer of polymer these membranes showed good stability under strong alkaline conditions good permeate flux 24 l m2 h at 21 5 bar for simulated bl and high rejection of organic components 28 in our previous works we investigated the effect of inorganic nanoparticles i e zno and organic nanoparticle i e multiwalled carbon nanotubes cnt on the performance of uf and nf membranes respectively for the filtration of bl 29 30 the performance of pes uf membranes improved e g water permeability increased by 73 1 and stability up to 80 c with the addition of zno nanoparticles in comparison with simple polymeric membranes zno based membranes showed higher permeate flux better separation efficiency and fouling resistance during filtration of industrial kraft bl it was also reported that the about 96 of original water permeability of mmm used for bl filtration could be recovered by a cleaning process without affecting their properties indicating the potential for reusability of these membranes 30 in the case of nf membranes cnt were used to prepare mmm to concentrate lignin from the permeate stream of the uf process the primary analysis was carried out for water filtration and filtration of bl model solution prepared using lignoboost lignin besides improvement in filtration properties the rejection of lignin also appeared to improve due to the interaction between cnt and lignin despite the larger pore size of mmm compared to simple polymeric membranes 29 however considering the high cost of cnt and the difficulty in dispersing them as well as the low permeate flux in the filtration of industrial bl pre filtered through a uf membrane further work is needed to improve the effectiveness of cnt based mmm for bl filtration therefore in this work activated carbon nanoparticles ac were selected for the preparation of mmm instead of cnt due to their good adsorption affinity toward lignin and lower cost 31 in addition the base polymer psf was replaced by pes which has a higher affinity for water used as a non solvent due to its polar structure and can lead to the development of membranes with greater flexibility porosity and permeate flow for the filtration of liquid feed 32 this work aims to study the formation and application of ac based nf membranes to separate lignin from industrial bl pre filtered by uf to the best of our knowledge no studies have been conducted on the filtration of bl using ac based mmm the effect of ac concentration was examined on the characteristics and filtration performance of prepared membranes and the operating conditions temperature pressure ph were optimized for the selected membrane the optimization study which included temperature and pressure was carried out using a full factorial experimental design and used to analyze the effects of these key variables on permeate flux lignin rejection and flux reduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials polyethersulfone pes mw 60 000 g mol was used as the base polymer for the preparation of nf membranes and was purchased from acros organics the other components of the casting solution for the preparation of membrane namely polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp mw 2900 g mol activated carbon nanoparticles ac particle size 100 nm and dmac were purchased from sigma aldrich industrial bl produced from the kraft pulping process using eucalyptus wood as raw material was supplied by a portuguese pulp and paper mill this bl was pre filtered by zno based pes ultrafiltration membranes to separate the high molecular weight components in the retentate stream as reported in our previous works 18 30 the permeate obtained from this uf process was used as feed for the nf process aiming to concentrate lignin by optimizing the performance of the prepared nf membranes the primary characteristics of kraft bl unfiltered and uf permeate feed for the nf process are shown in table 1 for which the characterization methodology has been described elsewhere 29 2 2 preparation of ac based nf membranes nf membranes with and without ac nanoparticles were prepared by nonsolvent induced phase inversion nipi process using deionized water as nonsolvent pes casting solution was prepared according to the composition given in table 2 using pvp ac and dmac as pore forming agent organic fillers and solvent respectively the process of preparation of casting solutions and membranes was described in our previous works 29 30 briefly first pvp was mixed in dmac by mechanical stirring and a specific amount of ac was dispersed in this solution by ultrasonic treatment for 15 20 min then pes was added to the obtained suspension and stirring was continued overnight at room temperature rt the prepared solution was then ultrasonicated for 15 min to prevent the formation of nanoparticle aggregates and kept in a vacuum oven at rt for 4 h to remove entrapped air the obtained polymeric solution with or without nanoparticles was spread over a clean glass plate using an automatic film applicator elcometer 4340 the thickness of the casting knife was maintained at 250 μm using a variable thickness knife the casted membranes were immediately immersed in a coagulation bath containing distilled water which was maintained at rt after primary phase separation the prepared membranes sheets were transferred to another freshwater bath and kept there for 24 h to ensure complete solvent extraction the membranes were then dried between filter papers for 48 h at rt 2 3 characterization of nf membranes the surface and morphological properties of the membranes were analyzed in terms of porosity mean pore size surface hydrophilicity and structural analysis using microscopic techniques the detailed procedure for these analysis can be found elsewhere 29 30 briefly porosity was determined by weight gravimetric analysis for which the weight of the membranes in the wet and dry states was used then using the porosity and permeability data the mean pore radius rm of the prepared membranes was calculated using the guerout elford ferry equation the surface hydrophilicity of the prepared nf membranes was analyzed by the static water contact angle wca using an oca 20 goniometer dataphysics germany equipment the sessile drop method was used to measure the wca by fitting the young laplace equation to minimize the error an average of 10 drops was reported scanning electron microscopy sem and atomic force microscopy afm were used for microscopic observation of pores structures and surface topology of the membranes sem analysis was performed using vega3 tescan analytics equipment and the surface and cross section of the prepared membranes was observed before analysis the membrane samples were fractured by immersion in liquid nitrogen and sputtered with a thin layer of gold palladium afm analysis was performed using nt mdt spectrum instruments ntegra equipment and three dimensional afm images were obtained by observing a surface area of 10 μm 10 μm by tapping mode the afm data were used to determine the surface roughness parameters namely mean roughness sa root mean square rms roughness maximum peak height sp valley depth sv and maximum height of roughness sz using gwyddion software 2 4 nanofiltration tests all filtration tests were performed using a stirred cell filtration system sterlitech hp4750 operating in dead end filtration mode all tests were carried out in replicates and the average values were reported for them the feed in the filtration cell was always agitated to achieve a reynolds number in the range of 7000 8000 this led the feed flow under the turbulence region and helped in minimizing the concentration polarization on the membrane surface 29 first the comparative filtration performance of the prepared membranes was analyzed by water and bl filtration tests the water filtration tests were performed in a transmembrane pressure tmp range of 6 24 bar at rt filtration studies using bl were conducted in a pressure range of 12 24 bar at 60 c and a feed ph 10 5 during the optimization studies of the operating variables the effects of temperature tmp and ph was analyzed in the range of 40 80 c 12 24 bar and 9 13 respectively the desired temperature in the cell was maintained using a thermostatic coil which was wrapped around the cell and insulated by covering with an insulating tape besides that the cell was also placed over a magnetic stirrer equipped with a hot plate before starting a filtration experiment the membrane in the cell was pressurized with distilled water at the highest pressure 24 bar until a stable flux was achieved the pure water flux pwf jw was evaluated by collecting permeate at varying pressure during fixed time intervals and calculated as the volume of permeate collected per unit of filtration time and effective membrane area the obtained values of pwf were plotted as a function of applied pressure resulting in a straight line curve the slope of this curve was used to determine the value of the average hydraulic permeability lp jw tmp in the range of applied tmp the hydraulic resistances r m of the membranes were calculated from the lp values r m lp μw where μw is the water viscosity after the water filtration tests the membrane performances were analyzed for the bl filtration bl feed used in this study refers to the permeate obtained from the uf process for the comparative study of the filtration performance of the prepared membranes the feed temperature was set at 60 c and the tmp was changed after fixed time intervals the permeate samples collected during these tests were analyzed in a set of 3 replicates to determine the lignin concentrations by uv vis spectrophotometry which has been described in detail elsewhere 29 allowing to determine its retention values calculated using eq 1 1 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf are the concentrations of lignin in the permeate and feed solution respectively to analyze the fouling resistance of the membranes the flux reduction during bl filtration was determined j1 j2 j1 100 by using the values of permeate flux which were observed at the beginning j1 and at the end j2 of filtration further the behavior of the membranes toward the cleaning process was evaluated by cleaning the membranes used for bl filtrations cleaning was performed sequentially by rinsing with distilled water followed by chemical cleaning with 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl solution at 50 c afterwards distilled water was filtered at 18 bar until the ph of feed was neutralized after chemical cleaning pwf and hydraulic permeability were analyzed at 18 bar the permeability data of the new membrane lp1 and the used membrane after cleaning lp2 were used to determine the antifouling ability of the prepared membranes by determining the permeability recovery lp2 lp1 100 2 5 experimental design based on the results of the membranes characterization studies one type of membrane was selected to find the operating conditions that would ensure its optimal performance a full factorial experiment 32 was designed considering 2 independent variables with 3 levels which are shown in table 3 the independent variables operating conditions namely feed temperature x1 and tmp x2 were selected for optimization studies the individual and interactive effects of the independent variables on the response variables filtration performance parameters i e initial permeate flux y1 lignin rejection y2 and flux reduction after filtration for 120 min y3 were analyzed a total of 9 experiments were conducted and each experiment was performed in duplicate design of experiments doe and statistical analysis of results were performed using jmp 16 pro and statistica 7 software the multiple regression models were developed based on the results of the doe to predict the performance parameters within the experimental range of operating conditions the general equation for 2nd order regression models can be expressed as eq 2 2 y α 0 i 1 n α i x i i 1 n α ii x i 2 1 i j n α ij x i x j where y α0 xi or xj αi αj and αij represent the response variables intercept independent variables and regression coefficients of the linear quadratic and interactive terms respectively considering the obtained experimental results a prediction profiler was generated using the jmp software the prediction profiler illustrates the variation of response variables with change in operating conditions within the experimental range this can then be used to determine the desirability function to identify the best operating conditions for multiple response processes by considering whether a response variable needed to be maximized or minimized 33 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization 3 1 1 porosity mean pore size and surface hydrophilicity the porosity mean pore size and wca of the prepared nf membranes are shown in fig 1 a and b it can be observed that the porosity pore size and surface hydrophilicity of nf membranes increased for the ac based membranes compared to the simple polymeric membrane 0 ac the improvement in porosity and pore size with the addition of ac can be explained by the increased heterogeneity of the membrane surface which leads to more voids in the polymeric matrix of membrane that can accommodate more water molecules 29 34 porosity was slightly reduced for 0 2 and 0 5 ac based membranes which may be caused by the delayed demixing of solvent and non solvent due to increased viscosity of the casting solution however at a high concentration of nanoparticles they can act as a surfactant and help to reduce the surface tension between the non solvent and the polymer film this leads to an increase in the exchange rate of solvent and non solvent during the phase inversion process resulting in the formation of bigger pores on the membrane surface 35 fig 1 b shows that the wca of the ac based membranes reduced in comparison with the simple polymeric membrane indicating higher surface hydrophilicity the highest reduction in wca was observed for 0 5 ac based membranes for which the contact angle was reduced by 17 36 compared to simple polymeric membrane the contact angle increased with further increase of the nanoparticle content to 1 which could be due to the increased chances of formation of nanoparticles aggregates at high concentration this leads to a lower accessibility of the hydrophilic moity of the nanoparticles at the membrane surface 30 3 1 2 morphology characterization by sem and afm the pore morphology of the membranes was observed using sem cross sectional images as shown in fig 2 all membranes exhibited an asymmetric structure with a top dense layer of micropores connected to macropores developed in the sublayer from fig 2 a b and c it can be seen that when ac were added at low concentration up to 0 2 the membranes presented a structure with well connected pores in the top and bottom layer however further increase in nanoparticles concentration resulted in a structure with closed pores in the bottom layer see fig 2 d and e this can be explained by the fact that the addition of ac to the casting solution can affect the exchange rate of solvent and non solvent during the phase separation process it is likely that the viscosity of the solution increases due to the addition of nanoparticles and the presence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties on its surface due to the delayed demixing of solvent and non solvent the macroporous structure in bottom layer is suppressed resulting in a more closed structure 36 the topological analysis of the membranes using the afm technique is shown in fig 3 and the statistical roughness data obtained by processing the afm images are presented in table 4 in table 4 the key roughness parameter is rms roughness which defines the average surface roughness of the prepared membranes these afm images demonstrate the peaks and valleys present on the membrane surface by the light and dark shades respectively it can be observed that at a very low concentration 0 1 the membranes presented a smooth surface with less contrasting shading as illustrated in fig 3 b and can also be verified from table 4 however with increasing concentration of nanoparticles there were more irregularities on the membrane surface with very high peaks and valleys furthermore in fig 3 e the lighter and darker regions become broaden which represents the agglomeration of nanoparticles at the highest concentration of ac nanoparticles 1 37 3 1 3 hydraulic permeability and resistance following the structural and topological analysis of the prepared membranes the filtration properties of the membranes were analyzed to observe the effects of nanoparticles on their filtration efficiency the variation of pwf along the tmp as well as the average permeability and hydraulic resistance of these membranes are shown in figs 4 a and b it can be seen that the membranes prepared with nanoparticles offered high pwf and permeability compared to simple polymeric membrane the permeability of ac based membranes increased with increasing concentration of ac except for the 0 2 ac based membrane the improvement in the permeability of the ac based membranes was a mutual influence of their porosity pore size and surface hydrophilicity a similar trend was also observed in our previous works and in the literature 30 38 the highest permeability was obtained for the 1 ac based membrane followed by the membranes prepared with concentrations of 0 5 and 0 1 ac the addition of ac at the highest concentration 1 resulted in an increase of 57 50 in hydraulic permeability compared to simple polymeric membrane the permeability of the 0 2 ac based membranes was the lowest among the ac based membranes which can be a mutual effect of low porosity and pore size see fig 1 a a similar behavior was observed by vatanpour et al 2012 for the reduction in pwf due to the decrease in pore size for mmm prepared using boehmite nanoparticles 38 as expected the hydraulic resistance of each membrane is inversely proportional to its permeability it can be observed that the simple polymeric membrane offered the highest hydraulic resistance among all the prepared nf membranes while it was the lowest for the 1 ac based membrane the hydraulic resistance was decreased by 37 28 for the 1 ac based membrane compared to simple polymeric membrane 3 2 membrane selection 3 2 1 black liquor filtration tests the effect of ac nanoparticles on the bl filtration performance of the prepared membranes was analyzed in the tmp range of 12 24 bar and at a temperature of 60 c to minimize the effects of irreversible fouling filtration was performed for only 20 min at each pressure and the permeate was collected for analysis of lignin rejection the variation in the permeate flux and lignin rejection along the tmp 12 18 and 24 bar can be seen in figs 5 a and 5 b respectively it can be observed that the permeate flux increased with tmp which showed that the permeate flux was below limiting flux for all these membranes however for the simple polymeric 0 1 and 1 ac based membranes the permeate flux started to be stabilized after 18 bar proving it as threshold tmp flux 39 however for the 0 2 and 0 5 ac based membranes the permeate flux increased almost linearly when the tmp was increased from 18 to 24 bar this indicates that these membranes due to their smaller pore size and high surface hydrophilicity are more stable when operating under high tmp to reach the limiting flux see figs 1 a and b further comparing the effect of ac nanoparticles on filtration it was also found that permeate flux through ac based membranes was higher compared to simple polymeric membrane the highest bl permeate flux was achieved by membranes prepared with 0 1 ac followed by membranes prepared with concentration of 0 2 1 and 0 5 ac this can be explained by the mutual effect of porosity and pore size while the higher concentration of nanoparticles can lead to blockage of membrane pores which dominated over the effect of porosity and pore size in these membranes in addition permeate samples collected at each pressure were analyzed for lignin concentration which were used to determine the rejection from fig 5 b it can be seen that lignin rejection increased with tmp which can be explained by the fact that due to the pressure gradient and the increase in the permeate flux the solute transport through these membranes was facilitated by the convection mechanism 40 the lignin rejection of all the prepared membranes was in the range of 85 92 the ac based membranes displayed a higher rejection compared to simple polymeric membrane despite having a slightly larger pore size it can be explained by that the rejection through these membranes was controlled not only by their pore size but also by the interaction between the membrane components and the solute molecules lignin a similar type of lignin rejection trend was observed in our previous work when we used a carbon nanotubes based polysulfone nf membrane for filtration of a lignin model solution 29 however among the ac based membranes the effect of pore size on rejection was observed due to the small pore size for instance 0 2 ac based membrane presented highest rejection in the range of 90 92 3 2 2 membrane fouling and cleaning to evaluate the reusability and antifouling ability the membranes were cleaned and the permeability recovery was analyzed using distilled water it was found that the recovery of permeability for the ac based membranes was higher than that of the simple polymeric membrane for the simple polymeric membrane only 79 54 of the original permeability was recovered while the highest permeability recovery of 98 02 was observed for the 0 1 ac based membrane in our previous work it was reported that cleaning with only an alkaline solution 0 2 m naoh resulted in pore dilation in simple polymeric membranes resulting in complete recovery of permeability but rejection by these membranes decreased 29 however in the present work the problem of pore dilation was overcome by using a milder alkaline solution and the adding of a subsequent cleaning step using a mild acidic solution as for the ac based membranes permeability recovery showed a direct correlation with surface hydrophilicity and roughness a similar observation was made by vatanpour et al 2012 during whey filtration using boehmite nanoparticles based mmm 38 since the membranes prepared with 0 5 and 1 ac showed high hydrophilicity and low surface roughness than the 0 2 ac based membrane their permeability recovery was higher the permeability recovery for nf membranes prepared with 0 2 0 5 and 1 ac were 88 09 95 87 and 91 54 respectively the above results showed that the membrane prepared with a concentration of 0 1 ac exhibited the highest flux and permeability recovery and the lignin rejection was also within the acceptable range expected for nf membranes therefore this membrane was selected for the optimization studies of the operating variables to improve its performance 3 3 optimization of operating variables 3 3 1 effect of temperature and pressure to optimize the key operating variables the effects of temperature and tmp was investigated on the initial permeate flux lignin rejection and flux reduction for the analysis of flux reduction the filtration was performed for 120 min for each run then the flux reduction was measured at the end of filtration and was compared to the initial flux the results of all runs based on the full factorial experimental design are shown in table 5 the objective was to maximize the flux and lignin rejection with the least possible reduction in permeate flux by analyzing the variation of the response variables as a function of the changes in the independent variables the regression coefficients for multivariate models were obtained these regression coefficients were used to develop the mathematical models given by eqs 3 5 which can be used to predict the values of the response variables at any combination of the operating variables normalized temperature and pressure values in the studied range the statistical parameters and determination coefficients r2 and adjusted r2 for these models are shown in table s1 the r2 adjusted r2 values for flux lignin rejection and flux reduction were 0 9926 0 9804 0 9840 0 9573 and 0 9083 0 7555 respectively analysis of variance and goodness of fit showed that these models had a good predictability for the response variables this was verified by comparing the predicted values of the response variables obtained using the multivariate models with the experimental values see fig s1 it was observed that the predicted values were in agreement with the experimental results indicating that the changes in operating conditions have significant effects on the response variables 3 y 1 53 654 4 502 x 1 60 20 10 831 x 2 18 6 5 211 x 1 60 20 x 2 18 6 4 759 x 1 60 20 2 2 331 x 2 18 6 2 4 y 2 86 773 3 121 x 1 60 20 0 924 x 2 18 6 1 416 x 1 60 20 x 2 18 6 0 413 x 1 60 20 2 3 591 x 2 18 6 2 5 y 3 6 210 0 342 x 1 60 20 4 384 x 2 18 6 1 130 x 1 60 20 x 2 18 6 1 781 x 1 60 20 2 2 602 x 2 18 6 2 the significance of each independent variable for both its linear l and quadratic q terms and the interactions of its linear terms can be analyzed by observing the pareto charts of each response variable in a 95 confidence interval p 0 05 which are shown in fig 6 from fig 6 a it can be observed that for flux both temperature q and tmp l q and their interaction showed a significant effect p 0 05 except temperature l for lignin rejection on the other hand temperature q and tmp l showed insignificant effects with a p value of 0 05 see table s1 further it was observed that with high flux flux reduction also increased which was undesirable and fig 6 c showed that only tmp l had a significant effect on flux reduction the multivariate mathematical models were used to generate 3d surface plots for each response variable and desirability profiler shown in figs 7 and 8 the 3d plots depict the variation of the response variables along with the changes in operating conditions and represented by different shading the prediction profiler on the other hand illustrates the changes in the response variables by changing one independent variable and keeping another variable constant to maximize desirability the desirability function changes within a range 0 1 representing the lowest to the highest desirability value for a response the predicted responses are presented by shaded area within the 95 confidence interval it can be seen that with as the temperature increased from 40 to 60 c the permeate flux decreased and the flux reduction increased the effect reversed when temperature was further increased from 60 to 80 c in the case of lignin rejection it decreased with increasing temperature this can be explained by the fact that high temperature can affect the flux and solute rejection through different aspects namely enlargement of effective pore size increasing the diffusivity of solutes and reducing viscosity of the solution 41 the observed kinematic viscosity of bl uf permeate was 1 46 0 0056 1 08 0 0040 mm2 s 0 76 0 0014 mm2 s and 0 58 0 0068 mm2 s at 25 40 60 and 80 c respectively therefore the decrease in viscosity at 40 c can explain the increase in flux however with further increase in temperature the higher diffusivity of larger solute molecules through the pores led to pore blockage and flux reduction with further increase in temperature up to 80 c the increase in the flux and the reduction in lignin rejection may be associated with the enlargement in membrane pores however the overall pore structure of these membranes was stable until 80 c as the surface and cross section of the 0 1 ac based membranes were observed by sem after cleaning the membranes which was used at 80 c and 24 bar no visible change in the morphology of pores was observed in sem analysis surface and cross sectional sem images of used 0 1 ac based membrane are shown in fig s2 as for the tmp effect this variable showed a strong influence on the behavior of the flux and flux reduction both flux and flux reduction increased continuously with tmp while lignin rejection first increased with a change in tmp from 12 to 18 bar and then decreased from 18 to 24 bar the improvement in flux until the limiting flux value was achieved with tmp can be associated with an increase in the driving force for the filtration process however after the critical flux high flux led to higher reduction due to the accumulation of solute molecules over membrane surface and in the pores 39 42 thus as high flux and high lignin rejection were desirable for high efficiency of the prepared nf membranes which was observed at low temperature and high pressure conditions however high flux was always accompanied by high flux reduction fouling of the membranes which led to lower performance of the nf process therefore to achieve the highest possible desirability a trade off between maximizing flux and lignin rejection and minimizing flux reduction needed to be done from the desirability profiler the maximum overall desirability of 0 54 was achieved at 40 c and 20 bar which can be considered as the optimum operating conditions 3 3 2 effect of feed ph and volume recovery after optimization of temperature and tmp the effect of feed ph and changes in feed volume were analyzed filtration was performed at 40 5 c 18 20 bar for 120 min and permeate samples were collected at 20 min intervals the variation in flux and lignin rejection with ph and filtration time is shown in fig 9 it can be observed that with increasing feed ph permeate flux increased while lignin rejection decreased this can be explained by the mutual influence of the variation in lignin molecular size and the effective pore size of nf membranes 43 44 due to the changing ph the decrease of bl ph led to the coagulation of lignin and formation of larger moleculars which can justify the increase in rejection at low ph further at high ph the increase in permate flux can be associated with the pore swelling besides varition into lignin solubility which has already been previously reported by many researchers 44 45 it is worth mentioning that during filtration at ph 9 the feed temperature was increased to 50 c causing the observed flux at ph 9 to be similar to the flux at ph 10 and showing slightly higher reduction and lower lignin rejection the intial bl permeate flux showed a reduction of around 58 16 at ph 10 compared to the flux of the original bl ph 13 it was found that due to the high flux at a ph of 13 the flux reduction was also the highest when the filtration was performed using 50 ml feed volume the flux reduced by 63 27 after 120 min of filtration this is because with high permeate flux the retentate concentration changed significantly resulted in flux reduction due to the development of concentration polarization at the membrane surface this can also be confirmed by observing the trend of lignin rejection which reduced from 71 26 to 57 11 with increasing filtration time this can be justified by the fact that the transport of solute lignin molecules under constant pressure was facilitated by a diffusion mechanism due to the dominant effect of the concentration gradient across the membrane surface 40 the diffusion of solute molecules to permeate side intended to minimize the concentration gradient concentration polarization which led to reduced rejection of lignin this was verified by repeating the filtration at original ph and using 250 ml feed volume to minimize the effects of significant volume reduction and subsequent concentration gradient it was observed that the flux reduction was lower 43 27 and the lignin rejection was also stabilized 70 since high flux and high lignin rejection are desirable for high performance of membrane and high ph showed opposite effect on flux and rejection therefore a trade off needs to be done at a ph of 11 5 the best balance was achieved between flux 15 62 l m2h flux reduction 19 73 and lignin rejection 80 47 therefore besides optimum temperature and tmp a small reduction in ph to 11 5 will further improve the filtration efficiency of these nf membranes these results showed that the use of ac based mmm and optimization of operating variables cumulatively improved membrane performance separation efficiency and fouling resistance for the separation of lignin from bl these aspects could ultimately influence the economics of the lignin separation process since this study was carried out at laboratory scale the information obtained may be used in the future for the scaling up and estimating the economic viability of the lignin separation process 4 conclusions the effect of ac nanoparticles on the performance of pes membranes was studied for the separation of lignin from bl along with the selection of optimal operating conditions for improving filtration efficiency the addition of ac improved all desirable properties of membrane porosity pore size surface hydrophilicity surface roughness water and bl permeability and fouling resistance compared to simple polymeric membranes it was found that the average surface roughness reduced by 22 97 at the lowest concentration 0 1 of ac nanoparticles while the highest surface hydrophilicity was observed at a concentration of 0 5 where the water contact angle was reduced by 11 6 for the bl filtration the membranes prepared with the lowest concentration of ac showed the highest flux of 9 04 0 29 l m2h at 24 bar good lignin rejection 88 91 at 12 24 bar and the highest flux recovery of 98 02 after cleaning the membrane whereas flux recovery was 79 54 for the simple polymeric membranes the study to optimize the operating variables was carried out using 0 1 ac based membranes in the range of 40 80 c 12 24 bar and 9 13 ph the results of the experimental design showed that temperature and pressure have a statistically significant effect on flux and lignin rejection but only pressure has a statistically significant effect on reduction of flux the best operating conditions for temperature and pressure were determined using the desirability profiler finding an acceptable process trade off between high values of flux lignin rejection and low flux reduction fouling in case of feed ph both high and low ph values adversely affected membrane performance therefore the optimal working parameters for the best membrane performance with minimal fouling were chosen to be 40 c 20 bar and 11 5 ph declaration of competing interest there is no interest need to be declared in this manuscript acknowledgements this work was carried out under

12517,in this work activated carbon nanoparticles ac at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 wt were used to prepare polyethersulfone nanofiltration membranes the effectiveness of these membranes in separating lignin from black liquor bl was evaluated under various operating conditions the addition of ac improved all desirable properties for instance water permeability was increased by 57 50 with the addition of 1 ac and surface hydrophilicity was improved by reducing the contact angle from 66 8 to 55 2 for 0 5 ac based membranes compared to simple polymeric membranes for bl filtration 0 1 ac based membranes offered the highest flux with an improvement of 120 at 24 bar and high lignin rejection compared to simple polymeric membranes in addition these membranes exhibited the highest water permeability recovery of 98 02 when used for bl filtration followed by cleaning during optimization tests of the main operating variables temperature pressure and ph using 0 1 ac based membranes it was found that extremely high conditions for each variable resulted in decreased performance in terms of fouling and lignin rejection the best performance of these membranes in terms of flux lignin rejection and fouling resistance was observed around 40 c 20 bar and 11 5 ph within the studied range in this study a new application for ac based nf membranes was established for the separation of lignin from bl the results of this study also showed that under optimal conditions the performance of ac based 0 1 membranes was improved for the efficient separation of lignin from bl with lower membrane fouling keywords activated carbon nanoparticles experimental design kraft black liquor lignin separation nanofiltration data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the search for clean and renewable resources is becoming a major concern worldwide due to the depletion of fossil fuel reserves and the irreparable damage their use is causing to the environment the development of biorefinery and circular economy concepts has shown that polyphenolic biopolymers like lignin holds significant potential for valorization 1 3 lignin accounts for 20 30 of lignocellulosic biomass and can be used as a feedstock for a variety of biomaterials that can be used as alternatives to petroleum based products 4 5 the consumption of lignocellulosic biomass in the pulp and paper industry is very high for example in 2021 european paper industries alone consumed 152 16 million m3 of wood biomass 6 in these industries the lignocellulosic biomass is delignified to produce cellulosic pulp using various pulping techniques the most popular of which is the kraft pulping process the spent pulping liquor or black liquor bl generated by this process contains both inorganic pulping chemicals and under explored but high potential organic materials such as lignin and hemicelluloses in the traditional pulp and paper industry the dissolved organic content of bl is used to meet energy needs by incinerating it in recovery boilers 4 although it is a compound with high energy potential however its separation from bl can increase its applicability as it can be transformed into a wide and diverse range of products among the various products that can be made from lignin includes bio dispersants flocculants carbon fibers resins adsorbents nanoparticles and thermoplastic materials 3 7 11 thus the incorporation of lignin isolation into the pulp industry may provide a more viable and industrially attractive solution for these industries however isolation of lignin from bl is still challenging due to its heterogeneity polydispersity and amorphous and robust structure in this context membrane filtration has proven to be a promising technology to concentrate separate the organic components of bl this allows to produce high purity fractions with controlled molecular weight distribution depending on the molecular weight cut off pore size of the membranes which are suitable for a variety of applications without further processing 12 15 in addition to concentrating the organic components of bl it is possible to recover the low molecular weight components like severely degraded organic compounds and inorganic pulping chemicals by selecting the right molecular weight cut off membranes 16 18 these can be subjected to the standard chemical recovery process which can help in maintaining the balance of cooking chemicals and the economic feasibility of the pulping process in case of membrane separation processes the membranes materials influence their performance that subsequently affects the economics of the separation process for instance polymeric membranes provide desirable separation efficiency but they suffer from high fouling and low stability when exposed to the severe conditions of bl i e high temperature and high ph 13 19 20 these limitations can be overcome by modifying polymeric membranes using suitable treatments or nanoparticles often referred as mixed matrix membranes mmm although the application of conventional membranes and mmm has been extensively studied to fractionate or concentrate a variety of liquids and gaseous feeds generated from various industries such as food dairy and textiles 21 26 however their application in fractionation of bl a biopolymers rich streams is still limited rashidi et al 2017 reported the use of graphene oxide membranes prepared on a microporous polyethersulfone pes support for nanofiltration nf of bl under extreme operating conditions of temperature 70 85 c and ph 12 27 in a similar study valderrama et al 2021 prepared modified polysulfone psf nf membranes with a selective hydrophilized layer of polymer these membranes showed good stability under strong alkaline conditions good permeate flux 24 l m2 h at 21 5 bar for simulated bl and high rejection of organic components 28 in our previous works we investigated the effect of inorganic nanoparticles i e zno and organic nanoparticle i e multiwalled carbon nanotubes cnt on the performance of uf and nf membranes respectively for the filtration of bl 29 30 the performance of pes uf membranes improved e g water permeability increased by 73 1 and stability up to 80 c with the addition of zno nanoparticles in comparison with simple polymeric membranes zno based membranes showed higher permeate flux better separation efficiency and fouling resistance during filtration of industrial kraft bl it was also reported that the about 96 of original water permeability of mmm used for bl filtration could be recovered by a cleaning process without affecting their properties indicating the potential for reusability of these membranes 30 in the case of nf membranes cnt were used to prepare mmm to concentrate lignin from the permeate stream of the uf process the primary analysis was carried out for water filtration and filtration of bl model solution prepared using lignoboost lignin besides improvement in filtration properties the rejection of lignin also appeared to improve due to the interaction between cnt and lignin despite the larger pore size of mmm compared to simple polymeric membranes 29 however considering the high cost of cnt and the difficulty in dispersing them as well as the low permeate flux in the filtration of industrial bl pre filtered through a uf membrane further work is needed to improve the effectiveness of cnt based mmm for bl filtration therefore in this work activated carbon nanoparticles ac were selected for the preparation of mmm instead of cnt due to their good adsorption affinity toward lignin and lower cost 31 in addition the base polymer psf was replaced by pes which has a higher affinity for water used as a non solvent due to its polar structure and can lead to the development of membranes with greater flexibility porosity and permeate flow for the filtration of liquid feed 32 this work aims to study the formation and application of ac based nf membranes to separate lignin from industrial bl pre filtered by uf to the best of our knowledge no studies have been conducted on the filtration of bl using ac based mmm the effect of ac concentration was examined on the characteristics and filtration performance of prepared membranes and the operating conditions temperature pressure ph were optimized for the selected membrane the optimization study which included temperature and pressure was carried out using a full factorial experimental design and used to analyze the effects of these key variables on permeate flux lignin rejection and flux reduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials polyethersulfone pes mw 60 000 g mol was used as the base polymer for the preparation of nf membranes and was purchased from acros organics the other components of the casting solution for the preparation of membrane namely polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp mw 2900 g mol activated carbon nanoparticles ac particle size 100 nm and dmac were purchased from sigma aldrich industrial bl produced from the kraft pulping process using eucalyptus wood as raw material was supplied by a portuguese pulp and paper mill this bl was pre filtered by zno based pes ultrafiltration membranes to separate the high molecular weight components in the retentate stream as reported in our previous works 18 30 the permeate obtained from this uf process was used as feed for the nf process aiming to concentrate lignin by optimizing the performance of the prepared nf membranes the primary characteristics of kraft bl unfiltered and uf permeate feed for the nf process are shown in table 1 for which the characterization methodology has been described elsewhere 29 2 2 preparation of ac based nf membranes nf membranes with and without ac nanoparticles were prepared by nonsolvent induced phase inversion nipi process using deionized water as nonsolvent pes casting solution was prepared according to the composition given in table 2 using pvp ac and dmac as pore forming agent organic fillers and solvent respectively the process of preparation of casting solutions and membranes was described in our previous works 29 30 briefly first pvp was mixed in dmac by mechanical stirring and a specific amount of ac was dispersed in this solution by ultrasonic treatment for 15 20 min then pes was added to the obtained suspension and stirring was continued overnight at room temperature rt the prepared solution was then ultrasonicated for 15 min to prevent the formation of nanoparticle aggregates and kept in a vacuum oven at rt for 4 h to remove entrapped air the obtained polymeric solution with or without nanoparticles was spread over a clean glass plate using an automatic film applicator elcometer 4340 the thickness of the casting knife was maintained at 250 μm using a variable thickness knife the casted membranes were immediately immersed in a coagulation bath containing distilled water which was maintained at rt after primary phase separation the prepared membranes sheets were transferred to another freshwater bath and kept there for 24 h to ensure complete solvent extraction the membranes were then dried between filter papers for 48 h at rt 2 3 characterization of nf membranes the surface and morphological properties of the membranes were analyzed in terms of porosity mean pore size surface hydrophilicity and structural analysis using microscopic techniques the detailed procedure for these analysis can be found elsewhere 29 30 briefly porosity was determined by weight gravimetric analysis for which the weight of the membranes in the wet and dry states was used then using the porosity and permeability data the mean pore radius rm of the prepared membranes was calculated using the guerout elford ferry equation the surface hydrophilicity of the prepared nf membranes was analyzed by the static water contact angle wca using an oca 20 goniometer dataphysics germany equipment the sessile drop method was used to measure the wca by fitting the young laplace equation to minimize the error an average of 10 drops was reported scanning electron microscopy sem and atomic force microscopy afm were used for microscopic observation of pores structures and surface topology of the membranes sem analysis was performed using vega3 tescan analytics equipment and the surface and cross section of the prepared membranes was observed before analysis the membrane samples were fractured by immersion in liquid nitrogen and sputtered with a thin layer of gold palladium afm analysis was performed using nt mdt spectrum instruments ntegra equipment and three dimensional afm images were obtained by observing a surface area of 10 μm 10 μm by tapping mode the afm data were used to determine the surface roughness parameters namely mean roughness sa root mean square rms roughness maximum peak height sp valley depth sv and maximum height of roughness sz using gwyddion software 2 4 nanofiltration tests all filtration tests were performed using a stirred cell filtration system sterlitech hp4750 operating in dead end filtration mode all tests were carried out in replicates and the average values were reported for them the feed in the filtration cell was always agitated to achieve a reynolds number in the range of 7000 8000 this led the feed flow under the turbulence region and helped in minimizing the concentration polarization on the membrane surface 29 first the comparative filtration performance of the prepared membranes was analyzed by water and bl filtration tests the water filtration tests were performed in a transmembrane pressure tmp range of 6 24 bar at rt filtration studies using bl were conducted in a pressure range of 12 24 bar at 60 c and a feed ph 10 5 during the optimization studies of the operating variables the effects of temperature tmp and ph was analyzed in the range of 40 80 c 12 24 bar and 9 13 respectively the desired temperature in the cell was maintained using a thermostatic coil which was wrapped around the cell and insulated by covering with an insulating tape besides that the cell was also placed over a magnetic stirrer equipped with a hot plate before starting a filtration experiment the membrane in the cell was pressurized with distilled water at the highest pressure 24 bar until a stable flux was achieved the pure water flux pwf jw was evaluated by collecting permeate at varying pressure during fixed time intervals and calculated as the volume of permeate collected per unit of filtration time and effective membrane area the obtained values of pwf were plotted as a function of applied pressure resulting in a straight line curve the slope of this curve was used to determine the value of the average hydraulic permeability lp jw tmp in the range of applied tmp the hydraulic resistances r m of the membranes were calculated from the lp values r m lp μw where μw is the water viscosity after the water filtration tests the membrane performances were analyzed for the bl filtration bl feed used in this study refers to the permeate obtained from the uf process for the comparative study of the filtration performance of the prepared membranes the feed temperature was set at 60 c and the tmp was changed after fixed time intervals the permeate samples collected during these tests were analyzed in a set of 3 replicates to determine the lignin concentrations by uv vis spectrophotometry which has been described in detail elsewhere 29 allowing to determine its retention values calculated using eq 1 1 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf are the concentrations of lignin in the permeate and feed solution respectively to analyze the fouling resistance of the membranes the flux reduction during bl filtration was determined j1 j2 j1 100 by using the values of permeate flux which were observed at the beginning j1 and at the end j2 of filtration further the behavior of the membranes toward the cleaning process was evaluated by cleaning the membranes used for bl filtrations cleaning was performed sequentially by rinsing with distilled water followed by chemical cleaning with 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl solution at 50 c afterwards distilled water was filtered at 18 bar until the ph of feed was neutralized after chemical cleaning pwf and hydraulic permeability were analyzed at 18 bar the permeability data of the new membrane lp1 and the used membrane after cleaning lp2 were used to determine the antifouling ability of the prepared membranes by determining the permeability recovery lp2 lp1 100 2 5 experimental design based on the results of the membranes characterization studies one type of membrane was selected to find the operating conditions that would ensure its optimal performance a full factorial experiment 32 was designed considering 2 independent variables with 3 levels which are shown in table 3 the independent variables operating conditions namely feed temperature x1 and tmp x2 were selected for optimization studies the individual and interactive effects of the independent variables on the response variables filtration performance parameters i e initial permeate flux y1 lignin rejection y2 and flux reduction after filtration for 120 min y3 were analyzed a total of 9 experiments were conducted and each experiment was performed in duplicate design of experiments doe and statistical analysis of results were performed using jmp 16 pro and statistica 7 software the multiple regression models were developed based on the results of the doe to predict the performance parameters within the experimental range of operating conditions the general equation for 2nd order regression models can be expressed as eq 2 2 y α 0 i 1 n α i x i i 1 n α ii x i 2 1 i j n α ij x i x j where y α0 xi or xj αi αj and αij represent the response variables intercept independent variables and regression coefficients of the linear quadratic and interactive terms respectively considering the obtained experimental results a prediction profiler was generated using the jmp software the prediction profiler illustrates the variation of response variables with change in operating conditions within the experimental range this can then be used to determine the desirability function to identify the best operating conditions for multiple response processes by considering whether a response variable needed to be maximized or minimized 33 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization 3 1 1 porosity mean pore size and surface hydrophilicity the porosity mean pore size and wca of the prepared nf membranes are shown in fig 1 a and b it can be observed that the porosity pore size and surface hydrophilicity of nf membranes increased for the ac based membranes compared to the simple polymeric membrane 0 ac the improvement in porosity and pore size with the addition of ac can be explained by the increased heterogeneity of the membrane surface which leads to more voids in the polymeric matrix of membrane that can accommodate more water molecules 29 34 porosity was slightly reduced for 0 2 and 0 5 ac based membranes which may be caused by the delayed demixing of solvent and non solvent due to increased viscosity of the casting solution however at a high concentration of nanoparticles they can act as a surfactant and help to reduce the surface tension between the non solvent and the polymer film this leads to an increase in the exchange rate of solvent and non solvent during the phase inversion process resulting in the formation of bigger pores on the membrane surface 35 fig 1 b shows that the wca of the ac based membranes reduced in comparison with the simple polymeric membrane indicating higher surface hydrophilicity the highest reduction in wca was observed for 0 5 ac based membranes for which the contact angle was reduced by 17 36 compared to simple polymeric membrane the contact angle increased with further increase of the nanoparticle content to 1 which could be due to the increased chances of formation of nanoparticles aggregates at high concentration this leads to a lower accessibility of the hydrophilic moity of the nanoparticles at the membrane surface 30 3 1 2 morphology characterization by sem and afm the pore morphology of the membranes was observed using sem cross sectional images as shown in fig 2 all membranes exhibited an asymmetric structure with a top dense layer of micropores connected to macropores developed in the sublayer from fig 2 a b and c it can be seen that when ac were added at low concentration up to 0 2 the membranes presented a structure with well connected pores in the top and bottom layer however further increase in nanoparticles concentration resulted in a structure with closed pores in the bottom layer see fig 2 d and e this can be explained by the fact that the addition of ac to the casting solution can affect the exchange rate of solvent and non solvent during the phase separation process it is likely that the viscosity of the solution increases due to the addition of nanoparticles and the presence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties on its surface due to the delayed demixing of solvent and non solvent the macroporous structure in bottom layer is suppressed resulting in a more closed structure 36 the topological analysis of the membranes using the afm technique is shown in fig 3 and the statistical roughness data obtained by processing the afm images are presented in table 4 in table 4 the key roughness parameter is rms roughness which defines the average surface roughness of the prepared membranes these afm images demonstrate the peaks and valleys present on the membrane surface by the light and dark shades respectively it can be observed that at a very low concentration 0 1 the membranes presented a smooth surface with less contrasting shading as illustrated in fig 3 b and can also be verified from table 4 however with increasing concentration of nanoparticles there were more irregularities on the membrane surface with very high peaks and valleys furthermore in fig 3 e the lighter and darker regions become broaden which represents the agglomeration of nanoparticles at the highest concentration of ac nanoparticles 1 37 3 1 3 hydraulic permeability and resistance following the structural and topological analysis of the prepared membranes the filtration properties of the membranes were analyzed to observe the effects of nanoparticles on their filtration efficiency the variation of pwf along the tmp as well as the average permeability and hydraulic resistance of these membranes are shown in figs 4 a and b it can be seen that the membranes prepared with nanoparticles offered high pwf and permeability compared to simple polymeric membrane the permeability of ac based membranes increased with increasing concentration of ac except for the 0 2 ac based membrane the improvement in the permeability of the ac based membranes was a mutual influence of their porosity pore size and surface hydrophilicity a similar trend was also observed in our previous works and in the literature 30 38 the highest permeability was obtained for the 1 ac based membrane followed by the membranes prepared with concentrations of 0 5 and 0 1 ac the addition of ac at the highest concentration 1 resulted in an increase of 57 50 in hydraulic permeability compared to simple polymeric membrane the permeability of the 0 2 ac based membranes was the lowest among the ac based membranes which can be a mutual effect of low porosity and pore size see fig 1 a a similar behavior was observed by vatanpour et al 2012 for the reduction in pwf due to the decrease in pore size for mmm prepared using boehmite nanoparticles 38 as expected the hydraulic resistance of each membrane is inversely proportional to its permeability it can be observed that the simple polymeric membrane offered the highest hydraulic resistance among all the prepared nf membranes while it was the lowest for the 1 ac based membrane the hydraulic resistance was decreased by 37 28 for the 1 ac based membrane compared to simple polymeric membrane 3 2 membrane selection 3 2 1 black liquor filtration tests the effect of ac nanoparticles on the bl filtration performance of the prepared membranes was analyzed in the tmp range of 12 24 bar and at a temperature of 60 c to minimize the effects of irreversible fouling filtration was performed for only 20 min at each pressure and the permeate was collected for analysis of lignin rejection the variation in the permeate flux and lignin rejection along the tmp 12 18 and 24 bar can be seen in figs 5 a and 5 b respectively it can be observed that the permeate flux increased with tmp which showed that the permeate flux was below limiting flux for all these membranes however for the simple polymeric 0 1 and 1 ac based membranes the permeate flux started to be stabilized after 18 bar proving it as threshold tmp flux 39 however for the 0 2 and 0 5 ac based membranes the permeate flux increased almost linearly when the tmp was increased from 18 to 24 bar this indicates that these membranes due to their smaller pore size and high surface hydrophilicity are more stable when operating under high tmp to reach the limiting flux see figs 1 a and b further comparing the effect of ac nanoparticles on filtration it was also found that permeate flux through ac based membranes was higher compared to simple polymeric membrane the highest bl permeate flux was achieved by membranes prepared with 0 1 ac followed by membranes prepared with concentration of 0 2 1 and 0 5 ac this can be explained by the mutual effect of porosity and pore size while the higher concentration of nanoparticles can lead to blockage of membrane pores which dominated over the effect of porosity and pore size in these membranes in addition permeate samples collected at each pressure were analyzed for lignin concentration which were used to determine the rejection from fig 5 b it can be seen that lignin rejection increased with tmp which can be explained by the fact that due to the pressure gradient and the increase in the permeate flux the solute transport through these membranes was facilitated by the convection mechanism 40 the lignin rejection of all the prepared membranes was in the range of 85 92 the ac based membranes displayed a higher rejection compared to simple polymeric membrane despite having a slightly larger pore size it can be explained by that the rejection through these membranes was controlled not only by their pore size but also by the interaction between the membrane components and the solute molecules lignin a similar type of lignin rejection trend was observed in our previous work when we used a carbon nanotubes based polysulfone nf membrane for filtration of a lignin model solution 29 however among the ac based membranes the effect of pore size on rejection was observed due to the small pore size for instance 0 2 ac based membrane presented highest rejection in the range of 90 92 3 2 2 membrane fouling and cleaning to evaluate the reusability and antifouling ability the membranes were cleaned and the permeability recovery was analyzed using distilled water it was found that the recovery of permeability for the ac based membranes was higher than that of the simple polymeric membrane for the simple polymeric membrane only 79 54 of the original permeability was recovered while the highest permeability recovery of 98 02 was observed for the 0 1 ac based membrane in our previous work it was reported that cleaning with only an alkaline solution 0 2 m naoh resulted in pore dilation in simple polymeric membranes resulting in complete recovery of permeability but rejection by these membranes decreased 29 however in the present work the problem of pore dilation was overcome by using a milder alkaline solution and the adding of a subsequent cleaning step using a mild acidic solution as for the ac based membranes permeability recovery showed a direct correlation with surface hydrophilicity and roughness a similar observation was made by vatanpour et al 2012 during whey filtration using boehmite nanoparticles based mmm 38 since the membranes prepared with 0 5 and 1 ac showed high hydrophilicity and low surface roughness than the 0 2 ac based membrane their permeability recovery was higher the permeability recovery for nf membranes prepared with 0 2 0 5 and 1 ac were 88 09 95 87 and 91 54 respectively the above results showed that the membrane prepared with a concentration of 0 1 ac exhibited the highest flux and permeability recovery and the lignin rejection was also within the acceptable range expected for nf membranes therefore this membrane was selected for the optimization studies of the operating variables to improve its performance 3 3 optimization of operating variables 3 3 1 effect of temperature and pressure to optimize the key operating variables the effects of temperature and tmp was investigated on the initial permeate flux lignin rejection and flux reduction for the analysis of flux reduction the filtration was performed for 120 min for each run then the flux reduction was measured at the end of filtration and was compared to the initial flux the results of all runs based on the full factorial experimental design are shown in table 5 the objective was to maximize the flux and lignin rejection with the least possible reduction in permeate flux by analyzing the variation of the response variables as a function of the changes in the independent variables the regression coefficients for multivariate models were obtained these regression coefficients were used to develop the mathematical models given by eqs 3 5 which can be used to predict the values of the response variables at any combination of the operating variables normalized temperature and pressure values in the studied range the statistical parameters and determination coefficients r2 and adjusted r2 for these models are shown in table s1 the r2 adjusted r2 values for flux lignin rejection and flux reduction were 0 9926 0 9804 0 9840 0 9573 and 0 9083 0 7555 respectively analysis of variance and goodness of fit showed that these models had a good predictability for the response variables this was verified by comparing the predicted values of the response variables obtained using the multivariate models with the experimental values see fig s1 it was observed that the predicted values were in agreement with the experimental results indicating that the changes in operating conditions have significant effects on the response variables 3 y 1 53 654 4 502 x 1 60 20 10 831 x 2 18 6 5 211 x 1 60 20 x 2 18 6 4 759 x 1 60 20 2 2 331 x 2 18 6 2 4 y 2 86 773 3 121 x 1 60 20 0 924 x 2 18 6 1 416 x 1 60 20 x 2 18 6 0 413 x 1 60 20 2 3 591 x 2 18 6 2 5 y 3 6 210 0 342 x 1 60 20 4 384 x 2 18 6 1 130 x 1 60 20 x 2 18 6 1 781 x 1 60 20 2 2 602 x 2 18 6 2 the significance of each independent variable for both its linear l and quadratic q terms and the interactions of its linear terms can be analyzed by observing the pareto charts of each response variable in a 95 confidence interval p 0 05 which are shown in fig 6 from fig 6 a it can be observed that for flux both temperature q and tmp l q and their interaction showed a significant effect p 0 05 except temperature l for lignin rejection on the other hand temperature q and tmp l showed insignificant effects with a p value of 0 05 see table s1 further it was observed that with high flux flux reduction also increased which was undesirable and fig 6 c showed that only tmp l had a significant effect on flux reduction the multivariate mathematical models were used to generate 3d surface plots for each response variable and desirability profiler shown in figs 7 and 8 the 3d plots depict the variation of the response variables along with the changes in operating conditions and represented by different shading the prediction profiler on the other hand illustrates the changes in the response variables by changing one independent variable and keeping another variable constant to maximize desirability the desirability function changes within a range 0 1 representing the lowest to the highest desirability value for a response the predicted responses are presented by shaded area within the 95 confidence interval it can be seen that with as the temperature increased from 40 to 60 c the permeate flux decreased and the flux reduction increased the effect reversed when temperature was further increased from 60 to 80 c in the case of lignin rejection it decreased with increasing temperature this can be explained by the fact that high temperature can affect the flux and solute rejection through different aspects namely enlargement of effective pore size increasing the diffusivity of solutes and reducing viscosity of the solution 41 the observed kinematic viscosity of bl uf permeate was 1 46 0 0056 1 08 0 0040 mm2 s 0 76 0 0014 mm2 s and 0 58 0 0068 mm2 s at 25 40 60 and 80 c respectively therefore the decrease in viscosity at 40 c can explain the increase in flux however with further increase in temperature the higher diffusivity of larger solute molecules through the pores led to pore blockage and flux reduction with further increase in temperature up to 80 c the increase in the flux and the reduction in lignin rejection may be associated with the enlargement in membrane pores however the overall pore structure of these membranes was stable until 80 c as the surface and cross section of the 0 1 ac based membranes were observed by sem after cleaning the membranes which was used at 80 c and 24 bar no visible change in the morphology of pores was observed in sem analysis surface and cross sectional sem images of used 0 1 ac based membrane are shown in fig s2 as for the tmp effect this variable showed a strong influence on the behavior of the flux and flux reduction both flux and flux reduction increased continuously with tmp while lignin rejection first increased with a change in tmp from 12 to 18 bar and then decreased from 18 to 24 bar the improvement in flux until the limiting flux value was achieved with tmp can be associated with an increase in the driving force for the filtration process however after the critical flux high flux led to higher reduction due to the accumulation of solute molecules over membrane surface and in the pores 39 42 thus as high flux and high lignin rejection were desirable for high efficiency of the prepared nf membranes which was observed at low temperature and high pressure conditions however high flux was always accompanied by high flux reduction fouling of the membranes which led to lower performance of the nf process therefore to achieve the highest possible desirability a trade off between maximizing flux and lignin rejection and minimizing flux reduction needed to be done from the desirability profiler the maximum overall desirability of 0 54 was achieved at 40 c and 20 bar which can be considered as the optimum operating conditions 3 3 2 effect of feed ph and volume recovery after optimization of temperature and tmp the effect of feed ph and changes in feed volume were analyzed filtration was performed at 40 5 c 18 20 bar for 120 min and permeate samples were collected at 20 min intervals the variation in flux and lignin rejection with ph and filtration time is shown in fig 9 it can be observed that with increasing feed ph permeate flux increased while lignin rejection decreased this can be explained by the mutual influence of the variation in lignin molecular size and the effective pore size of nf membranes 43 44 due to the changing ph the decrease of bl ph led to the coagulation of lignin and formation of larger moleculars which can justify the increase in rejection at low ph further at high ph the increase in permate flux can be associated with the pore swelling besides varition into lignin solubility which has already been previously reported by many researchers 44 45 it is worth mentioning that during filtration at ph 9 the feed temperature was increased to 50 c causing the observed flux at ph 9 to be similar to the flux at ph 10 and showing slightly higher reduction and lower lignin rejection the intial bl permeate flux showed a reduction of around 58 16 at ph 10 compared to the flux of the original bl ph 13 it was found that due to the high flux at a ph of 13 the flux reduction was also the highest when the filtration was performed using 50 ml feed volume the flux reduced by 63 27 after 120 min of filtration this is because with high permeate flux the retentate concentration changed significantly resulted in flux reduction due to the development of concentration polarization at the membrane surface this can also be confirmed by observing the trend of lignin rejection which reduced from 71 26 to 57 11 with increasing filtration time this can be justified by the fact that the transport of solute lignin molecules under constant pressure was facilitated by a diffusion mechanism due to the dominant effect of the concentration gradient across the membrane surface 40 the diffusion of solute molecules to permeate side intended to minimize the concentration gradient concentration polarization which led to reduced rejection of lignin this was verified by repeating the filtration at original ph and using 250 ml feed volume to minimize the effects of significant volume reduction and subsequent concentration gradient it was observed that the flux reduction was lower 43 27 and the lignin rejection was also stabilized 70 since high flux and high lignin rejection are desirable for high performance of membrane and high ph showed opposite effect on flux and rejection therefore a trade off needs to be done at a ph of 11 5 the best balance was achieved between flux 15 62 l m2h flux reduction 19 73 and lignin rejection 80 47 therefore besides optimum temperature and tmp a small reduction in ph to 11 5 will further improve the filtration efficiency of these nf membranes these results showed that the use of ac based mmm and optimization of operating variables cumulatively improved membrane performance separation efficiency and fouling resistance for the separation of lignin from bl these aspects could ultimately influence the economics of the lignin separation process since this study was carried out at laboratory scale the information obtained may be used in the future for the scaling up and estimating the economic viability of the lignin separation process 4 conclusions the effect of ac nanoparticles on the performance of pes membranes was studied for the separation of lignin from bl along with the selection of optimal operating conditions for improving filtration efficiency the addition of ac improved all desirable properties of membrane porosity pore size surface hydrophilicity surface roughness water and bl permeability and fouling resistance compared to simple polymeric membranes it was found that the average surface roughness reduced by 22 97 at the lowest concentration 0 1 of ac nanoparticles while the highest surface hydrophilicity was observed at a concentration of 0 5 where the water contact angle was reduced by 11 6 for the bl filtration the membranes prepared with the lowest concentration of ac showed the highest flux of 9 04 0 29 l m2h at 24 bar good lignin rejection 88 91 at 12 24 bar and the highest flux recovery of 98 02 after cleaning the membrane whereas flux recovery was 79 54 for the simple polymeric membranes the study to optimize the operating variables was carried out using 0 1 ac based membranes in the range of 40 80 c 12 24 bar and 9 13 ph the results of the experimental design showed that temperature and pressure have a statistically significant effect on flux and lignin rejection but only pressure has a statistically significant effect on reduction of flux the best operating conditions for temperature and pressure were determined using the desirability profiler finding an acceptable process trade off between high values of flux lignin rejection and low flux reduction fouling in case of feed ph both high and low ph values adversely affected membrane performance therefore the optimal working parameters for the best membrane performance with minimal fouling were chosen to be 40 c 20 bar and 11 5 ph declaration of competing interest there is no interest need to be declared in this manuscript acknowledgements this work was carried out under

12518,water scarcity will continue to be a global challenge in the coming years as long as sustainable solutions remain far fetched it has become necessary to improve the efficiency of water circulation to reduce the net demand in high water consumption sectors such as agriculture in palm oil industry the extraction of crude palm oil from oil palm fruit bunch requires a large amount of water half of which is discharged as palm oil mill effluent pome that is considered a high strength wastewater the current trend of pome research focuses on moving from conventional open ponding treatment to an integrated zero discharge system for better effluent management in this review the attempts taken by researchers in laboratory and pilot scale were highlighted to achieve an effluent of high quality water from pome that can be used as drinking water or recycled as boiler water in the palm oil production process membrane technology has recently emerged as one of the most promising separation techniques having a broad spectrum of applications including pome treatment furthermore water reclamation technique involving evaporation can split pome solids and recover clean water in a more sustainable and space saving manner additionally recovery of by product such as biofertilizer and biofuels is necessary to overcome the cost of the treatment as a whole in spite of several challenges water reclamation from pome can be considered economically feasible system from techno economic analysis perspective and it can feasibly shift the adopted industrial method from a linear take use discharge economy approach to a circular economy by keeping water in circulation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords palm oil mill effluent water reclamation membrane technology thermal treatment integrated zero discharge system data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the increased global industrialization and population growth have led to unavoidable energy crises and significant wastewater generation freshwater supply and demand have gradually increased during the last two decades 1 according to the report of the world health organization by the year 2025 half of the world s population will be living in water stressed areas 2 in this aspect the generated wastewater must be treated and or regenerated in the most cost effective and environmentally friendly manner to conserve energy protect environment and to meet ever increasing demand 3 noteworthy in most countries agriculture and food industry are the sectors that require the most water consumption almost 100 times more than the household sector 4 considering the leading agro industry in malaysia palm oil is critical for the advancement of the country s economy at the same time it is accountable for piling up voluminous underutilized by products as estimated almost 50 of palm oil mill effluent pome is generated from a total of 5 0 7 5 mt of water used to produce 1 mt of crude palm oil cpo 5 this water could be recovered from pome and reused in the milling processes or as drinking water the zero liquid discharge systems are gaining popular attention in water treatment technology since they enhance the production of clean water together with valuable by products generation making the production process more economically attractive and sustainable hence to be considered sustainable the process must be cost effective eco friendly and socially acceptable 4 according to mbavarira and grimm 6 a considerable potential is expected from circular economy in the water industry because water is not only considered as the heart of circular economy but also acts as a catalyst for transitioning away from the linear take use discharge approach on a global scale pertinently circular economy employs the 6rs strategy of reduce reuse recycle reclaim recover and restore that were defined by kakwani and kalbar 2020 7 to maintain water in circulation for long durations and thus reduces the load on natural systems 7 a shift to a circular economy will stimulate more effective water use especially when paired with strong incentives for innovation can improve an economy s ability to meet the demands of the developing water supply and demand imbalance 8 in order to achieve a comprehensive clean water reclamation process from pome a prior knowledge on the plausible techniques employed is essential to help in achieving zero discharge palm oil mills under the circular economy approach namely membrane technology thermal treatment and integrated zero discharge systems this has potential to improve the resource recovery productivity and cost effectiveness in conventional modeling approach advanced smart process control and optimization were adopted to maximize economic returns and minimize waste discharge to achieve a sustainable modeling an integration of all aspects such as techno economic environmental and social constraints are required 12 the multiple stages of biological treatments that are generally employed in many palm oil mills take a long retention time for each stage and in most cases involve generation of by products hybridizing biological treatment with both uf and ro membranes 9 10 as well as nf achieved remarkable outcomes in the water recovery from pome and other high strength wastewater there are many factors that need to be considered such as the required level of purity the volume of production the expenses of chemical pre treatments and other operational expenditures 4 fouling is an unavoidable problem for membranes which requires rigorous cleaning to restore performance due to the high load of suspended particulates in pome that hinder water passage through the membrane 11 water desalination for the production of potable water has two major categories thermal and membrane desalination both of them have attracted the attention of many researchers worldwide while desalination is prominently used in treating seawater and brine water it has been suggested for treating pome due to its essential part in securing the supply of an adequate amount of clean water but at very high cost 12 in order for palm oil mills to achieve sustainability the potential of water recycling approach as post treatment has been reviewed in this study focusing on membrane and thermal treatments membrane technology proposes interesting alternatives to the conventional processes because the former has numerous benefits that might help to address the problems encountered in the ponding system besides that reusable components in pome such as oil and water could be recovered using membrane system the water so recovered might be used for other purposes several researchers have recommended various pre treatment procedures to get utilizable water from pome recovery process 13 evaporation is another separation technology that has been developed to save time and money of the membrane process while minimizing the loss of water and the high value biomass despite the numerous limitations of biological processes serial biological treatment system has been demonstrated in several pilot plants and showed positive outcomes in terms of by product recovery and clean water reclamation 2 palm oil mill effluent pome pome the liquid waste generated from cpo clarification oil palm fresh fruit bunch opffb sterilization and hydro cyclone separation of a mixture containing shell and kernel 14 as shown in fig 1 in palm oil extraction process sterilization is the initial step which entails heating the opffb up to 140 c for a period ranging from 75 to 90 min in an autoclave machine to denature hydraulic enzymes and soften the oil palm fruitlets creating a coagulated viscous solution known as sterilizer condensate and the cooked fruits are called sterilized fruit bunches sfb about 36 of pome is generated at this stage 15 thereafter sfb is transported to get stripped pressed and clarified during which nearly 60 of the total pome is produced 16 the crude palm oil is further purified and vacuum dried studies showed that just 4 of the total pome is formed at this stage 17 the entire process is chemical free relies mostly on the thermal and physical force powered by in situ steam generated through combustion of residual oil palm biomass 14 for steam generation a significant amount of water is used during these phases the extraction water or waste steam ends up as effluent which is heavily infused with various organic compounds making pome a high strength wastewater 13 noteworthy solvent extraction is the common oil extraction process for other types of vegetable seed oil where small amount of wastewater is generated however solvent extraction is not applicable in palm oil extraction process therefore thermomechanical method is applied which demands 60 of water usage that ends up as wastewater pome one of the toughest challenges in the palm oil milling industry is the treatment of pome hence water recovery from pome could make this industry more feasible and environment friendly pome in nature is brown in color viscous contains high amount of solids and water the brownish color is attributed to the high content of carotene pectin tannin phenolic compounds and lignin moreover pome contains significant amounts of carbohydrates amino acids free organic acids and inorganic minerals 18 19 as listed in table 1 consequently the presence of such high levels of organic pollutants in pome makes it inhabitable for aquatic life hence it is prohibited to discharge it directly into waterways before proper treatment the oil palm sector in malaysia is steadfastly devoted to abiding by a variety of environmental laws the environment quality act 1974 and specific regulations for pome 1977 were enacted by the government to control the limits for watercourse discharge as shown in table 1 through environment management system iso14001 2015 policy the zero waste discharge processes could be altered into existing treatment system in the mills in light of the characteristics of pome mentioned in table 1 biological treatment that runs on the basis of suspended growth activated sludge approach in open ponding system running in series of anaerobic facultative and aerobic is generally adopted by 85 of the mills in malaysia and indonesia 20 this is owing to its simplicity cost effectiveness fewer technical expertise required and easier discharge limit in the past 21 many studies have confirmed the method s inefficiencies including long treatment times a big operational footprint a high risk of subsurface water pollution and the release of unpleasant odor gases including sulfur dioxide so2 and methane ch4 15 22 23 the emission of methane proved to be the major dilemma for the palm oil industry and the governments alike hence prompting the authorities to draw a mandate for compulsory methane capture along with stricter final discharge limit for palm oil mills 24 almost half of the existing pome treatment plants in malaysia are incapable to capture the produced biogas due to the inefficiency of applied techniques as latest and robust techniques are could be expensive to be commercialized especially for smaller independent millers 25 furthermore the resulted effluent in this open ponding method cannot meet revised malaysian discharge regulations most of the times and the accumulated sludge at the bottom of the treatment pond must be removed on a regular basis 15 according to lee and co authors 2019 to meet sufficient degradation requirement a typical anaerobic treatment pond roughly requires 30 45 acres to store the pome for 3 months before it is finally allowed to be discharged to river sources 20 3 water reclamation from pome out of its total composition 94 96 of pome comprises that of water as its major component 33 therefore pome could serve as a source of recycled fresh water for human consumption industrial uses and agricultural purposes in this study the efforts undertaken to recover water from pome have been reviewed the proposed treatment methods of pome are shown in fig 1 pome characteristics are not constant they may vary according to season milling process and location pome may sometimes contain higher amounts of oil and solids hence a pre treatment step might be deployed prior to membrane technology and integrated biological treatment systems while thermal treatment is less dependent on pome s characteristics the pome pre treatment techniques are not covered in this study 3 1 membrane technology membrane technology is old but well recognized as a robust filtration method with a track record of successfully treating wastewater and creating high quality water for industrial and municipal reuse or for releasing back to waterbodies 34 according to goh et al 3 membrane technology has gained an increased acceptance in wastewater treatment because of its ability to deal with a wide range of feed water while maintaining high operational reliability membrane bioreactor mbr forward osmosis fo ultra filtration uf nano filtration nf and membrane distillation md are some of the commonly applied membrane based wastewater treatment techniques 35 noteworthy only md is a thermally driven separation process whereas the other membrane technologies are pressure driven separation processes 36 mbr combines membrane technology with wastewater biological treatment technology has a number of benefits such as high biomass loading in the bioreactor a small footprint excellent effluent quality and a particularly high removal rate of suspended solids ss pathogenic bacteria and virus 37 mbr have received a lot of attention by researchers and public health experts as an alternative treatment process for wastewaters such as pome since the current conventional open ponding system has proven to be ineffective resulting in environmental pollution mbr offers a highly promising solution for the treatment of pome 38 the emergence of mbrs in the recent years was due to the resulted high quality of effluents that appropriate for discharge into the environment or reused for various purposes 3 1 1 pressure driven membrane process pressure driven membrane process is a type of membrane that utilize pressure force as driving force across the membrane induces a flux of permeate from bulk solution at one side of the membrane towards the permeate side reverse osmosis ro membranes are normally utilized for desalination of saltwater and brackish waters to generate high quality drinking water however ro for separation of organic solutions such as pome has widely been expanded 39 the principle of forward osmosis fo is based on water diffusion from a lower concentration solution to a higher concentration solution through a semipermeable membrane modest flux rates could be attained by utilizing a draw solution with a higher osmotic concentration than the wastewater feed although fo requires less hydraulic power and reduced chances of membrane fouling fo produces a diluted draw solution that is not pure water 40 therefore water recovery from pome using fo may require a further treatment making this method unfeasible for water reclamation from pome furthermore due to its efficiency the uf process is widely utilized in the refining industry uf membranes are utilized to filter pome because the ultrafiltration procedure can easily filter out suspended solids and microbes 41 the combinations of biological treatment with uf ro membranes 9 10 and nf 42 achieved remarkable outcomes for the water recovery from pome an efficient cross flow uf membrane was integrated with anaerobic reactor to reutilize pome to generate energy and produce clean water in a single treatment step the membrane s maximum operating pressure was 55 bars at 70 wc and the tested ph ranged from 2 to 12 at a steady state the overall removal of cod bod and tss was higher than 98 with biomethane yield of 0 7 lch4 gcod removed were achieved 37 hybat et al 2013 designed a similar system where a laboratory digester of membrane anaerobic system was used to digest pome and produce biogas followed by water clarification using a cross flow uf with maximum operating pressure of 55 bars at 70 c and ph ranging from 2 to 12 the cod removal efficiency biogas yield and vss removal recorded 94 to 97 0 83 l gcod d and 90 6 g l at hrt of 10 days 43 the study confirmed the efficiency of the integrated system anaerobic bioreactor uf membrane in water recovery from pome azmi and yunos 44 have investigated the efficiency of uf membrane treatment in reclaiming water reuse from pome at laboratory scale uf treatment reduced pollutant components by up to 90 when combined with adsorption pre treatment by palm kernel shell based activated carbon pks ac the optimal operating parameters were ph 8 stirring speed of 600 rpm and operating pressure of 2 bar for 90 min despite the high percentage of carbohydrate and protein recovered in the study the uf method was found to be impracticable for pome treatment due to the membrane fouling which resulted in a loss of productivity and as a result a high maintenance cost is required furthermore to ensure minimal membrane fouling and continuous operation a significant amount of clean water was necessary to completely clean the membrane 20 tertiary membrane treatment of pome was ideal in water reclamation for boiler feed standards three types of membrane nf270 bw30 and xle were assessed based on the removal efficiency of cod color turbidity tds p and conductivity 45 pome decolourization via a photocatalytic reaction was tested on a novel hybrid polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fibre membrane incorporated with different loadings of titanate nanotube that has been developed to enhance the hydrophilicity of the nanocomposite increase surface area and surface hydroxyl groups 3 also shamsuddin et al 46 made an improvement on the cellulose membrane to enhance pome decolourization performance by combining epoxidized natural rubber polyvinyl chloride with cellulose and cellulose grafting polymethyl methacrylate as a filler with compositions of 20 and 10 respectively the performance of paired uf membranes in a sandwich designs for the reclamation of water from final discharged pome was investigated 47 without a spacer two membranes namely polyethersulfone pes and regenerated cellulose rc were placed together in various configurations the average pollutant removal was 80 90 while the single membrane achieved 60 70 pollutant removal the quality of permeate obtained for tds ss turbidity bod5 cod were 535 mg l 25 mg l 0 88 ntu 23 3 mg l and 48 mg l respectively the reclaimed water was within the standard discharge limits and was recommended to be reused in the mill for palm oil extraction purposes table 2 summarized the research studies on membranes used for pome treatment 3 1 2 thermal driven membrane process thermally driven membrane process is a type of membrane process which uses low grade heat to drive separation membrane distillation md is a vaporization based thermally driven purification process in which a microporous hydrophobic and a non selective membrane is used to separate the solvents from the solutes at low pressure and temperature 55 md is an integration of membrane separation with thermal distillation that purposedly combines the comparative advantages of both approaches the conventional membrane treatments such as mf uf and ro suffer from many drastic drawbacks such as high energy consumption huge amounts of chemicals needed high pressure requirement and membrane fouling 56 md configuration could be categorised into four different categories as illustrated in fig s 1 in supplimentry data these are direct contact membrane distillation dcmd vacuum membrane distillation vmd sweeping gas membrane distillation sgmd and air gap membrane distillation agmd 57 all classes of md configurations use the same governing principle on the feed side wherein the heat input generates a transmembrane difference in vapor pressure and temperature this effect drives the flux of the most volatile components of the solution each mode is well organized to keep the difference in the vapor pressure high enough to drive flux over the membrane 55 to minimize the energy requirment in md systems recent studies are addressing the energy recovering techniques that offer numerous economic and environmental benefits for instance hybrid disalination systems feed dilution with rejected wastewater streams from the process and utilization of green energies 58 md configuration could be categorised into four different categories as

systems feed dilution with rejected wastewater streams from the process and utilization of green energies 58 3 1 2 1 direct contact membrane distillation dcmd in dcmd evaporation occurs at the feed membrane surface because the hot solution pome is in direct contact with the heated membrane surface as seen in fig s 1 a due to the pressure difference across the membrane to the permeate side vapor moves and condenses inside the membrane the hydrophobicity of the membrane solely allows gaseous phase inside its pores hence the feed solution is unable to penetrate inside the membrane 1 yatim and co authors 2019 tested dcmd with silanized tio2 on water recovery from synthetic wastewater paper mill effluent and pome results showed that the flux using paper mill effluent was less than that in synthetic water due to the formation of suspended solids and microalgae on the membrane surface while the system s rejection was maintained at 99 the results of pome on the other hand was not promising where a drastic decrease in membrane flux from 6 to 2 kg m2 h over 400 min of operation was observed noting that cod rejection was maintained at 96 9 59 this is due to the oil and solid content in pome that caused pore blocking therefore pre treatment is recommended to overcome the membrane fouling in another study dcmd was evaluated for its pollutant removal efficiency from sedimented and pre filtered pome nutrient removal capability of 99 for pre filtered pome was reported 36 in dcmd evaporation occurs at the feed membrane surface because the hot solution pome is in

of 99 for pre filtered pome was reported 36 olive oil mill effluent has comparable characteristics to pome as an oily wastewater with relatively high solid content sponza 2021 applied a three step treatment to achieve high pollutant removal efficiency of 99 00 99 99 first 17 18 of cod tss and phenol were removed by cartridge filtration as pretreatment stage second dcmd removed 81 90 of the effluent s pollutants the permeate flux in dcmd increased from 2 3 l m2 h up to 24 l m2 h as the feed flowrate increased lastly optimal cod tss and conductivity removals were 100 at a ro membrane pressure of 8 bar and remained constant until 21 bar ro pressure 60 in a similar study by 61 demonstrated the effeciency of dcmd in obtaining clean water and a concnetrate containg polyphenols from olive mill wastewater with separation efficiency of 99 pome is a brownish wastewater the removal of pome color is another challenge that could be resolved by dcmd for instance the possibility of recovering clean water from a dyeing wastewater usually discharged in hot condition from textile industry similar to pome was evaluated by mokhtar et al 62 by using the dry jet wet inversion process a series of pvdf hollow fibre membranes with varying polymer concentration 12 18 wt were designed for dcmd application it was found that regardless of the polymer concentration employed in the dope solution for membrane preparation at least 99 78 color removal was obtained the md is less prone to fouling than other pressure driven membrane processes such as mf uf and nf and thus potentially applied for recovering water from textile wastewater generally discharged at high temperatures in another study the removal of high concentrated solution of ions such as ca2 mg2 co3 2 and hco3 silica microorganisms and chemicals achieved 99 95 removal by dcmd during water recovery 63 3 1 2 2 vacuum membrane distillation vmd in this md module a pump is needed to create a vacuum in the permeate membrane side of a vmd configuration condensation of separated clean water occurs outside the membrane as shown in fig s 1 b the amount of heat lost by conduction is low which is a significant benefit against other available md 64 in terms of energy consumption and thermal evaporation efficiency it outperforms dcmd one of the most significant advantages offered by vmd is the possibility of utilizing renewable energy sources such as solar energy 65 and could be coupled with ro for better water recovery in this md module a pump is needed to create a vacuum in the permeate membrane side of a vmd configuration condensation of separated clean water occurs outside the membrane as shown in fig s 1 b the amount of heat lost by conduction is low which is a significant benefit against other available md 64 in terms of energy consumption and thermal evaporation efficiency it outperforms dcmd one of the most significant advantages offered by vmd is the possibility of utilizing renewable energy sources such as solar energy 65 and could be coupled with ro for better water recovery to the best of the authors knowledge no reports published on vmd technology of pome yet however several wastewaters have similar physicochemical properties as pome that could be used as relatable examples in this study for instance vmd was used to concentrate a lignocellulosic hydrolysate with glucose concentration of 35 96 g l under optimal conditions of velocity of 1 0 m s and 65 c heated by solar hot water heat transfer glucose rejection was 99 5 and the flux was 8 46 l m2h a vacuum pump was used to remove the transmembrane permeate which was then collected in a permeate container after chilling 66 vmd is expected to perform similarly with pome since it contains similar amount of glucose together with other types of sugar monomers yet finding a suitable pretreatment method to remove solids and oil from pome needs to be investigated prior to removal of furfural and acetic acid using vmd corn stover was hydrolyzed with 2 w v h2so4 at 95 c for 90 min at a solid to liquid ratio of 1 15 under optimal conditions 98 of furfural was removed by vmd the removal efficiency of acetic acid was noticeably lesser 67 for protein recovery from wastewaters białas et al 68 evaluated the recovery of the proteins in the effluent of the mechanically recovered poultry wastewater a novel design composing of mf uf and vmd using cross flow membrane techniques was used in their study results indicated that 70 of water was recovered and reductions in cod and tss level in the obtained permeate exceeded 99 the water recovered from this integrated membrane system could be reused in processing of poultry meat industry from the available studies it is estimated that pome needs to be pre treated before being subjected to vmd due to its high solid content and viscous nature in previous studies increasing the soluble organic matter such as sugar monomers from carbohydrates and elimination of the large particles could be achieved by chemical biological and physiochemical pre treatments 69 70 3 1 2 3 sweeping gas membrane distillation sgmd sgmd configuration a stream of cold inert gas flows in the permeate side sweeping the vaporized solution out of the permeate chamber an external condenser is required to condense the purified solution back to the feed stream as shown in fig s 1 c which is considered as a major disadvantage of sgmd 55 71 sgmd configuration applies dual concepts of agmd and dcmd 55 which consequently minimizes the conductive heat loss reduces the mass transfer resistance and increases evaporation efficiency traditional desalination technologies are effective but they are energy and time consuming 72 sgmd configuration a stream of cold inert gas flows in the permeate side sweeping the vaporized solution out of the permeate chamber an external condenser is required to condense the purified solution back to the feed stream as shown in fig s 1 c which is considered as a major disadvantage of sgmd 55 71 sgmd configuration applies dual concepts of agmd and dcmd 55 which consequently minimizes the conductive heat loss reduces the mass transfer resistance and increases evaporation efficiency traditional desalination technologies are effective but they are energy and time consuming 72 shirazi et al 73 used sgmd to directly separate ethanol and water using a flat sheet ptfe membrane diluted feeds within the temperature range of 35 to 55 c were used this method has a great potential to improve the bioethanol processing and water recovery in a similar study conducted to separate glycerol from water by flat sheet ptfe sgmd 71 it was observed that the optimum distillate rate was achieved at feed temperature of 65 c which sustains the hypothesis and emphasizes that the md is a temperature dependent process in that study around 99 of solute rejection was obtained in a study comparing three different md configurations namely dcmd vmd and sgmd in removing ammonia a pollutant present in pome from water 74 sgmd showed the moderate performance in terms of mass transfer coefficient when compared selectivity with the other two mds ammonia exists in many types of wastewaters the results showed immense potential in separating ammonia from water which could be implied on pome since there are yet no studies on viability of sgmd on pome treatment in light of the mentioned reports pome could perhaps be subjected to a prior anaerobic fermentation step since the fermented effluent contains volatile compounds and solvents 75 which might be further clarified using sgmd 3 1 2 4 air gap membrane distillation agmd as shown in fig s 1 d the presence of the air gap in this md design adds another layer of resistance that vapor transport must overcome this reduces the total flux that acts as a great barrier to mass transmission and is a major drawback of agmd 55 other than obtaining purified water nutrient recovery from such wastewaters is important a cost effective ammonia was recovered from liquefied wastewater by 80 removal efficiency using agmd 76 the economic returns of this study is high when compared to the commercial ammonia fertilizer that involves combination of atmospheric nitrogen gas with natural gas hydrogen by the haber bosch process under high pressure and temperature as well as an expensive catalyst 77 the suitable applications of this design are removal of salt and volatile compounds from aqueous solutions 57 hence the aforementioned md configuration is not viable for pome treatment since pome contains variety of pollutants and thus requires multiple pre treatment stages to be finally introduced to agmd as shown in fig s 1 d the presence of the air gap in this md design adds another layer of resistance that vapor transport must overcome this reduces the total flux that acts as a great barrier to mass transmission and is a major drawback of agmd 55 other than obtaining purified water nutrient recovery from such wastewaters is important a cost effective ammonia was recovered from liquefied wastewater by 80 removal efficiency using agmd 76 the economic returns of this

temperature as well as an expensive catalyst 77 the suitable applications of this design are removal of salt and volatile compounds from aqueous solutions 57 hence the aforementioned md configuration is not viable for pome treatment since pome contains variety of pollutants and thus requires multiple pre treatment stages to be finally introduced to agmd table 3 summarizes some of the previous studies used to separate various components mostly present in pome from various aqueous solutions since pome contains proteins anions and cations soluble sugars oil and grease and color these examples can help in choosing and developing the suitable md configuration and membrane characteristics to separate water from the pollutants the advantages and disadvantages of the four types of mds are summarized in table 4 noteworthy water recovery from pome has not been widely tested using sgmd vmd and agmd which requires the focus of researchers interested in sustainability and circular economy of palm oil industry 3 2 thermal treatment thermal method has shown a great potential in turning liquid pome into commercial biomass besides the oil recovery and the purified water thermal based methods rely on phase transitions caused by energy addition or removal causing thermal gradient 84 this alternative route for treating pome could help reduce environmental footprints while also requiring less capital investment than biogas operations 85 the main drawback of thermal treatment technologies is that a significant amount of energy is required to heat the water which is primarily provided by non renewable fossil fuel based source particularly in large scale thermal desalination plants 4 petal 2018 86 had described a genuine zero discharge scenario to recycle pome to be used for other applications this scenario involves flash evaporation air drying of pome with minimal chemical treatment where up to 85 of pure water could be recovered from the evaporation process and used as boiler feed water or process water this system requires a large surface area and a long retention time the evaporation of water from pome on the other hand consumes a lot of energy according to wenten et al 2018 approximately 1 kg of steam is required to evaporate 1 kg of water under typical conditions 13 tan and co authors 87 discussed two types of pome evaporation technologies that were focused on the reduction of steam demand of the process namely multi effect evaporation mee and mechanical vapor recompression mvr as shown in fig 2 the energy consuming mechanical process in mvr systems recompresses the vapor so formed consequently steam is reused and there is a reduction in fresh steam demand in the integrated palm oil based complex pobc optimization mee and mvr evaporation systems were evaluated for pome dewatering the single effect mvr pome evaporator resulted in a 64 reduction in thermal costs and in return a 1 5 reduction in pobc profitability it was found that reduced electricity tariffs to reach an electricity to steam ratio of 1 27 could boost the economic appeal of mvr implemented pobc the pome evaporation technology expectedly provides new opportunities in oil recovery water reuse effluent removal and process integration with downstream refinery for thermal based treatment of pome mee is another efficient system that saves around 75 of steam possesses extra effects and thus replaced single effect evaporator 88 the reason behind the equipment operation in multiple stages at stationary phase is to improve energy efficiency process profitability and prevent fouling 89 in this regard mee system was found suitable to remove a significant amount of water in the incoming feed in an energy efficient manner on the other hand it was claimed that mvr technology when employed in single effect evaporators could reduce the amount of steam required compared to mee mvr technology is ideal for low boiling point elevation applications like pome evaporation a specialized fan driven by electrical energy recompresses vapor from the evaporation side of the unit in an mvr system allowing vapor to be reused and eliminating steam usage during operation 90 in another design suggested by kandiah and batumalai 88 large amounts of suspended solids were removed in a two phase decanter of undiluted pome to enable oil sludge separation without the addition of water based on this study there are two types of evaporators first thermal falling film evaporator where the liquid like pome to be concentrated is fed to the top of the heating tubes and dispersed in such a way that it forms a thin film on the inside of the walls the other type is forced circulation evaporator in which both heating and vaporization are carried out separately while keeping in mind that the backpressure generated by an orifice plate or valve in the heat exchanger s discharge slows down the vaporization process fouling is reduced in comparison to other types of evaporators due to the suppression of boiling and the high circulation rate turbulent flow in the heat exchanger it was noteworthy that these types of evaporators were engineered for treating liquors that are prone to scaling or crystallization but appeared to be less applicable in pome treatment it was reported that when oil was absent water removal from pome sludge raised the viscosity of the sludge 91 as a result heat transfer efficiency is lowered while evaporator s tube clogging rate could be accelerated therefore the relatively high content of oil and grease in pome could serve as a fluidizing agent in the feed in an innovative technology alfa laval al company has introduced space saving solutions to split pome solids and recover clean water in a more sustainable manner al provides a zero liquid discharge system for recycling isolated clear pome water which could assist mills in meeting increasingly rigorous environmental regulations additionally a good portion of palm oil could be recovered from pome which increases the mill s profitability pomevap 92 a forced circulation plate evaporator that is based on al s well known technology is a small installation that takes up a minimal space area unlike ponding systems this forced circulation plate evaporator creates a highly turbulent flow inside the plate heat exchanger that is generated by circulating the liquid between the cyclone separator vessel and the plate flash evaporator the evaporator separates the pome into solids and a clear water stream preventing methane emissions to the atmosphere and lowering bod levels in the separated water the separated clear water could either be treated further to fulfill the local effluent discharge limits or recycled to the milling processes the sludge processing yields valuable by products such as fertilizers 93 and animal and aquatic feed 94 95 thereby acting as a new source of revenue pomevapplus is an advanced technology that combines both evaporation technologies with decanting stage as shown in fig 3 during evaporation the concentration of palm oil increases which is recovered in the decanter phase for optimum oil recovery that in turn increases the mill s profitability along with other by products it enhances the current open ponding systems by supporting dewatering of effluent from aerobic and anaerobic ponds through decanting al decanter is proven cost effective easily operated reliable sustainable and efficient in solids removal applying decanting step offers several advantages according to al supplier including 1 less transport and disposal cost due to lower sludge volume 2 high capacity in a smaller footprint with low energy intake 3 anti blocking function and wear resistant design and 4 clean in place in a closed environment 96 pomevapplus system is designed to treat dilute raw pome whose ideal composition is suggested to be around 5 solids non oil 1 oil and 94 water 97 the plate evaporator that was exclusively manufactured for those liquids whose handling is difficult and challenging due to fouling by allowing the passage of pome through the plates the plate evaporator can efficiently separate water in vapor form from the solids by creating a high turbulence shear rate within the plates through recirculation that results in lowering the fouling rate increasing heat transfer and separation time after evaporation the mixture of water vapors and solid concentrate passes through a cyclonic separator whereby the water vapors are collected at the top of the cyclone which is later condensed and could be re used after further treatment as clear water the solid concentrate continues to a series of decanting stage where oil recovery from solid concentrate is successfully achieved with least energy consumption essentially a powerful recirculation pump that ensures a high flow rate is employed to maintain a turbulent liquid movement inside the heat exchanger which keeps the solids suspended saavedra et al 2021 85 reviewed the innovative methods used on emerging thermal treatment methods that could be summarized in utilizing solar and geothermal energy as a source of heating or mixed energy supply to achieve a profitable water recovery system 3 3 integrated zero discharge treatment systems a wastewater with a high colloidal suspension and dissolved proteins and sugars like pome as aforementioned cannot be filtered using conventional membrane filtration systems one of the currently practiced treatment solutions is an integrated aerobic and anaerobic ponding system prior to membrane filtration nevertheless still high capital cost long retention times and organic and microbiological fouling of membranes are critical challenges for the integrated biological treatment systems even though the nf devices are available for instance a zero waste system devised by al amshawee et al 98 post treated pome which had undergone anaerobic degradation for water recovery process in three stages micro media fixed bed bio film reactor fbbr ozonation at 15 mg l ozone dose and electrodialysis desalination at 40 v as illustrated in fig 4 notably the latter was an electrically driven membrane treatment comprising electric supply electrodes and membrane films the effluent produced from this zero waste system was considered as a first class effluent with 100 clearance free from cod nitrogen compounds sulfate potassium calcium magnesium manganese iron boron zinc copper bromine chlorine and ozone the characteristic of the final effluent suggested it as palatable water for drinking irrigation discharging and recycling purposes this zero waste system used formerly bio treated pome that underwent retention in seven ponds hence biodegradation method is less reliable since it requires huge lands involves ghg emission in the earlier stages and has long hydraulic retention time hrt the cutting edge study by tabassum et al 10 demonstrated a pome zero discharge pilot plant that rendered zero ghg emission into the atmosphere and wastewater generation while incurred low capital investment plus low operating cost in comparison to the current pome treatment systems this zero discharge plant consisted of three main stages as shown in fig 5 first stage was pre treatment recovery of palm oil from pome while second stage involved biological of aerobic anaerobic treatment biogas production from pome and generation of final discharge effluent with a bod of 20 mg l or below and lastly membrane filtration wastewater reuse or recycling a multi staged system was necessary in treating such a high strength wastewater pome two patented treatment technologies were utilized in this pilot plant namely an advanced anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed anaerobic anaeg 99 and a novel environmental biotechnological aerobic process aerobic bioax 100 the two modules of uf membrane used were of a nominal mwco of 100 000 g mol the ro membrane was of 99 6 nacl rejection rate after a year of testing the bod readings of pome achieved below 20 mg l after bioax treatment that caused 80 76 removal noteworthy this vertical enclosed zero discharge system required only 2 acres of land for 60 t h mill as compared to the open ponding system that takes about 10 acres of land a zero waste technology system was demonstrated in pilot plant study for a sustainable palm oil mill by ukm ysd zero waste project 42 a series of treatments were applied to treat pome which comprised an initial anaerobic digestion stage to produce bio hydrogen and bio methane gases while the effluent was later subjected to a phycoremediation process by scenedesmus sp ukm9 which is the most efficient microalgae strain in pome treatment with cod and total organic carbon toc removal of 58 and 80 respectively the final stage of the pilot plant involved the water recycle and reuse by an integrated membrane treatment system as shown in fig 6 which consisted of a sand filter an activated carbon pre treatment unit and a cross flow membrane module used to further treat partially treated pome after the microalgae reactor the membrane modules used in the integrated membrane filtration system were ro low pressure ro and nf membranes the system successfully reduced the organic and inorganic pollutants i e 98 54 ammonia nitrogen nh3 n 99 93 cod 99 98 tss 99 51 tds 100 color 99 96 phosphorus 99 81 turbidity 99 50 conductivity 55 62 hardness mg and 68 49 hardness ca the high quality treated effluent was recommended to be used as the boiler feed water or drinking water another research team proposed a system alteration of the conventional open ponding system by eliminating the cooling pond and effluent polishing stages as illustrated in fig 7 and adding a thermal treatment and dewatering device for more stable and efficient pome treatment 101 they found that thermal pretreatment and solid loading significantly enhanced the treatment process of pome with cod bod and tss removal efficiencies of 97 5 95 1 and 94 5 respectively at hrt of 2 days the biogas produced was 2 folds higher than the conventional method with higher ch4 purity hence the time required for the secondary stage aeration treatment was diminished and the polishing stage was eliminated which led to economic advantages due to reduced energy consumption the integrated zero discharge system has proven to be efficient on producing high quality water the main drawbacks of this system are the burden of building and maintenance of the multiple stages plant and the long hrt on the other hand renewable energy could be generated and valuable biomass is obtained as by products which can help in reducing the cost of palm oil production process 4 by products recovery besides pure water this study aimed to review the potential products generated from pome treatment including solid biofertilizers liquid and gaseous biofuels full utilization of the organic material content in pome is recommended for higher economic returns and environmental pollution prevention according to loh et al 102 there are efforts being made to fully recover the different potential by products of palm oil milling which are produced in large quantities especially pome for integration into the food energy water nexus 4 1 biohydrogen and biogas raw pome or freshly discharged pome has proven to be a suitable substrate for biogas production via anaerobic digestion ad process ad involves degradation of pome via microorganisms with the absence of o2 generating biogas digestate potential biofertilizer and less polluted pome effluent the disadvantages of applying ad process in pome treatment are long hrt and long start up period 23 24 103 for that reason many researchers have introduced a prior stage for ad that is the production of biohydrogen through dark fermentation 101 104 105 high energy yield could be obtained by full utilization of organic matter in pome during the water reclamation process the energy required for processes such as thermal treatment membrane separation and heating in integrated zero discharge systems could be provided by the obtained biogas noting that the lower heating value lhv for h2 and ch4 are 120 and 50 mj kg respectively while the lhv for gasoline is 44 5 mj kg table 5 shows the anaerobic digestion of pome and the energy generated from capturing the biogas produced clearly single stage ad is not enough for clean water reclamation a pre or post treatment steps are required furthermore microbial fuel cell mfc are known to produce biogas from pome using a combined concept of anaerobic and aerobic chambers that are divided by a membrane where microorganisms are used as biocatalyst to transform the chemical energy stored in pome to electrical energy 103 however water reclamation using mfc is not satisfactory for example only 64 4 cod could be removed from pre treated pome with biogas of 1040 ml for 624 h 106 a maximum cod efficiency removal was 58 by using klebsiella variicola as the inoculum in mfc 107 4 2 biofertilizer pome is a rich source of npk nutrients the recovered nutrients from pome during the treatment processes could be used as a low cost biofertilizer to replace the widely used chemical fertilizers according to 93 treated pome is safe to be used as an organic fertilizer since it contains low level of heavy metal elements and high amounts of nutrients such as fe k ca mg and p in another study pome precipitate were tested in a set of pot trial tests using scindapsus aureus the ratio of bod cod of pome was around 2 58 meaning that high amount of organic material are readily degradable particularly mg n o and p the observed plant growth was superior as compared to the commercially available chemical fertilizer 113 a dried and dewatered pome sludge was considered as fertilizer in a biogas production plant and contributed to the project s main revenue 108 in a study conducted by 102 a comparison was made between anaerobically treated and untreated raw pome as an organic fertilizer supplemented with chicken manure for ipomoea aquatica kangkung growth by pot assay treated pome showed superior results compared to raw pome in terms of greater fresh biomass 50 increment plant height and leaves number in treatment which was reasoned to the high residual oil content 12 6 g l in raw pome that caused retarded plant growth nonetheless overdose of the treated pome fertilizer may contrarily affect the plant growth due to the presence of volatile fatty acid higher than 0 58 g l the stud estimated that 1 t of treated solid pome can be obtained from 20 m3of liquid pome 1 72 t of food vegetable would be produced from a total of 2 t blend of treated pome chicken manure fertilizer 1 1 t ha further renewable energy in a form of biogas could be produced 306 m3 biogas that results in avoiding 3 7 t co2eq from being released to the atmosphere therefore anaerobically treated pome from integrated zero discharge systems can be recovered and conditionally mixed other naturally occurring material and separated from water as an organic fertilizer through dewatering and drying process this will help overcome the high cost of chemical fertilizer used in cultivation 5 techno economic analysis tea at the research and development stage tea is performed to test the potential of economic feasibility of the proposed technologies it regulates the potential of process s real time tea of water recovery from various wastewaters have been extensively studied in literature that can be used to estimate the economic feasibility of pome treatment since it shares similar properties with the studied wastewaters 114 since desalination is thermal and pressure driven processes energy is the most important parameter in tea in general the cost of water reuse program from wastewaters is affected by several factors 115 that could be applied specifically in the case of pome these factors include the location of a reclaimed water source inside the palm oil mill treatment infrastructure based on the adopted method pome quality customer use requirements boiler water quality transmission and pumping timing and storage needs energy requirements concentrate disposal treatment of value added biomass permitting and financing costs evidently the energy source is the most influencing factor in the water production cost from wastewater using membrane separation for instance waste heat reduced the water cost by 71 and 55 compared to electricity and fuel oil burning respectively when using water gap md 116 in a similar finding the produced water cost was reduced by 87 after applying waste heat as thermal source in dcmd 117 the heat exchange equipment and storage tanks occupied must of the capital cost whereby thermal energy was the major cost for the operation and maintenance costs attaching solar energy as a thermal source for multi effect desalination has been suggested to reduce the cost of heating energy 118 the water production cost herein was 2 251usd m3 with an investments payback period of 5 738 years the water cost by this method was mainly affected by solar direct normal irradiation level land cost solar thermal field costs power block and labor costs the estimated fresh water production cost using fo ro and anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr system was 0 80 m3 for an open loop scheme maximizing water production 119 in another study by 120 a system of uf ro was used for water reclamation from municipal wastewater it was found that a higher influent flowrate can reduce the fresh water cost 0 57 m3 noting that uf operation required higher capex and opex compared to ro an fo md system was introduced to treat the effluent of anaerobically digested wastewater the electricity produced from methane in ad was 0 52 kwh m3 that is 100 times higher than the energy required for fo md system the clean water cost was 1 29 usd m3 future research must focus on reducing the membrane price to achieve price competitiveness with other methods 121 water recovery from pome greatly reduces the production cost of obtaining products with maximum efficiency each of the three reviewed methods of water recovery from pome has its own pros and cons that must be considered before going to from lab scale to the larger scale applications table 6 lists a comparison of the methods addressed in this study 6 challenges and future perspectives process control of integrated biological treatment system is considered challenging to list a few of these challenges the long start up periods sensitivity of microorganisms to internal and external factors and fluctuation in pome characteristics based on seasonal production 103 to avoid system failure and the extra labor and maintenance costs a prior treatment stage may be introduce to control the organic loading rate and shorten the start up period biological processes are usually associated by biogas generation the treatment plant must be designed to fully capture the generated gases as reported by 123 in a scenario of all palm oil mills in malaysia to capture the biogas a total of 1750 million m3 biogas with ghg savings of 19 5 million t co2eq can be achieved yearly this industry can supplement nation s energy mix with 540 mw of installed capacity in the form of bio compressed natural gas or biomethane in light of that many palm oil mills in malaysia are under planning of biogas plant installation however due to high capital cost and no strict regulations and enforcement the growth is relatively slow 103 through membrane process a high quality of water can be supplied in larger quantities and in shorter time as compared to the conventional biological treatment methods however most of the reported studies of pome membrane studies were tested in laboratory or pilot scale to investigate the impact of operating conditions large scale studies covering industrial water recovery from pome by the different membrane designs is still limited and hence represents a promising area for future research the evaporation technology presented by alfa laval with decanting stage requires high consumption of energy as compared to other discussed methods but in terms of operating time water quality simple pre treatment and maintenance cost it showed attractive outcome as far as recycling and reclamation of water from pome was concerned henceforth life cycle assessment optimization and techno economic analysis are suggested for its application in commercially scaled designs 7 conclusions this review provides an overview of the recent methods applied to obtain clean water from pome the objective of each of the discussed method was to achieve water in quality of drinking water or as boilers feed water understanding the characteristics of this type of wastewater is important in the selection of the right method to minimize the dependency on pre treatment step the recovered by products helps in achieving zero discharge system for environmental pollution prevention and in reducing the costs of pome treatment to maximize potential of the proposed methods for clean water reclamation from pome future research studies must focus on the performance of the thermal processes and reducing the cost of membranes in hybrid systems to be cost competitive with other technologies for water reclamation

12518,water scarcity will continue to be a global challenge in the coming years as long as sustainable solutions remain far fetched it has become necessary to improve the efficiency of water circulation to reduce the net demand in high water consumption sectors such as agriculture in palm oil industry the extraction of crude palm oil from oil palm fruit bunch requires a large amount of water half of which is discharged as palm oil mill effluent pome that is considered a high strength wastewater the current trend of pome research focuses on moving from conventional open ponding treatment to an integrated zero discharge system for better effluent management in this review the attempts taken by researchers in laboratory and pilot scale were highlighted to achieve an effluent of high quality water from pome that can be used as drinking water or recycled as boiler water in the palm oil production process membrane technology has recently emerged as one of the most promising separation techniques having a broad spectrum of applications including pome treatment furthermore water reclamation technique involving evaporation can split pome solids and recover clean water in a more sustainable and space saving manner additionally recovery of by product such as biofertilizer and biofuels is necessary to overcome the cost of the treatment as a whole in spite of several challenges water reclamation from pome can be considered economically feasible system from techno economic analysis perspective and it can feasibly shift the adopted industrial method from a linear take use discharge economy approach to a circular economy by keeping water in circulation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords palm oil mill effluent water reclamation membrane technology thermal treatment integrated zero discharge system data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the increased global industrialization and population growth have led to unavoidable energy crises and significant wastewater generation freshwater supply and demand have gradually increased during the last two decades 1 according to the report of the world health organization by the year 2025 half of the world s population will be living in water stressed areas 2 in this aspect the generated wastewater must be treated and or regenerated in the most cost effective and environmentally friendly manner to conserve energy protect environment and to meet ever increasing demand 3 noteworthy in most countries agriculture and food industry are the sectors that require the most water consumption almost 100 times more than the household sector 4 considering the leading agro industry in malaysia palm oil is critical for the advancement of the country s economy at the same time it is accountable for piling up voluminous underutilized by products as estimated almost 50 of palm oil mill effluent pome is generated from a total of 5 0 7 5 mt of water used to produce 1 mt of crude palm oil cpo 5 this water could be recovered from pome and reused in the milling processes or as drinking water the zero liquid discharge systems are gaining popular attention in water treatment technology since they enhance the production of clean water together with valuable by products generation making the production process more economically attractive and sustainable hence to be considered sustainable the process must be cost effective eco friendly and socially acceptable 4 according to mbavarira and grimm 6 a considerable potential is expected from circular economy in the water industry because water is not only considered as the heart of circular economy but also acts as a catalyst for transitioning away from the linear take use discharge approach on a global scale pertinently circular economy employs the 6rs strategy of reduce reuse recycle reclaim recover and restore that were defined by kakwani and kalbar 2020 7 to maintain water in circulation for long durations and thus reduces the load on natural systems 7 a shift to a circular economy will stimulate more effective water use especially when paired with strong incentives for innovation can improve an economy s ability to meet the demands of the developing water supply and demand imbalance 8 in order to achieve a comprehensive clean water reclamation process from pome a prior knowledge on the plausible techniques employed is essential to help in achieving zero discharge palm oil mills under the circular economy approach namely membrane technology thermal treatment and integrated zero discharge systems this has potential to improve the resource recovery productivity and cost effectiveness in conventional modeling approach advanced smart process control and optimization were adopted to maximize economic returns and minimize waste discharge to achieve a sustainable modeling an integration of all aspects such as techno economic environmental and social constraints are required 12 the multiple stages of biological treatments that are generally employed in many palm oil mills take a long retention time for each stage and in most cases involve generation of by products hybridizing biological treatment with both uf and ro membranes 9 10 as well as nf achieved remarkable outcomes in the water recovery from pome and other high strength wastewater there are many factors that need to be considered such as the required level of purity the volume of production the expenses of chemical pre treatments and other operational expenditures 4 fouling is an unavoidable problem for membranes which requires rigorous cleaning to restore performance due to the high load of suspended particulates in pome that hinder water passage through the membrane 11 water desalination for the production of potable water has two major categories thermal and membrane desalination both of them have attracted the attention of many researchers worldwide while desalination is prominently used in treating seawater and brine water it has been suggested for treating pome due to its essential part in securing the supply of an adequate amount of clean water but at very high cost 12 in order for palm oil mills to achieve sustainability the potential of water recycling approach as post treatment has been reviewed in this study focusing on membrane and thermal treatments membrane technology proposes interesting alternatives to the conventional processes because the former has numerous benefits that might help to address the problems encountered in the ponding system besides that reusable components in pome such as oil and water could be recovered using membrane system the water so recovered might be used for other purposes several researchers have recommended various pre treatment procedures to get utilizable water from pome recovery process 13 evaporation is another separation technology that has been developed to save time and money of the membrane process while minimizing the loss of water and the high value biomass despite the numerous limitations of biological processes serial biological treatment system has been demonstrated in several pilot plants and showed positive outcomes in terms of by product recovery and clean water reclamation 2 palm oil mill effluent pome pome the liquid waste generated from cpo clarification oil palm fresh fruit bunch opffb sterilization and hydro cyclone separation of a mixture containing shell and kernel 14 as shown in fig 1 in palm oil extraction process sterilization is the initial step which entails heating the opffb up to 140 c for a period ranging from 75 to 90 min in an autoclave machine to denature hydraulic enzymes and soften the oil palm fruitlets creating a coagulated viscous solution known as sterilizer condensate and the cooked fruits are called sterilized fruit bunches sfb about 36 of pome is generated at this stage 15 thereafter sfb is transported to get stripped pressed and clarified during which nearly 60 of the total pome is produced 16 the crude palm oil is further purified and vacuum dried studies showed that just 4 of the total pome is formed at this stage 17 the entire process is chemical free relies mostly on the thermal and physical force powered by in situ steam generated through combustion of residual oil palm biomass 14 for steam generation a significant amount of water is used during these phases the extraction water or waste steam ends up as effluent which is heavily infused with various organic compounds making pome a high strength wastewater 13 noteworthy solvent extraction is the common oil extraction process for other types of vegetable seed oil where small amount of wastewater is generated however solvent extraction is not applicable in palm oil extraction process therefore thermomechanical method is applied which demands 60 of water usage that ends up as wastewater pome one of the toughest challenges in the palm oil milling industry is the treatment of pome hence water recovery from pome could make this industry more feasible and environment friendly pome in nature is brown in color viscous contains high amount of solids and water the brownish color is attributed to the high content of carotene pectin tannin phenolic compounds and lignin moreover pome contains significant amounts of carbohydrates amino acids free organic acids and inorganic minerals 18 19 as listed in table 1 consequently the presence of such high levels of organic pollutants in pome makes it inhabitable for aquatic life hence it is prohibited to discharge it directly into waterways before proper treatment the oil palm sector in malaysia is steadfastly devoted to abiding by a variety of environmental laws the environment quality act 1974 and specific regulations for pome 1977 were enacted by the government to control the limits for watercourse discharge as shown in table 1 through environment management system iso14001 2015 policy the zero waste discharge processes could be altered into existing treatment system in the mills in light of the characteristics of pome mentioned in table 1 biological treatment that runs on the basis of suspended growth activated sludge approach in open ponding system running in series of anaerobic facultative and aerobic is generally adopted by 85 of the mills in malaysia and indonesia 20 this is owing to its simplicity cost effectiveness fewer technical expertise required and easier discharge limit in the past 21 many studies have confirmed the method s inefficiencies including long treatment times a big operational footprint a high risk of subsurface water pollution and the release of unpleasant odor gases including sulfur dioxide so2 and methane ch4 15 22 23 the emission of methane proved to be the major dilemma for the palm oil industry and the governments alike hence prompting the authorities to draw a mandate for compulsory methane capture along with stricter final discharge limit for palm oil mills 24 almost half of the existing pome treatment plants in malaysia are incapable to capture the produced biogas due to the inefficiency of applied techniques as latest and robust techniques are could be expensive to be commercialized especially for smaller independent millers 25 furthermore the resulted effluent in this open ponding method cannot meet revised malaysian discharge regulations most of the times and the accumulated sludge at the bottom of the treatment pond must be removed on a regular basis 15 according to lee and co authors 2019 to meet sufficient degradation requirement a typical anaerobic treatment pond roughly requires 30 45 acres to store the pome for 3 months before it is finally allowed to be discharged to river sources 20 3 water reclamation from pome out of its total composition 94 96 of pome comprises that of water as its major component 33 therefore pome could serve as a source of recycled fresh water for human consumption industrial uses and agricultural purposes in this study the efforts undertaken to recover water from pome have been reviewed the proposed treatment methods of pome are shown in fig 1 pome characteristics are not constant they may vary according to season milling process and location pome may sometimes contain higher amounts of oil and solids hence a pre treatment step might be deployed prior to membrane technology and integrated biological treatment systems while thermal treatment is less dependent on pome s characteristics the pome pre treatment techniques are not covered in this study 3 1 membrane technology membrane technology is old but well recognized as a robust filtration method with a track record of successfully treating wastewater and creating high quality water for industrial and municipal reuse or for releasing back to waterbodies 34 according to goh et al 3 membrane technology has gained an increased acceptance in wastewater treatment because of its ability to deal with a wide range of feed water while maintaining high operational reliability membrane bioreactor mbr forward osmosis fo ultra filtration uf nano filtration nf and membrane distillation md are some of the commonly applied membrane based wastewater treatment techniques 35 noteworthy only md is a thermally driven separation process whereas the other membrane technologies are pressure driven separation processes 36 mbr combines membrane technology with wastewater biological treatment technology has a number of benefits such as high biomass loading in the bioreactor a small footprint excellent effluent quality and a particularly high removal rate of suspended solids ss pathogenic bacteria and virus 37 mbr have received a lot of attention by researchers and public health experts as an alternative treatment process for wastewaters such as pome since the current conventional open ponding system has proven to be ineffective resulting in environmental pollution mbr offers a highly promising solution for the treatment of pome 38 the emergence of mbrs in the recent years was due to the resulted high quality of effluents that appropriate for discharge into the environment or reused for various purposes 3 1 1 pressure driven membrane process pressure driven membrane process is a type of membrane that utilize pressure force as driving force across the membrane induces a flux of permeate from bulk solution at one side of the membrane towards the permeate side reverse osmosis ro membranes are normally utilized for desalination of saltwater and brackish waters to generate high quality drinking water however ro for separation of organic solutions such as pome has widely been expanded 39 the principle of forward osmosis fo is based on water diffusion from a lower concentration solution to a higher concentration solution through a semipermeable membrane modest flux rates could be attained by utilizing a draw solution with a higher osmotic concentration than the wastewater feed although fo requires less hydraulic power and reduced chances of membrane fouling fo produces a diluted draw solution that is not pure water 40 therefore water recovery from pome using fo may require a further treatment making this method unfeasible for water reclamation from pome furthermore due to its efficiency the uf process is widely utilized in the refining industry uf membranes are utilized to filter pome because the ultrafiltration procedure can easily filter out suspended solids and microbes 41 the combinations of biological treatment with uf ro membranes 9 10 and nf 42 achieved remarkable outcomes for the water recovery from pome an efficient cross flow uf membrane was integrated with anaerobic reactor to reutilize pome to generate energy and produce clean water in a single treatment step the membrane s maximum operating pressure was 55 bars at 70 wc and the tested ph ranged from 2 to 12 at a steady state the overall removal of cod bod and tss was higher than 98 with biomethane yield of 0 7 lch4 gcod removed were achieved 37 hybat et al 2013 designed a similar system where a laboratory digester of membrane anaerobic system was used to digest pome and produce biogas followed by water clarification using a cross flow uf with maximum operating pressure of 55 bars at 70 c and ph ranging from 2 to 12 the cod removal efficiency biogas yield and vss removal recorded 94 to 97 0 83 l gcod d and 90 6 g l at hrt of 10 days 43 the study confirmed the efficiency of the integrated system anaerobic bioreactor uf membrane in water recovery from pome azmi and yunos 44 have investigated the efficiency of uf membrane treatment in reclaiming water reuse from pome at laboratory scale uf treatment reduced pollutant components by up to 90 when combined with adsorption pre treatment by palm kernel shell based activated carbon pks ac the optimal operating parameters were ph 8 stirring speed of 600 rpm and operating pressure of 2 bar for 90 min despite the high percentage of carbohydrate and protein recovered in the study the uf method was found to be impracticable for pome treatment due to the membrane fouling which resulted in a loss of productivity and as a result a high maintenance cost is required furthermore to ensure minimal membrane fouling and continuous operation a significant amount of clean water was necessary to completely clean the membrane 20 tertiary membrane treatment of pome was ideal in water reclamation for boiler feed standards three types of membrane nf270 bw30 and xle were assessed based on the removal efficiency of cod color turbidity tds p and conductivity 45 pome decolourization via a photocatalytic reaction was tested on a novel hybrid polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fibre membrane incorporated with different loadings of titanate nanotube that has been developed to enhance the hydrophilicity of the nanocomposite increase surface area and surface hydroxyl groups 3 also shamsuddin et al 46 made an improvement on the cellulose membrane to enhance pome decolourization performance by combining epoxidized natural rubber polyvinyl chloride with cellulose and cellulose grafting polymethyl methacrylate as a filler with compositions of 20 and 10 respectively the performance of paired uf membranes in a sandwich designs for the reclamation of water from final discharged pome was investigated 47 without a spacer two membranes namely polyethersulfone pes and regenerated cellulose rc were placed together in various configurations the average pollutant removal was 80 90 while the single membrane achieved 60 70 pollutant removal the quality of permeate obtained for tds ss turbidity bod5 cod were 535 mg l 25 mg l 0 88 ntu 23 3 mg l and 48 mg l respectively the reclaimed water was within the standard discharge limits and was recommended to be reused in the mill for palm oil extraction purposes table 2 summarized the research studies on membranes used for pome treatment 3 1 2 thermal driven membrane process thermally driven membrane process is a type of membrane process which uses low grade heat to drive separation membrane distillation md is a vaporization based thermally driven purification process in which a microporous hydrophobic and a non selective membrane is used to separate the solvents from the solutes at low pressure and temperature 55 md is an integration of membrane separation with thermal distillation that purposedly combines the comparative advantages of both approaches the conventional membrane treatments such as mf uf and ro suffer from many drastic drawbacks such as high energy consumption huge amounts of chemicals needed high pressure requirement and membrane fouling 56 md configuration could be categorised into four different categories as illustrated in fig s 1 in supplimentry data these are direct contact membrane distillation dcmd vacuum membrane distillation vmd sweeping gas membrane distillation sgmd and air gap membrane distillation agmd 57 all classes of md configurations use the same governing principle on the feed side wherein the heat input generates a transmembrane difference in vapor pressure and temperature this effect drives the flux of the most volatile components of the solution each mode is well organized to keep the difference in the vapor pressure high enough to drive flux over the membrane 55 to minimize the energy requirment in md systems recent studies are addressing the energy recovering techniques that offer numerous economic and environmental benefits for instance hybrid disalination systems feed dilution with rejected wastewater streams from the process and utilization of green energies 58 md configuration could be categorised into four different categories as

systems feed dilution with rejected wastewater streams from the process and utilization of green energies 58 3 1 2 1 direct contact membrane distillation dcmd in dcmd evaporation occurs at the feed membrane surface because the hot solution pome is in direct contact with the heated membrane surface as seen in fig s 1 a due to the pressure difference across the membrane to the permeate side vapor moves and condenses inside the membrane the hydrophobicity of the membrane solely allows gaseous phase inside its pores hence the feed solution is unable to penetrate inside the membrane 1 yatim and co authors 2019 tested dcmd with silanized tio2 on water recovery from synthetic wastewater paper mill effluent and pome results showed that the flux using paper mill effluent was less than that in synthetic water due to the formation of suspended solids and microalgae on the membrane surface while the system s rejection was maintained at 99 the results of pome on the other hand was not promising where a drastic decrease in membrane flux from 6 to 2 kg m2 h over 400 min of operation was observed noting that cod rejection was maintained at 96 9 59 this is due to the oil and solid content in pome that caused pore blocking therefore pre treatment is recommended to overcome the membrane fouling in another study dcmd was evaluated for its pollutant removal efficiency from sedimented and pre filtered pome nutrient removal capability of 99 for pre filtered pome was reported 36 in dcmd evaporation occurs at the feed membrane surface because the hot solution pome is in

pre treatment is recommended to overcome the membrane fouling in another study dcmd was evaluated for its pollutant removal efficiency from sedimented and pre filtered pome nutrient removal capability of 99 for pre filtered pome was reported 36 olive oil mill effluent has comparable characteristics to pome as an oily wastewater with relatively high solid content sponza 2021 applied a three step treatment to achieve high pollutant removal efficiency of 99 00 99 99 first 17 18 of cod tss and phenol were removed by cartridge filtration as pretreatment stage second dcmd removed 81 90 of the effluent s pollutants the permeate flux in dcmd increased from 2 3 l m2 h up to 24 l m2 h as the feed flowrate increased lastly optimal cod tss and conductivity removals were 100 at a ro membrane pressure of 8 bar and remained constant until 21 bar ro pressure 60 in a similar study by 61 demonstrated the effeciency of dcmd in obtaining clean water and a concnetrate containg polyphenols from olive mill wastewater with separation efficiency of 99 pome is a brownish wastewater the removal of pome color is another challenge that could be resolved by dcmd for instance the possibility of recovering clean water from a dyeing wastewater usually discharged in hot condition from textile industry similar to pome was evaluated by mokhtar et al 62 by using the dry jet wet inversion process a series of pvdf hollow fibre membranes with varying polymer concentration 12 18 wt were designed for dcmd application it was found that regardless of the polymer concentration employed in the dope solution for membrane preparation at least 99 78 color removal was obtained the md is less prone to fouling than other pressure driven membrane processes such as mf uf and nf and thus potentially applied for recovering water from textile wastewater generally discharged at high temperatures in another study the removal of high concentrated solution of ions such as ca2 mg2 co3 2 and hco3 silica microorganisms and chemicals achieved 99 95 removal by dcmd during water recovery 63 3 1 2 2 vacuum membrane distillation vmd in this md module a pump is needed to create a vacuum in the permeate membrane side of a vmd configuration condensation of separated clean water occurs outside the membrane as shown in fig s 1 b the amount of heat lost by conduction is low which is a significant benefit against other available md 64 in terms of energy consumption and thermal evaporation efficiency it outperforms dcmd one of the most significant advantages offered by vmd is the possibility of utilizing renewable energy sources such as solar energy 65 and could be coupled with ro for better water recovery in this md module a pump is needed to create a vacuum in the permeate membrane side of a vmd configuration condensation of separated clean water occurs outside the membrane as shown in fig s 1 b the amount of heat lost by conduction is low which is a significant benefit against other available md 64 in terms of energy consumption and thermal evaporation efficiency it outperforms dcmd one of the most significant advantages offered by vmd is the possibility of utilizing renewable energy sources such as solar energy 65 and could be coupled with ro for better water recovery to the best of the authors knowledge no reports published on vmd technology of pome yet however several wastewaters have similar physicochemical properties as pome that could be used as relatable examples in this study for instance vmd was used to concentrate a lignocellulosic hydrolysate with glucose concentration of 35 96 g l under optimal conditions of velocity of 1 0 m s and 65 c heated by solar hot water heat transfer glucose rejection was 99 5 and the flux was 8 46 l m2h a vacuum pump was used to remove the transmembrane permeate which was then collected in a permeate container after chilling 66 vmd is expected to perform similarly with pome since it contains similar amount of glucose together with other types of sugar monomers yet finding a suitable pretreatment method to remove solids and oil from pome needs to be investigated prior to removal of furfural and acetic acid using vmd corn stover was hydrolyzed with 2 w v h2so4 at 95 c for 90 min at a solid to liquid ratio of 1 15 under optimal conditions 98 of furfural was removed by vmd the removal efficiency of acetic acid was noticeably lesser 67 for protein recovery from wastewaters białas et al 68 evaluated the recovery of the proteins in the effluent of the mechanically recovered poultry wastewater a novel design composing of mf uf and vmd using cross flow membrane techniques was used in their study results indicated that 70 of water was recovered and reductions in cod and tss level in the obtained permeate exceeded 99 the water recovered from this integrated membrane system could be reused in processing of poultry meat industry from the available studies it is estimated that pome needs to be pre treated before being subjected to vmd due to its high solid content and viscous nature in previous studies increasing the soluble organic matter such as sugar monomers from carbohydrates and elimination of the large particles could be achieved by chemical biological and physiochemical pre treatments 69 70 3 1 2 3 sweeping gas membrane distillation sgmd sgmd configuration a stream of cold inert gas flows in the permeate side sweeping the vaporized solution out of the permeate chamber an external condenser is required to condense the purified solution back to the feed stream as shown in fig s 1 c which is considered as a major disadvantage of sgmd 55 71 sgmd configuration applies dual concepts of agmd and dcmd 55 which consequently minimizes the conductive heat loss reduces the mass transfer resistance and increases evaporation efficiency traditional desalination technologies are effective but they are energy and time consuming 72 sgmd configuration a stream of cold inert gas flows in the permeate side sweeping the vaporized solution out of the permeate chamber an external condenser is required to condense the purified solution back to the feed stream as shown in fig s 1 c which is considered as a major disadvantage of sgmd 55 71 sgmd configuration applies dual concepts of agmd and dcmd 55 which consequently minimizes the conductive heat loss reduces the mass transfer resistance and increases evaporation efficiency traditional desalination technologies are effective but they are energy and time consuming 72 shirazi et al 73 used sgmd to directly separate ethanol and water using a flat sheet ptfe membrane diluted feeds within the temperature range of 35 to 55 c were used this method has a great potential to improve the bioethanol processing and water recovery in a similar study conducted to separate glycerol from water by flat sheet ptfe sgmd 71 it was observed that the optimum distillate rate was achieved at feed temperature of 65 c which sustains the hypothesis and emphasizes that the md is a temperature dependent process in that study around 99 of solute rejection was obtained in a study comparing three different md configurations namely dcmd vmd and sgmd in removing ammonia a pollutant present in pome from water 74 sgmd showed the moderate performance in terms of mass transfer coefficient when compared selectivity with the other two mds ammonia exists in many types of wastewaters the results showed immense potential in separating ammonia from water which could be implied on pome since there are yet no studies on viability of sgmd on pome treatment in light of the mentioned reports pome could perhaps be subjected to a prior anaerobic fermentation step since the fermented effluent contains volatile compounds and solvents 75 which might be further clarified using sgmd 3 1 2 4 air gap membrane distillation agmd as shown in fig s 1 d the presence of the air gap in this md design adds another layer of resistance that vapor transport must overcome this reduces the total flux that acts as a great barrier to mass transmission and is a major drawback of agmd 55 other than obtaining purified water nutrient recovery from such wastewaters is important a cost effective ammonia was recovered from liquefied wastewater by 80 removal efficiency using agmd 76 the economic returns of this study is high when compared to the commercial ammonia fertilizer that involves combination of atmospheric nitrogen gas with natural gas hydrogen by the haber bosch process under high pressure and temperature as well as an expensive catalyst 77 the suitable applications of this design are removal of salt and volatile compounds from aqueous solutions 57 hence the aforementioned md configuration is not viable for pome treatment since pome contains variety of pollutants and thus requires multiple pre treatment stages to be finally introduced to agmd as shown in fig s 1 d the presence of the air gap in this md design adds another layer of resistance that vapor transport must overcome this reduces the total flux that acts as a great barrier to mass transmission and is a major drawback of agmd 55 other than obtaining purified water nutrient recovery from such wastewaters is important a cost effective ammonia was recovered from liquefied wastewater by 80 removal efficiency using agmd 76 the economic returns of this

temperature as well as an expensive catalyst 77 the suitable applications of this design are removal of salt and volatile compounds from aqueous solutions 57 hence the aforementioned md configuration is not viable for pome treatment since pome contains variety of pollutants and thus requires multiple pre treatment stages to be finally introduced to agmd table 3 summarizes some of the previous studies used to separate various components mostly present in pome from various aqueous solutions since pome contains proteins anions and cations soluble sugars oil and grease and color these examples can help in choosing and developing the suitable md configuration and membrane characteristics to separate water from the pollutants the advantages and disadvantages of the four types of mds are summarized in table 4 noteworthy water recovery from pome has not been widely tested using sgmd vmd and agmd which requires the focus of researchers interested in sustainability and circular economy of palm oil industry 3 2 thermal treatment thermal method has shown a great potential in turning liquid pome into commercial biomass besides the oil recovery and the purified water thermal based methods rely on phase transitions caused by energy addition or removal causing thermal gradient 84 this alternative route for treating pome could help reduce environmental footprints while also requiring less capital investment than biogas operations 85 the main drawback of thermal treatment technologies is that a significant amount of energy is required to heat the water which is primarily provided by non renewable fossil fuel based source particularly in large scale thermal desalination plants 4 petal 2018 86 had described a genuine zero discharge scenario to recycle pome to be used for other applications this scenario involves flash evaporation air drying of pome with minimal chemical treatment where up to 85 of pure water could be recovered from the evaporation process and used as boiler feed water or process water this system requires a large surface area and a long retention time the evaporation of water from pome on the other hand consumes a lot of energy according to wenten et al 2018 approximately 1 kg of steam is required to evaporate 1 kg of water under typical conditions 13 tan and co authors 87 discussed two types of pome evaporation technologies that were focused on the reduction of steam demand of the process namely multi effect evaporation mee and mechanical vapor recompression mvr as shown in fig 2 the energy consuming mechanical process in mvr systems recompresses the vapor so formed consequently steam is reused and there is a reduction in fresh steam demand in the integrated palm oil based complex pobc optimization mee and mvr evaporation systems were evaluated for pome dewatering the single effect mvr pome evaporator resulted in a 64 reduction in thermal costs and in return a 1 5 reduction in pobc profitability it was found that reduced electricity tariffs to reach an electricity to steam ratio of 1 27 could boost the economic appeal of mvr implemented pobc the pome evaporation technology expectedly provides new opportunities in oil recovery water reuse effluent removal and process integration with downstream refinery for thermal based treatment of pome mee is another efficient system that saves around 75 of steam possesses extra effects and thus replaced single effect evaporator 88 the reason behind the equipment operation in multiple stages at stationary phase is to improve energy efficiency process profitability and prevent fouling 89 in this regard mee system was found suitable to remove a significant amount of water in the incoming feed in an energy efficient manner on the other hand it was claimed that mvr technology when employed in single effect evaporators could reduce the amount of steam required compared to mee mvr technology is ideal for low boiling point elevation applications like pome evaporation a specialized fan driven by electrical energy recompresses vapor from the evaporation side of the unit in an mvr system allowing vapor to be reused and eliminating steam usage during operation 90 in another design suggested by kandiah and batumalai 88 large amounts of suspended solids were removed in a two phase decanter of undiluted pome to enable oil sludge separation without the addition of water based on this study there are two types of evaporators first thermal falling film evaporator where the liquid like pome to be concentrated is fed to the top of the heating tubes and dispersed in such a way that it forms a thin film on the inside of the walls the other type is forced circulation evaporator in which both heating and vaporization are carried out separately while keeping in mind that the backpressure generated by an orifice plate or valve in the heat exchanger s discharge slows down the vaporization process fouling is reduced in comparison to other types of evaporators due to the suppression of boiling and the high circulation rate turbulent flow in the heat exchanger it was noteworthy that these types of evaporators were engineered for treating liquors that are prone to scaling or crystallization but appeared to be less applicable in pome treatment it was reported that when oil was absent water removal from pome sludge raised the viscosity of the sludge 91 as a result heat transfer efficiency is lowered while evaporator s tube clogging rate could be accelerated therefore the relatively high content of oil and grease in pome could serve as a fluidizing agent in the feed in an innovative technology alfa laval al company has introduced space saving solutions to split pome solids and recover clean water in a more sustainable manner al provides a zero liquid discharge system for recycling isolated clear pome water which could assist mills in meeting increasingly rigorous environmental regulations additionally a good portion of palm oil could be recovered from pome which increases the mill s profitability pomevap 92 a forced circulation plate evaporator that is based on al s well known technology is a small installation that takes up a minimal space area unlike ponding systems this forced circulation plate evaporator creates a highly turbulent flow inside the plate heat exchanger that is generated by circulating the liquid between the cyclone separator vessel and the plate flash evaporator the evaporator separates the pome into solids and a clear water stream preventing methane emissions to the atmosphere and lowering bod levels in the separated water the separated clear water could either be treated further to fulfill the local effluent discharge limits or recycled to the milling processes the sludge processing yields valuable by products such as fertilizers 93 and animal and aquatic feed 94 95 thereby acting as a new source of revenue pomevapplus is an advanced technology that combines both evaporation technologies with decanting stage as shown in fig 3 during evaporation the concentration of palm oil increases which is recovered in the decanter phase for optimum oil recovery that in turn increases the mill s profitability along with other by products it enhances the current open ponding systems by supporting dewatering of effluent from aerobic and anaerobic ponds through decanting al decanter is proven cost effective easily operated reliable sustainable and efficient in solids removal applying decanting step offers several advantages according to al supplier including 1 less transport and disposal cost due to lower sludge volume 2 high capacity in a smaller footprint with low energy intake 3 anti blocking function and wear resistant design and 4 clean in place in a closed environment 96 pomevapplus system is designed to treat dilute raw pome whose ideal composition is suggested to be around 5 solids non oil 1 oil and 94 water 97 the plate evaporator that was exclusively manufactured for those liquids whose handling is difficult and challenging due to fouling by allowing the passage of pome through the plates the plate evaporator can efficiently separate water in vapor form from the solids by creating a high turbulence shear rate within the plates through recirculation that results in lowering the fouling rate increasing heat transfer and separation time after evaporation the mixture of water vapors and solid concentrate passes through a cyclonic separator whereby the water vapors are collected at the top of the cyclone which is later condensed and could be re used after further treatment as clear water the solid concentrate continues to a series of decanting stage where oil recovery from solid concentrate is successfully achieved with least energy consumption essentially a powerful recirculation pump that ensures a high flow rate is employed to maintain a turbulent liquid movement inside the heat exchanger which keeps the solids suspended saavedra et al 2021 85 reviewed the innovative methods used on emerging thermal treatment methods that could be summarized in utilizing solar and geothermal energy as a source of heating or mixed energy supply to achieve a profitable water recovery system 3 3 integrated zero discharge treatment systems a wastewater with a high colloidal suspension and dissolved proteins and sugars like pome as aforementioned cannot be filtered using conventional membrane filtration systems one of the currently practiced treatment solutions is an integrated aerobic and anaerobic ponding system prior to membrane filtration nevertheless still high capital cost long retention times and organic and microbiological fouling of membranes are critical challenges for the integrated biological treatment systems even though the nf devices are available for instance a zero waste system devised by al amshawee et al 98 post treated pome which had undergone anaerobic degradation for water recovery process in three stages micro media fixed bed bio film reactor fbbr ozonation at 15 mg l ozone dose and electrodialysis desalination at 40 v as illustrated in fig 4 notably the latter was an electrically driven membrane treatment comprising electric supply electrodes and membrane films the effluent produced from this zero waste system was considered as a first class effluent with 100 clearance free from cod nitrogen compounds sulfate potassium calcium magnesium manganese iron boron zinc copper bromine chlorine and ozone the characteristic of the final effluent suggested it as palatable water for drinking irrigation discharging and recycling purposes this zero waste system used formerly bio treated pome that underwent retention in seven ponds hence biodegradation method is less reliable since it requires huge lands involves ghg emission in the earlier stages and has long hydraulic retention time hrt the cutting edge study by tabassum et al 10 demonstrated a pome zero discharge pilot plant that rendered zero ghg emission into the atmosphere and wastewater generation while incurred low capital investment plus low operating cost in comparison to the current pome treatment systems this zero discharge plant consisted of three main stages as shown in fig 5 first stage was pre treatment recovery of palm oil from pome while second stage involved biological of aerobic anaerobic treatment biogas production from pome and generation of final discharge effluent with a bod of 20 mg l or below and lastly membrane filtration wastewater reuse or recycling a multi staged system was necessary in treating such a high strength wastewater pome two patented treatment technologies were utilized in this pilot plant namely an advanced anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed anaerobic anaeg 99 and a novel environmental biotechnological aerobic process aerobic bioax 100 the two modules of uf membrane used were of a nominal mwco of 100 000 g mol the ro membrane was of 99 6 nacl rejection rate after a year of testing the bod readings of pome achieved below 20 mg l after bioax treatment that caused 80 76 removal noteworthy this vertical enclosed zero discharge system required only 2 acres of land for 60 t h mill as compared to the open ponding system that takes about 10 acres of land a zero waste technology system was demonstrated in pilot plant study for a sustainable palm oil mill by ukm ysd zero waste project 42 a series of treatments were applied to treat pome which comprised an initial anaerobic digestion stage to produce bio hydrogen and bio methane gases while the effluent was later subjected to a phycoremediation process by scenedesmus sp ukm9 which is the most efficient microalgae strain in pome treatment with cod and total organic carbon toc removal of 58 and 80 respectively the final stage of the pilot plant involved the water recycle and reuse by an integrated membrane treatment system as shown in fig 6 which consisted of a sand filter an activated carbon pre treatment unit and a cross flow membrane module used to further treat partially treated pome after the microalgae reactor the membrane modules used in the integrated membrane filtration system were ro low pressure ro and nf membranes the system successfully reduced the organic and inorganic pollutants i e 98 54 ammonia nitrogen nh3 n 99 93 cod 99 98 tss 99 51 tds 100 color 99 96 phosphorus 99 81 turbidity 99 50 conductivity 55 62 hardness mg and 68 49 hardness ca the high quality treated effluent was recommended to be used as the boiler feed water or drinking water another research team proposed a system alteration of the conventional open ponding system by eliminating the cooling pond and effluent polishing stages as illustrated in fig 7 and adding a thermal treatment and dewatering device for more stable and efficient pome treatment 101 they found that thermal pretreatment and solid loading significantly enhanced the treatment process of pome with cod bod and tss removal efficiencies of 97 5 95 1 and 94 5 respectively at hrt of 2 days the biogas produced was 2 folds higher than the conventional method with higher ch4 purity hence the time required for the secondary stage aeration treatment was diminished and the polishing stage was eliminated which led to economic advantages due to reduced energy consumption the integrated zero discharge system has proven to be efficient on producing high quality water the main drawbacks of this system are the burden of building and maintenance of the multiple stages plant and the long hrt on the other hand renewable energy could be generated and valuable biomass is obtained as by products which can help in reducing the cost of palm oil production process 4 by products recovery besides pure water this study aimed to review the potential products generated from pome treatment including solid biofertilizers liquid and gaseous biofuels full utilization of the organic material content in pome is recommended for higher economic returns and environmental pollution prevention according to loh et al 102 there are efforts being made to fully recover the different potential by products of palm oil milling which are produced in large quantities especially pome for integration into the food energy water nexus 4 1 biohydrogen and biogas raw pome or freshly discharged pome has proven to be a suitable substrate for biogas production via anaerobic digestion ad process ad involves degradation of pome via microorganisms with the absence of o2 generating biogas digestate potential biofertilizer and less polluted pome effluent the disadvantages of applying ad process in pome treatment are long hrt and long start up period 23 24 103 for that reason many researchers have introduced a prior stage for ad that is the production of biohydrogen through dark fermentation 101 104 105 high energy yield could be obtained by full utilization of organic matter in pome during the water reclamation process the energy required for processes such as thermal treatment membrane separation and heating in integrated zero discharge systems could be provided by the obtained biogas noting that the lower heating value lhv for h2 and ch4 are 120 and 50 mj kg respectively while the lhv for gasoline is 44 5 mj kg table 5 shows the anaerobic digestion of pome and the energy generated from capturing the biogas produced clearly single stage ad is not enough for clean water reclamation a pre or post treatment steps are required furthermore microbial fuel cell mfc are known to produce biogas from pome using a combined concept of anaerobic and aerobic chambers that are divided by a membrane where microorganisms are used as biocatalyst to transform the chemical energy stored in pome to electrical energy 103 however water reclamation using mfc is not satisfactory for example only 64 4 cod could be removed from pre treated pome with biogas of 1040 ml for 624 h 106 a maximum cod efficiency removal was 58 by using klebsiella variicola as the inoculum in mfc 107 4 2 biofertilizer pome is a rich source of npk nutrients the recovered nutrients from pome during the treatment processes could be used as a low cost biofertilizer to replace the widely used chemical fertilizers according to 93 treated pome is safe to be used as an organic fertilizer since it contains low level of heavy metal elements and high amounts of nutrients such as fe k ca mg and p in another study pome precipitate were tested in a set of pot trial tests using scindapsus aureus the ratio of bod cod of pome was around 2 58 meaning that high amount of organic material are readily degradable particularly mg n o and p the observed plant growth was superior as compared to the commercially available chemical fertilizer 113 a dried and dewatered pome sludge was considered as fertilizer in a biogas production plant and contributed to the project s main revenue 108 in a study conducted by 102 a comparison was made between anaerobically treated and untreated raw pome as an organic fertilizer supplemented with chicken manure for ipomoea aquatica kangkung growth by pot assay treated pome showed superior results compared to raw pome in terms of greater fresh biomass 50 increment plant height and leaves number in treatment which was reasoned to the high residual oil content 12 6 g l in raw pome that caused retarded plant growth nonetheless overdose of the treated pome fertilizer may contrarily affect the plant growth due to the presence of volatile fatty acid higher than 0 58 g l the stud estimated that 1 t of treated solid pome can be obtained from 20 m3of liquid pome 1 72 t of food vegetable would be produced from a total of 2 t blend of treated pome chicken manure fertilizer 1 1 t ha further renewable energy in a form of biogas could be produced 306 m3 biogas that results in avoiding 3 7 t co2eq from being released to the atmosphere therefore anaerobically treated pome from integrated zero discharge systems can be recovered and conditionally mixed other naturally occurring material and separated from water as an organic fertilizer through dewatering and drying process this will help overcome the high cost of chemical fertilizer used in cultivation 5 techno economic analysis tea at the research and development stage tea is performed to test the potential of economic feasibility of the proposed technologies it regulates the potential of process s real time tea of water recovery from various wastewaters have been extensively studied in literature that can be used to estimate the economic feasibility of pome treatment since it shares similar properties with the studied wastewaters 114 since desalination is thermal and pressure driven processes energy is the most important parameter in tea in general the cost of water reuse program from wastewaters is affected by several factors 115 that could be applied specifically in the case of pome these factors include the location of a reclaimed water source inside the palm oil mill treatment infrastructure based on the adopted method pome quality customer use requirements boiler water quality transmission and pumping timing and storage needs energy requirements concentrate disposal treatment of value added biomass permitting and financing costs evidently the energy source is the most influencing factor in the water production cost from wastewater using membrane separation for instance waste heat reduced the water cost by 71 and 55 compared to electricity and fuel oil burning respectively when using water gap md 116 in a similar finding the produced water cost was reduced by 87 after applying waste heat as thermal source in dcmd 117 the heat exchange equipment and storage tanks occupied must of the capital cost whereby thermal energy was the major cost for the operation and maintenance costs attaching solar energy as a thermal source for multi effect desalination has been suggested to reduce the cost of heating energy 118 the water production cost herein was 2 251usd m3 with an investments payback period of 5 738 years the water cost by this method was mainly affected by solar direct normal irradiation level land cost solar thermal field costs power block and labor costs the estimated fresh water production cost using fo ro and anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr system was 0 80 m3 for an open loop scheme maximizing water production 119 in another study by 120 a system of uf ro was used for water reclamation from municipal wastewater it was found that a higher influent flowrate can reduce the fresh water cost 0 57 m3 noting that uf operation required higher capex and opex compared to ro an fo md system was introduced to treat the effluent of anaerobically digested wastewater the electricity produced from methane in ad was 0 52 kwh m3 that is 100 times higher than the energy required for fo md system the clean water cost was 1 29 usd m3 future research must focus on reducing the membrane price to achieve price competitiveness with other methods 121 water recovery from pome greatly reduces the production cost of obtaining products with maximum efficiency each of the three reviewed methods of water recovery from pome has its own pros and cons that must be considered before going to from lab scale to the larger scale applications table 6 lists a comparison of the methods addressed in this study 6 challenges and future perspectives process control of integrated biological treatment system is considered challenging to list a few of these challenges the long start up periods sensitivity of microorganisms to internal and external factors and fluctuation in pome characteristics based on seasonal production 103 to avoid system failure and the extra labor and maintenance costs a prior treatment stage may be introduce to control the organic loading rate and shorten the start up period biological processes are usually associated by biogas generation the treatment plant must be designed to fully capture the generated gases as reported by 123 in a scenario of all palm oil mills in malaysia to capture the biogas a total of 1750 million m3 biogas with ghg savings of 19 5 million t co2eq can be achieved yearly this industry can supplement nation s energy mix with 540 mw of installed capacity in the form of bio compressed natural gas or biomethane in light of that many palm oil mills in malaysia are under planning of biogas plant installation however due to high capital cost and no strict regulations and enforcement the growth is relatively slow 103 through membrane process a high quality of water can be supplied in larger quantities and in shorter time as compared to the conventional biological treatment methods however most of the reported studies of pome membrane studies were tested in laboratory or pilot scale to investigate the impact of operating conditions large scale studies covering industrial water recovery from pome by the different membrane designs is still limited and hence represents a promising area for future research the evaporation technology presented by alfa laval with decanting stage requires high consumption of energy as compared to other discussed methods but in terms of operating time water quality simple pre treatment and maintenance cost it showed attractive outcome as far as recycling and reclamation of water from pome was concerned henceforth life cycle assessment optimization and techno economic analysis are suggested for its application in commercially scaled designs 7 conclusions this review provides an overview of the recent methods applied to obtain clean water from pome the objective of each of the discussed method was to achieve water in quality of drinking water or as boilers feed water understanding the characteristics of this type of wastewater is important in the selection of the right method to minimize the dependency on pre treatment step the recovered by products helps in achieving zero discharge system for environmental pollution prevention and in reducing the costs of pome treatment to maximize potential of the proposed methods for clean water reclamation from pome future research studies must focus on the performance of the thermal processes and reducing the cost of membranes in hybrid systems to be cost competitive with other technologies for water reclamation

12519,oxytetracycline otc is widespread in the environment posing potential ecological health risks this work aimed to develop a bioremediation system that can biotransform and detoxify continuous otc bearing streams an otc removing organism achromobacter sp onk was isolated from activated sludge enriched with otc onk removed otc via co metabolic biotransformation a series of batch experiments were performed to determine the biotransformation kinetics 1 5 2 1 d 1 at varying levels of otc and the optimal operating conditions i e 2 0 g l biomass and 0 2 g l glucose as a carbon source for otc removal a bioremediation system for treating continuous otc streams was developed by immobilizing onk using a natural alginate polymer the immobilized onk bioremediation system demonstrated a 60 removal of otc with a hydraulic retention time of 10 h and detoxified otc using two novel transformation pathways that were validated by both structure based modeling and experimental results this study has practical implications for the development of an effective bioremediation process for detoxifying pharmaceutical waste streams graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biotransformation detoxification cell immobilization biocomposite bioremediation system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction oxytetracycline otc is one of the most commonly used tetracycline antibiotics worldwide tetracycline antibiotics have been produced on a large scale and have been widely used in human clinical settings the livestock industry and aquaculture and otc is consequently ubiquitous in various natural and engineered aquatic settings 1 environmental levels of detectable otc vary significantly typically ranging from nanograms to milligrams per liter in aquatic environments in particular otc has been measured at concentrations of up to 15 μg l in surface water 2 and up to 97 μg l with a 100 detection frequency in rivers 3 while it is rarely detected or is only found at very low levels i e less than micrograms per liter in groundwater given the levels of otc detected in natural environments and its predicted no effect concentrations pnecs from 2 7 to 72 μg l 4 otc poses environmental health risks to aquatic ecosystems otc has broad spectrum antibacterial activity and its known mode of action involves the inhibition of protein synthesis translation preventing cell growth multiplication 5 exposure to otc has been found to significantly interfere with cellular growth and the microcystin metabolic activity of microcystis aeruginosa at 31 μg l of no observed effect concentration noec 6 meanwhile otc has toxicological consequences for the growth and membrane functionality of chlorella vulgaris and increases cellular oxidative stress e g generating reactive oxygen species in many aquatic organisms e g oncorhynchus danio rerio and chlorella 4 these ecological risks are illustrated by the high risk quotient values 1 5 36 1 which is the ratio of measured environmental concentrations to the ecotoxicity thresholds e g pnecs 1 4 given its widespread use in a variety of settings the majority of otc enters engineered systems such as wastewater treatment plants wwtps very high levels of otc have been detected in pharmaceutical up to 2 4 mg l 7 aquaculture 0 3 0 5 mg l 3 8 and livestock up to 0 2 0 6 mg l 9 waste streams as with many other micropollutants the anthropogenic release is the major source of otc in the environment 10 thus it must be effectively treated before the discharge of wastewater while various chemical processes such as adsorption 11 oxidation 9 units and biological processes 9 can be used to reduce otc levels the removal rates in wwtps are largely unpredictable and often unsatisfactory in addition to abiotic routes e g photohydrolysis and adsorption biodegradation or biotransformation is a significant otc removal route in many municipal and industrial wwtps 12 because biological treatment is considered a cost effective and environmentally benign remediation option 13 it is important to understand the mechanisms involved in the biological breakdown of otc and the potential for incorporating biological degradation into the design and operation of engineered bioremediation systems several studies have made progress in understanding the microbial transformation of otc identifying seven isolates capable of transforming otc xanthobacter 14 burkholderia 15 pandoraea 16 pseudomonas 17 ochrobactrum 18 arthrobacter 19 and planococcus 20 a few major transformation products and pathways have been proposed with three of these isolates pandoraea pseudomonas and arthrobacter 16 17 19 and environmental factors affecting otc transformation characteristics including ph temperature and macro micronutrients have also been reported while previous studies have revealed the physiological characteristics of otc degrading microorganisms little effort has been made to develop engineering applications based on these full scale wwtps operate in continuous flow mode where the incoming stream must be treated within the given hydraulic retention time hrt thus it is important to determine whether it is technically feasible to employ the micropollutant biodegradation capability of microorganisms in a bioremediation system particularly because many microorganisms have slow growth characteristics with a doubling time that is longer than the typical hrt 13 21 in particular whether otc biotransformation can be completed for a given hrt and whether the transformation products are less toxic than the original compound need to be systematically assessed based on this gap in the current knowledge this study attempted to design and test a bioremediation system that utilizes a novel otc metabolizing microorganism first a microbial agent capable of removing otc was enriched and isolated from activated sludge as phylogenetic and phenotypic e g otc metabolic capabilities analysis of the microbial agent was performed a cell immobilization strategy using natural polymers was then used to develop a bioremediation system treating otc the operating parameters were also tested to optimize the metabolism of otc the results of which were incorporated into the design of the engineered bioremediation system liquid chromatography analysis was conducted to determine the biological transformation products and their associated pathways based on this analysis results quantitative structure activity relationship qsar modeling predicted that the otc bearing waste streams would be rendered less toxic by the proposed bioremediation system and this was validated using antimicrobial susceptibility experiments taken together the results of this study have practical implications for the design of engineered bioremediation systems that can effectively manage waste streams contaminated with pharmaceuticals 2 materials and methods 2 1 enrichment and phylogenetic analysis of an otc degrading bacteria a bioreactor with a working volume of 1 0 l was inoculated with as obtained from a local municipal wwtp in korea the enrichment bioreactor was fed by a synthetic feed containing otc with an hrt of 7 d as previously reported 22 the feed consisted of 2 5 mg l otc 1 8 g l glucose and other components 0 09 g l kh2po4 0 67 g l k2hpo4 0 05 g l

chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich in korea after 1 month of enrichment a mixed liquor sample was taken from the bioreactor and spread onto an agar plate with the same feed after several transfers to new plates for purification the resulting colonies were added to a liquid broth medium with the same composition as the feed the 16s rrna gene 8f 1492r of the pure culture was sequenced using standard sanger sequencing at biofact korea mixed liquor suspension samples were taken from the enrichment culture from which dna was extracted the hypervariable region v3 v5 of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using pcr and sequenced using miseq as described by oh and kim 24 mothur analysis was conducted to determine the operational taxonomic units otus of the community and their taxonomic classification as described previously 25 2 2 assessment of otc removal routes kinetics and characteristics to determine the potential otc removal routes using an otc removing organism designated onk four batch flasks were established under different experimental conditions as described previously 26 abiotic og inactive og active o and active og the designation was made considering the environmental conditions such as abiotic no cell active live cell and inactive autoclaved cell and the carbon sources such as o otc and og otc and glucose used in each bath experiment both the active og and active o were inoculated with a 10 v v active onk pre culture the inactive og contained autoclaved onk with the same inoculum biomass while the abiotic og did not contain onk before inoculation the onk inoculum was pre cultured centrifuged and washed twice using 1 phosphate buffered saline pbs as performed previously 27 all batch flasks were covered with aluminum foil and incubated under moderate shaking 150 rpm at room temperature the otc removal rate was calculated using the first order reaction rate eq 1 1 k 1 ln ct co δt where k 1 is the first order rate constant t is the interval time and c t and c o indicate the otc concentration at time t and 0 respectively the otc concentration was quantified using high performance liquid chromatography hplc system yl9100plus young lin instrument co korea following an analytical method that has been described previously 28 the injected volume and the sample flow rate were 0 1 ml and 1 ml min respectively the mobile phase was composed of 82 v v of 2 mm nah2po4 at ph 2 5 adjusted with acid phosphoric acid and 18 of acetonitrile the detection wavelength for otc was 256 nm with 0 05 mg l of the quantification limit a liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry lc ms system qqq lc ms 6410 series agilent technologies usa operating in electrospray ionization esi positive ion mode with a c18 column was used to determine the otc transformation products as previously described 29 this analysis was conducted at a temperature of 350 c a voltage of 4 kv a nebulizer pressure of 30 psi and a nitrogen flow rate of 6 l min the mobile phase consisted of 90 formic acid 0 1 mixed with 10 pure acetonitrile chem3d ultra 16 0 was used to illustrate the chemical structure the chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved organic carbon doc and volatile suspended solids vss were measured using the standard methods 30 the cell growth rate was measured using a uv vis spectrometer hach dr2500 as the optical density at a wavelength of 600 nm od600 statistical testing of differences between treatment groups was conducted using mann whitney u tests 2 3 development of an immobilized cell bioremediation system for otc removal fully grown onk cells incubated with the synthetic feed overnight were used for cell immobilization sodium alginate sa sigma aldrich in korea and onk cells 8 w v were combined by mixing suspended onk cells 4 with sa 4 the sa cell mixture was dropped via a syringe needle at a flow rate of 2 0 ml min into a sterile 5 cacl2 w v solution which was mixed well with a magnetic stirrer 400 rpm to produce round alginate beads that encapsulated and immobilized the onk cells fig s1 two separate bioremediation systems with a working volume of 1 l were established one with immobilized onk ri and the other with free onk cells rf and their otc removal rates were compared fig s2 the systems were operated in continuous flow mode with an hrt of 10 h the feed solution containing otc 2 5 mg l and glucose 0 2 g l continuously entered at a flow rate of 100 ml h and effluent was continuously decanted at the same rate ri has a fill rate of 30 for the onk biocomposite beads and its performance was compared with that of rf with the same amount of biomass effluent samples from both reactors were taken every day and the cell growth doc and otc concentration were monitored for the entire operating period 2 4 otc detoxification by the bioremediation system experimental observations and modeling predictions water samples were collected from 0 1 m below the surface of the receiving water of the wwtp effluent where onk originated the inhibitory effect on the heterotrophic growth of the mixed cultures taken from the receiving water body was quantified the mixed culture cells were washed twice with a pbs buffer and diluted to an od600 of 0 02 the cells were added to a control system in which mueller hinton broth mhb which consists of beef extract the acid hydrolysate of casein and starch in deionized water was used for cell growth mixed cultures were incubated overnight in an orbital shaker in triplicate at room temperature cell growth was measured using od600 cell growth data were fitted to a modified gompertz model as described previously 27 the potential toxicity of otc and its transformation derivatives were predicted based on qsar modeling using the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t 31 the qsar method predicts the toxicity threshold values for the 50 lethal concentration lc50 for fathead minnow fish over 96 h based on a given chemical formula 3 results and discussion 3 1 enrichment isolation and phylogenetic identification of the otc removing microorganism the mixed as culture was enriched in an enrichment reactor using the otc feed with 2 5 mg l otc and 1 8 g l glucose as the carbon sources the mixed culture suspension was spread on agar plates with the same feed after several transfers of the colonies to new agar plates the resulting isolate was added to a liquid broth with the same feed the otc concentrations were significantly lower with an increase in the od600 of the isolate inoculated broth which indicated potential otc metabolism a 16s rrna gene based phylogenetic tree was constructed to determine the taxonomic affiliation of the isolate and its phylogenetic relationship with other known otc degraders fig 1a the isolate shared a 97 nucleotide identity with achromobacter spp illustrating that it was affiliated with the achromobacter genus taxonomic analysis of the enrichment community using mothur identified two otus related to achromobacter the isolate exhibited a 99 nucleotide identity with otu 12039 and otu 23761 suggesting that they were the same species onk was shown to be distantly related to other known otc degraders pandoraea ochrobactrum planococcus xanthobacter and arthrobacter with a 90 nucleotide identity the isolate obtained in this study was thus designated as achromobacter sp onk achromobacter is a member of the alcaligenaceae family members of this genus are non motile rod shaped and gram negative and are found in a variety of habitats from natural waters to soil environments 32 the achromobacter reference strains closely related to onk 98 identity occur in natural a aegrifacien 33 engineered a sp w 1 34 aquatic systems and contaminated soil environments a xylosoxidans 35 this diverse range of habitats is indicative of the metabolic versatility of achromobacter populations including their broad spectrum resistance and degradation capabilities associated antimicrobials 36 bacterial isolates known to have otc metabolism have been obtained from as pandoraea arthrobacter and ochrobactrum 16 18 19 swine wastewater xanthobacter 14 pig manure burkholderia 15 aquacultural wastewater planococcus 20 and contaminated soil pseudomonas 17 onk exhibited a distant phylogenetic relatedness to other otc degraders 90 identity suggesting that its otc catabolic capabilities are potentially distinct from known otc degraders 3 2 otc removal routes kinetics and characteristics using onk the otc removal characteristics of onk were evaluated under four experimental conditions abiotic og inactive og active o and active og fig 1b and c the otc levels decreased by 27 after 2 h in the active og and the otc was completely removed within 24 h the active og also exhibited a gradual decrease in the cod 64 in 48 h while the od600 significantly increased from 0 06 to 0 39 the doubling time for onk in the active og estimated using od600 was 17 h the first order otc removal rate for active og condition was 3 47 d 1 although the abiotic og contained no onk biomass some otc was removed 1 41 d 1 likely due to natural decay e g hydrolysis and other abiotic routes the inactive og contained autoclaved cells and exhibited a higher otc removal rate 2 0 d 1 than the abiotic og flask which could be the result of biosorption i e adsorption to the inactive cells in addition to abiotic losses the active o which contained active onk cells and otc as the sole carbon and energy source has a comparable no statistical significance with p 0 05 otc removal rate 1 93 d 1 to that of the inactive og condition while it was significantly less p 0 05 than that of active og 3 47 d 1 these results suggested no significant primary metabolism of otc as a sole carbon source but co metabolic removal of otc as a secondary substrate only with another primary carbon source by onk collectively these results showed that 1 onk could grow by catabolizing otc via a co metabolic rather than a primary metabolic route and 2 onk removed otc about three times faster than natural decay to produce a half life of 0 2 d contaminants such as industrial and pharmaceutical chemicals released into the environment are subjected to various breakdown routes via biotic and abiotic reactions the natural decay rate of otc varies significantly because it is affected by a number of environmental factors e g ph and temperature for example the methyl group at the c6 position of otc fig s3 is highly unstable and reactive natural decay often involves the interaction between the c6 methyl and c6 hydroxyl groups and the subsequent reaction with hydrogen at c5a releasing h2o 16 the half life of otc in soil environments is 19 56 d longer than that observed in aquatic environments such as fresh water 2 4 d seawater 7 12 d and wastewater 3 7 d 14 37 given the environmentally relevant and maximum levels of otc μg l to mg l and the pnec 2 7 72 μg l 4 8 it can take days to weeks to naturally reduce otc down to non toxic levels in many otc contaminated environments 1 meaning that remediation actions are required the half life of otc with onk was 0 2 d much shorter than the 0 5 d for the abiotic conditions observed in the present study and the 2 46 d for natural decay 37 further the half life of otc with onk was significantly lower than that of other previously characterized isolates such as pandoraea 6 d ochrobactrum 2 5 d arthrobacter 4 d pseudomonas 10 d xanthobacter 5 6 d planococcus 2 13 d and burkholderia 12 d overall the onk population observed in this study was found to have greater potential for removing otc compared to other known otc degraders many environmental parameters can control the fate and removal rate of otc including the biomass initial otc and primary carbon source levels as such the operating parameters that could potentially affect the otc co metabolism kinetics of onk were examined first five batch flasks were established with biomass concentrations of 0 abiotic 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 g vss l fig 2a the removal rate with 0 5 g l onk was comparable to that of the abiotic flask increasing the biomass from 0 5 to 2 0 g l gradually increased the removal rate from 1 92 to 2 16 d 1 while 4 0 g l biomass did not increase the rate any further the biomass concentration of 2 4 gvss l which led to high otc removal rates was comparable to that employed in many full scale biological wwtps 1 4 gvss l because onk only catabolized otc in the presence of another primary carbon source the effects of the concentration of the primary carbon source on the otc removal rate were investigated revealing that 200 mg l glucose was the optimal level for co metabolism this concentration of glucose exhibited the highest otc removal rate fig 2b which was equivalent to 213 mg cod l and comparable to that in many municipal wastewater influents 300 500 mg cod l the effects of the initial otc concentration 0 5 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mg l were also tested the first order otc removal rate decreased from 2 1 d 1 to 1 5 d 1 when the otc increased from 0 5 mg l to 8 mg l fig 2c the concentration of a contaminant is found to affect its fate and removal rate in biological wastewater systems 38 while otc occurs at varying levels in the environment its environmentally relevant maxima is hundreds of micrograms per liter in contaminated surface water and streams impacted by aquacultural waste 3 8 the levels of otc tested in this study were similar to environmentally relevant levels while many previous studies have investigated very high levels of otc 10 100 mg l 16 18 19 that exceed environmentally relevant levels taken together these results identified the operational parameters that control the fate of otc and provided the foundation for the design of an onk based biological system for the removal of otc 3 3 development of an otc bioremediation system based on immobilized onk to design a bioremediation system using onk for otc removal a biocomposite entrapping onk in an alginate polymer matrix was synthesized first the effects of the sa cell concentration and the syringe needle diameter on the size and density of the biocomposite beads were examined the density of the biocomposite increased from 0 3 g cm3 to 1 2 g cm3 with an increase in the combined sa cell concentration from 1 to 8 w v fig 3a while the density of the biocomposite was highest 1 4 g cm3 with a 1 4 mm needle diameter followed by a 2 5 mm needle diameter 1 1 g cm3 fig 3b the 2 5 mm needle produced beads with a diameter of 4 5 mm which was comparable to many of the granular adsorbent and biocarrier additives used in wastewater systems thus this needle size was selected for cell immobilization in the present study the optimal synthesis conditions i e sa cell concentration of 8 and needle diameter of 2 5 mm led to large beads 4 5 mm with a density 1 1 g cm3 slightly higher than that of water this density was desirable because a less dense material would float on the water surface and be difficult to circulate even with mixers or aeration another important operational factor for the bioremediation system is the filling ratio of the biocomposite 39 because the filling ratio of biological additives significantly affects the biological performance 28 the otc removal rate was measured for a filling ratio of 7 5 to 60 and compared with the control which had no biocomposite fig 3c adding the biocomposite significantly enhanced otc removal 0 97 3 37 d 1 with the removal rate highest for a filling ratio of 30 the optimal filling ratio was comparable to the typical range for biocarriers used in many wastewater systems 20 50 40 two continuous bioreactor systems using onk were established to treat waste streams containing 2 5 mg l otc one with immobilized onk ri and the other with free onk cells rf both systems used a 30 filling ratio for the biocomposite and free cells respectively the optimized operating parameters e g 0 2 g l of primary carbon source 8 of sa cell biocomposite synthesized with 2 5 mm needle and 30 of biocomposite filling ratio for otc removal figs 2 and 3 were used for these systems the two systems were operated in a continuous stirred tank reactor with an hrt of 10 h which was comparable to the typical range for reactor systems 3 to 25 h 41 the two systems were run without onk for the first 48 h during which no significant changes in cell growth od600 and doc removal were observed fig 3d and e otc removal of 30 was observed without onk likely resulting from abiotic decay as observed in figs 1 and 2 and this was consistent with the 25 predicted based on the first order otc removal rate 1 4 d 1 the abiotic conditions and hrt onk was added as a biocomposite ri or free cells rf after 49 h which then led to significantly different results for the two systems high onk biomass levels od600 of 0 31 were observed at hour 49 in the rf effluent and this had rapidly decreased by hour 55 before leveling off at an od600 of 0 02 0 06 for hours 121 289 fig 3d in contrast the od600 values for the ri effluent were low 0 02 and comparable to that before the addition of the biocomposite these results indicated that the ri system successfully entrapped the onk while the free cells of onk were washed out the removal performance for otc and doc was significantly higher for ri than for rf fig 3e rf reduced otc by 55 and doc by 35 after 6 h after this temporary improvement the otc and doc removal efficiencies rapidly decreased returning back to those observed before inoculation 25 otc removal and 1 doc removal in contrast ri exhibited a stable system performance for the removal of otc and doc at levels much higher 63 and 85 respectively than those of rf the highly efficient performance of ri fig 3e and f was in a good agreement with the retention of the biocomposite shown in fig 3d these experimental results supported the potential for the use of an immobilized onk bioremediation strategy to treat otc the hrt is one of the most important design parameters for engineered biological systems treating continuous waste streams hrts of 3 to 25 h are typically employed in many full scale municipal industrial wwtps with different configurational units 41 to which the hrt of 10 h used in the present study was comparable employing microorganisms with a doubling time shorter than the hrt is not technically feasible due to cell wash out which was illustrated by the washout of the free cells observed in the present study onk was found to grow with a doubling time of 17 h much faster than that of other known otc degraders e g 28 h for ochrobactrum 21 h for burkholderia and 2 d for pseudomonas 15 17 18 in conventional as cas systems as cells are separated in a secondary settling tank some of which are recycled back to biological tanks this cell recycling strategy using the settling tank helps to retain slow growing microorganisms and maintain the high biomass levels within the system however the cell immobilization strategy proposed in the present study successfully retained the onk cells and maintained the desired functional performance and stability without the need for additional settling tanks because cell immobilization does not require additional cell cycling or separation e g membrane filtration systems it provides benefits for the design of engineered systems with lower capital and operating costs 3 4 biological detoxification of otc using the bioremediation system using batch experiments fig 1b hplc analysis was employed to identify shifts in the type and amount of otc and its possible derivatives fig s5 while the otc levels detected in the chromatogram after a retention time rt of 5 29 min were lower in the abiotic og the potential byproducts rt of 4 88 min of otc increased from hour 2 to hour 24 of interest was the removal of the byproducts in the active og after 24 h indicating biological removal activity a previous study detected 4 epi oxytetracycline eotc at an rt of 4 9 min 42 which was similar to the observations in the present study suggesting that eotc might be present as a transformation byproduct hence the byproducts of otc degradation detected in the hplc analysis were examined further using lc ms analysis of the ri and rf effluent after 241 h and the feed solution four peaks were observed in the chromatogram their specific m z and rts were summarized in table s1 in addition to otc m z 461 and an rt of 12 7 min the substances with m z 461 and 460 detected in the influent and the rf effluent were identified as eotc and c23h25no9 respectively as reported 43 eotc and c23h25no9 were thus classified as abiotic byproducts while c13h12o3 m z 198 and c13h23on m z 217 which were detected only in the ri effluent were classified as biological byproducts fig 4 other byproducts such as α apo otc and β apo otc were detected by li et al 44 and those detected with arthrobacter pandoraea and pseudomonas characterized previously are listed in table s1 for comparison based on the byproducts observed in the present and previous studies transformation pathways from otc were proposed fig 4 our results suggested three biotransformation or abiotic pathways for otc via dehydration epimerization and deamination methylation resulting in c22h22n2o8 eotc and c23h25no9 respectively otc is often dehydrated by losing an h2o molecule at the c5 and c6 positions i e the hydroxyl group forming c22h22n2o8 43 c22h22n2o8 was not detected in this study because it is highly unstable at a neutral ph or in weakly acidic solutions where spontaneous oxidation rapidly leads to the formation of α apo otc or β apo otc 44 c13h12o3 m z 217 was detected in lc ms analysis for biotic conditions with onk which might result from the fragmentation of α apo otc and β apo otc via enzymatic ring cleavage at the highly unstable c5 position through epimerization otc often transforms into eotc which has the same molar mass as otc but with a different orientation of the n ch3 2 functional group at the c4 position 43 eotc was present in the rf effluent but not in the ri effluent suggesting that it might undergo further biotransformation due to onk via ring cleavage achromobacter is capable of excreting dioxygenase 45 which cleaves the naphthol ring at the positions c5a and c11 potentially transforming eotc into c14h19o6 achromobacter also has an array of catalytic enzymes e g laccase 46 that are involved in demethylation which might transform the n ch3 2 functional group of c14h19o6 into c12h23no m z 198 the third pathway proposed in this study involved c23h25no9 which has not been reported in previous studies c23h25no9 could result from the abiotic deamination and methylation of otc the presence of c23h25no9 in both the synthetic feed and the rf effluent was suggestive of abiotic transformation but further studies are required to determine the exact transformation reactions and pathways in summary while known otc degraders arthrobacter pandoraea and pseudomonas have biotransformation pathways associated with c21h24n2o7 c12h10o4 and c21h28n2o8 16 17 19 the present study proposed new pathways for onk the toxicity of otc and its byproducts were estimated using the qsar method table s1 the predicted lc50 values for otc and its derivatives varied by about two orders of magnitude in general the transformation products showed high lc50 values i e a low toxicity compared to otc the otc transformation products c13h12o3 and c13h23on from the activity of onk had a toxicity that was 10 20 times lower than otc however eotc and c23h25no9 had toxicities that were similar to or even higher than otc table s2 therefore the results suggested that although byproducts from onk mediated degradation of otc can be less toxic the transformation of otc via other biotic abiotic pathways may not necessarily reduce the toxicity the byproducts may pose environmental risks of their own and or they may cause more serious ecological consequences due to their synergistic toxicological interactions 5 the degree of the toxicity predicted based on the molecular structure of the byproducts was also tested experimentally microbial samples were taken from 0 1 m below the surface of the water receiving effluent from the wwtp where the onk was sourced from the maximum growth and lag phase of the cultures were estimated using a modified gompertz model for the otc containing influent the influent without otc control and the effluents from rf and ri fig 5 the cellular growth in the otc influent and the rf effluent was significantly lower by 40 and 26 respectively in contrast the growth for the ri effluent was comparable to that of the control influent strongly indicating biological detoxification for heterotrophic growth compared to the control influent and ri effluent the rf effluent required a longer lag phase period for cell growth confirming the inhibitory effects of the rf effluent collectively the low toxicity of the onk transformed products predicted according to their molecular structure was experimentally validated using susceptibility testing providing robust evidence for biotransformation enabled detoxification within the onk mediated bioremediation system 3 5 immobilized onk bioremediation system practical implications and future outlook in any bioremediation system it is important to recognize that although the target contaminant can be successfully degraded via physicochemical and biological reactions the resulting byproducts may have comparable or even higher toxicity than the original contaminant the transformation of original contaminants does not necessarily lead to detoxification 47 for instance the metabolic intermediates 4 aminophenol hydroquinone and benzoquinone of acetaminophen a drug often used for reducing fever with covid 19 can be more toxic for heterotrophic cell growth and nitrification metabolic activity 13 27 otc derivatives are of particular environmental concern because about 70 80 of the otc ingested by humans animals and fish is excreted e g in urine as its original form or as byproducts 5 while a relative wealth of data on the environmental occurrence and toxicity of otc is currently available little is known about otc byproducts a few studies reported transformation products from otc produced by microbial isolates table s1 while the transformation products from arthrobacter and pandoraea were in general less toxic than otc based on qsar modeling the c22h21no9 produced by pseudomonas was found to be potentially eight times more toxic than otc in comparison to known otc degraders onk had novel otc biotransformation pathways that differ from previously characterized routes and led to detoxification in addition onk had a higher otc removal rate a half life of 0 2 d than other known degraders 2 12 d and a shorter doubling time 0 7 d and 1 2 d respectively from an engineering perspective these characteristics are advantageous desirable for the design of bioremediation systems because the use of onk can reduce the hrt and or solid rt thus helping to reduce the overall system volume and consequently the operating and capital costs while pseudomonas burkholderia and xanthorobacter are capable of degrading otc as a sole carbon source i e primary metabolism the removal routes for otc with other isolates pandoraea ochrobactrum arthrobacter and planococcus remain to be clarified 16 18 20 the systematic assessment of the removal routes in the present study suggested that onk employs the co metabolic degradation of otc rather than primary metabolism co metabolism involves the degradation of a substance in the presence of another primary substrate stimulating the growth of the organism 21 the co metabolic capabilities of onk for otc highlighted its potential use as a bioremediation or bioaugmentation agent for otc contaminated waste streams in which various heterogeneous carbon sources other than otc are available many of the environmental settings in which otc biological detoxification is required e g wastewater and contaminated soil water offer a range of organic matter that can act as a primary carbon source with the fluctuating presence of otc in trace amounts in these settings otc degraders with a co metabolic capability such as onk may have high selective fitness achromobacter has a diverse range of habitats fig 1a and is characterized by a large genome with an array of accessory metabolic genes indicating their metabolic versatility 32 collectively our results illustrated that achromobacter sp onk has great potential as a robust microbial agent for bioaugmentation and or bioremediation systems at various otc contaminated sites this study thus suggested future research that systematically assesses the operating factors that optimize onk bioaugmentation or bioremediation for pilot and full scale systems at otc contaminated sites further onk is phylogenetically and taxonomically distinguishable from known otc degraders and has novel biotransformation pathways accordingly future genomic and transcriptomic investigations will help to determine the genetic determinants and molecular regulatory networks associated with otc metabolism 4 conclusions achromobacter sp onk was isolated and taxonomically and phenotypically characterized in terms of its otc metabolism onk catabolized otc via co metabolism with two distinct biotransformation pathways operational i e carbon source biomass and otc levels and cell immobilization i e sa cell concentration needle diameter and filling ratio conditions were optimized to enhance otc biotransformation using these design factors an immobilized onk bioremediation system was developed to treat continuous otc streams with a typical hrt 10h the immobilized onk bioremediation system achieved the biotransformation enabled detoxification of otc which was validated

12519,oxytetracycline otc is widespread in the environment posing potential ecological health risks this work aimed to develop a bioremediation system that can biotransform and detoxify continuous otc bearing streams an otc removing organism achromobacter sp onk was isolated from activated sludge enriched with otc onk removed otc via co metabolic biotransformation a series of batch experiments were performed to determine the biotransformation kinetics 1 5 2 1 d 1 at varying levels of otc and the optimal operating conditions i e 2 0 g l biomass and 0 2 g l glucose as a carbon source for otc removal a bioremediation system for treating continuous otc streams was developed by immobilizing onk using a natural alginate polymer the immobilized onk bioremediation system demonstrated a 60 removal of otc with a hydraulic retention time of 10 h and detoxified otc using two novel transformation pathways that were validated by both structure based modeling and experimental results this study has practical implications for the development of an effective bioremediation process for detoxifying pharmaceutical waste streams graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biotransformation detoxification cell immobilization biocomposite bioremediation system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction oxytetracycline otc is one of the most commonly used tetracycline antibiotics worldwide tetracycline antibiotics have been produced on a large scale and have been widely used in human clinical settings the livestock industry and aquaculture and otc is consequently ubiquitous in various natural and engineered aquatic settings 1 environmental levels of detectable otc vary significantly typically ranging from nanograms to milligrams per liter in aquatic environments in particular otc has been measured at concentrations of up to 15 μg l in surface water 2 and up to 97 μg l with a 100 detection frequency in rivers 3 while it is rarely detected or is only found at very low levels i e less than micrograms per liter in groundwater given the levels of otc detected in natural environments and its predicted no effect concentrations pnecs from 2 7 to 72 μg l 4 otc poses environmental health risks to aquatic ecosystems otc has broad spectrum antibacterial activity and its known mode of action involves the inhibition of protein synthesis translation preventing cell growth multiplication 5 exposure to otc has been found to significantly interfere with cellular growth and the microcystin metabolic activity of microcystis aeruginosa at 31 μg l of no observed effect concentration noec 6 meanwhile otc has toxicological consequences for the growth and membrane functionality of chlorella vulgaris and increases cellular oxidative stress e g generating reactive oxygen species in many aquatic organisms e g oncorhynchus danio rerio and chlorella 4 these ecological risks are illustrated by the high risk quotient values 1 5 36 1 which is the ratio of measured environmental concentrations to the ecotoxicity thresholds e g pnecs 1 4 given its widespread use in a variety of settings the majority of otc enters engineered systems such as wastewater treatment plants wwtps very high levels of otc have been detected in pharmaceutical up to 2 4 mg l 7 aquaculture 0 3 0 5 mg l 3 8 and livestock up to 0 2 0 6 mg l 9 waste streams as with many other micropollutants the anthropogenic release is the major source of otc in the environment 10 thus it must be effectively treated before the discharge of wastewater while various chemical processes such as adsorption 11 oxidation 9 units and biological processes 9 can be used to reduce otc levels the removal rates in wwtps are largely unpredictable and often unsatisfactory in addition to abiotic routes e g photohydrolysis and adsorption biodegradation or biotransformation is a significant otc removal route in many municipal and industrial wwtps 12 because biological treatment is considered a cost effective and environmentally benign remediation option 13 it is important to understand the mechanisms involved in the biological breakdown of otc and the potential for incorporating biological degradation into the design and operation of engineered bioremediation systems several studies have made progress in understanding the microbial transformation of otc identifying seven isolates capable of transforming otc xanthobacter 14 burkholderia 15 pandoraea 16 pseudomonas 17 ochrobactrum 18 arthrobacter 19 and planococcus 20 a few major transformation products and pathways have been proposed with three of these isolates pandoraea pseudomonas and arthrobacter 16 17 19 and environmental factors affecting otc transformation characteristics including ph temperature and macro micronutrients have also been reported while previous studies have revealed the physiological characteristics of otc degrading microorganisms little effort has been made to develop engineering applications based on these full scale wwtps operate in continuous flow mode where the incoming stream must be treated within the given hydraulic retention time hrt thus it is important to determine whether it is technically feasible to employ the micropollutant biodegradation capability of microorganisms in a bioremediation system particularly because many microorganisms have slow growth characteristics with a doubling time that is longer than the typical hrt 13 21 in particular whether otc biotransformation can be completed for a given hrt and whether the transformation products are less toxic than the original compound need to be systematically assessed based on this gap in the current knowledge this study attempted to design and test a bioremediation system that utilizes a novel otc metabolizing microorganism first a microbial agent capable of removing otc was enriched and isolated from activated sludge as phylogenetic and phenotypic e g otc metabolic capabilities analysis of the microbial agent was performed a cell immobilization strategy using natural polymers was then used to develop a bioremediation system treating otc the operating parameters were also tested to optimize the metabolism of otc the results of which were incorporated into the design of the engineered bioremediation system liquid chromatography analysis was conducted to determine the biological transformation products and their associated pathways based on this analysis results quantitative structure activity relationship qsar modeling predicted that the otc bearing waste streams would be rendered less toxic by the proposed bioremediation system and this was validated using antimicrobial susceptibility experiments taken together the results of this study have practical implications for the design of engineered bioremediation systems that can effectively manage waste streams contaminated with pharmaceuticals 2 materials and methods 2 1 enrichment and phylogenetic analysis of an otc degrading bacteria a bioreactor with a working volume of 1 0 l was inoculated with as obtained from a local municipal wwtp in korea the enrichment bioreactor was fed by a synthetic feed containing otc with an hrt of 7 d as previously reported 22 the feed consisted of 2 5 mg l otc 1 8 g l glucose and other components 0 09 g l kh2po4 0 67 g l k2hpo4 0 05 g l

chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich in korea after 1 month of enrichment a mixed liquor sample was taken from the bioreactor and spread onto an agar plate with the same feed after several transfers to new plates for purification the resulting colonies were added to a liquid broth medium with the same composition as the feed the 16s rrna gene 8f 1492r of the pure culture was sequenced using standard sanger sequencing at biofact korea mixed liquor suspension samples were taken from the enrichment culture from which dna was extracted the hypervariable region v3 v5 of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using pcr and sequenced using miseq as described by oh and kim 24 mothur analysis was conducted to determine the operational taxonomic units otus of the community and their taxonomic classification as described previously 25 2 2 assessment of otc removal routes kinetics and characteristics to determine the potential otc removal routes using an otc removing organism designated onk four batch flasks were established under different experimental conditions as described previously 26 abiotic og inactive og active o and active og the designation was made considering the environmental conditions such as abiotic no cell active live cell and inactive autoclaved cell and the carbon sources such as o otc and og otc and glucose used in each bath experiment both the active og and active o were inoculated with a 10 v v active onk pre culture the inactive og contained autoclaved onk with the same inoculum biomass while the abiotic og did not contain onk before inoculation the onk inoculum was pre cultured centrifuged and washed twice using 1 phosphate buffered saline pbs as performed previously 27 all batch flasks were covered with aluminum foil and incubated under moderate shaking 150 rpm at room temperature the otc removal rate was calculated using the first order reaction rate eq 1 1 k 1 ln ct co δt where k 1 is the first order rate constant t is the interval time and c t and c o indicate the otc concentration at time t and 0 respectively the otc concentration was quantified using high performance liquid chromatography hplc system yl9100plus young lin instrument co korea following an analytical method that has been described previously 28 the injected volume and the sample flow rate were 0 1 ml and 1 ml min respectively the mobile phase was composed of 82 v v of 2 mm nah2po4 at ph 2 5 adjusted with acid phosphoric acid and 18 of acetonitrile the detection wavelength for otc was 256 nm with 0 05 mg l of the quantification limit a liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry lc ms system qqq lc ms 6410 series agilent technologies usa operating in electrospray ionization esi positive ion mode with a c18 column was used to determine the otc transformation products as previously described 29 this analysis was conducted at a temperature of 350 c a voltage of 4 kv a nebulizer pressure of 30 psi and a nitrogen flow rate of 6 l min the mobile phase consisted of 90 formic acid 0 1 mixed with 10 pure acetonitrile chem3d ultra 16 0 was used to illustrate the chemical structure the chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved organic carbon doc and volatile suspended solids vss were measured using the standard methods 30 the cell growth rate was measured using a uv vis spectrometer hach dr2500 as the optical density at a wavelength of 600 nm od600 statistical testing of differences between treatment groups was conducted using mann whitney u tests 2 3 development of an immobilized cell bioremediation system for otc removal fully grown onk cells incubated with the synthetic feed overnight were used for cell immobilization sodium alginate sa sigma aldrich in korea and onk cells 8 w v were combined by mixing suspended onk cells 4 with sa 4 the sa cell mixture was dropped via a syringe needle at a flow rate of 2 0 ml min into a sterile 5 cacl2 w v solution which was mixed well with a magnetic stirrer 400 rpm to produce round alginate beads that encapsulated and immobilized the onk cells fig s1 two separate bioremediation systems with a working volume of 1 l were established one with immobilized onk ri and the other with free onk cells rf and their otc removal rates were compared fig s2 the systems were operated in continuous flow mode with an hrt of 10 h the feed solution containing otc 2 5 mg l and glucose 0 2 g l continuously entered at a flow rate of 100 ml h and effluent was continuously decanted at the same rate ri has a fill rate of 30 for the onk biocomposite beads and its performance was compared with that of rf with the same amount of biomass effluent samples from both reactors were taken every day and the cell growth doc and otc concentration were monitored for the entire operating period 2 4 otc detoxification by the bioremediation system experimental observations and modeling predictions water samples were collected from 0 1 m below the surface of the receiving water of the wwtp effluent where onk originated the inhibitory effect on the heterotrophic growth of the mixed cultures taken from the receiving water body was quantified the mixed culture cells were washed twice with a pbs buffer and diluted to an od600 of 0 02 the cells were added to a control system in which mueller hinton broth mhb which consists of beef extract the acid hydrolysate of casein and starch in deionized water was used for cell growth mixed cultures were incubated overnight in an orbital shaker in triplicate at room temperature cell growth was measured using od600 cell growth data were fitted to a modified gompertz model as described previously 27 the potential toxicity of otc and its transformation derivatives were predicted based on qsar modeling using the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t 31 the qsar method predicts the toxicity threshold values for the 50 lethal concentration lc50 for fathead minnow fish over 96 h based on a given chemical formula 3 results and discussion 3 1 enrichment isolation and phylogenetic identification of the otc removing microorganism the mixed as culture was enriched in an enrichment reactor using the otc feed with 2 5 mg l otc and 1 8 g l glucose as the carbon sources the mixed culture suspension was spread on agar plates with the same feed after several transfers of the colonies to new agar plates the resulting isolate was added to a liquid broth with the same feed the otc concentrations were significantly lower with an increase in the od600 of the isolate inoculated broth which indicated potential otc metabolism a 16s rrna gene based phylogenetic tree was constructed to determine the taxonomic affiliation of the isolate and its phylogenetic relationship with other known otc degraders fig 1a the isolate shared a 97 nucleotide identity with achromobacter spp illustrating that it was affiliated with the achromobacter genus taxonomic analysis of the enrichment community using mothur identified two otus related to achromobacter the isolate exhibited a 99 nucleotide identity with otu 12039 and otu 23761 suggesting that they were the same species onk was shown to be distantly related to other known otc degraders pandoraea ochrobactrum planococcus xanthobacter and arthrobacter with a 90 nucleotide identity the isolate obtained in this study was thus designated as achromobacter sp onk achromobacter is a member of the alcaligenaceae family members of this genus are non motile rod shaped and gram negative and are found in a variety of habitats from natural waters to soil environments 32 the achromobacter reference strains closely related to onk 98 identity occur in natural a aegrifacien 33 engineered a sp w 1 34 aquatic systems and contaminated soil environments a xylosoxidans 35 this diverse range of habitats is indicative of the metabolic versatility of achromobacter populations including their broad spectrum resistance and degradation capabilities associated antimicrobials 36 bacterial isolates known to have otc metabolism have been obtained from as pandoraea arthrobacter and ochrobactrum 16 18 19 swine wastewater xanthobacter 14 pig manure burkholderia 15 aquacultural wastewater planococcus 20 and contaminated soil pseudomonas 17 onk exhibited a distant phylogenetic relatedness to other otc degraders 90 identity suggesting that its otc catabolic capabilities are potentially distinct from known otc degraders 3 2 otc removal routes kinetics and characteristics using onk the otc removal characteristics of onk were evaluated under four experimental conditions abiotic og inactive og active o and active og fig 1b and c the otc levels decreased by 27 after 2 h in the active og and the otc was completely removed within 24 h the active og also exhibited a gradual decrease in the cod 64 in 48 h while the od600 significantly increased from 0 06 to 0 39 the doubling time for onk in the active og estimated using od600 was 17 h the first order otc removal rate for active og condition was 3 47 d 1 although the abiotic og contained no onk biomass some otc was removed 1 41 d 1 likely due to natural decay e g hydrolysis and other abiotic routes the inactive og contained autoclaved cells and exhibited a higher otc removal rate 2 0 d 1 than the abiotic og flask which could be the result of biosorption i e adsorption to the inactive cells in addition to abiotic losses the active o which contained active onk cells and otc as the sole carbon and energy source has a comparable no statistical significance with p 0 05 otc removal rate 1 93 d 1 to that of the inactive og condition while it was significantly less p 0 05 than that of active og 3 47 d 1 these results suggested no significant primary metabolism of otc as a sole carbon source but co metabolic removal of otc as a secondary substrate only with another primary carbon source by onk collectively these results showed that 1 onk could grow by catabolizing otc via a co metabolic rather than a primary metabolic route and 2 onk removed otc about three times faster than natural decay to produce a half life of 0 2 d contaminants such as industrial and pharmaceutical chemicals released into the environment are subjected to various breakdown routes via biotic and abiotic reactions the natural decay rate of otc varies significantly because it is affected by a number of environmental factors e g ph and temperature for example the methyl group at the c6 position of otc fig s3 is highly unstable and reactive natural decay often involves the interaction between the c6 methyl and c6 hydroxyl groups and the subsequent reaction with hydrogen at c5a releasing h2o 16 the half life of otc in soil environments is 19 56 d longer than that observed in aquatic environments such as fresh water 2 4 d seawater 7 12 d and wastewater 3 7 d 14 37 given the environmentally relevant and maximum levels of otc μg l to mg l and the pnec 2 7 72 μg l 4 8 it can take days to weeks to naturally reduce otc down to non toxic levels in many otc contaminated environments 1 meaning that remediation actions are required the half life of otc with onk was 0 2 d much shorter than the 0 5 d for the abiotic conditions observed in the present study and the 2 46 d for natural decay 37 further the half life of otc with onk was significantly lower than that of other previously characterized isolates such as pandoraea 6 d ochrobactrum 2 5 d arthrobacter 4 d pseudomonas 10 d xanthobacter 5 6 d planococcus 2 13 d and burkholderia 12 d overall the onk population observed in this study was found to have greater potential for removing otc compared to other known otc degraders many environmental parameters can control the fate and removal rate of otc including the biomass initial otc and primary carbon source levels as such the operating parameters that could potentially affect the otc co metabolism kinetics of onk were examined first five batch flasks were established with biomass concentrations of 0 abiotic 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 g vss l fig 2a the removal rate with 0 5 g l onk was comparable to that of the abiotic flask increasing the biomass from 0 5 to 2 0 g l gradually increased the removal rate from 1 92 to 2 16 d 1 while 4 0 g l biomass did not increase the rate any further the biomass concentration of 2 4 gvss l which led to high otc removal rates was comparable to that employed in many full scale biological wwtps 1 4 gvss l because onk only catabolized otc in the presence of another primary carbon source the effects of the concentration of the primary carbon source on the otc removal rate were investigated revealing that 200 mg l glucose was the optimal level for co metabolism this concentration of glucose exhibited the highest otc removal rate fig 2b which was equivalent to 213 mg cod l and comparable to that in many municipal wastewater influents 300 500 mg cod l the effects of the initial otc concentration 0 5 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 mg l were also tested the first order otc removal rate decreased from 2 1 d 1 to 1 5 d 1 when the otc increased from 0 5 mg l to 8 mg l fig 2c the concentration of a contaminant is found to affect its fate and removal rate in biological wastewater systems 38 while otc occurs at varying levels in the environment its environmentally relevant maxima is hundreds of micrograms per liter in contaminated surface water and streams impacted by aquacultural waste 3 8 the levels of otc tested in this study were similar to environmentally relevant levels while many previous studies have investigated very high levels of otc 10 100 mg l 16 18 19 that exceed environmentally relevant levels taken together these results identified the operational parameters that control the fate of otc and provided the foundation for the design of an onk based biological system for the removal of otc 3 3 development of an otc bioremediation system based on immobilized onk to design a bioremediation system using onk for otc removal a biocomposite entrapping onk in an alginate polymer matrix was synthesized first the effects of the sa cell concentration and the syringe needle diameter on the size and density of the biocomposite beads were examined the density of the biocomposite increased from 0 3 g cm3 to 1 2 g cm3 with an increase in the combined sa cell concentration from 1 to 8 w v fig 3a while the density of the biocomposite was highest 1 4 g cm3 with a 1 4 mm needle diameter followed by a 2 5 mm needle diameter 1 1 g cm3 fig 3b the 2 5 mm needle produced beads with a diameter of 4 5 mm which was comparable to many of the granular adsorbent and biocarrier additives used in wastewater systems thus this needle size was selected for cell immobilization in the present study the optimal synthesis conditions i e sa cell concentration of 8 and needle diameter of 2 5 mm led to large beads 4 5 mm with a density 1 1 g cm3 slightly higher than that of water this density was desirable because a less dense material would float on the water surface and be difficult to circulate even with mixers or aeration another important operational factor for the bioremediation system is the filling ratio of the biocomposite 39 because the filling ratio of biological additives significantly affects the biological performance 28 the otc removal rate was measured for a filling ratio of 7 5 to 60 and compared with the control which had no biocomposite fig 3c adding the biocomposite significantly enhanced otc removal 0 97 3 37 d 1 with the removal rate highest for a filling ratio of 30 the optimal filling ratio was comparable to the typical range for biocarriers used in many wastewater systems 20 50 40 two continuous bioreactor systems using onk were established to treat waste streams containing 2 5 mg l otc one with immobilized onk ri and the other with free onk cells rf both systems used a 30 filling ratio for the biocomposite and free cells respectively the optimized operating parameters e g 0 2 g l of primary carbon source 8 of sa cell biocomposite synthesized with 2 5 mm needle and 30 of biocomposite filling ratio for otc removal figs 2 and 3 were used for these systems the two systems were operated in a continuous stirred tank reactor with an hrt of 10 h which was comparable to the typical range for reactor systems 3 to 25 h 41 the two systems were run without onk for the first 48 h during which no significant changes in cell growth od600 and doc removal were observed fig 3d and e otc removal of 30 was observed without onk likely resulting from abiotic decay as observed in figs 1 and 2 and this was consistent with the 25 predicted based on the first order otc removal rate 1 4 d 1 the abiotic conditions and hrt onk was added as a biocomposite ri or free cells rf after 49 h which then led to significantly different results for the two systems high onk biomass levels od600 of 0 31 were observed at hour 49 in the rf effluent and this had rapidly decreased by hour 55 before leveling off at an od600 of 0 02 0 06 for hours 121 289 fig 3d in contrast the od600 values for the ri effluent were low 0 02 and comparable to that before the addition of the biocomposite these results indicated that the ri system successfully entrapped the onk while the free cells of onk were washed out the removal performance for otc and doc was significantly higher for ri than for rf fig 3e rf reduced otc by 55 and doc by 35 after 6 h after this temporary improvement the otc and doc removal efficiencies rapidly decreased returning back to those observed before inoculation 25 otc removal and 1 doc removal in contrast ri exhibited a stable system performance for the removal of otc and doc at levels much higher 63 and 85 respectively than those of rf the highly efficient performance of ri fig 3e and f was in a good agreement with the retention of the biocomposite shown in fig 3d these experimental results supported the potential for the use of an immobilized onk bioremediation strategy to treat otc the hrt is one of the most important design parameters for engineered biological systems treating continuous waste streams hrts of 3 to 25 h are typically employed in many full scale municipal industrial wwtps with different configurational units 41 to which the hrt of 10 h used in the present study was comparable employing microorganisms with a doubling time shorter than the hrt is not technically feasible due to cell wash out which was illustrated by the washout of the free cells observed in the present study onk was found to grow with a doubling time of 17 h much faster than that of other known otc degraders e g 28 h for ochrobactrum 21 h for burkholderia and 2 d for pseudomonas 15 17 18 in conventional as cas systems as cells are separated in a secondary settling tank some of which are recycled back to biological tanks this cell recycling strategy using the settling tank helps to retain slow growing microorganisms and maintain the high biomass levels within the system however the cell immobilization strategy proposed in the present study successfully retained the onk cells and maintained the desired functional performance and stability without the need for additional settling tanks because cell immobilization does not require additional cell cycling or separation e g membrane filtration systems it provides benefits for the design of engineered systems with lower capital and operating costs 3 4 biological detoxification of otc using the bioremediation system using batch experiments fig 1b hplc analysis was employed to identify shifts in the type and amount of otc and its possible derivatives fig s5 while the otc levels detected in the chromatogram after a retention time rt of 5 29 min were lower in the abiotic og the potential byproducts rt of 4 88 min of otc increased from hour 2 to hour 24 of interest was the removal of the byproducts in the active og after 24 h indicating biological removal activity a previous study detected 4 epi oxytetracycline eotc at an rt of 4 9 min 42 which was similar to the observations in the present study suggesting that eotc might be present as a transformation byproduct hence the byproducts of otc degradation detected in the hplc analysis were examined further using lc ms analysis of the ri and rf effluent after 241 h and the feed solution four peaks were observed in the chromatogram their specific m z and rts were summarized in table s1 in addition to otc m z 461 and an rt of 12 7 min the substances with m z 461 and 460 detected in the influent and the rf effluent were identified as eotc and c23h25no9 respectively as reported 43 eotc and c23h25no9 were thus classified as abiotic byproducts while c13h12o3 m z 198 and c13h23on m z 217 which were detected only in the ri effluent were classified as biological byproducts fig 4 other byproducts such as α apo otc and β apo otc were detected by li et al 44 and those detected with arthrobacter pandoraea and pseudomonas characterized previously are listed in table s1 for comparison based on the byproducts observed in the present and previous studies transformation pathways from otc were proposed fig 4 our results suggested three biotransformation or abiotic pathways for otc via dehydration epimerization and deamination methylation resulting in c22h22n2o8 eotc and c23h25no9 respectively otc is often dehydrated by losing an h2o molecule at the c5 and c6 positions i e the hydroxyl group forming c22h22n2o8 43 c22h22n2o8 was not detected in this study because it is highly unstable at a neutral ph or in weakly acidic solutions where spontaneous oxidation rapidly leads to the formation of α apo otc or β apo otc 44 c13h12o3 m z 217 was detected in lc ms analysis for biotic conditions with onk which might result from the fragmentation of α apo otc and β apo otc via enzymatic ring cleavage at the highly unstable c5 position through epimerization otc often transforms into eotc which has the same molar mass as otc but with a different orientation of the n ch3 2 functional group at the c4 position 43 eotc was present in the rf effluent but not in the ri effluent suggesting that it might undergo further biotransformation due to onk via ring cleavage achromobacter is capable of excreting dioxygenase 45 which cleaves the naphthol ring at the positions c5a and c11 potentially transforming eotc into c14h19o6 achromobacter also has an array of catalytic enzymes e g laccase 46 that are involved in demethylation which might transform the n ch3 2 functional group of c14h19o6 into c12h23no m z 198 the third pathway proposed in this study involved c23h25no9 which has not been reported in previous studies c23h25no9 could result from the abiotic deamination and methylation of otc the presence of c23h25no9 in both the synthetic feed and the rf effluent was suggestive of abiotic transformation but further studies are required to determine the exact transformation reactions and pathways in summary while known otc degraders arthrobacter pandoraea and pseudomonas have biotransformation pathways associated with c21h24n2o7 c12h10o4 and c21h28n2o8 16 17 19 the present study proposed new pathways for onk the toxicity of otc and its byproducts were estimated using the qsar method table s1 the predicted lc50 values for otc and its derivatives varied by about two orders of magnitude in general the transformation products showed high lc50 values i e a low toxicity compared to otc the otc transformation products c13h12o3 and c13h23on from the activity of onk had a toxicity that was 10 20 times lower than otc however eotc and c23h25no9 had toxicities that were similar to or even higher than otc table s2 therefore the results suggested that although byproducts from onk mediated degradation of otc can be less toxic the transformation of otc via other biotic abiotic pathways may not necessarily reduce the toxicity the byproducts may pose environmental risks of their own and or they may cause more serious ecological consequences due to their synergistic toxicological interactions 5 the degree of the toxicity predicted based on the molecular structure of the byproducts was also tested experimentally microbial samples were taken from 0 1 m below the surface of the water receiving effluent from the wwtp where the onk was sourced from the maximum growth and lag phase of the cultures were estimated using a modified gompertz model for the otc containing influent the influent without otc control and the effluents from rf and ri fig 5 the cellular growth in the otc influent and the rf effluent was significantly lower by 40 and 26 respectively in contrast the growth for the ri effluent was comparable to that of the control influent strongly indicating biological detoxification for heterotrophic growth compared to the control influent and ri effluent the rf effluent required a longer lag phase period for cell growth confirming the inhibitory effects of the rf effluent collectively the low toxicity of the onk transformed products predicted according to their molecular structure was experimentally validated using susceptibility testing providing robust evidence for biotransformation enabled detoxification within the onk mediated bioremediation system 3 5 immobilized onk bioremediation system practical implications and future outlook in any bioremediation system it is important to recognize that although the target contaminant can be successfully degraded via physicochemical and biological reactions the resulting byproducts may have comparable or even higher toxicity than the original contaminant the transformation of original contaminants does not necessarily lead to detoxification 47 for instance the metabolic intermediates 4 aminophenol hydroquinone and benzoquinone of acetaminophen a drug often used for reducing fever with covid 19 can be more toxic for heterotrophic cell growth and nitrification metabolic activity 13 27 otc derivatives are of particular environmental concern because about 70 80 of the otc ingested by humans animals and fish is excreted e g in urine as its original form or as byproducts 5 while a relative wealth of data on the environmental occurrence and toxicity of otc is currently available little is known about otc byproducts a few studies reported transformation products from otc produced by microbial isolates table s1 while the transformation products from arthrobacter and pandoraea were in general less toxic than otc based on qsar modeling the c22h21no9 produced by pseudomonas was found to be potentially eight times more toxic than otc in comparison to known otc degraders onk had novel otc biotransformation pathways that differ from previously characterized routes and led to detoxification in addition onk had a higher otc removal rate a half life of 0 2 d than other known degraders 2 12 d and a shorter doubling time 0 7 d and 1 2 d respectively from an engineering perspective these characteristics are advantageous desirable for the design of bioremediation systems because the use of onk can reduce the hrt and or solid rt thus helping to reduce the overall system volume and consequently the operating and capital costs while pseudomonas burkholderia and xanthorobacter are capable of degrading otc as a sole carbon source i e primary metabolism the removal routes for otc with other isolates pandoraea ochrobactrum arthrobacter and planococcus remain to be clarified 16 18 20 the systematic assessment of the removal routes in the present study suggested that onk employs the co metabolic degradation of otc rather than primary metabolism co metabolism involves the degradation of a substance in the presence of another primary substrate stimulating the growth of the organism 21 the co metabolic capabilities of onk for otc highlighted its potential use as a bioremediation or bioaugmentation agent for otc contaminated waste streams in which various heterogeneous carbon sources other than otc are available many of the environmental settings in which otc biological detoxification is required e g wastewater and contaminated soil water offer a range of organic matter that can act as a primary carbon source with the fluctuating presence of otc in trace amounts in these settings otc degraders with a co metabolic capability such as onk may have high selective fitness achromobacter has a diverse range of habitats fig 1a and is characterized by a large genome with an array of accessory metabolic genes indicating their metabolic versatility 32 collectively our results illustrated that achromobacter sp onk has great potential as a robust microbial agent for bioaugmentation and or bioremediation systems at various otc contaminated sites this study thus suggested future research that systematically assesses the operating factors that optimize onk bioaugmentation or bioremediation for pilot and full scale systems at otc contaminated sites further onk is phylogenetically and taxonomically distinguishable from known otc degraders and has novel biotransformation pathways accordingly future genomic and transcriptomic investigations will help to determine the genetic determinants and molecular regulatory networks associated with otc metabolism 4 conclusions achromobacter sp onk was isolated and taxonomically and phenotypically characterized in terms of its otc metabolism onk catabolized otc via co metabolism with two distinct biotransformation pathways operational i e carbon source biomass and otc levels and cell immobilization i e sa cell concentration needle diameter and filling ratio conditions were optimized to enhance otc biotransformation using these design factors an immobilized onk bioremediation system was developed to treat continuous otc streams with a typical hrt 10h the immobilized onk bioremediation system achieved the biotransformation enabled detoxification of otc which was validated
