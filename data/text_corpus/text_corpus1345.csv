6725,no attempts have been found on dealing with a set of non competitive or leader follower interactive objectives when performing optimal groundwater remediation management this study presents a multi level nonlinear simulation optimization ml nso model for groundwater remediation management when objectives should be satisfied at multiple levels this model is formulated by integrating health risk assessment at the residential concern level energy assessment at the energy concern level and contamination forecasting at the environmental concern level within a general framework the capabilities and effectiveness of the developed model are illustrated through a real world case located at cantuar saskatchewan in canada results facilitate a generating non compromised solutions in association with the optimal strategies regarding groundwater injection and extraction b displaying the distribution of contaminant concentration and carcinogenic risks for human health and estimating the corresponding energy consumption c resolving of conflicts and interactions among residential energy and environmental requirements moreover the performance of ml nso model is enhanced by comparing with the single level and multi objective sl nso and mo nso models results show that ml nso model would assign higher priority on the residential and environmental concerns by tolerating a slight rise in energy cost the ml nso model would provide more comprehensive and systematic policies with considering the leader follower relationship within system keywords multi level programming groundwater remediation optimization health risks 1 introduction the global groundwater resources have been under serious threat because of their exposures to a broad spectrum of contaminants emanating from various sources especially the oil industry schipper et al 2010 roy and bickerton 2010 wiafe et al 2013 obiri nyarko et al 2014 huang et al 2014 fang et al 2017 groundwater contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbon spills and leakage has posed significant risks to the environment and human health azizullah et al 2011 li et al 2014 pisciotta et al 2015 meng et al 2019 he et al 2018 petroleum hydrocarbons when discharged and even slightly dissolved into the groundwater could impose great threat to neighboring environment and human health fujinaga et al 2012 mchugh et al 2014 tomlinson and ruby 2016 benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex are a group of contaminants brought by petroleum hydrocarbon which can directly enter groundwater environment chaiklieng et al 2015 from 1987 to 1993 over 2 00 million pounds of benzene approximately 4 00 million pounds of toluene nearly 0 76 million pounds of ethylbenzene and over 4 80 billion pounds of xylenes were released to the environment in the us currently a number of remediation techniques have been developed for cleaning up dissolved btex from the groundwater nevertheless the remediation is costly large scale and time consuming as reported from the national research council nrc 2012 there were at least 126 000 contaminated sites required continued management throughout the us and the cost to cleanup these sites was estimated to exceed 110 127 billion without an optimal management from the systematic perspective the remediation would become extremely costly and low efficient a number of mathematical methods have been proposed to support optimal groundwater remediation systems butscher and huggenberger 2009 datta et al 2011 kim et al 2011 van zelm et al 2011 parker et al 2012 chitsazan et al 2015 polat et al 2015 milan et al 2018 pacheco et al 2018 chen et al 2018 for instance ayvaz and elci 2013 used hybrid hs solver optimization algorithm for minimizing the groundwater pumping cost by developing a linked simulation optimization model under any certain water demand the optimal remediation strategies such as numbers locations and pumping rates of the pumping wells would be efficiently identified by the simulation optimization model which could obtain just any mathematically plausible solution thakur and mondal 2016 presented a subnet of response surface methodology named box behnken design to evaluate the optimal experimental conditions for the objective requirement of arsenic removal and operating cost in groundwater remediation optimization system farhadi et al 2016 developed an agent based nash modeling framework including a modflow simulation process an artificial neural network and a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii optimization model the nash bargaining model aimed to find a compromise among modified optimal objectives of the three stakeholders farmers the government executive sector and the environmental protection institutes implementation resulted in 58 3 less water extraction and approximately 3 m water level uplift however the most of optimization researches focus on single objective or multiple but parallel objectives ushijima and yeh 2015 davison et al 2015 seldom focuses on the problem of optimization for multiple objectives arising from different decision levels with leader follower relationships in the groundwater management system bi level programming has been demonstrated to be an effective tool in solving optimal management issues where dual design objectives arise from decision makers at two different levels skulovich et al 2014 taha et al 2014 gang et al 2015 chen et al 2017 for example xu et al 2013 presented a bi level programming model to address a regional water resources allocation problem under fuzzy random environment the application of the bi level model in the gan fu plain irrigation district could demonstrate its practicality and efficiency however there are still very few attempts to use bi level programming for groundwater remediation management more significantly general remediation objectives can hardly be limited to only two levels in fact the objectives should accommodate more levels such as those representative of the concerns of the energy and residential sectors unfortunately neither bi level i e two non completive nor multi objective i e multiple competitive programming can solve these types of management problems multi level decision making has increasingly attracted much attention owing to its capability of representing the requirements of multi level decision makers this further improves the incapability of bi level programming in dealing with enhanced complex dominant subordinate relationships at multiple levels this study aims to develop a multi level nonlinear simulation optimization ml nso model to support optimal groundwater remediation management when three objectives should be satisfied at multiple levels this model is formulated by integrating health risk assessment at the residential concern level mcknight and finkel 2013 tartakovsky 2013 zhang et al 2018 sharma et al 2019 shen et al 2016 energy assessment at the energy concern level and contamination forecasting at the contamination concern level gaur et al 2011 yu et al 2016 within a general framework the design and application of the multi level nonlinear simulation optimization model comprise 1 formulating a groundwater remediation optimization problem which comprises minimizing carcinogenic risk energy consumption and environmental concern with different important levels 2 discussing rational considerations and handling parameter uncertainty in health risk assessment 3 presenting a multi level decision making approach based on satisfactory degree to solve the multi level groundwater optimization problem and 4 applying the developed method to address a real world petroleum contaminated groundwater remediation management problem in canada 2 methodology 2 1 formulation of a simulation optimization multi level model a pump and treat system is established as groundwater remediation technology in this study the system generally contains extraction injection and monitoring wells the extraction wells would carry the contaminated groundwater to the surface and the injection wells would sent the treated water back to the aquifer boal et al 2015 the monitoring wells are used to identify concentrations in contamination plume the varied pumping rates at injection and extraction wells injection rates and extraction rates could compose different remediation strategies and generate different remediation performances therefore the injection and extraction rates are presented as inputs and contamination concentrations at monitoring wells are the resulting outputs fig 1 shows the flowchart of the simulation optimization model for groundwater remediation management problem a general procedure for groundwater remediation model can be summarized as follows step 1 generating a number of simulation scenarios through numerical experiment design based on a three dimensional multiphase multi component simulation model step 2 establishing a set of surrogates based on stepwise quadratic surface analysis to reflect the relationships between the pumping rates and contaminant concentrations and the accuracy of the obtained surrogates would be tested by four statistics root mean square error r2 f value and p value step 3 developing the multi level groundwater remediation optimization based on the surrogates with residential energy environmental concerns step 4 obtaining the optimal solutions under different scenarios by using a multi level decision making approach based on satisfactory degree to support decision makings the multi level programing is an effective approach for dealing with the problems where the multi level decision makers have their targets and performances for the same optimization problem candler and norton 1977a candler and norton 1977b osman et al 2004 baky 2010 in the multi level decision making processes the relative lower level decision maker must follow the relative upper level ones which in turn must attempt to meet the lower level demands in an incentive or disincentive manner for their targets being optimized synchronously tookanlou et al 2015 bahramara et al 2016 a general multi level model with single objective function at each level can be given as follows 1 upper level objective m i n f 1 upper l e v e l x 1 x 2 x 3 c 11 x 1 c 12 x 2 c 13 x 3 s t upper level constraints x 1 x 2 x 3 r where x 2 should be solved from middle level objective m i n f 2 middle l e v e l x 1 x 2 x 3 c 21 x 1 c 22 x 2 c 23 x 3 s t middle level constraints x 1 x 2 x 3 t where x 3 should be solved from lower level objective m i n f 3 lower l e v e l x 1 x 2 x 3 c 31 x 1 c 32 x 2 c 33 x 3 s t lower level constraints x 1 x 2 x 3 h where the vectors x1 x2 and x3 are the upper middle and lower level decision variables respectively f 1 f 2 and f 3 respectively denote the upper middle and lower level objective functions c denotes the constant matrix r t and h denote the sets represented by the upper middle and lower level constraints respectively actually the multi level programming is conceptually theoretically methodologically and physically different from traditional multi objective programing the particular structure of multi level programming facilitates the formulation of a number of practical problems that involve a hierarchical decision making process but the objectives and constraints of multi objective model are always parallel a general multi objective model can be given as follows 2 min f 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 c 11 x 1 c 12 x 2 c 13 x 3 m i n f 2 x 1 x 2 x 3 c 21 x c 22 x 2 c 23 x 3 m i n f 3 x 1 x 2 x 3 c 31 x c 32 x 2 c 33 x 3 s t x 1 x 2 x 3 r x 1 x 2 x 3 t x 1 x 2 x 3 h similar to multi objective programming fuzzy programming and stochastic programming multi level programming is another class of mathematical programming methods no matter in theory or practical decision making multi level programming is completely different from multi objective programming first the relationships among the objectives are different one is competitive without any priority and the other is leader follower related with priority but without competition second they may have completely different decision spaces which has been extensively discussed in many existing studies osman et al 2004 third the latter has pareto optimality but the former has no fourth the latter is still linear by assuming all the constraints and objectives are linear but the former is always nonlinear thus increasing the difficulty in problem solving there are three aspects considered for the groundwater remediation management system involving health risk assessment energy consumption index and environment standard which exhibit different influences the groundwater optimization model mainly aims to reduce contaminant concentrations to the levels of environment standards after remediation the model also focuses on total remediation cost which is an indispensable factor for groundwater optimization and defined as the sum of fixed and operating costs for the general pumping and treat systems the fixed cost could be neglected since it is greatly much lower than the operating one the operating cost is generally generated from pumping rates which comprises injection and extraction rates ayvaz and karahan 2008 the operation of injection and extraction wells depends on to a large extent the consumption of electrical energy therefore the consumption index of electrical energy connecting pumping rate with the remediation cost is incorporated into the modeling framework furthermore human health would be under threat from contaminant concentrations in groundwater especially when it comes to that complex contaminants in petroleum contaminated groundwater have been linked to cancer in response to such a concern health risk assessment with the concern of local residence can be used for measuring the direct and indirect effects complex contaminants in petroleum contaminated groundwater have been linked to cancer therefore carcinogenic risk is the only consideration for health risk assessment during the multi level decision making process the constraints for the upper level objective should include not only its constraints but also those at the lower level the objective at the lower level just satisfies the limiting conditions from the lower level the objective at the upper level satisfies more limiting conditions than that at the lower level therefore the higher level possesses greater significance in this groundwater remediation management system the model is divided into three levels to represent the degree of importance of three factors carcinogenic risk assessment that is designated at the upper level for representing the concern of the local residence electrical energy consumption index that is assigned to the middle level for expressing the energy concern and environmental standards of contaminants that are placed at the lower level for exhibiting the concern of environment contamination fig 2 shows the multi level structure of groundwater remediation optimization 1 upper or leader level residential concern level carcinogenic risk assessment is assigned on the upper level attributed to its greater importance as compared with other considerations the minimum of average carcinogenic risk at all the monitoring wells in the entire contaminated region is regarded as the objective carcinogenic risk can be calculated by evaluating several monitoring wells each carcinogenic risk should be subjected to an acceptable risk standard usepa recommendations the upper level can thus be formulated as 3a min t c r i s k i 1 i mc r i i 3b s t m c r i r a c c 3c mc r i sf m c i i r e f e d 1000 a t b w where tcrisk is total carcinogenic risk mcr is a carcinogenic risk at a monitoring well racc is maximum value of acceptable carcinogenic risk sf is slope factor which is expressed as the carcinogenic risk per unit dose in unit of the inverse of milligrams of the substance or chemical per kilogram of body weight per day ef is exposure frequency ir is ingestion rate bw is body weight ed is exposure duration at is averaging time mc is monitoring concentration of contaminant which can be solved through hybrid numerical simulation and stepwise response surface analysis i is number i monitoring well i is amount of total monitoring wells 2 middle or follower for the upper and leader for the lower level energy concern level the minimum consumption index of electrical energy is the middle level objective and this index is a function of the total pumping rate preliminary studies indicated that statistical coefficients of a linear relationship are altered when total the pumping rate exceeds a certain critical value furthermore total extraction and injection rates should be equal to maintain a stable hydraulic gradient under this condition groundwater flow can be directed toward the plume interior and clean water can be injected within a specified pumping period thus the middle level can be formulated as 4a min d e e c f d t p r 4b s t d t p r j 1 j e r j m 1 m i r m 4c deec f j 1 j e

daily total pumping rate dtpr is the critical value of dtpr if dtpr is lower than dtpr deec is the function of the upper equation conversely deec is the function of the lower equation er and ir are extraction and injection rates respectively j is number j extraction well m is number m injection well j and m are amount of total extraction and injection wells respectively αandβare statistic coefficients eep 3 lower level or follower environmental concern level environmental standards are the lower level concern with a minimum average contaminant concentration as the objective contaminant concentrations in each monitoring well should be lower than the acceptable levels contaminant concentration at a monitoring well in groundwater exhibits a non linear relationship with extraction and injection rates stepwise quadratic response surface analysis is introduced to deal with the non linear equation the injection and extraction rates are inputs and contaminant concentration in each monitoring well is output of the surrogate based on simulation and stepwise quadratic response analysis a series of surrogate equations between contamination concentrations and injection and extraction rates can be obtained finally the objective should be subjected to technical constraints that is injection and extraction rates should be limited within a desired boundary range thus the lower level can be formulated as 5a min f c i 1 i m c i i 5b s t m c i c c a c c 5c m c i c 0 i j 1 j c j i e r j m 1 m c m i i r m j 1 j j 1 j c j j i e r j e r j m 1 m m 1 m c m m i i r m i r m j 1

making approach based on satisfactory degree sf is an inexact parameter because it generally results from numerous toxicity experiments on animals it is thus difficult to accurately estimate its value in humans in carcinogenic risk assessment li et al 2014 the average sf value for benzene can be determined as 0 029 recommended by the usepa moreover benzene is the only carcinogen and tex are not determined carcinogens according to the guideline of usepa the values of slope factor for tex are not calculated and recommended by usepa therefore three values representing low medium and high confidence levels of the cancer slope factor were determined for benzene the sequence of decision making is from the top to middle and then to the bottom level correspondingly reflecting the local residence energy to contamination concerns the upper level decision maker accepts suggestions from the lower level decision maker each decision maker seeks his own interests within the tolerance limit set by the upper levels decision makers at each level are fully informed of the resolutions of those at the upper level consequently a supervised upper to lower level search procedure can generate a non dominated satisfactory solution for the multi level optimization problem fig 3 describes the decision procedure of multi level groundwater remediation model based on satisfactory degree first the objective of the residential level should be independently minimized subject to the total constraints containing those of the residential energy and environmental levels but the objectives of the energy and environmental levels are ignored the obtained results under this circumstance are regarded as the ideal solution of tcrisk and the proposed ideal solution is designated as tcrideal second the objective of the energy level should be minimized subject to constraints which are in the energy and environmental levels in this case the objective of the energy level and the entire components of the residential level are excluded the energy level solves its problem independently and obtains its ideal solution eecideal third the environmental level obtains its optimal solution fcideal independently and entirely neglects the residential and energy levels however the three ideal solutions are most probably inconsistent because of the conflicts among the three concerns this supposition suggests that the optimal decision is found at tcrideal but the residential level should reassess the tolerance or indefiniteness of this decision at a certain boundary of an interval decisions made outside the boundary are not acceptable therefore a triangular membership function indicated by a satisfactory degree and based on a tolerance degree can be formulated as follows 7 γ 1 if t c r i s k t c r ideal racc t c r i s k racc t c r ideal if t c r ideal t c r i s k r a c c 0 if r a c c t c r i s k where γ is the satisfactory degree of the residential level similarly the other two satisfactory degrees indicate the memberships of the energy and environmental levels based on a given tolerance 8 μ 1 if d e e c e e c ideal eecacc d e e c eecacc e e c ideal if e e c ideal d e e c e e c a c c 0 if e e c a c c d e e c 9 φ 1 if f c f c ideal ccacc f c ccacc f c ideal if f c ideal f c f c a c c 0 if f c a c c f c where μ and φ are satisfactory degrees of the middle and lower objectives eecacc is the boundary is the maximum value of the acceptable energy consumption ccacc is the boundary is the maximum value of the acceptable contaminant concentration in order to satisfy all the degrees of satisfactions which are usually in conflict with one another γ μ and φ should be maximized simultaneously hence the multi level objective is transformed as follows 10 max λ 11 λ m i n γ μ φ the objective should be simultaneously maximized subject to all constraints of the upper middle and lower levels with the three triangular membership functions therefore the model can be solved as 12 max λ s t λ m i n γ μ φ γ 1 if t c r i s k t c r ideal racc t c r i s k racc t c r ideal if t c r ideal t c r i s k r a c c 0 if r a c c t c r i s k μ 1 if d e e c e e c ideal eecacc d e

significant hydrocarbon effects have been reported in this area because of drainage leakage and blow down fluids of subsurface facilities based on excessive development of the petroleum industry eep some of these effects are relatively simple yet others may have long term implications over time attributed to their cumulative effects on soil groundwater as well as human health a sound remediation strategies pertinent to such effects is thus needed to implement pump and treat system was selected as the main groundwater remediation technology due to its simplification and high effectiveness on contamination removal the system generally contains extraction injection and monitoring wells two injection wells were placed at the upstream of the contaminated plume four extraction wells were placed at the downstream of the contaminated plume around the contamination sources the injection wells were used to send treated water back to groundwater and the extraction wells were used to pump the contaminated groundwater to water treatment facility on surface moreover eight monitoring wells were used to detect the concentrations of benzene compounds the three kinds of wells have already existed fig 4 5 and 10 years of remediation durations were taken into consideration as timeframes the simulation results indicated that the concentrations of toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes tex decreased to below their respective environment standards once benzene concentration satisfied the designated limits moreover benzene exhibited higher toxicity and carcinogenicity than the other three contaminants as a consequence benzene concentrations were considered only in the optimization model a part of surrogates of monitoring wells m1 m4 between benzene contamination concentrations and the injection extraction rates are shown in table 1 besides on site characteristics the pumping rates at all injection and extraction wells were set below 100 m3 hr 3 1 variation of satisfaction degree in this model three key parameters including probability distributions of sf racc and ccacc may have important implications for the final optimal strategies varied racc and ccacc represent the changes in the risk and concentration constraints many groundwater standards are established by different countries and vary with different spatial locations and functions such as agriculture and forest areas freshwater to support aquatic life drinking water and so on carcinogenic risk values lower than 0 0001 represent the absence of threat to human health sf is based on numerous scientific studies and characteristics of the contaminated site hence obtaining the true value of sf is impractical therefore single factor analysis of the three parameters was conducted fig 5 in this analysis one parameter varies while the other parameters are maintained constant figs 5a and 5b show the satisfactory degrees of the three objectives obtained from the model under different racc and ccacc the two subfigures display similar variation trends first the satisfactory degree of energy consumption shows no significant variation with changes from the low to the middle value of risk or concentration however high values of constraints lead to a considerable high satisfactory degree of energy consumption this shows that the extraction and injection rates rapidly decrease meanwhile second the constraints and satisfactory degrees of energy consumption and contaminant concentration do not linearly increase because of the effect of the other constraints results of the middle constraint are superior to those of the high value constraints third the high satisfactory degree of carcinogenic risk is maintained with the changes in the risk and concentration constraints the satisfactory degree of energy consumption is the determining factor under high value of the constraints whereas the satisfactory degree of contaminant concentration is the determining factor under remaining values of the constraints subfigure 5c shows the satisfactory degrees of the three objectives at the low medium and high level of sf with uncertainty the results at low level are the closest to the value of sf recommended by usepa whereas those at high level possess high reliability the satisfactory degree of contaminant concentration remains nearly unchanged across the three levels however the other satisfactory degrees dramatically decline from the low to medium levels the satisfactory degree of carcinogenic risk rapidly increases from medium to high level thus it is concluded that uncertainty of sf influence the final optimal strategies especially on carcinogenic risk decision makers should hence include this aspect into careful consideration 3 2 analyses of extraction and injection rates the effects of the racc and ccacc are similar therefore racc and ccacc were combined in pairs and divided into three restriction classes that is loose middle and strict classes table 2 under the three levels of sf these classes generate several predicted scenarios the optimal strategies were evaluated under these scenarios fig 6 shows each extraction and injection rate at the extraction and injection wells under these scenarios at 5 and 10 year remediation duration figs 6a 6b and 6c present each pumping rate at extraction and injection wells with strict middle and loose classes of restriction respectively differences in extraction and injection rate were detected between the 5 and 10 year remediation durations overall extraction and injection rates do not decrease under the 10 year remediation compared with those of the 5 year remediation because of strict restrictions fig 6a even at high level of sf the rates at 5 year remediation are lower than those of the 10 year remediation meanwhile the rates at 5 year remediation duration exceed those of the 10 year duration in fig 6b but the difference is not significant under loose restriction the rates between the 5 and 10 year remediation exhibit huge disparity fig 6c a long remediation period possesses significant advantages on energy consumption under this scenario therefore high extraction and injection rates are required under strict and middle restrictions however long remediation duration does not guarantee absolute benefit in energy consumption decision makers should carefully balance between the time and costs for groundwater remediation management five years of remediation is a relatively appropriate option extraction and injection wells play different roles in the groundwater remediation management system for the two injection wells the injection rates of qi1 and qi2 are mainly maintained at stable states the total injection rate is roughly equally split between qi1 and qi2 the two injection wells are often nearly in full operation however the four extraction wells show completely different situations these differences are primarily manifested in two aspects the extraction rates at the extraction wells considerably vary under the three classes of restrictions and levels of sf despite similar remediation duration and the values from qe1 to qe3 fluctuate remarkably although the classes of restriction and levels of sf remained unchanged the extraction rate of extraction well 4 approaches 0 in most scenarios this finding means that extraction well 4 was left unused results from the loose restriction indicate that extraction rate is mainly contributed by extraction wells 1 and 3 with the other two classes of restriction the extraction rate is reasonably assigned to extraction wells 1 2 and 3 in summary injection wells 1 and 2 play primary roles in the groundwater remediation management system these wells should hence be the focus during decision making certain extraction wells should also be particularly emphasized on the basis of variations in restrictions and levels of sf the removal of extraction well 4 from the groundwater remediation management system may be considered 3 3 predicted carcinogenic risks and contaminant concentrations based on the combinations among the three classes of restrictions and confidence levels the predicted distributions of carcinogenic risks and contaminant concentrations are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively each subfigure describes the predicted results under a scenario composed of a certain class restriction and confidence level the combinations of the three classes of restriction and three levels of sf resulted in a total of nine scenarios fig 7 depicts the distribution of carcinogenic risk after 5 years of remediation whereas fig 8 illustrates the distribution of benzene concentration after 10 years of remediation as the level of sf directly influences carcinogenic risk three subfigures at the top middle and bottom of figs 7 and 8 depict the distribution of carcinogenic risk and benzene concentration with low medium and high levels of sf respectively horizontal comparison of subfigures has different simulation results with different restriction classes under these nine scenarios composed of three restriction classes and three levels of sf contamination region with carcinogenic risk mainly locates at the right of the study area fig 7 the left of the study area will not have carcinogenic risks two regions possessing high carcinogenic risks are both situated at the downstream groundwater flow of contamination sources with about 50 m one is around monitoring wells 2 and 4 attains relatively higher carcinogenic risks than those of other regions the other is around monitoring wells 5 and 7 extraction well 1 is close to them meanwhile the other areas comprise the low risk zone similar results could be found in fig 8 in most of the scenarios the areas around monitoring wells 2 4 5 and 7 exhibit higher benzene concentrations than those of the other areas by contrast monitoring wells 1 and 3 show low benzene concentrations monitoring well 8 is located within a safe zone in most of the scenarios the trend provides scientific basis for rational land use planning decision makers should allot the low carcinogenic risk regions to human activity areas 3 4 comparison with traditional single level multi objective level optimization traditional single level nonlinear simulation optimization sl nso and multi objective nonlinear simulation optimization mo nso models are introduced to compare remediation performance with ml nso sl nso aims to determine the total carcinogenic risk tcrisk similar to that of the upper level of ml nso the constraints of sl nso are all the constraints of ml nso in the three levels in particular for sl nso the consumption index of electrical energy and the final contaminant concentration are not limited in the groundwater remediation management system however the consumption index of electrical energy and contaminant concentration can still be obtained the mo nso can be formulated as follows 13 objectives min t c r i s k i 1 i mc

the forecasted optimal remediation strategies of ml nso are shown in fig 9 number 1 represents the results from sl nso number 2 represents the results from ml nso the 10 year period was selected as the remediation duration in this case with low medium and high levels of sf horizontal comparison among the three subfigures indicated that ml nso exhibits a certain advantage over sl nso the predicted performances of ml nso exhibit lower final carcinogenic risk and contaminant concentration compared with those of sl nso by contrast the consumption index of electrical energy predicted by ml nso is higher than that from sl nso in most scenarios figures 9d 9e and 9f show that the carcinogenic risk and contaminant concentration of ml nso are slightly lower than those of sl nso at low and medium levels of sf at the high level of sf the three objectives are nearly the same between ml nso and sl nso similar tendencies are displayed in figures 9 g 9 h and 9i furthermore high satisfactory degrees of carcinogenic risk are maintained longitudinal comparison of subfigures was performed with three different constraint classes of racc and ccacc first satisfactory degrees of the three objectives especially carcinogenic risk are mostly at a high level the satisfactory degrees of carcinogenicity can reach 100 under several scenarios under strict scenarios the satisfactory degrees of carcinogenic risk can indicate distinctions to a certain extent second the consumption index of electrical energy and contaminant concentration express obvious disparity between ml nso and sl nso for example the consumption index of electrical energy of sl nso is higher than that of ml nso at a medium confidence interval however opposite results are obtained at a high confidence interval figure 9b third the consumption index of electrical energy obtained from sl nso is lower than that from ml nso whereas contaminant concentration of ml nso is lower than that of sl nso under a number of scenarios these findings demonstrate that the consumption index of electrical energy and contaminant concentration as the objectives of the energy and environmental levels respectively exert significant influences on the final optimal strategy optimal strategies of ml nso are more suitable for the development of contemporary environmentalism than that of sl nso comparison of ml nso with traditional single level nonlinear optimization sl nso whose objective is energy consumption generally shows that the energy consumption would be slightly increased by 18 93 however this can be fordable since the contamination concentration would be decreased by 32 87 and the carcinogenic risk can be lowered by 35 62 this suggests that ml nso would assign higher priority on the residential and environmental concerns by tolerating a slight rise in energy cost in general ml nso has the advantages of not only simultaneously dealing with multiple remediation objectives but also handling the leader follower relationships among them fig 10 describes the generated optimal levels of three objectives health risk energy consumption and contaminant concentration concerns between ml nso and mo nso under 5 year remediation first the generated tcrisk representing health risk concern of ml nso is less than or equal to that of mo nso under the whole scenarios subfigure 10 a under several scenarios the tcrisk values of the two optimization approaches are almost same typically tcrisk of ml nso is nearly half of tcrisk of mo nso when sf is medium and constraint of ccacc and racc is high second by contrast the generated deec representing energy consumption concern of ml nso is higher than that of mo nso subfigure 10 b the largest distinction between two optimization approaches appears when sf is low and constraint of ccacc and racc is medium deec of ml nso is more than 2 5 times than that of mo nso third results of the generated fc representing contaminant concentration concern of two optimization approaches are quite opposite to the health risk and energy consumption concern the generated fc of mo nso is approximately more than 2 3 times than that of ml nso the fc of ml nso fluctuates at 6 µg l under most scenarios however the fc of mo nso ranges from 17 to 66 µg l which is much higher than that of ml nso therefore results of health risk and contaminant concentration derived from mo nso are higher than those derived from ml nso but energy consumption of mo nso is better than that of ml nso the results of multi objective are more balanced than those of ml nso among the health risk energy consumption and contaminant concentration concerns the ml nso could generate a health risk and contaminant concentration emphasized remediation performance the ml nso usually results in relative lower benefits compared with mo nso but it is generally accompanied by better environmental and health risk benefits and it is acceptable to obtain a better environmental quality and a lower health risk level with sacrificing a certain economic benefit 4 conclusions this study develops a novel multi level nonlinear simulation optimization ml nso model for groundwater remediation management the upper level model describes the health risk assessment for the residential concern leader the middle level model centers mostly on energy consumption for the energy concern level follower for the upper and leader for the lower while the lower level model focuses on contamination forecasting for the environmental concern level follower such a multi level modeling framework can not only elevate incapability of bi level methods in addressing enhanced complex leader follower relationships among different stakeholders but also better reflect the environmental impacts caused by groundwater contamination an improved multi level interactive solution algorithm based on satisfactory degree is then introduced into the decision making process for balancing to what extent the constraints are met and the objective reaches its optimal with consideration of parameter uncertainty this is the first attempt to apply the developed ml nso model to a real world petroleum contaminated groundwater remediation management in canada results obtained from the developed ml nso model can a generate non compromised solutions in association with the optimal strategies regarding groundwater injection and extraction b identify the temporal and spatial distribution of contaminant concentration and carcinogenic risks and evaluating the resulting electrical energy consumption and c address the conflict trade off among residential energy and environmental requirements moreover the performance of the ml nso model is highlighted by comparing with single level nonlinear simulation optimization sl nso and multi objective nonlinear simulation optimization mo nso models results show that ml nso model results in relative lower benefits compared with mo nso but it is generally accompanied by better environmental and health risk benefits and it is acceptable to obtain a better environmental quality and a lower health risk level with sacrificing a certain economic benefit the ml nso model would provide more comprehensive and systematic policies attributable to its hierarchical structure for expressing a leader follower relationship system the ml nso model could be beneficial for public health and environmental protection however two aspects are expected to be fulfilled for improvement in the further researches the influence of parameter uncertainty at each level should be taken into consideration in the general framework more appropriate strategies close to the real ones would be obtained with incorporation of such uncertainties on the other hand the remediation objectives are not limited to merely three more objectives from more than three levels will thus be employed to handle more leader follower relationships among them

6725,no attempts have been found on dealing with a set of non competitive or leader follower interactive objectives when performing optimal groundwater remediation management this study presents a multi level nonlinear simulation optimization ml nso model for groundwater remediation management when objectives should be satisfied at multiple levels this model is formulated by integrating health risk assessment at the residential concern level energy assessment at the energy concern level and contamination forecasting at the environmental concern level within a general framework the capabilities and effectiveness of the developed model are illustrated through a real world case located at cantuar saskatchewan in canada results facilitate a generating non compromised solutions in association with the optimal strategies regarding groundwater injection and extraction b displaying the distribution of contaminant concentration and carcinogenic risks for human health and estimating the corresponding energy consumption c resolving of conflicts and interactions among residential energy and environmental requirements moreover the performance of ml nso model is enhanced by comparing with the single level and multi objective sl nso and mo nso models results show that ml nso model would assign higher priority on the residential and environmental concerns by tolerating a slight rise in energy cost the ml nso model would provide more comprehensive and systematic policies with considering the leader follower relationship within system keywords multi level programming groundwater remediation optimization health risks 1 introduction the global groundwater resources have been under serious threat because of their exposures to a broad spectrum of contaminants emanating from various sources especially the oil industry schipper et al 2010 roy and bickerton 2010 wiafe et al 2013 obiri nyarko et al 2014 huang et al 2014 fang et al 2017 groundwater contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbon spills and leakage has posed significant risks to the environment and human health azizullah et al 2011 li et al 2014 pisciotta et al 2015 meng et al 2019 he et al 2018 petroleum hydrocarbons when discharged and even slightly dissolved into the groundwater could impose great threat to neighboring environment and human health fujinaga et al 2012 mchugh et al 2014 tomlinson and ruby 2016 benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex are a group of contaminants brought by petroleum hydrocarbon which can directly enter groundwater environment chaiklieng et al 2015 from 1987 to 1993 over 2 00 million pounds of benzene approximately 4 00 million pounds of toluene nearly 0 76 million pounds of ethylbenzene and over 4 80 billion pounds of xylenes were released to the environment in the us currently a number of remediation techniques have been developed for cleaning up dissolved btex from the groundwater nevertheless the remediation is costly large scale and time consuming as reported from the national research council nrc 2012 there were at least 126 000 contaminated sites required continued management throughout the us and the cost to cleanup these sites was estimated to exceed 110 127 billion without an optimal management from the systematic perspective the remediation would become extremely costly and low efficient a number of mathematical methods have been proposed to support optimal groundwater remediation systems butscher and huggenberger 2009 datta et al 2011 kim et al 2011 van zelm et al 2011 parker et al 2012 chitsazan et al 2015 polat et al 2015 milan et al 2018 pacheco et al 2018 chen et al 2018 for instance ayvaz and elci 2013 used hybrid hs solver optimization algorithm for minimizing the groundwater pumping cost by developing a linked simulation optimization model under any certain water demand the optimal remediation strategies such as numbers locations and pumping rates of the pumping wells would be efficiently identified by the simulation optimization model which could obtain just any mathematically plausible solution thakur and mondal 2016 presented a subnet of response surface methodology named box behnken design to evaluate the optimal experimental conditions for the objective requirement of arsenic removal and operating cost in groundwater remediation optimization system farhadi et al 2016 developed an agent based nash modeling framework including a modflow simulation process an artificial neural network and a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii optimization model the nash bargaining model aimed to find a compromise among modified optimal objectives of the three stakeholders farmers the government executive sector and the environmental protection institutes implementation resulted in 58 3 less water extraction and approximately 3 m water level uplift however the most of optimization researches focus on single objective or multiple but parallel objectives ushijima and yeh 2015 davison et al 2015 seldom focuses on the problem of optimization for multiple objectives arising from different decision levels with leader follower relationships in the groundwater management system bi level programming has been demonstrated to be an effective tool in solving optimal management issues where dual design objectives arise from decision makers at two different levels skulovich et al 2014 taha et al 2014 gang et al 2015 chen et al 2017 for example xu et al 2013 presented a bi level programming model to address a regional water resources allocation problem under fuzzy random environment the application of the bi level model in the gan fu plain irrigation district could demonstrate its practicality and efficiency however there are still very few attempts to use bi level programming for groundwater remediation management more significantly general remediation objectives can hardly be limited to only two levels in fact the objectives should accommodate more levels such as those representative of the concerns of the energy and residential sectors unfortunately neither bi level i e two non completive nor multi objective i e multiple competitive programming can solve these types of management problems multi level decision making has increasingly attracted much attention owing to its capability of representing the requirements of multi level decision makers this further improves the incapability of bi level programming in dealing with enhanced complex dominant subordinate relationships at multiple levels this study aims to develop a multi level nonlinear simulation optimization ml nso model to support optimal groundwater remediation management when three objectives should be satisfied at multiple levels this model is formulated by integrating health risk assessment at the residential concern level mcknight and finkel 2013 tartakovsky 2013 zhang et al 2018 sharma et al 2019 shen et al 2016 energy assessment at the energy concern level and contamination forecasting at the contamination concern level gaur et al 2011 yu et al 2016 within a general framework the design and application of the multi level nonlinear simulation optimization model comprise 1 formulating a groundwater remediation optimization problem which comprises minimizing carcinogenic risk energy consumption and environmental concern with different important levels 2 discussing rational considerations and handling parameter uncertainty in health risk assessment 3 presenting a multi level decision making approach based on satisfactory degree to solve the multi level groundwater optimization problem and 4 applying the developed method to address a real world petroleum contaminated groundwater remediation management problem in canada 2 methodology 2 1 formulation of a simulation optimization multi level model a pump and treat system is established as groundwater remediation technology in this study the system generally contains extraction injection and monitoring wells the extraction wells would carry the contaminated groundwater to the surface and the injection wells would sent the treated water back to the aquifer boal et al 2015 the monitoring wells are used to identify concentrations in contamination plume the varied pumping rates at injection and extraction wells injection rates and extraction rates could compose different remediation strategies and generate different remediation performances therefore the injection and extraction rates are presented as inputs and contamination concentrations at monitoring wells are the resulting outputs fig 1 shows the flowchart of the simulation optimization model for groundwater remediation management problem a general procedure for groundwater remediation model can be summarized as follows step 1 generating a number of simulation scenarios through numerical experiment design based on a three dimensional multiphase multi component simulation model step 2 establishing a set of surrogates based on stepwise quadratic surface analysis to reflect the relationships between the pumping rates and contaminant concentrations and the accuracy of the obtained surrogates would be tested by four statistics root mean square error r2 f value and p value step 3 developing the multi level groundwater remediation optimization based on the surrogates with residential energy environmental concerns step 4 obtaining the optimal solutions under different scenarios by using a multi level decision making approach based on satisfactory degree to support decision makings the multi level programing is an effective approach for dealing with the problems where the multi level decision makers have their targets and performances for the same optimization problem candler and norton 1977a candler and norton 1977b osman et al 2004 baky 2010 in the multi level decision making processes the relative lower level decision maker must follow the relative upper level ones which in turn must attempt to meet the lower level demands in an incentive or disincentive manner for their targets being optimized synchronously tookanlou et al 2015 bahramara et al 2016 a general multi level model with single objective function at each level can be given as follows 1 upper level objective m i n f 1 upper l e v e l x 1 x 2 x 3 c 11 x 1 c 12 x 2 c 13 x 3 s t upper level constraints x 1 x 2 x 3 r where x 2 should be solved from middle level objective m i n f 2 middle l e v e l x 1 x 2 x 3 c 21 x 1 c 22 x 2 c 23 x 3 s t middle level constraints x 1 x 2 x 3 t where x 3 should be solved from lower level objective m i n f 3 lower l e v e l x 1 x 2 x 3 c 31 x 1 c 32 x 2 c 33 x 3 s t lower level constraints x 1 x 2 x 3 h where the vectors x1 x2 and x3 are the upper middle and lower level decision variables respectively f 1 f 2 and f 3 respectively denote the upper middle and lower level objective functions c denotes the constant matrix r t and h denote the sets represented by the upper middle and lower level constraints respectively actually the multi level programming is conceptually theoretically methodologically and physically different from traditional multi objective programing the particular structure of multi level programming facilitates the formulation of a number of practical problems that involve a hierarchical decision making process but the objectives and constraints of multi objective model are always parallel a general multi objective model can be given as follows 2 min f 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 c 11 x 1 c 12 x 2 c 13 x 3 m i n f 2 x 1 x 2 x 3 c 21 x c 22 x 2 c 23 x 3 m i n f 3 x 1 x 2 x 3 c 31 x c 32 x 2 c 33 x 3 s t x 1 x 2 x 3 r x 1 x 2 x 3 t x 1 x 2 x 3 h similar to multi objective programming fuzzy programming and stochastic programming multi level programming is another class of mathematical programming methods no matter in theory or practical decision making multi level programming is completely different from multi objective programming first the relationships among the objectives are different one is competitive without any priority and the other is leader follower related with priority but without competition second they may have completely different decision spaces which has been extensively discussed in many existing studies osman et al 2004 third the latter has pareto optimality but the former has no fourth the latter is still linear by assuming all the constraints and objectives are linear but the former is always nonlinear thus increasing the difficulty in problem solving there are three aspects considered for the groundwater remediation management system involving health risk assessment energy consumption index and environment standard which exhibit different influences the groundwater optimization model mainly aims to reduce contaminant concentrations to the levels of environment standards after remediation the model also focuses on total remediation cost which is an indispensable factor for groundwater optimization and defined as the sum of fixed and operating costs for the general pumping and treat systems the fixed cost could be neglected since it is greatly much lower than the operating one the operating cost is generally generated from pumping rates which comprises injection and extraction rates ayvaz and karahan 2008 the operation of injection and extraction wells depends on to a large extent the consumption of electrical energy therefore the consumption index of electrical energy connecting pumping rate with the remediation cost is incorporated into the modeling framework furthermore human health would be under threat from contaminant concentrations in groundwater especially when it comes to that complex contaminants in petroleum contaminated groundwater have been linked to cancer in response to such a concern health risk assessment with the concern of local residence can be used for measuring the direct and indirect effects complex contaminants in petroleum contaminated groundwater have been linked to cancer therefore carcinogenic risk is the only consideration for health risk assessment during the multi level decision making process the constraints for the upper level objective should include not only its constraints but also those at the lower level the objective at the lower level just satisfies the limiting conditions from the lower level the objective at the upper level satisfies more limiting conditions than that at the lower level therefore the higher level possesses greater significance in this groundwater remediation management system the model is divided into three levels to represent the degree of importance of three factors carcinogenic risk assessment that is designated at the upper level for representing the concern of the local residence electrical energy consumption index that is assigned to the middle level for expressing the energy concern and environmental standards of contaminants that are placed at the lower level for exhibiting the concern of environment contamination fig 2 shows the multi level structure of groundwater remediation optimization 1 upper or leader level residential concern level carcinogenic risk assessment is assigned on the upper level attributed to its greater importance as compared with other considerations the minimum of average carcinogenic risk at all the monitoring wells in the entire contaminated region is regarded as the objective carcinogenic risk can be calculated by evaluating several monitoring wells each carcinogenic risk should be subjected to an acceptable risk standard usepa recommendations the upper level can thus be formulated as 3a min t c r i s k i 1 i mc r i i 3b s t m c r i r a c c 3c mc r i sf m c i i r e f e d 1000 a t b w where tcrisk is total carcinogenic risk mcr is a carcinogenic risk at a monitoring well racc is maximum value of acceptable carcinogenic risk sf is slope factor which is expressed as the carcinogenic risk per unit dose in unit of the inverse of milligrams of the substance or chemical per kilogram of body weight per day ef is exposure frequency ir is ingestion rate bw is body weight ed is exposure duration at is averaging time mc is monitoring concentration of contaminant which can be solved through hybrid numerical simulation and stepwise response surface analysis i is number i monitoring well i is amount of total monitoring wells 2 middle or follower for the upper and leader for the lower level energy concern level the minimum consumption index of electrical energy is the middle level objective and this index is a function of the total pumping rate preliminary studies indicated that statistical coefficients of a linear relationship are altered when total the pumping rate exceeds a certain critical value furthermore total extraction and injection rates should be equal to maintain a stable hydraulic gradient under this condition groundwater flow can be directed toward the plume interior and clean water can be injected within a specified pumping period thus the middle level can be formulated as 4a min d e e c f d t p r 4b s t d t p r j 1 j e r j m 1 m i r m 4c deec f j 1 j e

daily total pumping rate dtpr is the critical value of dtpr if dtpr is lower than dtpr deec is the function of the upper equation conversely deec is the function of the lower equation er and ir are extraction and injection rates respectively j is number j extraction well m is number m injection well j and m are amount of total extraction and injection wells respectively αandβare statistic coefficients eep 3 lower level or follower environmental concern level environmental standards are the lower level concern with a minimum average contaminant concentration as the objective contaminant concentrations in each monitoring well should be lower than the acceptable levels contaminant concentration at a monitoring well in groundwater exhibits a non linear relationship with extraction and injection rates stepwise quadratic response surface analysis is introduced to deal with the non linear equation the injection and extraction rates are inputs and contaminant concentration in each monitoring well is output of the surrogate based on simulation and stepwise quadratic response analysis a series of surrogate equations between contamination concentrations and injection and extraction rates can be obtained finally the objective should be subjected to technical constraints that is injection and extraction rates should be limited within a desired boundary range thus the lower level can be formulated as 5a min f c i 1 i m c i i 5b s t m c i c c a c c 5c m c i c 0 i j 1 j c j i e r j m 1 m c m i i r m j 1 j j 1 j c j j i e r j e r j m 1 m m 1 m c m m i i r m i r m j 1

making approach based on satisfactory degree sf is an inexact parameter because it generally results from numerous toxicity experiments on animals it is thus difficult to accurately estimate its value in humans in carcinogenic risk assessment li et al 2014 the average sf value for benzene can be determined as 0 029 recommended by the usepa moreover benzene is the only carcinogen and tex are not determined carcinogens according to the guideline of usepa the values of slope factor for tex are not calculated and recommended by usepa therefore three values representing low medium and high confidence levels of the cancer slope factor were determined for benzene the sequence of decision making is from the top to middle and then to the bottom level correspondingly reflecting the local residence energy to contamination concerns the upper level decision maker accepts suggestions from the lower level decision maker each decision maker seeks his own interests within the tolerance limit set by the upper levels decision makers at each level are fully informed of the resolutions of those at the upper level consequently a supervised upper to lower level search procedure can generate a non dominated satisfactory solution for the multi level optimization problem fig 3 describes the decision procedure of multi level groundwater remediation model based on satisfactory degree first the objective of the residential level should be independently minimized subject to the total constraints containing those of the residential energy and environmental levels but the objectives of the energy and environmental levels are ignored the obtained results under this circumstance are regarded as the ideal solution of tcrisk and the proposed ideal solution is designated as tcrideal second the objective of the energy level should be minimized subject to constraints which are in the energy and environmental levels in this case the objective of the energy level and the entire components of the residential level are excluded the energy level solves its problem independently and obtains its ideal solution eecideal third the environmental level obtains its optimal solution fcideal independently and entirely neglects the residential and energy levels however the three ideal solutions are most probably inconsistent because of the conflicts among the three concerns this supposition suggests that the optimal decision is found at tcrideal but the residential level should reassess the tolerance or indefiniteness of this decision at a certain boundary of an interval decisions made outside the boundary are not acceptable therefore a triangular membership function indicated by a satisfactory degree and based on a tolerance degree can be formulated as follows 7 γ 1 if t c r i s k t c r ideal racc t c r i s k racc t c r ideal if t c r ideal t c r i s k r a c c 0 if r a c c t c r i s k where γ is the satisfactory degree of the residential level similarly the other two satisfactory degrees indicate the memberships of the energy and environmental levels based on a given tolerance 8 μ 1 if d e e c e e c ideal eecacc d e e c eecacc e e c ideal if e e c ideal d e e c e e c a c c 0 if e e c a c c d e e c 9 φ 1 if f c f c ideal ccacc f c ccacc f c ideal if f c ideal f c f c a c c 0 if f c a c c f c where μ and φ are satisfactory degrees of the middle and lower objectives eecacc is the boundary is the maximum value of the acceptable energy consumption ccacc is the boundary is the maximum value of the acceptable contaminant concentration in order to satisfy all the degrees of satisfactions which are usually in conflict with one another γ μ and φ should be maximized simultaneously hence the multi level objective is transformed as follows 10 max λ 11 λ m i n γ μ φ the objective should be simultaneously maximized subject to all constraints of the upper middle and lower levels with the three triangular membership functions therefore the model can be

significant hydrocarbon effects have been reported in this area because of drainage leakage and blow down fluids of subsurface facilities based on excessive development of the petroleum industry eep some of these effects are relatively simple yet others may have long term implications over time attributed to their cumulative effects on soil groundwater as well as human health a sound remediation strategies pertinent to such effects is thus needed to implement pump and treat system was selected as the main groundwater remediation technology due to its simplification and high effectiveness on contamination removal the system generally contains extraction injection and monitoring wells two injection wells were placed at the upstream of the contaminated plume four extraction wells were placed at the downstream of the contaminated plume around the contamination sources the injection wells were used to send treated water back to groundwater and the extraction wells were used to pump the contaminated groundwater to water treatment facility on surface moreover eight monitoring wells were used to detect the concentrations of benzene compounds the three kinds of wells have already existed fig 4 5 and 10 years of remediation durations were taken into consideration as timeframes the simulation results indicated that the concentrations of toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes tex decreased to below their respective environment standards once benzene concentration satisfied the designated limits moreover benzene exhibited higher toxicity and carcinogenicity than the other three contaminants as a consequence benzene concentrations were considered only in the optimization model a part of surrogates of monitoring wells m1 m4 between benzene contamination concentrations and the injection extraction rates are shown in table 1 besides on site characteristics the pumping rates at all injection and extraction wells were set below 100 m3 hr 3 1 variation of satisfaction degree in this model three key parameters including probability distributions of sf racc and ccacc may have important implications for the final optimal strategies varied racc and ccacc represent the changes in the risk and concentration constraints many groundwater standards are established by different countries and vary with different spatial locations and functions such as agriculture and forest areas freshwater to support aquatic life drinking water and so on carcinogenic risk values lower than 0 0001 represent the absence of threat to human health sf is based on numerous scientific studies and characteristics of the contaminated site hence obtaining the true value of sf is impractical therefore single factor analysis of the three parameters was conducted fig 5 in this analysis one parameter varies while the other parameters are maintained constant figs 5a and 5b show the satisfactory degrees of the three objectives obtained from the model under different racc and ccacc the two subfigures display similar variation trends first the satisfactory degree of energy consumption shows no significant variation with changes from the low to the middle value of risk or concentration however high values of constraints lead to a considerable high satisfactory degree of energy consumption this shows that the extraction and injection rates rapidly decrease meanwhile second the constraints and satisfactory degrees of energy consumption and contaminant concentration do not linearly increase because of the effect of the other constraints results of the middle constraint are superior to those of the high value constraints third the high satisfactory degree of carcinogenic risk is maintained with the changes in the risk and concentration constraints the satisfactory degree of energy consumption is the determining factor under high value of the constraints whereas the satisfactory degree of contaminant concentration is the determining factor under remaining values of the constraints subfigure 5c shows the satisfactory degrees of the three objectives at the low medium and high level of sf with uncertainty the results at low level are the closest to the value of sf recommended by usepa whereas those at high level possess high reliability the satisfactory degree of contaminant concentration remains nearly unchanged across the three levels however the other satisfactory degrees dramatically decline from the low to medium levels the satisfactory degree of carcinogenic risk rapidly increases from medium to high level thus it is concluded that uncertainty of sf influence the final optimal strategies especially on carcinogenic risk decision makers should hence include this aspect into careful consideration 3 2 analyses of extraction and injection rates the effects of the racc and ccacc are similar therefore racc and ccacc were combined in pairs and divided into three restriction classes that is loose middle and strict classes table 2 under the three levels of sf these classes generate several predicted scenarios the optimal strategies were evaluated under these scenarios fig 6 shows each extraction and injection rate at the extraction and injection wells under these scenarios at 5 and 10 year remediation duration figs 6a 6b and 6c present each pumping rate at extraction and injection wells with strict middle and loose classes of restriction respectively differences in extraction and injection rate were detected between the 5 and 10 year remediation durations overall extraction and injection rates do not decrease under the 10 year remediation compared with those of the 5 year remediation because of strict restrictions fig 6a even at high level of sf the rates at 5 year remediation are lower than those of the 10 year remediation meanwhile the rates at 5 year remediation duration exceed those of the 10 year duration in fig 6b but the difference is not significant under loose restriction the rates between the 5 and 10 year remediation exhibit huge disparity fig 6c a long remediation period possesses significant advantages on energy consumption under this scenario therefore high extraction and injection rates are required under strict and middle restrictions however long remediation duration does not guarantee absolute benefit in energy consumption decision makers should carefully balance between the time and costs for groundwater remediation management five years of remediation is a relatively appropriate option extraction and injection wells play different roles in the groundwater remediation management system for the two injection wells the injection rates of qi1 and qi2 are mainly maintained at stable states the total injection rate is roughly equally split between qi1 and qi2 the two injection wells are often nearly in full operation however the four extraction wells show completely different situations these differences are primarily manifested in two aspects the extraction rates at the extraction wells considerably vary under the three classes of restrictions and levels of sf despite similar remediation duration and the values from qe1 to qe3 fluctuate remarkably although the classes of restriction and levels of sf remained unchanged the extraction rate of extraction well 4 approaches 0 in most scenarios this finding means that extraction well 4 was left unused results from the loose restriction indicate that extraction rate is mainly contributed by extraction wells 1 and 3 with the other two classes of restriction the extraction rate is reasonably assigned to extraction wells 1 2 and 3 in summary injection wells 1 and 2 play primary roles in the groundwater remediation management system these wells should hence be the focus during decision making certain extraction wells should also be particularly emphasized on the basis of variations in restrictions and levels of sf the removal of extraction well 4 from the groundwater remediation management system may be considered 3 3 predicted carcinogenic risks and contaminant concentrations based on the combinations among the three classes of restrictions and confidence levels the predicted distributions of carcinogenic risks and contaminant concentrations are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively each subfigure describes the predicted results under a scenario composed of a certain class restriction and confidence level the combinations of the three classes of restriction and three levels of sf resulted in a total of nine scenarios fig 7 depicts the distribution of carcinogenic risk after 5 years of remediation whereas fig 8 illustrates the distribution of benzene concentration after 10 years of remediation as the level of sf directly influences carcinogenic risk three subfigures at the top middle and bottom of figs 7 and 8 depict the distribution of carcinogenic risk and benzene concentration with low medium and high levels of sf respectively horizontal comparison of subfigures has different simulation results with different restriction classes under these nine scenarios composed of three restriction classes and three levels of sf contamination region with carcinogenic risk mainly locates at the right of the study area fig 7 the left of the study area will not have carcinogenic risks two regions possessing high carcinogenic risks are both situated at the downstream groundwater flow of contamination sources with about 50 m one is around monitoring wells 2 and 4 attains relatively higher carcinogenic risks than those of other regions the other is around monitoring wells 5 and 7 extraction well 1 is close to them meanwhile the other areas comprise the low risk zone similar results could be found in fig 8 in most of the scenarios the areas around monitoring wells 2 4 5 and 7 exhibit higher benzene concentrations than those of the other areas by contrast monitoring wells 1 and 3 show low benzene concentrations monitoring well 8 is located within a safe zone in most of the scenarios the trend provides scientific basis for rational land use planning decision makers should allot the low carcinogenic risk regions to human activity areas 3 4 comparison with traditional single level multi objective level optimization traditional single level nonlinear simulation optimization sl nso and multi objective nonlinear simulation optimization mo nso models are introduced to compare remediation performance with ml nso sl nso aims to determine the total carcinogenic risk tcrisk similar to that of the upper level of ml nso the constraints of sl nso are all the constraints of ml nso in the three levels in particular for sl nso the consumption index of electrical energy and the final contaminant concentration are not limited in the groundwater remediation management system however the consumption index of electrical energy and contaminant concentration can still be obtained the mo nso can be formulated as follows 13 objectives min t c r i s k i 1 i mc r i i m i n d e e c f d t p r m i n f c i 1 i m c i i s t mc r i r a c c j 1 j e r j m 1 m i r m m c i c c a c c 0 e r j r m a 0 i r m r m a comparison between the calculation results of sl nso and the forecasted optimal remediation strategies of ml nso are shown in fig 9 number 1 represents the results from sl nso number 2 represents the results from ml nso the 10 year period was selected as the remediation duration in this case with low medium and high levels of sf horizontal comparison among the three subfigures indicated that ml nso exhibits a certain advantage over sl nso the predicted performances of ml nso exhibit lower final carcinogenic risk and contaminant concentration compared with those of sl nso by contrast the consumption index of electrical energy predicted by ml nso is higher than that from sl nso in most scenarios figures 9d 9e and 9f show that the carcinogenic risk and contaminant concentration of ml nso are slightly lower than those of sl nso at low and medium levels of sf at the high level of sf the three objectives are nearly the same between ml nso and sl nso similar tendencies are displayed in figures 9 g 9 h and 9i furthermore high satisfactory degrees of carcinogenic risk are maintained longitudinal comparison of subfigures was performed with three different constraint classes of racc and ccacc first satisfactory degrees of the three objectives especially carcinogenic risk are mostly at a high level the satisfactory degrees of carcinogenicity can reach 100 under several scenarios under strict scenarios the satisfactory degrees of carcinogenic risk can indicate distinctions to a certain extent second the consumption index of electrical energy and contaminant concentration express obvious disparity between ml nso and sl nso for example the consumption index of electrical energy of sl nso is higher than that of ml nso at a medium confidence interval however opposite results are obtained at a high confidence interval figure 9b third the consumption index of electrical energy obtained from sl nso is lower than that from ml nso whereas contaminant concentration of ml nso is lower than that of sl nso under a number of scenarios these findings demonstrate that the consumption index of electrical energy and contaminant concentration as the objectives of the energy and environmental levels respectively exert significant influences on the final optimal strategy optimal strategies of ml nso are more suitable for the development of contemporary environmentalism than that of sl nso comparison of ml nso with traditional single level nonlinear optimization sl nso whose objective is energy consumption generally shows that the energy consumption would be slightly increased by 18 93 however this can be fordable since the contamination concentration would be decreased by 32 87 and the carcinogenic risk can be lowered by 35 62 this suggests that ml nso would assign higher priority on the residential and environmental concerns by tolerating a slight rise in energy cost in general ml nso has the advantages of not only simultaneously dealing with multiple remediation objectives but also handling the leader follower relationships among them fig 10 describes the generated optimal levels of three objectives health risk energy consumption and contaminant concentration concerns between ml nso and mo nso under 5 year remediation first the generated tcrisk representing health risk concern of ml nso is less than or equal to that of mo nso under the whole scenarios subfigure 10 a under several scenarios the tcrisk values of the two optimization approaches are almost same typically tcrisk of ml nso is nearly half of tcrisk of mo nso when sf is medium and constraint of ccacc and racc is high second by contrast the generated deec representing energy consumption concern of ml nso is higher than that of mo nso subfigure 10 b the largest distinction between two optimization approaches appears when sf is low and constraint of ccacc and racc is medium deec of ml nso is more than 2 5 times than that of mo nso third results of the generated fc representing contaminant concentration concern of two optimization approaches are quite opposite to the health risk and energy consumption concern the generated fc of mo nso is approximately more than 2 3 times than that of ml nso the fc of ml nso fluctuates at 6 µg l under most scenarios however the fc of mo nso ranges from 17 to 66 µg l which is much higher than that of ml nso therefore results of health risk and contaminant concentration derived from mo nso are higher than those derived from ml nso but energy consumption of mo nso is better than that of ml nso the results of multi objective are more balanced than those of ml nso among the health risk energy consumption and contaminant concentration concerns the ml nso could generate a health risk and contaminant concentration emphasized remediation performance the ml nso usually results in relative lower benefits compared with mo nso but it is generally accompanied by better environmental and health risk benefits and it is acceptable to obtain a better environmental quality and a lower health risk level with sacrificing a certain economic benefit 4 conclusions this study develops a novel multi level nonlinear simulation optimization ml nso model for groundwater remediation management the upper level model describes the health risk assessment for the residential concern leader the middle level model centers mostly on energy consumption for the energy concern level follower for the upper and leader for the lower while the lower level model focuses on contamination forecasting for the environmental concern level follower such a multi level modeling framework can not only elevate incapability of bi level methods in addressing enhanced complex leader follower relationships among different stakeholders but also better reflect the environmental impacts caused by groundwater contamination an improved multi level interactive solution algorithm based on satisfactory degree is then introduced into the decision making process for balancing to what extent the constraints are met and the objective reaches its optimal with consideration of parameter uncertainty this is the first attempt to apply the developed ml nso model to a real world petroleum contaminated groundwater remediation management in canada results obtained from the developed ml nso model can a generate non compromised solutions in association with the optimal strategies regarding groundwater injection and extraction b identify the temporal and spatial distribution of contaminant concentration and carcinogenic risks and evaluating the resulting electrical energy consumption and c address the conflict trade off among residential energy and environmental requirements moreover the performance of the ml nso model is highlighted by comparing with single level nonlinear simulation optimization sl nso and multi objective nonlinear simulation optimization mo nso models results show that ml nso model results in relative lower benefits compared with mo nso but it is generally accompanied by better environmental and health risk benefits and it is acceptable to obtain a better environmental quality and a lower health risk level with sacrificing a certain economic benefit the ml nso model would provide more comprehensive and systematic policies attributable to its hierarchical structure for expressing a leader follower relationship system the ml nso model could be beneficial for public health and environmental protection however two aspects are expected to be fulfilled for improvement in the further researches the influence of parameter uncertainty at each level should be taken into consideration in the general framework more appropriate strategies close to the real ones would be obtained with incorporation of such uncertainties on the other hand the remediation objectives are not limited to merely three more objectives from more than three levels will thus be employed to handle more leader follower relationships among them

6726,in this study a review of the overlay index methods served for delineation of vulnerable zones in coastal aquifers affected by swi is provided then a more realistic presentation of the vulnerability mapping of coastal aquifers to swi through modified galdit index method by incorporating the influential factors on swi is established the modifications on galdit method including incorporating the seaward hydraulic gradient i instead of the height of groundwater level above sea level l so called gaidit and considering hydraulic gradient i as an additional parameter to the galdit so called galdit i three galdit gaidit and galdit i methods were evaluated with data from three coastal confined and phreatic confined aquifers located in the south of the caspian sea northern iran while no highly vulnerable zone was recognized by galdit method across three studied aquifers averagely 43 4 and 50 5 of aquifers area were defined as highly vulnerable zones by gaidit and galdit i respectively furthermore the final vulnerability maps obtained by galdit i and then gaidit indicates higher correlation by three groundwater quality indices specific to swi including f sea r 0 72 and 0 63 and g q i r 0 69 and 0 62 and also the distribution of tds in groundwater r 0 71 and 0 61 compared with galdit r 0 33 0 42 and 0 36 respectively the values of vulnerability index obtained by galdit i and gaidit are more strongly correlated with the length of swi into the aquifer l x based on strack s analytical approach than galdit r 0 52 0 36 and 0 32 respectively the results of sensitivity analysis indicated that the hydraulic gradient height of groundwater level above sea level aquifer type and existing status of seawater intrusion has the greatest impact on the groundwater vulnerability across the studied aquifers by galdit i and gaidit methods results also indicated that serving the influential parameters in galdit methods regarding the hydrological and anthropogenic characteristics across the aquifer provide a more realistic characterization of the swi this modification leads to an accurate aquifer vulnerability mapping to swi in aquifers characterized by

al 2018 while more than 45 of the world s population i e 2 69 109 people in 2018 august resides within the 100 km landward of coastline the average population density apd of czs in 2000 87 people km 2 is nearly four times greater than inland areas 23 people km 2 shi and singh 2003 fernandino et al 2018 the projected apd by unesco 2003 in czs and inland areas are 115 and 44 people km 2 respectively by 2025 czs comprise 20 of the earth s surface and the same time is the location of 75 of megacities with more than 10 million inhabitants czs are also a major destination for coastal and maritime tourism nearly 80 of all tourism takes place in coastal areas 16 5 million visitors yearly with a growth rate of 17 since 1989 crossland et al 2003 kantamaneni 2016 the pressure for further development in czs requires additional water resources to meet growing demands in these areas the demographic pressure and the high level of urbanization cause high water demand which is increasingly met by groundwater furthermore human activities cause groundwater depletion triggering seawater intrusion and pollutant dispersion parisi et al 2018 therefore the protection of groundwater resources in czs as a valuable freshwater resources in these areas requires cautious measures in particular in arid and semi arid parts of the world costanza et al 1997 fuentesa et al 2018 seawater intrusion swi is among the main threatening factors for the quantity and quality of groundwater resources in coastal aquifers worldwide swi is the landward movement of saline water into coastal aquifers and usually shows seasonal oscillation due to human and climate forced factors xiao et al 2016 baena ruiz et al 2018 readers are referred to some of the recent review papers in the literature for further information werner et al 2013 have provided a comprehensive review of swi processes ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 reviewed coastal groundwater optimization methods for managing swi into coastal aquifers more recently ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 reviewed sea level rise slr impacts on swi in coastal aquifers a type of popular and easy to use approach in the study of swi vulnerability assessments is the indexing method klassen and allen 2017 only a few published guidance could be found for rapidly assessing the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to swi at regional scales i e aquifer scale particularly in the case of insufficient long term data kallioras et al 2011 kura et al 2014 luoma et al 2017 kazakis et al 2018 galdit method is an acronym standing for six incorporated indicators including aquifer type g hydraulic conductivity of aquifer a height of groundwater level above sea level l distance from the shoreline d some hydrogeochemical evidence about the presence of swi such as ec and ion of c l i and saturated thickness of aquifer t chachadi and lobo ferreira 2007 this method is among the most popular methods for this purpose and it gives relatively accurate results for assessing the vulnerability of large scale regions with complex in geological settings to swi panagopoulos et al 2006 galdit uses simple indicators with easy to collect data that follows also the parsimony principle lobo ferreira et al 2007 a summary of the recent studies that used overlay index o i methods to delineate the vulnerability of coastal aquifer to swi is provided in table 1 based on the review of the previous studies a variety of o i methods including original and modified forms of galdit chachadi and lobo ferreira 2007 drastic allen et al 1987 sintacs civita and de maio 2004 and avi van stempvoort et al 1992 have been used for mapping the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to swi due to both natural and anthropogenic factors galdit method provides quite effective and reasonable results compared to the other afore mentioned methods due to involving the hydro dynamic condition of the aquifer e g permeability and groundwater level trabelsi et al 2016 this method provides promising results based on hydrogeochemical indications for the aquifers that are strongly impacted by recharge and exploitation rate and also slr due to climate change xiao et al 2016 luoma et al 2017 and storm surges yang et al 2013 whereas the other methods e g drastic and sintacs are better suited to consider the vulnerability due to anthropogenic factors e g contamination from the surface they have no parameters that relate to contamination from swi kallioras et al 2011 allouche et al 2017 table 1 shows that the most important factors for evaluating the vulnerability of the coastal aquifers to swi are height of groundwater level above sea level pedreira et al 2015 recinos et al 2015 luoma et al 2017 hazards due to climate change i e slr and overexploitation of aquifers lobo ferreira et al 2005 mahesha et al 2012 and pumping rate docheshmeh gorji and asghari moghadam 2016 klassen and allen 2017 the proficiency of galdit among the other o i methods to map the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to swi especially in absence of anthropogenic contamination from aquifer surface is revealed from the table 1 key findings column the drawbacks of i o methods are the use of qualitative parameters e g groundwater occurrence in galdit a large amount of data required especially for galdit and sintacs and a few vulnerability categorizations ivkovic et al 2013 luoma et al 2017 moreover they need appropriate indicators for checking the model robustness and verification kazakis et al 2018 and adopting a spatial interpolation method for observed point data across the aquifer saidi et al 2013 and subjectivity in selecting the weights of different attributes kallioras et al 2011 the i o methods require to serve the most influential factors on swi according to inherent susceptibility and anthropogenic factors werner et al 2012 klassen and allen 2017 motevalli et al 2018 table 1 reveals that the verification of the vulnerability mapped output has been checked by comparison of the results with hydrogeochemical data from groundwater samples whereas choosing the best verifying indicator is still a challenge kazakis et al 2018 for the coastal aquifers with overexploitation of groundwater the seaward hydraulic gradient is the most important variable controlling the seawater toe location and also provides the major source of fresh groundwater discharge to sea werner et al 2012 ferguson and gleeson 2012 holding and allen 2015 comte et al 2016 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 however the galdit method serves the height of groundwater level above sea level as an alternate indicator but fluctuations of the hydraulic gradient driven by changes in transient recharge discharge components indicates higher correlation with groundwater salinity especially across the coastline anderson and emanuel 2010 gonneea et al 2013 awareness of the impact of the hydraulic gradient on swi it is not yet included directly in the o i method to delineation of vulnerability zones over aquifer scale this study was motivated by the need to provide a more accurate mapping of the vulnerability of large scale coastal aquifers to swi by introducing more influential hydrological factors in an o i approach for the first time it attempts to evaluate the utilization of seaward hydraulic gradient of groundwater flow i as an influential indicator in galdit method accordingly an alternative quantitative indicator i is served in the original form of galdit model one time instead of height of groundwater level above sea level l so called gaidit and another time as an additional input parameter so called galdit i the efficiency of three models galdit gaidit and galdit i in generating vulnerability based on annual averaged data and time evolution hazard based on seasonal data mapping are evaluated by the application of the methods on three confined and semi confined coastal aquifers in the southern coast of the caspian sea iran the verification of the final vulnerability maps produced by three methods over three studied aquifers was carried out using three groundwater chemical indicators of fresh and seawater and also the length of the seawater intrusion at the point beneath the shoreline into the aquifer section based on strack 1976 analytical solution the meaningfulness of the incorporated parameters into three models galdit gaidit and galdit i for vulnerability mapping of aquifers to swi are also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 galdit approach galdit is an overlay index method to assess the spatial intrinsic vulnerability of coastal aquifer systems to seawater intrusion developed based on a parametric system with rating scores and weights for six most important factors controlling seawater intrusion chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 a summary of parameter weights rates and ranges used in galdit method are given in table 2 originally chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 suggested the ratio of c l h c o 3 c o 3 2 for rating the impact status of the existing swi later dörfliger et al 2011 and luoma et al 2017 added ec values and cl concentration of groundwater from wells along the coastline as alternative indices of existing swi and reclassified the related rates in each grid cell each parameter was rated as r i based on its vulnerability to seawater intrusion being 2 5 lowest vulnerability 5 7 5 and 10 highest vulnerability these assigned rating parameters were multiplied by the weight strings w i being 1 lowest significant parameter to 4 highest significant parameter to obtain final vulnerability index in each grid chachadi 2005 1 g a l d i t i 1 6 w i r i i 1 6 w i the galdit index categorized in three classes low 5 moderate 5 7 5 and high vulnerability 10 2 2 modifications to galdit in this study two modifications are made on the input parameters of the galdit model 1 replacing the height of groundwater level above sea level l with the seaward hydraulic gradient i d h d x i e gaidit method and 2 serving the parameter i as an additional parameter into the galdit model i e galdit i method hydraulic gradient a vector having both a direction and magnitude represents the slope of the water table or potentiometric surface and is the driving force for groundwater flow within an aquifer beljin et al 2014 previous studies e g loaciga et al 2012 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 demonstrated through the analytical and numerical models that the dominant factors controlling the seawater toe location are the magnitudes of fresh groundwater discharge to sea parameter q in fig 1 recharge rate slr landward hydraulic head aquifer thickness density difference ratio of freshwater and seawater and slope of aquifer bed respectively in this study hydraulic gradient i at each point is estimated by h s w h l w x where h s w l and h l w l is seaward and landward hydraulic head or potentiometric surface respectively and x l is aquifer length landward or seaward direction of i is defined by its negative and positive sign respectively the hydraulic gradient inflexion point i e the interface between landward and seaward direction of i is a key factor in determining the degree of swi fetter 2001 spatiotemporal changes in i can be due to changes in aquifer recharge from the ground surface pumping rates of nearby water supply wells or changes in nearby surface water elevations and also transmissivity of the aquifer ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 in this study the seaward values of i i e positive values are rated and embedded in the galdit model instead of parameter l based on studies of fetter 2001 and thereafter werner 2017 seaward freshwater flow causing passive swi class which is frequently observed in the confined aquifers as also observed in the studied aquifers whereas both seaward and landward freshwater flow causing both active and passive swi classes the modifications on the input parameters of the galdit method are also shown schematically in fig 2 therefore based on improvements on the galdit for producing the vulnerability mapping of a coastal aquifer to swi the gaidit uses six input parameters including groundwater occurrence g aquifer hydraulic conductivity a seaward hydraulic gradient of freshwater i distance from the shoreline d impact of the existing status of seawater intrusion i and aquifer saturated thickness t as input parameters whereas the galdit i model uses seven parameters g a l d i t and i as input the vulnerability ratings used for the parameters g a l d i and t are the same as the galdit method and are presented in table 1 the vulnerability ratings adopted in this study for the parameter i are presented in table 2 the inputs processes and steps required to be followed to apply two indices of galdit gaidit and galdit i for vulnerability mapping of coastal aquifers to swi are schematized in fig 2 the procedure includes collecting information maps and raw data e g well logs hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters of aquifers groundwater and seawater quality implementing interpolation processes in gis environment required to establish the distributed parameters over aquifer in form of raster maps rating the parameters according to table 1 producing the vulnerability maps of coastal aquifers by calculating the indices of galdit gaidit and galdit i integrating the weighted layers of considered parameters in each method accuracy assessment of produced vulnerability maps by comparing the spatial distribution of vulnerability indices values some important factors of swi presence developed based on groundwater quality parameters including total dissolved solids tds groundwater quality index g q i fraction of seawater f s e a and the length of the seawater intrusion into the aquifer section l x and sensitivity analysis of all incorporated parameters in two vulnerability indices 2 3 study area to compare and evaluate the galdit gaidit and galdit i approaches in the vulnerability mapping of the coastal aquifer to swi three coastal aquifers astaneh koochesfahan as ko fomanat and lahijan chaboksar la ch along the southern coast of caspian sea at the northern part of iran are considered due to the availability of enough required data fig 3 shows the location of three studied aquifers and exploration and piezometric wells the aquifers are in south caspian sea basin and known as a part of the alborz tectonical range in alpine fold belt due to the influence of mediterranean air masses three plains receive high rainfall 1000 mm annually according to geologic cross section of three aquifers shown in fig 4 fomanat aquifer with area of 2027 km 2 is a fully confined aquifer whereas as ko with area of 2027 km 2 and la ch with area of 2027 km 2 are confined phreatic aquifers respectively grwa 2015 report no 8353 111 table 3 summarizes the hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry characteristics of the studied aquifers based on the geology map of alborz zone at scale of 1 100000 provided by geological survey and mineral explorations of iran gsi 1997 three aquifers covered by late pleistocene and holocene quaternary age well sorted deposits

coverage of fluvial deposits 1 6 in as ko according to stocklin 1968 the three plains are located in a tectonically active area the surface slopes of three plains are less than 2 which are categorized as flat plains davis 1987 the groundwater level in three aquifers near the caspian sea north parts is below the msl mean caspian sea level is 26 5 m below msl see also table 3 according to monitoring networks of piezometers the groundwater level of three aquifers indicates insignificant decline 0 1 m annually during the last 20 years 1994 2013 the groundwater flow in three aquifers has a general direction from the south to north i e the caspian sea northeast and northwest based on previous tracer tests grwa 2015 in the studied aquifers groundwater quality sampling was conducted by guilan regional water authority gwra during 2002 2011 through 23 in la ch 44 in fomanat and 19 in as ko piezometric wells the southern caspian sea is characterized by salinities of nearly 8 0 0 5 g l in the west to 13 0 0 5 g l in the east which increases from the surface to the bottom of the sea leroy et al 2007 even with this low salinity boundary the coastal aquifers are faced with swi due to the presence of relict connate seawater within the permeable holocene sediments of the semi confined aquifers kosarev and yablonskaya 1994 additionally the freshwater demands for agricultural and domestic water are mostly supplied by groundwater exploitation of the coastal aquifers because of accessibility low depth of groundwater as shown in table 3 and high storage capacity of the groundwater in these alluvial aquifers gholami et al 2010 2 4 verification of vulnerability maps to avoid flawed decisions and subjective environmental assessments on the final vulnerability maps verification of the produced vulnerability indices by the galdit gaidit and galdit i methods with the measured data is necessary three considered aquifers have long term hydrogeochemical data and this allows to define different indices according to fig 2 four indices including spatial distribution of t d s in groundwater fraction of seawater f sea into groundwater groundwater quality indices g q i and the length of the seawater intrusion at the into the aquifer section l x serve to verify the produced vulnerability maps the following describes how the indices of f sea g q i and l x are developed 1 fraction of seawater f sea since chloride c l and sodium n a make up nearly 85 of the total ionic composition of seawater increasing c l concentration within the aquifer can be used as an indicator for swi richter and kreitler 1993 fraction of seawater f sea introduced by appelo and postma 2005 is used as a verification parameter to assess the produced vulnerability maps 2 f sea c l i c l f w c l s w c

ranging from 0 to 1 denotes to freshwater and seawater respectively fraction of seawater index f sea fails to identify hydrogeochemical reactions associated with swi that can mostly affect the ionic composition of groundwater in coastal aquifers appelo and willemsen 1987 these reactions including cation exchanges dolomitization and sulfate reduction which produce c a 2 s 2 and h c o 3 ions panteleit et al 2011 2 groundwater quality indices g q i alkaline groundwater in coastal aquifers may have a high concentration of c l due to swi but be less saline therefore besides electrical conductivity ec of groundwater in the aquifers as a simple indicator of salinity two groundwater quality indices g q i m i x and g q i d o m developed by tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 are used to aggregate hydrochemical data of different ions 3 g q i m i x c a 2 m g 2 t c h c o 3 t a 50 4 g q i d o m n a k t c h c o 3 t a 50 where t c and t a are concentration of total cations and anions in groundwater respectively the concentrations of ions in eqs 3 and 4 are meq l the indices g q i m i x and g q i d o m range from 0 representing saline water and c a c l water type respectively to 100 representing fresh water and n a h c o 3 water type respectively to group the essential character of groundwater quality into different domains the calculated values of g q i m i x and g q i d o m are presented on the diamond field of piper diagram piper 1944 singhal and gupta 2010 fig 5 the domains resulted including i ii iii iv v vi representing water type of c a h c o 3 n a c l mixed c a n a h c o 3 mixed c

identify the swi and hydrogeochemical pathways in the coastal aquifers based on major ions relevant in groundwater appelo and postma 2005 3 the length of the seawater intrusion into the aquifer l x when the steady state salinity distribution occurs after the inland movement of saline water freshwater interface the parameter l x offers an insight into the propensity for swi and understanding the vulnerability of a coastal environment zhou 2011 werner et al 2012 moreover l x allows to consider the instability in interface position through future stresses e g change in recharge due to climate change or over extraction by the pumping nofal et al 2015 the parameter l x can be derived from the steady state sharp interface equations of strack 1976 1989 for an unconfined and confined coastal aquifer experiencing distributed recharge and with the conditions that shown in fig 1 the freshwater groundwater discharge to the sea q l 2 t 1 based on the method developed by strack 1976 1989 is as

parameters of q w net δ k z 0 and h 0 to delineate the length of the seawater intrusion into the aquifer which may differ for the points with same distance from the shoreline it is noteworthy that in

the substantially alter the chemical mixture of local groundwater around the well poulsen et al 2018 this may introducing erroneous and misleading results for better understanding and construction of the swi process and location mcmillan et al 2014 water sampling from these wells should be taken after an enough pumping period to sure fully purging of ifr so the well yields native groundwater cook et al 2017 before verifying the produced vulnerability maps by galdit gaidit and galdit i with indices of tds f sea g q i and length of swi into the aquifer l x independence of these data should be tested multicollinearity statistics mct including variance inflation factor vif and tolerance value of determination coefficient tv belsley et al 1980 are conducted in statistical package for the social sciences software spss version 16 spss inc 2001 to test the independence of final vulnerability scores and corresponding values of tds f sea g q i and l x in three studied aquifers 2 5 preparation of vulnerability indicators 2 5 1 groundwater occurrence aquifer type g the extent of swi depends on the type of the aquifer in the study area i e confined unconfined leaky confined and bounded table 2 a confined aquifer is more prone to swi due to the instantaneous release of water to wells during pumping and also the larger cone of depression further adds the vulnerability according to chachadi and lobo ferreira 2007 if multiple aquifers are present in an area i e aquifers as ko and la ch as shown in table 3 the highest rating score 10 can be adopted therefore the assigned rate for parameter g over three studied aquifers in the three methods of galdit gaidit and galdit i is 10 well logs information were collected from the iran water resources management company iwrm co and digitized to prepare the geological map of three studied aquifers by rockworks visualization software rockware inc 2010 see also fig 4 the ratings adopted for the parameter g were described in table 1 2 5 2 aquifer hydraulic conductivity a hydraulic conductivity of an aquifer represents the ability of water transmission through aquifer formations allen et al 1987 can influence the magnitude of swi the grid map of hydraulic conductivity is prepared based on point data of pumping test transmissivity and saturated thickness of aquifer and interpolating over the aquifer area in the rating of parameter k the effect of hydraulic barriers like impervious dikes parallel to the coast and clay layers which may act as walls to swi should be considered chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 the average values of hydraulic conductivity varying from 0 1 to 16 75 m d a y for aquifer la ch 0 2 to 64 1 m d a y for aquifer fomanat and 0 3 to 96 0 m d a y for aquifer as ko assigned rates to the feature a for three aquifers are shown in fig 6 a c three methods of galdit gaidit and galdit i use identical rating values for the parameter a 2 5 3 height of groundwater level above sea level l in the galdit and galdit i approaches the level of ground water with respect to mean sea elevation msl is the most important factor of the swi evolution in a coastal aquifer chachadi and lobo ferreira 2007 the annual averaged values of parameter l during year 2013 varying from 4 0 to 136 0 m for aquifer fomanat 0 2 to 90 m for aquifer la ch and 4 8 to 73 1 m for aquifer as ko assigned rates to the feature l for three aquifers are shown in fig 6 d f in the gaidit and galdit i approaches the hydraulic gradient i is used instead of the parameter height of groundwater level above sea level based on aforementioned reasons the direction of parameter i fig 6p r are valid for both recharge and highly withdraw seasons i e december and august respectively grid maps of l and i for three studied aquifers were produced by interpolating the average groundwater level data collected in year 2013 from the observation wells by gwra 2014 the hydraulic gradient through three aquifers was oriented in a north and northeast direction toward the caspian sea and the irrigation wells with an average magnitude varying from 0 1 to 2 7 percent for aquifer la ch 0 1 to 1 8 percent for aquifer fomanat and 0 1 to 2 3 percent for aquifer as ko which is not significantly different in irrigation and non pumping conditions in the aquifers as ko and fomanat some hydraulic gradient inflexion points can be observed near to shoreline however mapping the i values allowed for a rapid evaluation and forecasting of the swi class especially in the transient conditions where seawater movements had not yet provided a distinct indication of the final steady state salinity distribution morgan et al 2015 fig 6 p r show the rated values assigned for the parameter i over the three aquifers 2 5 4 distance from the shore line d the impact of swi reduces as it moves inland chachadi and lobo ferreira 2007 table 2 provides general guidelines for rating of the parameter d used in three approaches of galdit gaidit and galdit i the rated values assigned for the parameter d is shown in fig 6 g i 2 5 5 impact of the existing status of seawater intrusion i since ions of c l and h c o 3 dominates in the seawater and natural groundwater respectively chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 recommended the concentration of c l ratio of c l h c o 3 c o 3 2 and electrical conductivity ec can be used to assign the rating of the parameter i in galdit approach the rating adopted in table 2 for the parameter i is also used in gaidit and galdit i methods to assess swi in a coastal aquifer the concentration of c l annual averaged of 2013 varying averagely from 0 2 to 8 34 mg l for fomanat 1 0 to 7 0 mg l for as ko and 0 12 to 8 9 for la ch the ratio of c l h c o 3 c o 3 2 varying averagely from 0 05 to 1 14 0 04 to 2 5 and 0 01 to 1 53 for aquifer fomanat la ch and as ko respectively fig 6 j l shows the assigned rates to the parameter i over three studied aquifers which is identically used in galdit gaidit and galdit i beforehand the presence of the seawater in the groundwater of coastal aquifers was described by piper diagram in the confluence of two quality indices of g q i m i x and g q i d o m fig 5 2 5 6 aquifer saturated thickness t extension and magnitude of swi in the coastal aquifers is directly related to the saturated thickness of the aquifer chachadi and lobo ferreira 2007 average values of the parameter t vary from 47 to 182 m for as ko 29 to 206 m for fomanat and 38 to 147 m for la ch table 2 supplements the ratings for various ranges of t three methods of galdit gaidit and galdit i use identical rates for the parameter t as shown in fig 6 m o mapping of the groundwater intrinsic vulnerability index through galdit gaidit and galdit i methods for three studied aquifers was performed using the arcmap program version 10 1 each parameter was converted to a grid map with grid cell size of 10 10 m the rating and weighting were performed for each parameter using the map overlay analytical function in the spatial analyst module of the arcmap program accumulation of weighted parameter maps in the three galdit gaidit and galdit i approaches produce the final vulnerability map 3 results and discussions a selection of parameter combinations derived from three studied aquifers based on the latest available hydrogeological data annual averaged data of year 2013 is given in tables 4 and 5 some of these parameters e g a k and ρ s are inferred from the study area and therefore are only rough approximations of the general conditions of the studied aquifers the parameters q and l t are computed from the eqs 6 and 7 respectively the values obtained for l t are consistent with the ones reported by golshan et al 2018 which determined the location of swi wedge by vertical resistivity sounding and electromagnetic survey in the east of studied region between 350 and 800 m from the shoreline awareness of the parameter values for each aquifer given in tables 4 and 5 the corresponding values of l x at each point x can be computed using the eq 6 the diamond field of the piper diagram and the values of g q i m i x and g q i d o m eqs 3 and 4 developed for the latest observed chemical quality data of groundwater year 2013 in two months of november and august as the least and highest withdraw month respectively for three studied aquifers are shown in fig 5 the groundwater of fomanat and la ch for two months november and august is classified in three zones of i iv and v representing the water type n a h c o 3 mixed c a m g c l and c a c l respectively while groundwater of as ko for both months november and august classified in two zones of i and iv indicating water type n a h c o 3 and mixed c a m g c l respectively the range of calculated values of g q i m i x and g q i d o m fig 5 indicate higher values for the august in comparison to december for three studied aquifers the obtained values of g q i m i x and g q i d o m and the domains of groundwater type indicate the presence of saline groundwater for three aquifers seawater especially for fomanat in august cation exchange and sulfate reduction for three aquifers and dolomitization and dedolomitization which produces secondary saline groundwater in august for fomanat and la ch the right trend of hydrogeochemical data in august compared to december is evidence of mixing of fresh and saline water in the three aquifers the results obtained indicate the swi for fomanat and la ch aquifers higher values of g q i m i x and g q i d o m while mixing fresh and saline water occurs in as ko moreover the fresh groundwater data in domain i is not frequently observed in both months of august and december in as ko the produced vulnerability maps of three studied aquifers generated by the galdit gaidit and galdit i methods are given in fig 7 a i the moderate vulnerable zone obtained by the galdit method is limited to a thin length of the aquifers beneath the shore except a small area in the east of fomanat aquifer whereas no high vulnerable zone is delineated by this method high vulnerable zone with a considerable area of three studied aquifers was defined by both gaidit and galdit i methods the vulnerability maps produced by gaidit and galdit i methods exhibit similar patterns and showed small differences in the finer detail two modified models define some parts of aquifers e g west part of fomanat and southeast of la ch as low vulnerable zone despite their vicinity to the sea fig 7 due to dominant influences of i and hydraulic conductivity indicator a on the final map the classified vulnerability indexes obtained by the three models galdit gaidit and galdit i are given in table 6 each category reflects an aquifer s inherent capacity for swi the map area with a high gaidit vulnerability index covers 58 1 49 0 and 44 3 of the aquifer area la ch as ko and fomanat respectively whereas whereas the high vulnerable area defined by galdit i for aquifers la ch as ko and fomanat are 43 5 49 8 and 30 8 respectively none of three aquifers has high vulnerability areas according to galdit method the galdit model generates low vulnerable areas much greater than both gaidit and galdit i models the areas of moderate and high vulnerability classes obtained by galdit are much smaller than two other models the maximum and minimum high vulnerable zone is obtained for the aquifer la ch 58 1 by gaidit model while no low vulnerable zone is obtained by the galdit i method for aquifer as ko 0 3 78 4 and 19 7 of this aquifer area are identified as low vulnerable zones by the galdit and gaidit models respectively generally the results of table 6 indicates the galdit method tends to generate low and moderate vulnerable areas results of independency tests in significant level of α 0 05 indicate that all values of vif and tv for intercomparison of vulnerability scores as dependent variable and four indices as independent variable are equal to 1 0 this means that the vulnerability scores obtained by three methods statistically are independent of the indices tds f sea g q i and l x the vulnerability maps produced by the galdit i and gaidit for three studied aquifers have more consistency with the maps of tds concentrations and distributions of quality indices of f sea g q i and length of swi into aquifer l x as shown in fig 8 in addition the pearson s correlation coefficient r between the vulnerability index values produced by the three models and corresponding tds f sea g q i and l x values are computed and given in table 7 although all correlation coefficients listed in table 7 are significant at significant level α 0 05 but the galdit i followed by gaidit outperforms the galdit with an average modification respectively equal to 48 2 and 19 9 for as ko 77 9 and 59 0 for la ch and 127 3 and 93 1 for fomanat in r value on average the maximum correlation of galdit i and gaidit vulnerability indexes in three aquifers is obtained with the f sea r 0 72 and g q i r 0 63 respectively whereas the maximum correlation of galdit index is obtained on average with the g q i equal to 0 42 the difference between the final vulnerability maps produces by galdit gaidit and galdit i methods is believed to be related to the modifications implemented in the incorporated indices i e parameter i which shows better presentation of transient recharge discharge components of groundwater at local spatio temporal scale the vulnerability maps produced by the three methods are based on annual averaged data but utilization of the time evolution parameters in these approaches i e parameters l and i may lead to seasonal hazard maps of aquifer to swi fig 9 shows the vulnerability maps produced by the galdit gaidit and galdit i methods over la ch aquifer for instance based on corresponding data of dry september and wet march seasons results shown in fig 9 b and d reveals the difference of aquifer vulnerability area produced by the gaidit for dry 15 0 low vul 39 0 moderate vul and 46 0 high vul and wet 20 0 low vul 48 5 moderate vul and 31 5 high vul seasons the corresponding areas to different vulnerability classes produced by the galdit i are 8 3 low vul 30 0 moderate vul and 61 0 high vul in dry season and 9 7 low vul 44 0 moderate vul and 45 0 high vul in wet season while the seasonal hazard map of la ch aquifer produced by the galdit method for the dry 93 8 low vul and 6 2 moderate vul and wet period 94 3 low vul and 5 7 moderate vul has not substantial difference as shown in fig 9 a and c the difference between the vulnerability maps in dry and wet season especially in a high vulnerable area caused by anthropogenic effect i e pumping for agricultural demands in three studied aquifers sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the contribution degree of six indicators to the final vulnerability maps through galdit gaidit and galdit i methods using the eq 8 li and merchant 2013 8 p v v u l j v u l 0 v u l 0 100 where p v is the percentage of variation in the vulnerability index v u l j is the vulnerability score affected by changes in specific indicator j and v u l 0 is the vulnerability score for the initial condition without changes in the values of indicators for instance the p v values for the galdit gaidit and galdit i vulnerability indices respect to 10 of increase in the scores of influential indicators are calculated for three studied aquifers and shown in table 8 results indicate the predominant influence of indicator g i e aquifer type on the both galdit and gaidit vulnerability index adopted for three aquifers after the aquifer type g hydraulic conductivity indicator a and hydraulic gradient i have the greatest impact on gaidit index while in the galdit index the hydraulic conductivity a and distance from the shoreline d have the greatest influence after the indicator g the impact of the existing status of seawater intrusion indicator i has the minimum influence on both vulnerability indices of galdit and gaidit adopted for three studied aquifers however according to the guideline given in table 1 the weights of indicator i is equal to g this is related to hydrogeochemical properties of groundwater in the studied aquifers particularly c l concentration since duplicating the weight of indicator i does not significantly change the final vulnerability index through both methods aquifers hydraulic gradient recharge rate freshwater flux to the sea the contrast in freshwater and seawater density saturated thickness of the aquifer and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer materials could be considered as dominant factors causing swi 4 conclusion in this study a tabulated review of the vulnerability studies of the coastal aquifers based on overlay index methods was presented these methods require to identify the most influential factors on swi according to inherent susceptibility and anthropogenic factors in this regard two modifications were proposed on the input parameters of galdit method with replacing the height of groundwater level above sea level parameter l by seaward hydraulic gradient of freshwater parameter i gaidit method and by considering the parameter i as an additional input parameter of galdit galdit i method three methods of galdit gaidit and galdit i were evaluated in the three coastal aquifers to delineate the groundwater vulnerability zones to swi three groundwater chemical indices specified for swi including fraction of seawater f sea groundwater quality index g q i the concentration of tds and length of seawater intrusion l x estimated by strack s analytical solution were used for validation of two vulnerability indices results indicated that modifications implemented on the galdit method especially galdit i have significantly increased the correlation of final vulnerability scores with four indices of f sea g q i tds and l x therefore the suggested methods galdit i and gaidit provide a better representative of the vulnerable zones of the studied aquifers the proposed models could potentially be used as a more accurate groundwater vulnerability assessment that is a helpful and excellent decision making tool for groundwater management and risk assessment of aquifer subject to swi the results of sensitivity analysis indicated that the hydraulic gradient parameter i and groundwater height above sea level parameter l has the great impact on the groundwater vulnerability across the studied aquifers by gaidit and galdit i method the seaward hydraulic gradient parameter i is the most important variable controlling the seawater toe location provides the major source of fresh groundwater discharge to sea and reflects the resultant effects of recharge rate pumping rate head of freshwater freshwater flux to the sea sea level rise and changing in transmissivity of aquifer the galdit method doesn t consider this parameter as input on the other hand one of possible challenge accompanied by serving the parameter i for parameter l in the gaidit method may occur in delineating vulnerability of inland zones with a low spatial variation of groundwater level even inland groundwater level driven by the low impact of recharge discharge components in such regions the small values of the hydraulic gradient i may lead to inaccurate estimation of the final vulnerability index thus the results of gaidit method are more reliable for estimation of vulnerable zones due to time dependent anthropogenic changes e g pumping results of this study indicated that utilization of both parameters l and i in galdit i approach may produce more accurate vulnerability map which is more correlated to the four groundwater indices of f sea g q i tds and l x however increasing the number of input parameters compared with the gaidit and galdit may be one of drawback accompanied by the galdit i index the results of the study can serve as a primary target for the introduction of future mitigation and adaptation strategies on the indicators involving for vulnerability mapping of coastal aquifers to swi towards sustainable groundwater management the detailed vulnerability assessment could be built upon by carrying out numerical modeling in aquifers identified accurately as being highly vulnerable by the index method acknowledgements the authors wish to

6726,in this study a review of the overlay index methods served for delineation of vulnerable zones in coastal aquifers affected by swi is provided then a more realistic presentation of the vulnerability mapping of coastal aquifers to swi through modified galdit index method by incorporating the influential factors on swi is established the modifications on galdit method including incorporating the seaward hydraulic gradient i instead of the height of groundwater level above sea level l so called gaidit and considering hydraulic gradient i as an additional parameter to the galdit so called galdit i three galdit gaidit and galdit i methods were evaluated with data from three coastal confined and phreatic confined aquifers located in the south of the caspian sea northern iran while no highly vulnerable zone was recognized by galdit method across three studied aquifers averagely 43 4 and 50 5 of aquifers area were defined as highly vulnerable zones by gaidit and galdit i respectively furthermore the final vulnerability maps obtained by galdit i and then gaidit indicates higher correlation by three groundwater quality indices specific to swi including f sea r 0 72 and 0 63 and g q i r 0 69 and 0 62 and also the distribution of tds in groundwater r 0 71 and 0 61 compared with galdit r 0 33 0 42 and 0 36 respectively the values of vulnerability index obtained by galdit i and gaidit are more strongly correlated with the length of swi into the aquifer l x based on strack s analytical approach than galdit r 0 52 0 36 and 0 32 respectively the results of sensitivity analysis indicated that the hydraulic gradient height of groundwater level above sea level aquifer type and existing status of seawater intrusion has the greatest impact on the groundwater vulnerability across the studied aquifers by galdit i and gaidit methods results also indicated that serving the influential parameters in galdit methods regarding the hydrological and anthropogenic characteristics across the aquifer provide a more realistic characterization of the swi this modification leads to an accurate aquifer vulnerability mapping to swi in aquifers characterized by

al 2018 while more than 45 of the world s population i e 2 69 109 people in 2018 august resides within the 100 km landward of coastline the average population density apd of czs in 2000 87 people km 2 is nearly four times greater than inland areas 23 people km 2 shi and singh 2003 fernandino et al 2018 the projected apd by unesco 2003 in czs and inland areas are 115 and 44 people km 2 respectively by 2025 czs comprise 20 of the earth s surface and the same time is the location of 75 of megacities with more than 10 million inhabitants czs are also a major destination for coastal and maritime tourism nearly 80 of all tourism takes place in coastal areas 16 5 million visitors yearly with a growth rate of 17 since 1989 crossland et al 2003 kantamaneni 2016 the pressure for further development in czs requires additional water resources to meet growing demands in these areas the demographic pressure and the high level of urbanization cause high water demand which is increasingly met by groundwater furthermore human activities cause groundwater depletion triggering seawater intrusion and pollutant dispersion parisi et al 2018 therefore the protection of groundwater resources in czs as a valuable freshwater resources in these areas requires cautious measures in particular in arid and semi arid parts of the world costanza et al 1997 fuentesa et al 2018 seawater intrusion swi is among the main threatening factors for the quantity and quality of groundwater resources in coastal aquifers worldwide swi is the landward movement of saline water into coastal aquifers and usually shows seasonal oscillation due to human and climate forced factors xiao et al 2016 baena ruiz et al 2018 readers are referred to some of the recent review papers in the literature for further

also the parsimony principle lobo ferreira et al 2007 a summary of the recent studies that used overlay index o i methods to delineate the vulnerability of coastal aquifer to swi is provided in table

maio 2004 and avi van stempvoort et al 1992 have been used for mapping the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to swi due to both natural and anthropogenic factors galdit method provides quite effective

provides promising results based on hydrogeochemical indications for the aquifers that are strongly impacted by recharge and exploitation rate and also slr due to climate change xiao et al 2016 luoma

surface they have no parameters that relate to contamination from swi kallioras et al 2011 allouche et al 2017 table 1 shows that the most important factors for evaluating the vulnerability of the coastal aquifers to swi are height of groundwater level above sea level pedreira et al 2015 recinos et al 2015 luoma et al 2017 hazards due to climate change i e slr and overexploitation of aquifers

use of qualitative parameters e g groundwater occurrence in galdit a large amount of data required especially for galdit and sintacs and a few vulnerability categorizations ivkovic et al 2013 luoma et

inherent susceptibility and anthropogenic factors werner et al 2012 klassen and allen 2017 motevalli et al 2018 table 1 reveals that the verification of the vulnerability mapped output has been checked by comparison of the results with hydrogeochemical data from groundwater samples whereas choosing the best verifying indicator is still a challenge kazakis et al 2018 for the coastal aquifers with overexploitation of groundwater the seaward hydraulic gradient is the most important variable controlling the seawater toe location and also provides the major source of fresh groundwater discharge to sea werner et al 2012 ferguson and gleeson 2012 holding and allen 2015 comte et al 2016 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 however the galdit method serves the height of groundwater level

of vulnerability zones over aquifer scale this study was motivated by the need to provide a more accurate mapping of the vulnerability of large scale coastal aquifers to swi by introducing more influential hydrological factors in an o i approach for the first time it attempts to evaluate the utilization of seaward hydraulic gradient of groundwater flow i as an influential indicator in galdit method accordingly an alternative quantitative indicator i is served in the original form of galdit model one time instead of height of groundwater level above sea level l so called gaidit and another time as an additional input parameter so called galdit i the efficiency of three models galdit gaidit and galdit i in generating vulnerability based on annual averaged data and time evolution hazard based on seasonal data mapping are evaluated by the application of the methods on three confined and semi confined coastal aquifers in the southern coast of the caspian sea iran the verification of the final vulnerability maps produced by three methods over three studied aquifers was carried out using three groundwater chemical indicators of fresh and seawater and also the length of the seawater intrusion at the point beneath the shoreline into the aquifer section based on strack 1976 analytical solution the meaningfulness of the incorporated parameters into three models galdit gaidit and galdit i for vulnerability mapping of aquifers to swi are also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 galdit approach galdit is an overlay index method to assess the spatial intrinsic vulnerability of coastal aquifer systems to seawater intrusion developed based on a parametric system with rating scores and weights for six most important factors controlling seawater intrusion chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 a summary of parameter weights rates and ranges used in galdit method are given in table 2 originally chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 suggested the ratio of c l h c o 3 c o 3 2 for rating the impact status of the existing swi later dörfliger et al 2011 and luoma et al 2017 added ec values and cl concentration of groundwater from wells along the coastline as alternative indices of existing swi and reclassified the related rates in each grid cell each parameter was rated as r i based on its vulnerability to seawater intrusion being 2 5 lowest vulnerability 5 7 5 and 10 highest vulnerability these assigned rating parameters were multiplied by the weight strings w i being 1 lowest significant parameter to 4 highest significant parameter to obtain final vulnerability index in each grid chachadi 2005 1 g a l d i t i 1 6 w i r i i 1 6 w i the galdit index categorized in three classes low 5 moderate 5 7 5 and high vulnerability 10 2 2 modifications to galdit in this study two modifications are made on the input parameters of the galdit model 1 replacing the height of groundwater level above sea level l with the seaward hydraulic gradient i d h d x i e gaidit method and 2 serving the parameter i as an additional parameter into the galdit model i e galdit i method hydraulic gradient a vector having both a direction and magnitude represents the slope of the water table or potentiometric surface and is the driving force for groundwater flow within an aquifer beljin et al 2014 previous studies e g loaciga et al 2012 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 demonstrated through the analytical and numerical models that the dominant factors controlling the seawater toe location are the magnitudes of fresh groundwater discharge to sea parameter q in fig 1 recharge rate slr landward hydraulic head aquifer thickness density difference ratio of freshwater and seawater and slope of aquifer bed respectively in this study hydraulic gradient i at each point is estimated by h s w h l w x where h s w l and h l w l is seaward and landward hydraulic head or potentiometric surface respectively and x l is aquifer length landward or seaward direction of i is defined by its negative and positive sign respectively the hydraulic gradient inflexion point i e the interface between landward and seaward direction of i is a key factor in determining the degree of swi fetter 2001 spatiotemporal changes in i can be due to changes in aquifer recharge from the ground surface pumping rates of nearby water supply wells or changes in nearby surface water elevations and also transmissivity of the aquifer ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 in this study the seaward values of i i e positive values are rated and embedded in the galdit model instead of parameter l based on studies of fetter 2001 and thereafter werner 2017 seaward freshwater flow causing passive swi class which is frequently observed in the confined aquifers as also observed in the studied aquifers whereas both seaward and landward freshwater flow causing both active and passive swi classes the modifications on the input parameters of the galdit method are also shown schematically in fig 2 therefore based on improvements on the galdit for producing the vulnerability mapping of a coastal aquifer to swi the gaidit uses six input parameters including groundwater occurrence g aquifer hydraulic conductivity a seaward hydraulic gradient of freshwater i distance from the shoreline d impact of the existing status of seawater intrusion i and aquifer saturated thickness t as input parameters whereas the galdit i model uses seven parameters g a l d i t and i as input the vulnerability ratings used for the parameters g a l d i and t are the same as the galdit method and are presented in table 1 the vulnerability ratings adopted in this study for the parameter i are presented in table 2 the inputs processes and steps required to be followed to apply two indices of galdit gaidit and galdit i for vulnerability mapping of coastal aquifers to swi are schematized in fig 2 the procedure includes collecting information maps and raw data e g well logs hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters of aquifers groundwater and seawater quality implementing interpolation processes in gis environment required to establish the distributed parameters over aquifer in form of raster maps rating the parameters according to table 1 producing the vulnerability maps of coastal aquifers by calculating the indices of galdit gaidit and galdit i integrating the weighted layers of considered parameters in each method accuracy assessment of produced vulnerability maps by comparing the spatial distribution of vulnerability indices values some important factors of swi presence developed based on groundwater quality parameters including total dissolved solids tds groundwater quality index g q i fraction of seawater f s e a and the length of the seawater intrusion into the aquifer section l x and sensitivity analysis of all incorporated parameters in two vulnerability indices 2 3 study area to compare and evaluate the galdit gaidit and galdit i approaches in the vulnerability mapping of the coastal aquifer to swi three coastal aquifers astaneh koochesfahan as ko fomanat and lahijan chaboksar la ch along the southern coast of caspian sea at the northern part of iran are considered due to the availability of enough required data fig 3 shows the location of three studied aquifers and exploration and piezometric wells the aquifers are in south caspian sea basin and known as a part of the alborz tectonical range in alpine fold belt due to the influence of mediterranean air masses three plains receive high rainfall 1000 mm annually according to geologic cross section of three aquifers shown in fig 4 fomanat aquifer with area of 2027 km 2 is a fully confined aquifer whereas as ko with area of 2027 km 2 and la ch with area of 2027 km 2 are confined phreatic aquifers respectively grwa 2015 report no 8353 111 table 3 summarizes the hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry characteristics of the studied aquifers based on the geology map of alborz zone at scale of 1 100000 provided by geological survey and mineral explorations of iran gsi 1997 three aquifers covered by late pleistocene and holocene quaternary age well sorted deposits consisting of deltaic alluviums 29 5 in la ch 78 8 in as ko and 18 7 in fomanat marine deposits 48 8 in la ch 4 3 in as ko and 81 3 in fomanat beach deposits 21 7 in la ch 15 3 in as ko and a small coverage of fluvial deposits 1 6 in as ko according to stocklin 1968 the three plains are located in a tectonically active area the surface slopes of three plains are less than 2 which are categorized as flat plains davis 1987 the groundwater level in three aquifers near the caspian sea north parts is below the msl mean caspian sea level is 26 5 m below msl see also table 3 according to monitoring networks of piezometers the groundwater level of three aquifers indicates insignificant decline 0 1 m annually during the last 20 years 1994 2013 the groundwater flow in three aquifers has a general direction from the south to north i e the caspian sea northeast and northwest based on previous tracer tests grwa 2015 in the studied aquifers groundwater quality sampling was conducted by guilan regional water authority gwra during 2002 2011 through 23 in la ch 44 in fomanat and 19 in as ko piezometric wells the southern caspian sea is characterized by salinities of nearly 8 0 0 5 g l in the west to 13 0 0 5 g l in the east which increases from the surface to the bottom of the sea leroy et al 2007 even with this low salinity boundary the coastal aquifers are faced with swi due to the presence of relict connate seawater within the permeable holocene sediments of the semi confined aquifers kosarev and yablonskaya 1994 additionally the freshwater demands for agricultural and domestic water are mostly supplied by groundwater exploitation of the coastal aquifers because of accessibility low depth of groundwater as shown in table 3 and high storage capacity of the groundwater in these alluvial aquifers gholami et al 2010 2 4 verification of vulnerability maps to avoid flawed decisions and subjective environmental assessments on the final vulnerability maps verification of the produced vulnerability indices by the galdit gaidit and galdit i methods with the measured data is necessary three considered aquifers have long term hydrogeochemical data and this allows to define different indices according to fig 2 four indices including spatial distribution of t d s in groundwater fraction of seawater f sea into groundwater groundwater quality indices g q i and the length of the seawater intrusion at the into the aquifer section l x serve to verify the produced vulnerability maps the following describes how the indices of f sea g q i and l x are developed 1 fraction of seawater f sea since chloride c l and sodium n a make up nearly 85 of the total ionic composition of seawater increasing c l concentration within the aquifer can be used as an indicator for swi richter and kreitler 1993 fraction of seawater f sea introduced by appelo and postma 2005 is used as a verification parameter to assess the produced vulnerability maps 2 f sea c l i c l f w c l s w c l f w where c l i is the concentration of cl in groundwater at i th location meq l c l f w and c l s w are the concentration of c l in freshwater and seawater meq l respectively the f sea values ranging from 0 to 1 denotes to freshwater and seawater respectively fraction of seawater index f sea fails to identify hydrogeochemical reactions associated with swi that can mostly affect the ionic composition of groundwater in coastal aquifers appelo and willemsen 1987 these reactions including cation exchanges dolomitization and sulfate reduction which produce c a 2 s 2 and h c o 3 ions panteleit et al 2011 2 groundwater quality indices g q i alkaline groundwater in coastal aquifers may have a high concentration of c l due to swi but be less saline therefore besides electrical conductivity ec of groundwater in the aquifers as a simple indicator of salinity two groundwater quality indices g q i m i x and g q i d o m developed by tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 are used to aggregate hydrochemical data of different ions 3 g q i m i x c a 2 m g 2 t c h c o 3 t a 50 4 g q i d o m n a k t c h c o 3 t a 50 where t c and t a are concentration of total cations and anions in groundwater respectively the concentrations of ions in eqs 3 and 4 are meq l the indices g q i m i x and g q i d o m range from 0 representing saline water and c a c l water type respectively to 100 representing fresh water and n a h c o 3 water type respectively to group the essential character of groundwater quality into different domains the calculated values of g q i m i x and g q i d o m are presented on the diamond field of piper diagram piper 1944 singhal and gupta 2010 fig 5 the domains resulted including i ii iii iv v vi representing water type of c a h c o 3 n a c l mixed c a n a h c o 3 mixed c a m g c l c a c l and n a h c o 3 respectively sarath prasanth et al 2012 coupling the piper diagram and groundwater quality indices g q i m i x and g q i d o m is a widely and simple method to identify the swi and hydrogeochemical pathways in the coastal aquifers based on major ions relevant in groundwater appelo and postma 2005 3 the length of the seawater intrusion into the aquifer l x when the steady state salinity distribution occurs after the inland movement of saline water freshwater interface the parameter l x offers an insight into the propensity for swi and understanding the vulnerability of a coastal environment zhou 2011 werner et al 2012 moreover l x allows to consider the instability in interface position through future stresses e g change in recharge due to climate change or over extraction by the pumping nofal et al 2015 the parameter l x can be derived from the steady state sharp interface equations of strack 1976 1989 for an unconfined and confined coastal aquifer experiencing distributed recharge and with the conditions that shown in fig 1 the freshwater groundwater discharge to the sea q l 2 t 1 based on the method developed by strack 1976 1989 is as follows 5 q k 2 x h f x z 0 2 δ 1 z 0 2 w net x 2 f o r u n c o n f i n e d a q u i f e r k h 0 x h f x δ h f x h 0 2 w net x 2 f o r c o n f i n e d a q u i f e r where h f x l is the fresh water hydraulic head above the msl in each distance x l from shore line h 0 l is confined aquifer thickness respect to base of aquifer w net lt 1 is net recharge to aquifer after subtracting all losses including evapotranspiration storage in vadose zone pumping and leakage for confined aquifer which maybe a negative or positive value k lt 1 is saturated hydraulic conductivity of aquifer formations ρ

aquifer below the msl for brevity we refer the reader to werner et al 2012 and ataie ashtiani et al 2013b for further details of the method the eq 5 is valid for the landward of interface x l t using the eq 5 negative values is obtained for the q under passive swi condition badaruddin et al 2015 according to fetter 1973 2001 passive swi condition referring to inland movements of seawater in areas where fresh groundwater flows towards the coastline awareness of h f x at different location x from piezometric monitoring network ρ s ρ f z 0 h 0 k and w net the value of q can be obtained from the eq 5 replacing the ghyben herzberg equation as h f x δ z x ghyben 1889 herzberg 1901 in the eq 5 the length of the seawater intrusion at the point beneath the shoreline into the aquifer section l x l

werner et al 2012 ataie ashtiani et al 2013b and ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 another advantages of using the parameter l x in assessment of swi vulnerability is its dependency to influenced parameters of q w net δ k z 0 and h 0 to delineate the length of the seawater intrusion into the aquifer which may differ for the points with same distance from the shoreline it is noteworthy that in long screened pumping wells and especially those left un pumped for a long time contribution of intraborehole flow regime ifr due to vertical hydraulic gradient across screen or open intervals around the substantially alter the chemical mixture of local groundwater around the well poulsen et al 2018 this may introducing erroneous and misleading results for better understanding and construction of the swi process and location mcmillan et al 2014 water sampling from these wells should be taken after an enough pumping period to sure fully purging of ifr so the well yields native groundwater cook et al 2017 before verifying the produced vulnerability maps by galdit gaidit and galdit i with indices of tds f sea g q i and length of swi into the aquifer l x independence of these data should be tested multicollinearity statistics mct including variance inflation factor vif and tolerance value of determination coefficient tv belsley et al 1980 are conducted in statistical package for the social sciences software spss version 16 spss inc 2001 to test the independence of final vulnerability scores and corresponding values of tds f sea g q i and l x in three studied aquifers 2 5 preparation of vulnerability indicators 2 5 1 groundwater occurrence aquifer type g the extent of swi depends on the type of the aquifer in the study area i e confined unconfined leaky confined and bounded table 2 a confined aquifer is more prone to swi due to the instantaneous release of water to wells during pumping and also the larger cone of depression further adds the vulnerability according to chachadi and lobo ferreira 2007 if multiple aquifers are present in an area i e aquifers as ko and la ch as shown in table 3 the highest rating score 10 can be adopted therefore the assigned rate for parameter g over three studied aquifers in the three methods of galdit gaidit and galdit i is 10 well logs information were collected from the iran water resources management company iwrm co and digitized to prepare the geological map of three studied aquifers by rockworks visualization software rockware inc 2010 see also fig 4 the ratings adopted for the parameter g were described in table 1 2 5 2 aquifer hydraulic conductivity a hydraulic conductivity of an aquifer represents the ability of water transmission through aquifer formations allen et al 1987 can influence the magnitude of swi the grid map of hydraulic conductivity is prepared based on point data of pumping test transmissivity and saturated thickness of aquifer and interpolating over the aquifer area in the rating of parameter k the effect of hydraulic barriers like impervious dikes parallel to the coast and clay layers which may act as walls to swi should be considered chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 the average values of hydraulic conductivity varying from 0 1 to 16 75 m d a y for aquifer la ch 0 2 to 64 1 m d a y for aquifer fomanat and 0 3 to 96 0 m d a y for aquifer as ko assigned rates to the feature a for three aquifers are shown in fig 6 a c three methods of galdit gaidit and galdit i use identical rating values for the parameter a 2 5 3 height of groundwater level above sea level l in the galdit and galdit i approaches the level of ground water with respect to mean sea elevation msl is the most important factor of the swi evolution in a coastal aquifer chachadi and lobo ferreira 2007 the annual averaged values of parameter l during year 2013 varying from 4 0 to 136 0 m for aquifer fomanat 0 2 to 90 m for aquifer la ch and 4 8 to 73 1 m for aquifer as ko assigned rates to the feature l for three aquifers are shown in fig 6 d f in the gaidit and galdit i approaches the hydraulic gradient i is used instead of the parameter height of groundwater level above sea level based on aforementioned reasons the direction of parameter i fig 6p r are valid for both recharge and highly withdraw seasons i e december and august respectively grid maps of l and i for three studied aquifers were produced by interpolating the average groundwater level data collected in year 2013 from the observation wells by gwra 2014 the hydraulic gradient through three aquifers was oriented in a north and northeast direction toward the caspian sea and the irrigation wells with an average magnitude varying from 0 1 to 2 7 percent for aquifer la ch 0 1 to 1 8 percent for aquifer fomanat and 0 1 to 2 3 percent for aquifer as ko which is not significantly different in irrigation and non pumping conditions in the aquifers as ko and fomanat some hydraulic gradient inflexion points can be observed near to shoreline however mapping the i values allowed for a rapid evaluation and forecasting of the swi class especially in the transient conditions where seawater movements had not yet provided a distinct indication of the final steady state salinity distribution morgan et al 2015 fig 6 p r show the rated values assigned for the parameter i over the three aquifers 2 5 4 distance from the shore line d the impact of swi reduces as it moves inland chachadi and lobo ferreira 2007 table 2 provides general guidelines for rating of the parameter d used in three approaches of galdit gaidit and galdit i the rated values assigned for the parameter d is shown in fig 6 g i 2 5 5 impact of the existing status of seawater intrusion i since ions of c l and h c o 3 dominates in the seawater and natural groundwater respectively chachadi and lobo ferreira 2001 recommended the concentration of c l ratio of c l h c o 3 c o 3 2 and electrical conductivity ec can be used to assign the rating of the parameter i in galdit approach the rating adopted in table 2 for the parameter i is also used in gaidit and galdit i methods to assess swi in a coastal aquifer the concentration of c l annual averaged of 2013 varying averagely from 0 2 to 8 34 mg l for fomanat 1 0 to 7 0 mg l for as ko and 0 12 to 8 9 for la ch the ratio of c l h c o 3 c o 3 2 varying averagely from 0 05 to 1 14 0 04 to 2 5 and 0 01 to 1 53 for aquifer fomanat la ch and as ko respectively fig 6 j l shows the assigned rates to the parameter i over three studied aquifers which is identically used in galdit gaidit and galdit i beforehand the presence of the seawater in the groundwater of coastal aquifers was described by piper diagram in the confluence of two quality indices of g q i m i x and g q i d o m fig 5 2 5 6 aquifer saturated thickness t extension and magnitude of swi in the coastal aquifers is directly related to the saturated thickness of the aquifer chachadi and lobo ferreira 2007 average values of the parameter t vary from 47 to 182 m for as ko 29 to 206 m for fomanat and 38 to 147 m for la ch table 2 supplements the ratings for various ranges of t three methods of galdit gaidit and galdit i use identical rates for the parameter t as shown in fig 6 m o mapping of the groundwater intrinsic vulnerability index through galdit gaidit and galdit i methods for three studied aquifers was performed using the arcmap program version 10 1 each parameter was converted to a grid map with grid cell size of 10 10 m the rating and weighting were performed for each parameter using the map overlay analytical function in the spatial analyst module of the arcmap program accumulation of weighted parameter maps in the three galdit gaidit and galdit i approaches produce the final vulnerability map 3 results and discussions a selection of parameter combinations derived from three studied aquifers based on the latest available hydrogeological data annual averaged data of year 2013 is given in tables 4 and 5 some of these parameters e g a k and ρ s are inferred from the study area and therefore are only rough approximations of the general conditions of the studied aquifers the parameters q and l t are computed from the eqs 6 and 7 respectively the values obtained for l t are consistent with the ones reported by golshan et al 2018 which determined the location of swi wedge by vertical resistivity sounding and electromagnetic survey in the east of studied region between 350 and 800 m from the shoreline awareness of the parameter values for each aquifer given in tables 4 and 5 the corresponding values of l x at each point x can be computed using the eq 6 the diamond field of the piper diagram and the values of g q i m i x and g q i d o m eqs 3 and 4 developed for the latest observed chemical quality data of groundwater year 2013 in two months of november and august as the least and highest withdraw month respectively for three studied aquifers are shown in fig 5 the groundwater of fomanat and la ch for two months november and august is classified in three zones of i iv and v representing the water type n a h c o 3 mixed c a m g c l and c a c l respectively while groundwater of as ko for both months november and august classified in two zones of i and iv indicating water type n a h c o 3 and mixed c a m g c l respectively the range of calculated values of g q i m i x and g q i d o m fig 5 indicate higher values for the august in comparison to december for three studied aquifers the obtained values of g q i m i x and g q i d o m and the domains of groundwater type indicate the presence of saline groundwater for three aquifers seawater especially for fomanat in august cation exchange and sulfate reduction for three aquifers and dolomitization and dedolomitization which produces secondary saline groundwater in august for fomanat and la ch the right trend of hydrogeochemical data in august compared to december is evidence of mixing of fresh and saline water in the three aquifers the results obtained indicate the swi for fomanat and la ch aquifers higher values of g q i m i x and g q i d o m while mixing fresh and saline water occurs in as ko moreover the fresh groundwater data in domain i is not frequently observed in both months of august and december in as ko the produced vulnerability maps of three studied aquifers generated by the galdit gaidit and galdit i methods are given in fig 7 a i the moderate vulnerable zone obtained by the galdit method is limited to a thin length of the aquifers beneath the shore except a small area in the east of fomanat aquifer whereas no high vulnerable zone is delineated by this method high vulnerable zone with a considerable area of three studied aquifers was defined by both gaidit and galdit i methods the vulnerability maps produced by gaidit and galdit i methods exhibit similar patterns and showed small differences in the finer detail two modified models define some parts of aquifers e g west part of fomanat and southeast of la ch as low vulnerable zone despite their vicinity to the sea fig 7 due to dominant influences of i and hydraulic conductivity indicator a on the final map the classified vulnerability indexes obtained by the three models galdit gaidit and galdit i are given in table 6 each category reflects an aquifer s inherent capacity for swi the map area with a high gaidit vulnerability index covers 58 1 49 0 and 44 3 of the aquifer area la ch as ko and fomanat respectively whereas whereas the high vulnerable area defined by galdit i for aquifers la ch as ko and fomanat are 43 5 49 8 and 30 8 respectively none of three aquifers has high vulnerability areas according to galdit method the galdit model generates low vulnerable areas much greater than both gaidit and galdit i models the areas of moderate and high vulnerability classes obtained by galdit are much smaller than two other models the maximum and minimum high vulnerable zone is obtained for the aquifer la ch 58 1 by gaidit model while no low vulnerable zone is obtained by the galdit i method for aquifer as ko 0 3 78 4 and 19 7 of this aquifer area are identified as low vulnerable zones by the galdit and gaidit models respectively generally the results of table 6 indicates the galdit method tends to generate low and moderate vulnerable areas results of independency tests in significant level of α 0 05 indicate that all values of vif and tv for intercomparison of vulnerability scores as dependent variable and four indices as independent variable are equal to 1 0 this means that the vulnerability scores obtained by three methods statistically are independent of the indices tds f sea g q i and l x the vulnerability maps produced by the galdit i and gaidit for three studied aquifers have more consistency with the maps of tds concentrations and distributions of quality indices of f sea g q i and length of swi into aquifer l x as shown in fig 8 in addition the pearson s correlation coefficient r between the vulnerability index values produced by the three models and corresponding tds f sea g q i and l x values are computed and given in table 7 although all correlation coefficients listed in table 7 are significant at significant level α 0 05 but the galdit i followed by gaidit outperforms the galdit with an average modification respectively equal to 48 2 and 19 9 for as ko 77 9 and 59 0 for la ch and 127 3 and 93 1 for fomanat in r value on average the maximum correlation of galdit i and gaidit vulnerability indexes in three aquifers is obtained with the f sea r 0 72 and g q i r 0 63 respectively whereas the maximum correlation of galdit index is obtained on average with the g q i equal to 0 42 the difference between the final vulnerability maps produces by galdit gaidit and galdit i methods is believed to be related to the modifications implemented in the incorporated indices i e parameter i which shows better presentation of transient recharge discharge components of groundwater at local spatio temporal scale the vulnerability maps produced by the three methods are based on annual averaged data but utilization of the time evolution parameters in these approaches i e parameters l and i may lead to seasonal hazard maps of aquifer to swi fig 9 shows the vulnerability maps produced by the galdit gaidit and galdit i methods over la ch aquifer for instance based on corresponding data of dry september and wet march seasons results shown in fig 9 b and d reveals the difference of aquifer vulnerability area produced by the gaidit for dry 15 0 low vul 39 0 moderate vul and 46 0 high vul and wet 20 0 low vul 48 5 moderate vul and 31 5 high vul seasons the corresponding areas to different vulnerability classes produced by the galdit i are 8 3 low vul 30 0 moderate vul and 61 0 high vul in dry season and 9 7 low vul 44 0 moderate vul and 45 0 high vul in wet season while the seasonal hazard map of la ch aquifer produced by the galdit method for the dry 93 8 low vul and 6 2 moderate vul and wet period 94 3 low vul and 5 7 moderate vul has not substantial difference as shown in fig 9 a and c the difference between the vulnerability maps in dry and wet season especially in a high vulnerable area caused by anthropogenic effect i e pumping for agricultural demands in three studied aquifers sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the contribution degree of six indicators to the final vulnerability maps through galdit gaidit and galdit i methods using the eq 8 li and merchant 2013 8 p v v u l j v u l 0 v u l 0 100 where p v is the percentage of variation in the vulnerability index v u l j is the vulnerability score affected by changes in specific indicator j and v u l 0 is the vulnerability score for the initial condition without changes in the values of indicators for instance the p v values for the galdit gaidit and galdit i vulnerability indices respect to 10 of increase in the scores of influential indicators are calculated for three studied aquifers and shown in table 8 results indicate the predominant influence of indicator g i e aquifer type on the both galdit and gaidit vulnerability index adopted for three aquifers after the aquifer type g hydraulic conductivity indicator a and hydraulic gradient i have the greatest impact on gaidit index while in the galdit index the hydraulic conductivity a and distance from the shoreline d have the greatest influence after the indicator g the impact of the existing status of seawater intrusion indicator i has the minimum influence on both vulnerability indices of galdit and gaidit adopted for three studied aquifers however according to the guideline given in table 1 the weights of indicator i is equal to g this is related to hydrogeochemical properties of groundwater in the studied aquifers particularly c l concentration since duplicating the weight of indicator i does not significantly change the final vulnerability index through both methods aquifers hydraulic gradient recharge rate freshwater flux to the sea the contrast in freshwater and seawater density saturated thickness of the aquifer and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer materials could be considered as dominant factors causing swi 4 conclusion in this study a tabulated review of the vulnerability studies of the coastal aquifers based on overlay index methods was presented these methods require to identify the most influential factors on swi according to inherent susceptibility and anthropogenic factors in this regard two modifications were proposed on the input parameters of galdit method with replacing the height of groundwater level above sea level parameter l by seaward hydraulic gradient of freshwater parameter i gaidit method and by considering the parameter i as an additional input parameter of galdit galdit i method three methods of galdit gaidit and galdit i were evaluated in the three coastal aquifers to delineate the groundwater vulnerability zones to swi three groundwater chemical indices specified for swi including fraction of seawater f sea groundwater quality index g q i the concentration of tds and length of seawater intrusion l x estimated by strack s analytical solution were used for validation of two vulnerability indices results indicated that modifications implemented on the galdit method especially galdit i have significantly increased the correlation of final vulnerability scores with four indices of f sea g q i tds and l x therefore the suggested methods galdit i and gaidit provide a better representative of the vulnerable zones of the studied aquifers the proposed models could potentially be used as a more accurate groundwater vulnerability assessment that is a helpful and excellent decision making tool for groundwater management and risk assessment of aquifer subject to swi the results of sensitivity analysis indicated that the hydraulic gradient parameter i and groundwater height above sea level parameter l has the great impact on the groundwater vulnerability across the studied aquifers by gaidit and galdit i method the seaward hydraulic gradient parameter i is the most important variable controlling the seawater toe location provides the major source of fresh groundwater discharge to sea and reflects the resultant effects of recharge rate pumping rate head of freshwater freshwater flux to the sea sea level rise and changing in transmissivity of aquifer the galdit method doesn t consider this parameter as input on the other hand one of possible challenge accompanied by serving the parameter i for parameter l in the gaidit method may occur in delineating vulnerability of inland zones with a low spatial variation of groundwater level even inland groundwater level driven by the low impact of recharge discharge components in such regions the small values of the hydraulic gradient i may lead to inaccurate estimation of the final vulnerability index thus the results of gaidit method are more reliable for estimation of vulnerable zones due to time dependent anthropogenic changes e g pumping results of this study indicated that utilization of both parameters l and i in galdit i approach may produce more accurate vulnerability map which is more correlated to the four groundwater indices of f sea g q i tds and l x however increasing the number of input parameters compared with the gaidit and galdit may be one of drawback accompanied by the galdit i index the results of the study can serve as a primary target for the introduction of future mitigation and adaptation strategies on the indicators involving for vulnerability mapping of coastal aquifers to swi towards sustainable groundwater management the detailed

6727,laboratory evaporation experiments are used to determine soil hydraulic properties shp in most cases data are evaluated with the simplified evaporation method sem numerical simulations were used before to quantify the accuracy of the sem and it was found that the method yields accurate estimates of shp however previous tests neither accounted for heat flow nor thermal fluxes of liquid water and water vapor nor temperature effects on the transport properties since evaporation experiments are under most circumstances non isothermal past studies were therefore oversimplified and likely inaccurate the objective of this article is to test the accuracy of the sem using numerical simulations with a coupled model of water vapor and heat flow which is based on the philip de vries theory and solves the surface energy balance the model provides a state of the art description of the fluxes of water vapor and energy during laboratory evaporation from bare soil we present simulation results for different soil textures and resistances to vapor flow between soil and air and analyze the accuracy of the sem using the simulated data the resulting average error for the water retention curve is smaller than 0 0025 m3 m 3 and the relative error of hydraulic conductivity ranges from 5 to 15 for sandy loam and clay loam for sand the error in conductivity is higher but the structural shape of the conductivity curve is still identified relatively well compared to previous analyses of the evaporation method assuming isothermal flow the average error of the sem turned out to be only slightly higher keywords soil hydraulic properties water retention curve hydraulic conductivity evaporation method hydrus 1d parameter estimation 1 introduction modeling water flow in variably saturated porous media with the richards equation requires knowledge of the soil hydraulic properties shp different methods exist to determine the shp in the laboratory and the field dane and topp 2002 durner and lipsius 2006 among the laboratory methods the evaporation method has been applied frequently in recent years schelle et al 2013 beckers et al 2016 volk et al 2016 because it is easy to implement and provides data in high resolution in a relatively short time the evaporation method allows to determine the soil water retention curve wrc and the soil hydraulic conductivity curve hcc simultaneously by measuring the mass of a soil column and the pressure head in at least two depths in the soil the resulting data can either be analyzed with inverse modeling using the richards equation šimunek et al 1998 weber et al 2017 with the method proposed by wind wind 1968 iden and durner 2008 or with the so called simplified evaporation method sem introduced by schindler 1980 currently the sem is most frequently used because i it circumvents the necessity to solve the richards equation numerically ii the data evaluation is simple and can be reduced to spreadsheet level and iii it does not rely on assumptions regarding the parametric representation of the shp although the sem hinges on simplifying assumptions like linearity of pressure head water content and flux density in space and linearity of pressure head changes and evaporation rate with time the method has been shown to yield accurate shp for a broad range of soil textures evaporation rates and column lengths by theoretical studies based on numerical simulation wendroth et al 1993 peters and durner 2008a peters et al 2015 bezerra coelho et al 2018 wendroth et al 1993 were the first who tested the sem by numerical simulations with the richards equation peters and durner 2008a improved the original data evaluation of the sem and analyzed the effect of the simplifying assumptions on the accuracy of the shp determined with the sem their tests were based on numerical simulations with the richards equation and thus assumed isothermal liquid water flow only and neglected the flow of water vapor in the soil the contribution of vapor flow close to the soil surface to the total water flux during stage 2 evaporation is nowadays recognized or et al 2013 and hydraulic conductivity data in dry soil are often much higher than predicted by common models of the shp tuller and or 2001 peters and durner 2008b lebeau and konrad 2010 peters 2013 peters et al 2015 have reanalyzed the sem by including the flow of water in incompletely filled pores i e film and corner flow and the isothermal flow of water vapor the analysis was again based on numerical simulations with the richards equation i e an isothermal flow model but film and vapor flow were considered in an effective hcc the use of a novel parametrization of the shp which reflected recently gained knowledge on the storage and flow of water in dry soils peters 2013 iden and durner 2014 peters 2014 led to markedly different time series of pressure head compared to popular parametrizations of shp by van genuchten 1980 and kosugi 1996 this was the case for all soil textures but the differences were particularly pronounced for sandy soils and motivated the development of an improved calculation scheme for the sem peters et al 2015 the above mentioned numerical studies have used the richards equation as flow model and have neither accounted for heat flow nor thermal fluxes nor temperature effects on the shp modeling bare soil evaporation with the richards equation involves to specify a potential evaporation rate which reflects the meteorological conditions as upper boundary condition in many numerical codes the upper boundary condition is switched to a first type condition after a user defined pressure head at the top is reached šimunek et al 2013 this switch leads to the decrease of the evaporation rate which is observed during stage 2 of laboratory evaporation experiments or et al 2013 refer to this stage as falling rate period in contrast the first stage of evaporation stage 1 in which the atmospheric demand controls the drying rate is often called the constant rate period vanderborght et al 2017 explain the use of a critical pressure head in more detail review current approaches of evaporation models using continuum theory and analyze the different simplifications leading from a fully coupled multiphase flow model to an extended richards equation accounting for the fluxes of liquid water and water vapor given the complexity of the evaporation process the use of an isothermal flow model and a system dependent boundary condition with a switch is rather a technical compromise than a process based description of bare soil evaporation in this study we include previously unaccounted processes in the theoretical test of the sem we note that evaporation from bare soil involves a complex interplay of several small scale processes and any attempt to model it with a model based on continuum theory involves simplifications these processes which include the water vaporization from single pores of different diameter the connectivity between pores and the lateral small scale heat transport under and above the soil surface are still a matter of intense research or et al 2013 the objective of this study is to evaluate the sem by accounting for the surface energy balance of the soil heat flow and temperature dynamics during evaporation fluxes of liquid water and water vapor induced by pressure head and temperature gradients and temperature effects on pressure head and hydraulic conductivity these effects were neglected in previous analyses although laboratory evaporation experiments are non isothermal in the vast majority of cases our analysis therefore leads to a closer representation of reality and allows a more rigorous test of the accuracy of the sem we simulated evaporation experiments with the comprehensive coupled water vapor and heat flow model presented by saito et al 2006 which is based on the theory presented by philip and de vries 1957 the error of the sem was quantified by applying it to the computer generated virtual data this methodology has also been used by wendroth et al 1993 peters and durner 2008a b peters et al 2015 and bezerra coelho et al 2018 the central question is whether the conclusions on the accuracy of the sem drawn by previous investigators were too confident because of the previously unaccounted processes and temperature dependencies during evaporation 2 material and methods 2 1 numerical modeling of evaporation experiments the process of evaporation couples the flow of water both as liquid and vapor with the flow of energy by the transfer of latent heat which is an important component of the surface energy balance foken 2016 shuttleworth 2007 as a consequence evaporation from soil is a non isothermal process therefore we simulated laboratory evaporation experiments with the coupled water vapor and heat flow model described by saito et al 2006 the model considers the fluxes of liquid water and water vapor driven by the gradients of pressure head and temperature philip and de vries 1957 and will be referred to as coupled model in the remainder of this article we used the hydrus 1d software code šimunek et al 2008 šimunek et al 2013 šimunek et al 2016 to numerically solve the governing equations which are described in saito et al 2006 and sakai et al 2011 sakai et al 2011 have simulated laboratory evaporation experiments to analyze the process of subsurface evaporation during stage 2 evaporation and test the applicability of heat pulse probes milly 1982 saito et al 2006 novak 2016 and bittelli et al 2008 applied the theory to field data under dynamic atmospheric boundary conditions and presented different numerical codes for the solution of the coupled system of partial differential equations the soil hydraulic properties shp were parametrized with the peters durner iden pdi model peters 2013 iden and durner 2014 peters 2014 the pdi model accounts for water storage in capillaries adsorption of water to the matrix capillary flow and non capillary flow occurring in films and corners the wrc is described by a weighted superposition of two functions a capillary saturation function s c and a non capillary saturation function s nc which describes the storage of adsorbed water the general equation for the wrc is iden and durner 2014 1 θ h θ s θ r s c h θ r s nc h where θ h m3 m 3 denotes volumetric water content h m is the suction i e the absolute value of pressure head θ s m3 m 3 and θ r m3 m 3 are the saturated and residual water contents respectively in the pdi model the residual water content is the maximum volume of adsorbed water per unit volume of soil and the water content at which liquid continuity in the capillary flow domain ceases in dry soil the wrc described by the pdi has the linear shape on a semilog plot often measured with the dewpoint method campbell and shiozawa 1992 schelle et al 2013 and reaches a water content of zero at oven dryness fayer and simmons 1995 webb 2000 we used the capillary saturation function of kosugi 1996 to describe s c the kosugi model assumes a log normal pore size distribution and requires two parameters which represent the suction corresponding to the median effective pore radius h m m and the standard deviation of the lognormal density function σ m the pdi model rescales the original kosugi equation to ensure that the relative water saturation becomes zero at oven dryness iden and durner 2014 the non capillary saturation function is then added to parametrize the wrc eq 1 the liquid hydraulic conductivity function is computed as the sum of capillary and non capillary hydraulic conductivities 2 k lh h k lc h k lnc h with the capillary conductivity function k lc m d 1 and the conductivity function describing flow in films and corners k lnc m d 1 we will refer to the model of the shp as kos pdi in the remainder of this article a detailed mathematical description of the kos pdi model is provided in the original articles peters 2013 iden and durner 2014 peters 2014 a brief summary of the mathematical expressions is given in table 1 the implementation of the coupled model in hydrus 1d computes the isothermal vapor conductivity k v h saito et al 2006 internally this is the reason why different from peters 2013 k v h does not occur in eq 2 table 2 provides an overview of the model parameters of the three soils analyzed in this study and fig 1 left middle shows the soil hydraulic functions the same hydraulic functions have also been used in peters et al 2015 for modeling heat flow the soil thermal properties were parameterized with the model of chung and horton 1987 fig 1 right shows the soil thermal conductivity as function of suction for the three textures covered in this study a soil temperature of 20 c was used as initial condition for the heat flow simulation this means to assume thermal equilibrium at the beginning and is practically achieved by sealing the soil column at the top to prevent evaporation while allowing heat exchange through the casing a no flux bc was used at the bottom of the profile at the top the surface energy balance was solved by hydrus 1d saito et al 2006 the surface energy balance is fig 2 3 r n g h λ e ρ w e where r n w m 2 is net radiation g w m 2 is the soil heat flux h w m 2 is the sensible heat flux between the soil surface and the atmosphere λe j kg 1 is the latent heat of vaporization and λe ρw e w m 2 is the latent heat flux from soil to atmosphere caused by the evaporation rate e m d 1 in eq 3 all upward fluxes have a positive sign except for r n which is positive if it is directed towards the soil surface downward eq 3 differs from the energy balance equation in many textbooks bonan 2008 shuttleworth 2012 because it accounts for the sign convention of the soil model i e a positive value of g indicates an upward flow of energy shortwave radiation was neglected in the computation of r n i e it was assumed that the evaporation experiment is conducted in a dark laboratory net longwave radiation was computed by the stefan boltzmann law using the surface temperature of the soil and the ambient temperature the equation relating the evaporation rate with the vapor pressure difference between soil and atmosphere and the aerodynamic resistance is sakai 2011 4 e ρ vs ρ va ρ w r a where ρ vs and ρ va kg m 3 are the vapor contents of the soil surface and atmosphere respectively ρ w kg m 3 is the density of liquid water and r a s m 1 is the aerodynamic resistance in this study the aerodynamic resistance is an empirical parameter which we adjusted to achieve evaporation rates representative for a laboratory in a field situation r a can be linked to the wind speed and roughness lengths for momentum and heat vapor in the turbulent boundary layer bonan 2008 fig 2 illustrates the setup of an evaporation experiment the setup and experimental protocol ares described in more detail in schindler 1980 schindler and müller 2006 and peters and durner 2008a b the soil column has a length of 5 cm an inner diameter of 8 cm and a volume of 250 cm3 two tensiometers measuring the pressure head are installed at depths 1 25 and 3 75 cm fig 2 for the numerical simulations with hydrus 1d we discretized the domain into 41 equally spaced nodes a hydrostatic pressure head distribution with a pressure head of 0 cm at the bottom was used as initial condition for the water flow simulation a no flux condition was used as lower boundary condition bc at the top of the profile an atmospheric bc with a critical suction h 0 6 31 106 cm corresponding to oven dryness schneider and goss 2012 was used this value avoided the switch in the upper boundary condition flux to dirichlet because the simulated suction at the top node of the numerical mesh did never reach h 0 this assured that the flux across the top is computed from the simulated fluxes for the entire simulation and is not manipulated by the technical artifact to limit the suction at the top the water content tolerance for the iterative solution was set to 10 6 the evaporation experiments were simulated for a duration of 14 days we considered the three soils which cover a broad spectrum of textures and shp ranging from almost pure sand over sandy loam to clay loam table 2 for each soil three different aerodynamic resistances r a s m 1 were considered 30 100 and 300 s m 1 the values were chosen to reach evaporation rates during stage 1 between 1 and 10 mm d 1 we assumed an ambient temperature of 20 c and a relative humidity of 50 for the laboratory air the applied model summarizes current knowledge about the evaporation process in the framework of continuum theory the systematic variation of the aerodynamic resistance ensured that typical evaporation rates in the laboratory were obtained in micrometeorology the aerodynamic resistances for the sensible and latent heat fluxes are usually assumed to be equal shuttleworth 2012 therefore two of the components of the surface energy balance λ e e and h are treated adequately in the model of the remaining two net radiation r n is treated by the stefan boltzmann law finally the model for the ground heat flux g encompasses molecular heat conduction and convective heat transport by flowing liquid water and water vapor saito et al 2006 šimunek et al 2013 we note that the model in one spatial dimension assumes that horizontal flow of liquid water and water vapor are negligible that no energy is exchanged between the soil and the surroundings neither through the cylinder walls nor the bottom of the soil core and that no vertical redistribution of heat occurs in the casing an experimental validation of these assumptions is beyond the scope of this article and clearly a difficult task because the energy balance of the system must be closed the reason for this is that evaporation depends on surface temperature monteith 1981 the primary objective of this study was to test the accuracy of the sem use of model generated data ensures a robust test of the method because the correct soil hydraulic properties are known peters and durner 2008a 2 2 point data with the simplified evaporation method the data obtained from the numerical simulation of the evaporation experiments were used to check whether the sem yields unbiased point data of the shp the pressure head data corresponding to the soil depths 1 25 and 3 75 cm were filtered to a temporal resolution of 0 01 d the cumulative evaporation rates were filtered in the same way peters et al 2015 the resulting point data were then interpolated by cubic hermite splines fritsch and carlson 1980 to yield 100 equally spaced data points on the t axis these artificial data were then analyzed to yield point data of the shp as described below no artificial noise was added to the computer generated data because the focus of this study was to identify possible systematic errors caused by the simplifying assumptions of the sem we used the improved evaluation scheme presented by peters et al 2015 to calculate point data of θ h and k h the column averaged soil water content was calculated by dividing the amount of water l w cm which is a hydrus 1d output by the column height l cm soil hydraulic conductivity was calculated from the buckingham darcy law and by assuming that the flux across the center of the soil column equals 50 of the evaporation rate schindler and müller 2006 the hydraulic conductivity data were calculated after peters et al 2015 while different components of soil hydraulic conductivity are included in the numerical model of water flow the sem allows only to calculate an effective hydraulic conductivity k h as the sem assumes isothermal flow the hydraulic conductivity data k h were interpreted as effective values comprising both the liquid hydraulic conductivity k lh and the isothermal vapor conductivity k vh as a consequence the accuracy of the sem was quantified by comparing the calculated point values k h with the effective isothermal hydraulic conductivity function k lh k vh the resulting point values of hydraulic conductivity were assigned to an average suction which is calculated as the weighted mean of the arithmetically and geometrically averaged suctions the details of the adaptive weighting scheme can be found in eqs 6 and 7 in peters et al 2015 the column averaged water contents are calculated at an intermediate time level and assigned to the same average suction after calculating the point data of the shp the k h data were filtered according to the criterion presented in peters and durner 2008a this ensured that the retained k h data correspond to gradients in pressure head large enough to be accurately determined with tensiometers we used a fortran90 code for data evaluation which is also used in the hyprop fit software pertassek et al 2015 and performs all calculation steps outlined above the discrepancy between the calculated point values and the true hydraulic functions was quantified with the root mean squared deviation rmsd for θ h and log10 k h 2 3 simultaneous fitting of retention and conductivity curves we quantified the discrepancy between the true and the fitted hydraulic functions as the final step of our analysis because in a typical application of the sem the user fits a parametric expression of the hydraulic functions to the point data by nonlinear regression this step was also performed by bezerra coelho et al 2018 to quantify the accuracy of the sem the kos pdi model was fitted to the point data θ h and k h by minimizing the weighted least squares objective function 5 o p w θ σ i 1 m θ θ i θ h i p 2 w k σ i 1 m k log 10 k i log 10 k mod h i p 2 where p θ r θ s l o g 10 h m l o g 10 σ l o g 10 k s τ l o g 10 ω is the vector of unknown parameters θ mod h i p and k mod h i p are the shp predicted by the kos pdi model and w θ 1000 and w k 1 are user defined regression weights which reflect the accuracy of the data points the simulated water content θ mod h i p was calculated by the integral method peters and durner 2006 the objective function was minimized by the shuffled complex evolution strategy sce ua duan et al 1992 the data used in the objective function were restricted to those which can be determined by tensiometers with boiling delay schindler et al 2010 the maximum measurable suction was assumed to be h 2000 cm the fitted functions therefore reflect current measurement technology the agreement between the fitted and true shp was again quantified by the rmsd for θ h and log 10 k h 3 results and discussion 3 1 water and heat flow dynamics during evaporation experiments in this section we present the simulated time series of the evaporation rates and the state variables at the soil surface for the different soils and aerodynamic resistances r a fig 3 shows the results of the numerical simulation with the coupled model for the sandy loam and three different values of r a plotted are the time series of the evaporation rate fig 3a cumulative evaporation fig 3b and state variables at the soil surface fig 3c f for all values of r a the evaporation rate decreases rapidly at the beginning then becomes approximately constant during stage 1 and finally decreases during stage 2 the initial decrease of the rate is caused by a marked decrease in soil surface temperature fig 3c which leads to a decrease in saturation vapor pressure and therefore the vapor density fig 3f the temperature decrease is caused by the latent heat loss at the soil surface interestingly the evaporation rate during stage 1 is not inversely proportional to the aerodynamic resistance the rate for r a 30 s m 1 9 6 mm d 1 is not ten times as high as the one for r a 300 s m 1 1 4 mmd 1 the reason for this is that a higher rate leads as shown in fig 3b to a lower surface temperature 14 c versus 16 c and thus to a smaller vapor pressure as shown in fig 3f this is the reason why the dependency of the evaporation rate on aerodynamic resistance is nonlinear the time series of relative humidity and pressure head at the soil surface shown in fig 3d and 3e reveal that stage 1 ends when the relative humidity at the soil surface becomes smaller than unity this corresponds to a suction of approximately 104 cm for which the relative humidity is 99 at a temperature of 20 c according to the kelvin equation at the beginning of stage 2 the surface suction rises quickly and then slowly approaches 106 cm the value assumed for the atmosphere the decrease of the evaporation rate during stage 2 leads to a proportional decrease in the latent heat flux and to a continuous increase in surface temperature as shown in fig 3c this temperature increase counteracts the sharp decrease in relative humidity shown in fig 3d and contributes to the temporal dynamics of the surface vapor density shown in fig 3f which is proportional to the evaporation rate finally evaporation ceases when the ambient air and the soil are in equilibrium i e if the vapor densities of the soil surface and the atmosphere are the same in fig 3f the vapor density is therefore approaching the vapor density of the atmosphere i e 8 64 g m 3 for the sandy loam the total cumulative evaporation is 2 05 cm as shown in fig 3d this value equals the difference between the amount of water stored in the soil at the beginning and the water content at h 106 cm multiplied by the column length fig 4 shows the components of the surface energy balance top and the depth distribution of water content middle and pressure head bottom at different simulation times for the three soils analyzed and medium aerodynamic resistance r a 100 s m 1 for different soil textures the duration of stage 1 differs and the transition to stage 2 is sharpest for the sand and smoothest for the clay loam the decrease of the evaporation rate during stage 2 reflects the width of the pore size distribution and the more gently dipping liquid hydraulic conductivity function for the finer textured soils the time series of net radiation r n closely reflect the soil surface temperature r n has a positive sign indicating a flow of energy from the surroundings to the colder soil surface and approaches zero during stage 2 because the soil surface temperature approaches the ambient temperature in addition to the input of energy by r n the soil surface receives energy by the sensible heat flux h which is directed downwards as it follows the temperature gradient the ground heat flux g is positive upward at the beginning when the soil surface is cooling and reaches a value of almost zero afterwards at the onset of stage 2 g shows a short peak this peak reflects the transport of latent heat by water vapor towards the surface and is most pronounced for the sandy soil and almost invisible for the clay loam in which liquid flow plays a bigger role because of a higher k lh h in dry soil the results shown in figs 3 and 4 are of course a result of a simulation and therefore conditional on the assumptions emphasized in section 2 1 they are in close qualitative agreement with findings reported in other studies or et al 2013 fig 1 highlight the different evaporation stages the role of vapor flow during stage 2 and provide time series of the evaporation rate which are in close agreement with the ones shown in fig 3 our results on surface temperature are also in close agreement with the ones reported by sakai et al 2011 despite differences in column length and the lower boundary condition for heat flow 3 2 depth profiles of state variables during laboratory evaporation the depth distribution of water content is linear in the beginning of the evaporation experiment for all soil textures but becomes nonlinear with progressing evaporation fig 4 second row for the sandy soil a dry surface layer becomes evident after 6 d fig 4 bottom left overall the water content distribution is more nonlinear for the finer textured soils the question to which degree this nonlinearity leads to errors in the shp determined with the sem will be treated in the next section the lowermost row of plots in fig 4 illustrates the depth profiles of suction for all soils the pressure head distribution becomes strongly nonlinear after the onset of stage 2 when the suction at the top increases quickly for the sand the suction in the topsoil increases abruptly and approaches a value of 106 cm this results in a quick decrease of the evaporation rate and a very large pressure head gradient in the upper part of the soil for clay loam the suction in the topsoil increases more slowly resulting in a smoother decrease of the evaporation rate and a smaller pressure head gradient the sandy loam lies in between the two other textures for the sandy soil the spatial distribution of the suction after 14 d shows an air dry soil from top to bottom which indicates equilibrium with the atmosphere in agreement with this the evaporation rate is zero after 14 d a similar picture becomes evident for the sandy loam whereas the simulation time for clay loam is insufficient to evaporate the necessary amount of water 3 3 accuracy of point data of water retention and hydraulic conductivity fig 5 shows the true hydraulic functions calculated with the kos pdi parameters in table 2 and the corresponding point values obtained from the sem for the three soils and for the aerodynamic resistance r a 100 s m 1 the results for the other two resistances are provided in the supporting information si as the simulated temperature gradients were generally very small during the late phase of the evaporation experiments it can be assumed that thermal vapor flow is much less important than isothermal vapor flow therefore we include the isothermal vapor conductivity k v h in the plots the point values are shown for the entire data range which is not fully accessible by current measurement technology light grey and the measurement range of tensiometers dark grey with boiling delay schindler et al 2010 with an assumed maximum measurable suction h 2000 cm the number of data points of k h differs between the soils because the time series of suction and hydraulic gradient are different and the filter criterion of peters and durner 2008a which uses the signal to noise ratio of the hydraulic gradient was applied the number is smallest for sand because the hydraulic gradient develops only slowly due to the high values of k h in wet soil for sandy loam and clay loam the number of k h data points is much larger the wrcs top row illustrate the great accuracy of the sem for all three soils considered this finding is not restricted to the measurement range of tensiometers but surprisingly even covers the entire suction range not supported by current sensors the good performance of the sem for the determination of the wrc is confirmed by the rmsd values summarized in table 3 which are all smaller than 0 0025 the highest deviations are obtained for the sand for the hydraulic conductivity function the accuracy of the sem is excellent for sandy loam and clay loam but systematic yet small deviations become evident for sand this is reflected in the rmsd values in table 3 for sand the hydraulic conductivity function is overestimated between h 102 cm and h 102 5 cm the suction range in which film and corner flow start to dominate as indicated by the change in slope in the double logarithmic plot for higher suctions k h is underestimated systematically but this is already beyond the measurement range of tensiometers for clay loam the hydraulic conductivity function is slightly overestimated in the range h 101 1 to h 101 5 cm for sandy loam and clay loam and the medium evaporation rate r a 100 s m 1 the rmsd of l o g 10 k corresponds to a relative deviation of less than 1 for the smallest rate the relative errors are only about 0 7 for both soils for the sand the rmsd of l o g 10 k is 0 3 100 relative error and the change in slope of the k h function in the double logarithmic plot is identified relatively well for the clay loam the k h function close to saturation is overestimated by the sem the reason for this is that the true fluxes across the center of the column are smaller than 50 of the evaporation rate peters et al 2015 compared to peters et al 2015 the rmsd values in this study are on average approximately twice as high for the wrc for the hcc the rmsd values of l o g 10 k are on average 0 005 greater in this study although the errors of the shp are slightly increased compared to previous isothermal analyses the overall deviation between the correct and identified shp is still small the difference in the rmsd values between the studies illustrates the importance of using a coupled heat water and vapor flow model to assess the error of methods which rely on evaporative water loss e g the hot air method summing up the results of our study corroborate those of peters and durner 2008a peters et al 2015 and bezerra coelho et al 2018 and therefore reconfirm the high quality of the sem overall table 3 shows that the accuracy of the sem increases with increasing r a or decreasing evaporation rate however as was first shown by wendroth et al 1993 an increasing rate increases the hydraulic gradient in the soil and thus extends the range of reliable k h data further towards water saturation 3 4 accuracy of fitted water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves the results of fitting the kos pdi to the data points obtained with the sem for the measurement range of tensiometers are illustrated in fig 6 the results are shown for an aerodynamic resistance r a 100 s m 1 those for the other two resistances were very similar and are shown in the si again the true hcc includes k vh the hydraulic conductivity due to isothermal vapor flow the fitted hydraulic functions are shown over the entire range of suction dotted grey line and for the suction range covered by the measurements red line the rmsd values summarized in table 4 refer to the data range supported by tensiometer measurements i e current measurement technology note that errors in the parametrization of the shp model error are not accounted for although they occur in every real situation the results illustrated in fig 6 mainly confirm the result of the previous section overall the wrc is identified accurately for all three textures for the hcc the agreement between true and fitted functions in the measurement range is excellent for sandy loam and clay loam but a small systematic overestimation of k h is evident for the sand these findings are supported by table 4 the rmsd values for the wrc are all smaller than the ones shown in table 3 fitting a function to the point data decreases the error if systematic error is negligible this is the case for the wrc determined with the sem the same result is obtained for the hcc for sandy loam and clay loam in contrast fitting a function to the point data leads to an increase in the rmsd of l o g 10 k compared to table 3 for the sand a clear indication of a systematic error for this soil overall the relative error in k h is about 100 for sand and between 5 and 15 for the two loamy soils 4 summary and conclusions in previous studies the accuracy of the sem as a methodology to determine shp was analyzed based on the assumption that soil water flow can be modeled as an isothermal process however under most circumstances evaporation leads to non isothermal flow processes we have reanalyzed the sem with data which were generated with a coupled water vapor and heat flow model based on the philip de vries theory which solves the surface energy balance compared to the previous numerical tests of the sem our study explicitly accounts for heat flow liquid and vapor fluxes induced by temperature gradients and temperature effects on the transport properties and the pressure head our study thus captures the complex coupled nonlinear process of evaporation much more comprehensively than previous studies the main features of laboratory evaporation experiments were captured well by the simulation results namely i the decrease of the evaporation rate during stage 2 ii the cooling of the surface caused by the loss of latent energy and the subsequent warming of the soil during the stage 2 iii the development of a dry surface layer in sandy soil and iv the complete drying of a porous medium until equilibrium with the air humidity in the laboratory is reached our analysis of the sem mainly confirmed the results of previous studies but overall showed a slightly increased deviations between true and identified hydraulic properties the sem leads to accurate estimates of the shp across a wide spectrum of textures ranging from sand to clay loam and for different evaporation rates during stage 1 ranging from 1 to 10 mm d 1 the average deviation between the sem calculated point data and the true shp was approximately 0 001 m3 m 3 for the wrc for the hcc the deviation of k h was in the range of 10 for the loamy soils but almost 100 for the sand the deviation between the true and fitted hydraulic functions was even smaller except for the hcc of the sand for sandy soils with narrow pore size distribution conductivity curves determined with the sem should be taken with care and the evaluation of corresponding experiments by inverse modeling is recommended though numerically more expensive we confirmed that the sem is still a very useful tool to determine the general shape of the hydraulic functions and to support a preliminary selection of a parametric model our findings are not restricted to the current measurement range of tensiometers but are valid for the entire suction range this implies that the sem will profit from future sensor developments which help to further extend the measurement range of pressure head towards dryness we acknowledge that our study relies on the assumption of a perfect thermal insulation across the bottom and the sides of the column the effects of heat fluxes across the lateral and lower boundaries on the results of the sem should be studied in the future using a coupled water vapor and heat flow model in three spatial dimensions in addition the fluxes occurring in the surface energy balance in particular the sensible heat flux and the ground heat flux should be measured under controlled conditions to further validate the output of the coupled model used in this study

6727,laboratory evaporation experiments are used to determine soil hydraulic properties shp in most cases data are evaluated with the simplified evaporation method sem numerical simulations were used before to quantify the accuracy of the sem and it was found that the method yields accurate estimates of shp however previous tests neither accounted for heat flow nor thermal fluxes of liquid water and water vapor nor temperature effects on the transport properties since evaporation experiments are under most circumstances non isothermal past studies were therefore oversimplified and likely inaccurate the objective of this article is to test the accuracy of the sem using numerical simulations with a coupled model of water vapor and heat flow which is based on the philip de vries theory and solves the surface energy balance the model provides a state of the art description of the fluxes of water vapor and energy during laboratory evaporation from bare soil we present simulation results for different soil textures and resistances to vapor flow between soil and air and analyze the accuracy of the sem using the simulated data the resulting average error for the water retention curve is smaller than 0 0025 m3 m 3 and the relative error of hydraulic conductivity ranges from 5 to 15 for sandy loam and clay loam for sand the error in conductivity is higher but the structural shape of the conductivity curve is still identified relatively well compared to previous analyses of the evaporation method assuming isothermal flow the average error of the sem turned out to be only slightly higher keywords soil hydraulic properties water retention curve hydraulic conductivity evaporation method hydrus 1d parameter estimation 1 introduction modeling water flow in variably saturated porous media with the richards equation requires knowledge of the soil hydraulic properties shp different methods exist to determine the shp in the laboratory and the field dane and topp 2002 durner and lipsius 2006 among the laboratory methods the evaporation method has been applied frequently in recent years schelle et al 2013 beckers et al 2016 volk et al 2016 because it is easy to implement and provides data in high resolution in a relatively short time the evaporation method allows to determine the soil water retention curve wrc and the soil hydraulic conductivity curve hcc simultaneously by measuring the mass of a soil column and the pressure head in at least two depths in the soil the resulting data can either be analyzed with inverse modeling using the richards equation šimunek et al 1998 weber et al 2017 with the method proposed by wind wind 1968 iden and durner 2008 or with the so called simplified evaporation method sem introduced by schindler 1980 currently the sem is most frequently used because i it circumvents the necessity to solve the richards equation numerically ii the data evaluation is simple and can be reduced to spreadsheet level and iii it does not rely on assumptions regarding the parametric representation of the shp although the sem hinges on simplifying assumptions like linearity of pressure head water content and flux density in space and linearity of pressure head changes and evaporation rate with time the method has been shown to yield accurate shp for a broad range of soil textures evaporation rates and column lengths by theoretical studies based on numerical simulation wendroth et al 1993 peters and durner 2008a peters et al 2015 bezerra coelho et al 2018 wendroth et al 1993 were the first who tested the sem by numerical simulations with the richards equation peters and durner 2008a improved the original data evaluation of the sem and analyzed the effect of the simplifying assumptions on the accuracy of the shp determined with the sem their tests were based on numerical simulations with the richards equation and thus assumed isothermal liquid water flow only and neglected the flow of water vapor in the soil the contribution of vapor flow close to the soil surface to the total water flux during stage 2 evaporation is nowadays recognized or et al 2013 and hydraulic conductivity data in dry soil are often much higher than predicted by common models of the shp tuller and or 2001 peters and durner 2008b lebeau and konrad 2010 peters 2013 peters et al 2015 have reanalyzed the sem by including the flow of water in incompletely filled pores i e film and corner flow and the isothermal flow of water vapor the analysis was again based on numerical simulations with the richards equation i e an isothermal flow model but film and vapor flow were considered in an effective hcc the use of a novel parametrization of the shp which reflected recently gained knowledge on the storage and flow of water in dry soils peters 2013 iden and durner 2014 peters 2014 led to markedly different time series of pressure head compared to popular parametrizations of shp by van genuchten 1980 and kosugi 1996 this was the case for all soil textures but the differences were particularly pronounced for sandy soils and motivated the development of an improved calculation scheme for the sem peters et al 2015 the above mentioned numerical studies have used the richards equation as flow model and have neither accounted for heat flow nor thermal fluxes nor temperature effects on the shp modeling bare soil evaporation with the richards equation involves to specify a potential evaporation rate which reflects the meteorological conditions as upper boundary condition in many numerical codes the upper boundary condition is switched to a first type condition after a user defined pressure head at the top is reached šimunek et al 2013 this switch leads to the decrease of the evaporation rate which is observed during stage 2 of laboratory evaporation experiments or et al 2013 refer to this stage as falling rate period in contrast the first stage of evaporation stage 1 in which the atmospheric demand controls the drying rate is often called the constant rate period vanderborght et al 2017 explain the use of a critical pressure head in more detail review current approaches of evaporation models using continuum theory and analyze the different simplifications leading from a fully coupled multiphase flow model to an extended richards equation accounting for the fluxes of liquid water and water vapor given the complexity of the evaporation process the use of an isothermal flow model and a system dependent boundary condition with a switch is rather a technical compromise than a process based description of bare soil evaporation in this study we include previously unaccounted processes in the theoretical test of the sem we note that evaporation from bare soil involves a complex interplay of several small scale processes and any attempt to model it with a model based on continuum theory involves simplifications these processes which include the water vaporization from single pores of different diameter the connectivity between pores and the lateral small scale heat transport under and above the soil surface are still a matter of intense research or et al 2013 the objective of this study is to evaluate the sem by accounting for the surface energy balance of the soil heat flow and temperature dynamics during evaporation fluxes of liquid water and water vapor induced by pressure head and temperature gradients and temperature effects on pressure head and hydraulic conductivity these effects were neglected in previous analyses although laboratory evaporation experiments are non isothermal in the vast majority of cases our analysis therefore leads to a closer representation of reality and allows a more rigorous test of the accuracy of the sem we simulated evaporation experiments with the comprehensive coupled water vapor and heat flow model presented by saito et al 2006 which is based on the theory presented by philip and de vries 1957 the error of the sem was quantified by applying it to the computer generated virtual data this methodology has also been used by wendroth et al 1993 peters and durner 2008a b peters et al 2015 and bezerra coelho et al 2018 the central question is whether the conclusions on the accuracy of the sem drawn by previous investigators were too confident because of the previously unaccounted processes and temperature dependencies during evaporation 2 material and methods 2 1 numerical modeling of evaporation experiments the process of evaporation couples the flow of water both as liquid and vapor with the flow of energy by the transfer of latent heat which is an important component of the surface energy balance foken 2016 shuttleworth 2007 as a consequence evaporation from soil is a non isothermal process therefore we simulated laboratory evaporation experiments with the coupled water vapor and heat flow model described by saito et al 2006 the model considers the fluxes of liquid water and water vapor driven by the gradients of pressure head and temperature philip and de vries 1957 and will be referred to as coupled model in the remainder of this article we used the hydrus 1d software code šimunek et al 2008 šimunek et al 2013 šimunek et al 2016 to numerically solve the governing equations which are described in saito et al 2006 and sakai et al 2011 sakai et al 2011 have simulated laboratory evaporation experiments to analyze the process of subsurface evaporation during stage 2 evaporation and test the applicability of heat pulse probes milly 1982 saito et al 2006 novak 2016 and bittelli et al 2008 applied the theory to field data under dynamic atmospheric boundary conditions and presented different numerical codes for the solution of the coupled system of partial differential equations the soil hydraulic properties shp were parametrized with the peters durner iden pdi model peters 2013 iden and durner 2014 peters 2014 the pdi model accounts for water storage in capillaries adsorption of water to the matrix capillary flow and non capillary flow occurring in films and corners the wrc is described by a weighted superposition of two functions a capillary saturation function s c and a non capillary saturation function s nc which describes the storage of adsorbed water the general equation for the wrc is iden and durner 2014 1 θ h θ s θ r s c h θ r s nc h where θ h m3 m 3 denotes volumetric water content h m is the suction i e the absolute value of pressure head θ s m3 m 3 and θ r m3 m 3 are the saturated and residual water contents respectively in the pdi model the residual water content is the maximum volume of adsorbed water per unit volume of soil and the water content at which liquid continuity in the capillary flow domain ceases in dry soil the wrc described by the pdi has the linear shape on a semilog plot often measured with the dewpoint method campbell and shiozawa 1992 schelle et al 2013 and reaches a water content of zero at oven dryness fayer and simmons 1995 webb 2000 we used the capillary saturation function of kosugi 1996 to describe s c the kosugi model assumes a log normal pore size distribution and requires two parameters which represent the suction corresponding to the median effective pore radius h m m and the standard deviation of the lognormal density function σ m the pdi model rescales the original kosugi equation to ensure that the relative water saturation becomes zero at oven dryness iden and durner 2014 the non capillary saturation function is then added to parametrize the wrc eq 1 the liquid hydraulic conductivity function is computed as the sum of capillary and non capillary hydraulic conductivities 2 k lh h k lc h k lnc h with the capillary conductivity function k lc m d 1 and the conductivity function describing flow in films and corners k lnc m d 1 we will refer to the model of the shp as kos pdi in the remainder of this article a detailed mathematical description of the kos pdi model is provided in the original articles peters 2013 iden and durner 2014 peters 2014 a brief summary of the mathematical expressions is given in table 1 the implementation of the coupled model in hydrus 1d computes the isothermal vapor conductivity k v h saito et al 2006 internally this is the reason why different from peters 2013 k v h does not occur in eq 2 table 2 provides an overview of the model parameters of the three soils analyzed in this study and fig 1 left middle shows the soil hydraulic functions the same hydraulic functions have also been used in peters et al 2015 for modeling heat flow the soil thermal properties were parameterized with the model of chung and horton 1987 fig 1 right shows the soil thermal conductivity as function of suction for the three textures covered in this study a soil temperature of 20 c was used as initial condition for the heat flow simulation this means to assume thermal equilibrium at the beginning and is practically achieved by sealing the soil column at the top to prevent evaporation while allowing heat exchange through the casing a no flux bc was used at the bottom of the profile at the top the surface energy balance was solved by hydrus 1d saito et al 2006 the surface energy balance is fig 2 3 r n g h λ e ρ w e where r n w m 2 is net radiation g w m 2 is the soil heat flux h w m 2 is the sensible heat flux between the soil surface and the atmosphere λe j kg 1 is the latent heat of vaporization and λe ρw e w m 2 is the latent heat flux from soil to atmosphere caused by the evaporation rate e m d 1 in eq 3 all upward fluxes have a positive sign except for r n which is positive if it is directed towards the soil surface downward eq 3 differs from the energy balance equation in many textbooks bonan 2008 shuttleworth 2012 because it accounts for the sign convention of the soil model i e a positive value of g indicates an upward flow of energy shortwave radiation was neglected in the computation of r n i e it was assumed that the evaporation experiment is conducted in a dark laboratory net longwave radiation was computed by the stefan boltzmann law using the surface temperature of the soil and the ambient temperature the equation relating the evaporation rate with the vapor pressure difference between soil and atmosphere and the aerodynamic resistance is sakai 2011 4 e ρ vs ρ va ρ w r a where ρ vs and ρ va kg m 3 are the vapor contents of the soil surface and atmosphere respectively ρ w kg m 3 is the density of liquid water and r a s m 1 is the aerodynamic resistance in this study the aerodynamic resistance is an empirical parameter which we adjusted to achieve evaporation rates representative for a laboratory in a field situation r a can be linked to the wind speed and roughness lengths for momentum and heat vapor in the turbulent boundary layer bonan 2008 fig 2 illustrates the setup of an evaporation experiment the setup and experimental protocol ares described in more detail in schindler 1980 schindler and müller 2006 and peters and durner 2008a b the soil column has a length of 5 cm an inner diameter of 8 cm and a volume of 250 cm3 two tensiometers measuring the pressure head are installed at depths 1 25 and 3 75 cm fig 2 for the numerical simulations with hydrus 1d we discretized the domain into 41 equally spaced nodes a hydrostatic pressure head distribution with a pressure head of 0 cm at the bottom was used as initial condition for the water flow simulation a no flux condition was used as lower boundary condition bc at the top of the profile an atmospheric bc with a critical suction h 0 6 31 106 cm corresponding to oven dryness schneider and goss 2012 was used this value avoided the switch in the upper boundary condition flux to dirichlet because the simulated suction at the top node of the numerical mesh did never reach h 0 this assured that the flux across the top is computed from the simulated fluxes for the entire simulation and is not manipulated by the technical artifact to limit the suction at the top the water content tolerance for the iterative solution was set to 10 6 the evaporation experiments were simulated for a duration of 14 days we considered the three soils which cover a broad spectrum of textures and shp ranging from almost pure sand over sandy loam to clay loam table 2 for each soil three different aerodynamic resistances r a s m 1 were considered 30 100 and 300 s m 1 the values were chosen to reach evaporation rates during stage 1 between 1 and 10 mm d 1 we assumed an ambient temperature of 20 c and a relative humidity of 50 for the laboratory air the applied model summarizes current knowledge about the evaporation process in the framework of continuum theory the systematic variation of the aerodynamic resistance ensured that typical evaporation rates in the laboratory were obtained in micrometeorology the aerodynamic resistances for the sensible and latent heat fluxes are usually assumed to be equal shuttleworth 2012 therefore two of the components of the surface energy balance λ e e and h are treated adequately in the model of the remaining two net radiation r n is treated by the stefan boltzmann law finally the model for the ground heat flux g encompasses molecular heat conduction and convective heat transport by flowing liquid water and water vapor saito et al 2006 šimunek et al 2013 we note that the model in one spatial dimension assumes that horizontal flow of liquid water and water vapor are negligible that no energy is exchanged between the soil and the surroundings neither through the cylinder walls nor the bottom of the soil core and that no vertical redistribution of heat occurs in the casing an experimental validation of these assumptions is beyond the scope of this article and clearly a difficult task because the energy balance of the system must be closed the reason for this is that evaporation depends on surface temperature monteith 1981 the primary objective of this study was to test the accuracy of the sem use of model generated data ensures a robust test of the method because the correct soil hydraulic properties are known peters and durner 2008a 2 2 point data with the simplified evaporation method the data obtained from the numerical simulation of the evaporation experiments were used to check whether the sem yields unbiased point data of the shp the pressure head data corresponding to the soil depths 1 25 and 3 75 cm were filtered to a temporal resolution of 0 01 d the cumulative evaporation rates were filtered in the same way peters et al 2015 the resulting point data were then interpolated by cubic hermite splines fritsch and carlson 1980 to yield 100 equally spaced data points on the t axis these artificial data were then analyzed to yield point data of the shp as described below no artificial noise was added to the computer generated data because the focus of this study was to identify possible systematic errors caused by the simplifying assumptions of the sem we used the improved evaluation scheme presented by peters et al 2015 to calculate point data of θ h and k h the column averaged soil water content was calculated by dividing the amount of water l w cm which is a hydrus 1d output by the column height l cm soil hydraulic conductivity was calculated from the buckingham darcy law and by assuming that the flux across the center of the soil column equals 50 of the evaporation rate schindler and müller 2006 the hydraulic conductivity data were calculated after peters et al 2015 while different components of soil hydraulic conductivity are included in the numerical model of water flow the sem allows only to calculate an effective hydraulic conductivity k h as the sem assumes isothermal flow the hydraulic conductivity data k h were interpreted as effective values comprising both the liquid hydraulic conductivity k lh and the isothermal vapor conductivity k vh as a consequence the accuracy of the sem was quantified by comparing the calculated point values k h with the effective isothermal hydraulic conductivity function k lh k vh the resulting point values of hydraulic conductivity were assigned to an average suction which is calculated as the weighted mean of the arithmetically and geometrically averaged suctions the details of the adaptive weighting scheme can be found in eqs 6 and 7 in peters et al 2015 the column averaged water contents are calculated at an intermediate time level and assigned to the same average suction after calculating the point data of the shp the k h data were filtered according to the criterion presented in peters and durner 2008a this ensured that the retained k h data correspond to gradients in pressure head large enough to be accurately determined with tensiometers we used a fortran90 code for data evaluation which is also used in the hyprop fit software pertassek et al 2015 and performs all calculation steps outlined above the discrepancy between the calculated point values and the true hydraulic functions was quantified with the root mean squared deviation rmsd for θ h and log10 k h 2 3 simultaneous fitting of retention and conductivity curves we quantified the discrepancy between the true and the fitted hydraulic functions as the final step of our analysis because in a typical application of the sem the user fits a parametric expression of the hydraulic functions to the point data by nonlinear regression this step was also performed by bezerra coelho et al 2018 to quantify the accuracy of the sem the kos pdi model was fitted to the point data θ h and k h by minimizing the weighted least squares objective function 5 o p w θ σ i 1 m θ θ i θ h i p 2 w k σ i 1 m k log 10 k i log 10 k mod h i p 2 where p θ r θ s l o g 10 h m l o g 10 σ l o g 10 k s τ l o g 10 ω is the vector of unknown parameters θ mod h i p and k mod h i p are the shp predicted by the kos pdi model and w θ 1000 and w k 1 are user defined regression weights which reflect the accuracy of the data points the simulated water content θ mod h i p was calculated by the integral method peters and durner 2006 the objective function was minimized by the shuffled complex evolution strategy sce ua duan et al 1992 the data used in the objective function were restricted to those which can be determined by tensiometers with boiling delay schindler et al 2010 the maximum measurable suction was assumed to be h 2000 cm the fitted functions therefore reflect current measurement technology the agreement between the fitted and true shp was again quantified by the rmsd for θ h and log 10 k h 3 results and discussion 3 1 water and heat flow dynamics during evaporation experiments in this section we present the simulated time series of the evaporation rates and the state variables at the soil surface for the different soils and aerodynamic resistances r a fig 3 shows the results of the numerical simulation with the coupled model for the sandy loam and three different values of r a plotted are the time series of the evaporation rate fig 3a cumulative evaporation fig 3b and state variables at the soil surface fig 3c f for all values of r a the evaporation rate decreases rapidly at the beginning then becomes approximately constant during stage 1 and finally decreases during stage 2 the initial decrease of the rate is caused by a marked decrease in soil surface temperature fig 3c which leads to a decrease in saturation vapor pressure and therefore the vapor density fig 3f the temperature decrease is caused by the latent heat loss at the soil surface interestingly the evaporation rate during stage 1 is not inversely proportional to the aerodynamic resistance the rate for r a 30 s m 1 9 6 mm d 1 is not ten times as high as the one for r a 300 s m 1 1 4 mmd 1 the reason for this is that a higher rate leads as shown in fig 3b to a lower surface temperature 14 c versus 16 c and thus to a smaller vapor pressure as shown in fig 3f this is the reason why the dependency of the evaporation rate on aerodynamic resistance is nonlinear the time series of relative humidity and pressure head at the soil surface shown in fig 3d and 3e reveal that stage 1 ends when the relative humidity at the soil surface becomes smaller than unity this corresponds to a suction of approximately 104 cm for which the relative humidity is 99 at a temperature of 20 c according to the kelvin equation at the beginning of stage 2 the surface suction rises quickly and then slowly approaches 106 cm the value assumed for the atmosphere the decrease of the evaporation rate during stage 2 leads to a proportional decrease in the latent heat flux and to a continuous increase in surface temperature as shown in fig 3c this temperature increase counteracts the sharp decrease in relative humidity shown in fig 3d and contributes to the temporal dynamics of the surface vapor density shown in fig 3f which is proportional to the evaporation rate finally evaporation ceases when the ambient air and the soil are in equilibrium i e if the vapor densities of the soil surface and the atmosphere are the same in fig 3f the vapor density is therefore approaching the vapor density of the atmosphere i e 8 64 g m 3 for the sandy loam the total cumulative evaporation is 2 05 cm as shown in fig 3d this value equals the difference between the amount of water stored in the soil at the beginning and the water content at h 106 cm multiplied by the column length fig 4 shows the components of the surface energy balance top and the depth distribution of water content middle and pressure head bottom at different simulation times for the three soils analyzed and medium aerodynamic resistance r a 100 s m 1 for different soil textures the duration of stage 1 differs and the transition to stage 2 is sharpest for the sand and smoothest for the clay loam the decrease of the evaporation rate during stage 2 reflects the width of the pore size distribution and the more gently dipping liquid hydraulic conductivity function for the finer textured soils the time series of net radiation r n closely reflect the soil surface temperature r n has a positive sign indicating a flow of energy from the surroundings to the colder soil surface and approaches zero during stage 2 because the soil surface temperature approaches the ambient temperature in addition to the input of energy by r n the soil surface receives energy by the sensible heat flux h which is directed downwards as it follows the temperature gradient the ground heat flux g is positive upward at the beginning when the soil surface is cooling and reaches a value of almost zero afterwards at the onset of stage 2 g shows a short peak this peak reflects the transport of latent heat by water vapor towards the surface and is most pronounced for the sandy soil and almost invisible for the clay loam in which liquid flow plays a bigger role because of a higher k lh h in dry soil the results shown in figs 3 and 4 are of course a result of a simulation and therefore conditional on the assumptions emphasized in section 2 1 they are in close qualitative agreement with findings reported in other studies or et al 2013 fig 1 highlight the different evaporation stages the role of vapor flow during stage 2 and provide time series of the evaporation rate which are in close agreement with the ones shown in fig 3 our results on surface temperature are also in close agreement with the ones reported by sakai et al 2011 despite differences in column length and the lower boundary condition for heat flow 3 2 depth profiles of state variables during laboratory evaporation the depth distribution of water content is linear in the beginning of the evaporation experiment for all soil textures but becomes nonlinear with progressing evaporation fig 4 second row for the sandy soil a dry surface layer becomes evident after 6 d fig 4 bottom left overall the water content distribution is more nonlinear for the finer textured soils the question to which degree this nonlinearity leads to errors in the shp determined with the sem will be treated in the next section the lowermost row of plots in fig 4 illustrates the depth profiles of suction for all soils the pressure head distribution becomes strongly nonlinear after the onset of stage 2 when the suction at the top increases quickly for the sand the suction in the topsoil increases abruptly and approaches a value of 106 cm this results in a quick decrease of the evaporation rate and a very large pressure head gradient in the upper part of the soil for clay loam the suction in the topsoil increases more slowly resulting in a smoother decrease of the evaporation rate and a smaller pressure head gradient the sandy loam lies in between the two other textures for the sandy soil the spatial distribution of the suction after 14 d shows an air dry soil from top to bottom which indicates equilibrium with the atmosphere in agreement with this the evaporation rate is zero after 14 d a similar picture becomes evident for the sandy loam whereas the simulation time for clay loam is insufficient to evaporate the necessary amount of water 3 3 accuracy of point data of water retention and hydraulic conductivity fig 5 shows the true hydraulic functions calculated with the kos pdi parameters in table 2 and the corresponding point values obtained from the sem for the three soils and for the aerodynamic resistance r a 100 s m 1 the results for the other two resistances are provided in the supporting information si as the simulated temperature gradients were generally very small during the late phase of the evaporation experiments it can be assumed that thermal vapor flow is much less important than isothermal vapor flow therefore we include the isothermal vapor conductivity k v h in the plots the point values are shown for the entire data range which is not fully accessible by current measurement technology light grey and the measurement range of tensiometers dark grey with boiling delay schindler et al 2010 with an assumed maximum measurable suction h 2000 cm the number of data points of k h differs between the soils because the time series of suction and hydraulic gradient are different and the filter criterion of peters and durner 2008a which uses the signal to noise ratio of the hydraulic gradient was applied the number is smallest for sand because the hydraulic gradient develops only slowly due to the high values of k h in wet soil for sandy loam and clay loam the number of k h data points is much larger the wrcs top row illustrate the great accuracy of the sem for all three soils considered this finding is not restricted to the measurement range of tensiometers but surprisingly even covers the entire suction range not supported by current sensors the good performance of the sem for the determination of the wrc is confirmed by the rmsd values summarized in table 3 which are all smaller than 0 0025 the highest deviations are obtained for the sand for the hydraulic conductivity function the accuracy of the sem is excellent for sandy loam and clay loam but systematic yet small deviations become evident for sand this is reflected in the rmsd values in table 3 for sand the hydraulic conductivity function is overestimated between h 102 cm and h 102 5 cm the suction range in which film and corner flow start to dominate as indicated by the change in slope in the double logarithmic plot for higher suctions k h is underestimated systematically but this is already beyond the measurement range of tensiometers for clay loam the hydraulic conductivity function is slightly overestimated in the range h 101 1 to h 101 5 cm for sandy loam and clay loam and the medium evaporation rate r a 100 s m 1 the rmsd of l o g 10 k corresponds to a relative deviation of less than 1 for the smallest rate the relative errors are only about 0 7 for both soils for the sand the rmsd of l o g 10 k is 0 3 100 relative error and the change in slope of the k h function in the double logarithmic plot is identified relatively well for the clay loam the k h function close to saturation is overestimated by the sem the reason for this is that the true fluxes across the center of the column are smaller than 50 of the evaporation rate peters et al 2015 compared to peters et al 2015 the rmsd values in this study are on average approximately twice as high for the wrc for the hcc the rmsd values of l o g 10 k are on average 0 005 greater in this study although the errors of the shp are slightly increased compared to previous isothermal analyses the overall deviation between the correct and identified shp is still small the difference in the rmsd values between the studies illustrates the importance of using a coupled heat water and vapor flow model to assess the error of methods which rely on evaporative water loss e g the hot air method summing up the results of our study corroborate those of peters and durner 2008a peters et al 2015 and bezerra coelho et al 2018 and therefore reconfirm the high quality of the sem overall table 3 shows that the accuracy of the sem increases with increasing r a or decreasing evaporation rate however as was first shown by wendroth et al 1993 an increasing rate increases the hydraulic gradient in the soil and thus extends the range of reliable k h data further towards water saturation 3 4 accuracy of fitted water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves the results of fitting the kos pdi to the data points obtained with the sem for the measurement range of tensiometers are illustrated in fig 6 the results are shown for an aerodynamic resistance r a 100 s m 1 those for the other two resistances were very similar and are shown in the si again the true hcc includes k vh the hydraulic conductivity due to isothermal vapor flow the fitted hydraulic functions are shown over the entire range of suction dotted grey line and for the suction range covered by the measurements red line the rmsd values summarized in table 4 refer to the data range supported by tensiometer measurements i e current measurement technology note that errors in the parametrization of the shp model error are not accounted for although they occur in every real situation the results illustrated in fig 6 mainly confirm the result of the previous section overall the wrc is identified accurately for all three textures for the hcc the agreement between true and fitted functions in the measurement range is excellent for sandy loam and clay loam but a small systematic overestimation of k h is evident for the sand these findings are supported by table 4 the rmsd values for the wrc are all smaller than the ones shown in table 3 fitting a function to the point data decreases the error if systematic error is negligible this is the case for the wrc determined with the sem the same result is obtained for the hcc for sandy loam and clay loam in contrast fitting a function to the point data leads to an increase in the rmsd of l o g 10 k compared to table 3 for the sand a clear indication of a systematic error for this soil overall the relative error in k h is about 100 for sand and between 5 and 15 for the two loamy soils 4 summary and conclusions in previous studies the accuracy of the sem as a methodology to determine shp was analyzed based on the assumption that soil water flow can be modeled as an isothermal process however under most circumstances evaporation leads to non isothermal flow processes we have reanalyzed the sem with data which were generated with a coupled water vapor and heat flow model based on the philip de vries theory which solves the surface energy balance compared to the previous numerical tests of the sem our study explicitly accounts for heat flow liquid and vapor fluxes induced by temperature gradients and temperature effects on the transport properties and the pressure head our study thus captures the complex coupled nonlinear process of evaporation much more comprehensively than previous studies the main features of laboratory evaporation experiments were captured well by the simulation results namely i the decrease of the evaporation rate during stage 2 ii the cooling of the surface caused by the loss of latent energy and the subsequent warming of the soil during the stage 2 iii the development of a dry surface layer in sandy soil and iv the complete drying of a porous medium until equilibrium with the air humidity in the laboratory is reached our analysis of the sem mainly confirmed the results of previous studies but overall showed a slightly increased deviations between true and identified hydraulic properties the sem leads to accurate estimates of the shp across a wide spectrum of textures ranging from sand to clay loam and for different evaporation rates during stage 1 ranging from 1 to 10 mm d 1 the average deviation between the sem calculated point data and the true shp was approximately 0 001 m3 m 3 for the wrc for the hcc the deviation of k h was in the range of 10 for the loamy soils but almost 100 for the sand the deviation between the true and fitted hydraulic functions was even smaller except for the hcc of the sand for sandy soils with narrow pore size distribution conductivity curves determined with the sem should be taken with care and the evaluation of corresponding experiments by inverse modeling is recommended though numerically more expensive we confirmed that the sem is still a very useful tool to determine the general shape of the hydraulic functions and to support a preliminary selection of a parametric model our findings are not restricted to the current measurement range of tensiometers but are valid for the entire suction range this implies that the sem will profit from future sensor developments which help to further extend the measurement range of pressure head towards dryness we acknowledge that our study relies on the assumption of a perfect thermal insulation across the bottom and the sides of the column the effects of heat fluxes across the lateral and lower boundaries on the results of the sem should be studied in the future using a coupled water vapor and heat flow model in three spatial dimensions in addition the fluxes occurring in the surface energy balance in particular the sensible heat flux and the ground heat flux should be measured under controlled conditions to further validate the output of the coupled model used in this study

6728,supraglacial debris is known to strongly influence the distribution of glacier surface melt since melt inputs drive the formation and evolution of glacial drainage systems it should follow that the drainage systems of debris covered glaciers will differ from those of debris free glaciers this would have implications for the proglacial runoff regime subglacial erosion and glacier dynamics this paper presents analysis of return curves from 33 successful dye injections into the extensively debris covered miage glacier italian alps it demonstrates that the spatial distribution of supraglacial debris influences the structure and seasonal evolution of the glacial drainage system where the debris cover is continuous melt is lower and the surface topography is chaotic with many small supraglacial catchments these factors result in an inefficient englacial subglacial drainage network beneath continuous debris which drains to the conduit system emanating from the upper ablation zone melt rates are high in areas of clean and dirty ice above the continuous debris runoff from these areas is concentrated by inter moraine troughs into large supraglacial streams which encourages the early season development of an efficient englacial subglacial conduit system downstream of this area drainage efficiency from the debris covered area increases over the melt season but dye trace transit velocity remains lower than from moulins on the upper glacier future runoff models should account for the influence of supraglacial debris on the hydrological system keywords debris covered glaciers dye tracing glacier hydrology 1 introduction this paper presents a systematic glacier scale study of the internal hydrology of a debris covered glacier based on data collected over two ablation seasons debris covered glaciers are especially prevalent in mid latitude high elevation mountain ranges scherler et al 2018 such as the pamirs karakoram and himalaya scherler et al 2011 bolch et al 2012 minora et al 2016 caucasus mountains russia stokes et al 2007 and the western alps deline et al 2012 glacier runoff is important for downstream water resources in these regions especially during dry seasons xu et al 2009 maurya et al 2011 due to negative glacier mass balance the extent and thickness of supraglacial debris appears to be increasing globally with implications for future glacier mass balance bolch et al 2008 bhambri et al 2011 lambrecht et al 2011 kirkbride and deline 2013 scherler et al 2018 debris more than a few cm thick attenuates the diurnal melt signal due to the time taken for energy to be conducted through the debris to the ice surface fyffe et al 2014 the dominant effect of a continuous debris cover is a reduction in the melt rate compared to bare ice except where debris is thin or patchy where melt is enhanced østrem 1959 mattson et al 1993 kirkbride and dugmore 2003 mihalcea et al 2006 nicholson and benn 2006 brock et al 2010 lejeune et al 2013 fyffe et al 2014 minora et al 2015 understanding the nature and evolution of the drainage system of debris covered glaciers is important because it controls how meltwater inputs influence both glacier dynamics and proglacial runoff regimes e g mair et al 2002 considering the strong influence debris has on surface ablation rates extensive debris cover can be expected to influence the morphology and evolution of a glacier s hydrological system but the nature and extent of this impact is not currently known on debris covered glaciers melt rates are particularly high just above the limit of continuous debris fyffe et al 2014 contrasting with clean glaciers where melt rates increase towards the terminus it is this change to the patterns of meltwater generation that may alter the structure and evolution of the hydrological system of debris covered glaciers on debris free temperate glaciers dye tracing has demonstrated that the seasonal evolution of the englacial subglacial hydrological system is characterised by increasing efficiency over time this increase in efficiency is linked to the increase in volume and daily amplitude of surface meltwater inputs associated with the upglacier retreat of the seasonal snowline nienow et al 1998 willis et al 2002 campbell et al 2006 understanding these processes is as important for debris covered glaciers which can display significant velocity variations both seasonally with faster summer than winter velocities as found at baltoro glacier pakistan karakoram quincey et al 2009 mayer et al 2006 gangotri glacier indian himalaya scherler et al 2008 biafo glacier central karakoram scherler and strecker 2012 and miage glacier italian alps fyffe 2012 and in response to daily weather fluctuations with short term periods of faster flow also measured on miage glacier fyffe 2012 any impact on drainage form and development would also be expected to alter the relationship between melt production and the proglacial runoff regime relative to a debris free glacier studies of debris covered glaciers are therefore needed to examine whether the influence of debris on melt rates affects the glacier hydrological system there have been only a few preliminary dye tracing studies on debris covered glaciers hasnain et al 2001 studied the autumn close down of the hydrological system on dokriani glacier and pottakkal et al 2014 traced the transfer of proglacial stream water beneath the tongue of gangotri glacier neither study dealt explicitly with the influence of the debris cover table 1 direct investigation of englacial conduit systems within debris covered glaciers see table 1 for details has not yet revealed the morphology of inaccessible regions of the glacial drainage network nor gauged the efficiency of the entire system this dye tracing study of miage glacier has two objectives i to assess the influence of debris cover on supraglacial topography and hydrology and therefore on the amplitude magnitude and spatial distribution of meltwater inputs into the glacial drainage system and ii to determine the morphology and seasonal evolution of the coupled englacial subglacial hydrological system and its relationship to the spatial distribution of supraglacial debris cover these objectives provide the structural sub headings used in the following methods results and discussions sections 2 study site miage glacier is situated in the western italian alps fig 1 it originates from four main icefall tributaries the mont blanc dome bionassay and tête carrée glaciers as the main glacier tongue enters val veny it bends eastwards before splitting into the large northern and southern lobes and smaller central lobe the glacier area is 10 5 km2 over an elevation range of 1740 4640 m a s l the lower 5 km of the glacier is completely covered by debris which averages 0 25 m in thickness foster et al 2012 except for isolated debris free ice cliffs reid and brock 2014 debris thickness increases down glacier with sub debris ice melt suppressed over most of the lower tongue at higher elevations above c 2500 m a s l debris is confined to medial and lateral moraines with the intervening ice having a patchy covering of dust to boulder sized sediment hereafter dirty ice the debris originates predominantly from rockfalls and mixed snow and rock avalanches from the steep valley sides deline 2009 debris cover has been shown to influence the distribution of glacier thinning across the ablation zone smiraglia et al 2000 thomson et al 2000 diolaiuti et al 2009 annual horizontal glacier velocity measured between june 2010 and june 2011 was c 32 m a 1 for most of the main tongue decreasing downstream to c 13 m a 1 at 1 5 km above the southern terminus fyffe 2012 summer velocities exceed winter velocities by 26 on the main tongue although the difference decreases to 20 above the divergence of the three lobes fyffe 2012 ice thickness along the glacier centre line is a maximum of 380 m at around 2350 m a s l decreasing down the main tongue to 250 m before shallowing past the bend to c 120 m supplementary material a details the derivation of the ice thickness data a distributed surface energy balance melt model fyffe et al 2014 was used to quantify spatial and temporal variation in surface melting over the 2010 and 2011 summers 3 methods 3 1 background data field data were collected over two ablation seasons from 5 june 2010 to 13 september 2010 and from 4 june 2011 to 16 september 2011 three meteorological stations were located on the glacier the lower and upper weather stations lws and uws hereafter were full energy balance stations situated on continuous debris cover with the ice weather station iws measuring only air temperature on an area of dirty ice fig 1 details of the instruments installed on lws uws and iws are given in brock et al 2010 and fyffe et al 2014 the main outflow stream from the glacier exits the northern lobe while very little drainage exits the southern lobe discharge was monitored at a gauging station directly downstream of the northern portal fig 1 stage was measured using a pressure transducer mounted in a well attached to a large stable boulder see table 2 for details the onset hobo pressure data were compensated using air pressure data from mont de la saxe 7 6 km from the gauging station a high flow event in june 2011 caused damage to the well resulting in data loss between 18 june 2011 and 3 august 2011 and the repositioning of the well other data voids are 27 28 august 2010 and 4 8 september 2010 all recorded stages were adjusted to the datum of the june 2010 stilling well so that a single stage discharge rating could be applied to the entire record the stage discharge rating was derived from discharges calculated from dye dilution gauging using rhodamine wt in total 16 dye dilution gaugings performed in both 2010 and 2011 provided a two part rating curve which has a standard error of the estimate of 0 76 m3 s 1 which gave a percentage error of 14 6 using the average daily discharge in 2010 of 5 37 m3 s 1 the use of a single rating curve for the whole period was justified by the correspondence of gaugings from different field visits 3 2 the influence of debris on the supraglacial topography and hydrology 3 2 1 delimiting supraglacial catchments and routing supraglacial streams and their catchments were defined by applying arnold s 2010 lake and catchment identification algorithm lcia to a digital elevation model dem this supraglacial algorithm is favoured because it does not rely on the artificial filling of sinks before calculating the flow routing arnold 2010 provides detailed model methods the dem was derived from airborne lidar surveys in 2008 provided by regione autonoma valle d aosta vda dem hereafter and has a spatial resolution of 2 m and a vertical accuracy of 0 5 m the vda dem was resampled to a 4 m cell size and was clipped to the glacier area supraglacial catchments were categorised by surface cover type debris covered ice clean ice or dirty ice as shown in fig 1 by determining the surface cover within which their centroid was located 3 2 2 supraglacial stream measurements prior to conducting a dye trace the discharge and velocity of the chosen supraglacial stream qs and us respectively were measured in 2011 only either the velocity area method or salt dilution gauging was used to measure supraglacial stream discharge dilution gauging was preferred but was not always possible the cross sectional area was calculated by multiplying stream width by depth measured on average at 9 points across the channel surface velocity was measured by timing the passage of floats which probably overestimate mean depth averaged velocity dingman 2002 floats usually followed the stream thalweg and so travelled faster than the width and depth averaged flow salt dilution gauging was performed using a portable conductivity probe table 2 where the dilution gauging velocity was the distance between injection and detection points divided by the time between injection and peak of the concentration curve this gives a better measure of velocity than is provided by the float method therefore discharges measured using the velocity area method were adjusted using the ratio of dilution velocity to float velocity found from simultaneous measurements 3 3 the influence of debris on the englacial and subglacial hydrological system in total 48 dye injections were conducted into 16 surface streams with 33 breakthrough curves successfully detected all dye injections were carried out using 21 rhodamine wt liquid dye between 40 and 280 ml of dye was used per injection to allow comparison of breakthrough curves from the same streams repeat injections were conducted at similar times of day particularly for upglacier streams the injection times for streams traced on multiple occasions resulting in successful traces are 14 27 16 50 s3 13 00 17 10 s5 s5b 16 31 19 02 s7 15 15 16 22 s12 s12b 12 08 15 12 s14 s14b and 13 18 15 29 s15 dye traces were detected at the gauging station using a fluorometer see table 2 and a campbell data logger cr500 until 14 june 2011 when it was replaced with a cr10x at either 5 or 1 min intervals each fluorometer was calibrated in the field with each batch of dye with the dye concentration calculated after subtraction of the background fluorescence which was either a constant value or occasionally a gradient over time however high frequency background variation remained genuine dye breakthrough curves were therefore distinguished from background variability on the basis of a the dye concentration being greater than 2 the standard deviation of the background concentration and b a period of continuous above background dye concentration surrounding the peak value lasting at least 10 min the latter condition is necessary to distinguish from short term noise which can on occasion exceed the background concentration threshold for 1 2 min the standard deviation of the background variability was calculated using data from the first 30 min after dye injection this time period was chosen to be sufficient to capture the background variation which had a period in the order of several minutes while not including data influenced by dye emergence the minimum period of continuous above background dye concentration for interpreted traces was 15 min mean 2 h 59 min this supports the initial qualitative assessment that all interpreted breakthrough curves are due to dye dye was always injected into flowing streams on the lower glacier streams could be obscured by debris hiding moulins from view or contain clasts but the streams used for injections did not flow through the debris matrix itself on the lower glacier moulins were not located for the s1 s2 and s6 streams the s3 and s4 streams did apparently sink into a moulin a few metres from the injection point but this was hidden by large boulders s7 became englacial a short distance from the injection site through the cut and closure mechanism rather than via a moulin and the s8 injection was directly into an englacial conduit the injection point into s5 was into a stream 446 m upstream of the moulin and so the trace transit velocity u was adjusted to account for the time spent in the supraglacial stream using the measured supraglacial stream velocity us at the time of the test 2011 only henceforth only adjusted u is given on the upper glacier all successfully traced streams s10 s12 s13 s14 and s15 flowed directly into a moulin except s11 which likely flowed into the s10 moulin during 2011 repeat injections at individual points were prioritized five injection points were chosen two on the lower glacier s5 and s7 and three on the upper glacier s12 s14 and s15 see fig 1 the three upper points were intended to be spread equally along the glacier but all the moulins present were clustered in a relatively small area the parameters calculated for each dye breakthrough curve are given in table 3 4 results 4 1 the influence of debris on the supraglacial topography and hydrology the tributary ice falls have small surface catchments due to the crevassing creating a chaotic surface fig 2 and table 4 drainage capture will keep inputs small and widely distributed although large subglacial streams were exposed at the base of the tributary glaciers indicating that subglacial drainage does become channelized at this elevation in the mid glacier area the catchments are relatively large since areas of dirty ice are laterally enclosed by debris covered moraine crests figs 2 and 3 a table 4 shows that the dirty ice catchments which include the main medial and lateral moraines correspond to a larger mean catchment area streams injected in this area include s12 the main stream draining the eastern side of the upper glacier supplementary fig 1a and s14 the main stream draining the western side of the upper glacier supplementary fig 1b these streams had the highest qs and us of those measured table 6 with the qs range 0 378 0 888 m3 s 1 for s14 and 0 025 0 341 m3 s 1 for s12 and the us range 0 92 2 16 m s 1 for s14 and 0 43 0 50 m s 1 for s12 in contrast the crevassed debris covered lateral moraines had smaller supraglacial catchments due to the en echelon crevasses intersecting surface runoff on the heavily debris covered lower tongue the debris cover resulted in hummocky topography and consequently consistently small supraglacial catchments the maximum catchment area and mean area of the largest 10 catchments are much lower than for clean and dirty ice figs 2 3b and table 4 supraglacial streams were difficult to find in this region of the glacier and there was a lack of well defined moulins streams injected in the continuously debris covered zone included s5 the largest stream observed on the lower glacier and s7 both of which had relatively low qs and us the qs range was 0 027 0 032 m3 s 1 for s5 and 0 006 0 032 m3 s 1 for s7 and the us range was 0 13 0 25 m s 1 for s5 and 0 17 0 28 m s 1 for s7 crevasses are scarce here confirming the importance of the debris cover in determining the supraglacial catchment boundaries fig 2 4 2 the influence of debris on the englacial and subglacial hydrological system for context meteorological and proglacial runoff fluctuations are given in fig 4 dye trace parameters for all 2010 and 2011 injections are reported in tables 5 and 6 with dye return curves shown in figs 5 8 injections into s10 and above are termed upper glacier injections draining patchy debris and bare ice while those into s8 and below are termed lower glacier injections continuously debris covered ice no successful traces were obtained from s9 4 2 1 spatial patterns generally water entering the glacier via the main moulins around the upper limit of continuous debris cover travelled quickly to the proglacial stream with mean u of the s10 to s15 dye traces being 0 56 m s 1 these traces mostly had single peaked return curves fig 6a and 7b d f and relatively high percentage dye returns pr confirming that the majority of the water was routed efficiently most streams from the lower glacier had low u the average for all lower glacier injection points was 0 26 m s 1 with the exception of s6 and s8 fig 6a which had a higher u of 0 58 m s 1 and 0 43 m s 1 respectively return curves from lower glacier injections were generally broader and several displayed multiple peaks figs 5 6b and 7a c e a striking result is that average u increases with distance upglacier and is significantly positively correlated with the distance from the gauging station in june of both years and september 2011 with all time periods giving positive correlations see fig 9 a pr was also significantly positively correlated with distance from the gauging station in june of both years excluding pr values greater than 100 see fig 9b 4 2 2 seasonal evolution 4 2 2 1 lower glacier lower glacier traces in early june generally showed low u e g injections into s1 s3 s5 and s7 had u 0 2 m s 1 and often displayed multiple peaks e g s5 06jun11 and s7 05jun11 fig 5 an increase in the efficiency of the drainage network during june was evidenced by a decrease in the number of peaks in the s5 from seven to three more prominent peaks and s7 from multi to single peaked dye breakthrough curves fig 5 further evolution of the drainage network between june and july was shown at s5 by an increase in u and pr and a decrease in the dispersion coefficient d and dispersivity b alongside the increased prominence of the first peak in the breakthrough curve fig 7c the s3 29jul10 injection produced a single peak much clearer than its june counterpart with a higher u and much larger pr fig 7a a slight reduction in drainage efficiency between july and september was shown at s3 in 2010 by a reduced u and d fig 7a and table 5 and at s5 in 2011 by a reduced u and increase in the number of peaks in the breakthrough curve fig 7c 4 2 2 2 upper glacier most upper glacier injections in june into s10 s12 s13 s14 had u 0 4 m s 1 with low d and b despite the early season stage and extensive snow cover on the upper glacier traces tended to have discrete narrow peaks although the secondary peak on the s13 11jun10 trace suggests temporary water storage in the moulin or a secondary channel fig 8 the shoulder of the s15 13jun11 trace fig 8 indicates that water was being released gradually most likely past an englacial channel constriction comparing june and july traces the s15 28jul11 u was much higher than in june fig 7f and no longer had a flat top to the trace causing a reduction in d and b conversely the late july return curves s12 30jul11 and s14 29jul11 were slower and more dispersed than in june although they still had single peaks fig 7b and d respectively indicating the efficiency of the channel system had decreased s12 s14 and s15 were all injected again 3 or 4 days later at the start of august all three traces showed a strong increase in u fig 10 a a decrease in d and b and an increase in am fig 10b compared to the return curves prior to 31 july 2011 indicating an increase in channel efficiency between late july and early august the september traces from s12 s14 and s15 had higher u than the june and end of july traces but similar to or in the case of s12 slightly lower than their early august traces fig 7b d f and table 6 5 discussion 5 1 the influence of debris on the supraglacial topography and hydrology in the region of the glacier between c 2300 and 2500 m a s l surface topography is strongly controlled by contrasting ablation rates between thick moraine crest debris 0 02 m w e d 1 fyffe et al 2014 and more sparsely debris covered ice in the intervening troughs 0 05 m w e d 1 fyffe et al 2014 generating predominantly large valley shaped catchments medial moraines grow downglacier to 30 40 m vertical amplitude fig 3a thus relatively high meltwater discharges are focused into the inter moraine troughs resulting in a small number of high discharge streams feeding the cluster of moulins at s12 s15 this explains the relatively large qs and us measured at s12 and s14 section 4 1 surface relief decreases downglacier below 2300 m a s l due to the gravitational redistribution of debris down moraine flanks into the troughs this inverts relief development by reversing the ablation gradient down the moraine flanks resulting in the hummocky and chaotic topography of the lower tongue fig 3b consequently there is less potential for the formation of an integrated channel network on the continuously debris covered zone resulting in a local stream network with a large number of small catchments and hollows which may form ponds fig 2 and table 4 melt rates beneath continuous debris on the lower glacier averaged 0 019 m w e d 1 in 2010 fyffe et al 2014 hence much less meltwater per unit area is produced on the lower glacier despite the low elevation and relatively high air temperatures this explains the small qs and low us of the streams on the lower tongue the diurnal amplitude of qs on the debris covered part of the glacier is also likely reduced because the melt signal is attenuated beneath thick debris due to the time taken for the energy receipt at the surface to be conducted through the debris to the ice debris interface see figs 10 and 11 of fyffe et al 2014 furthermore meltwater may be further delayed while flowing through the debris matrix prior to reaching a supraglacial stream although this delay has not yet been quantified the cumulative effect of the surface debris cover is to reduce and attenuate the inputs into the rest of the hydrological system 5 2 the influence of debris on the englacial and subglacial hydrological system 5 2 1 early formation and evolution of a channelized system draining the upper glacier fast peaked and low dispersion dye breakthrough curves from the upper glacier indicate that a channelized system connects surface streams originating on clean and dirty ice above the continuously debris covered zone to the proglacial stream this was the case even in early june 2010 when the glacier was snow covered well below the elevation of the upper moulins the seasonal evolution of a temperate glacier s hydrological system is caused by an increase in the magnitude and amplitude of inputs into the system usually initiated by the switch from snow to ice melt which causes pressure fluctuations large enough to destabilise the hydraulically inefficient distributed system into a more efficient discrete channel system e g nienow et al 1998 willis et al 2002 campbell et al 2006 the establishment of a channelized network draining the upper glacier moulins prior to the depletion of the winter snow cover cannot be due to the year round survival of subglacial conduits because this is precluded by our closure rate calculations supplementary material a it is therefore argued that early season snowmelt inputs were able to initiate channelization this could be a consequence of the large catchment areas upstream of the moulins in the central ablation area section 5 1 the s12 and s14 catchments are at a relatively low elevation 2400 2500 m a s l for the region lower than the terminus elevation of most debris free glaciers in the western european alps melt induced evolution of a persistent snow pack may allow the development of an efficient supraglacial drainage system beneath the early summer snowpack to give input hydrographs of sufficient amplitude to channelize the system mair et al 2002 the evidence from miage glacier therefore adds to mair et al s 2002 argument that the retreat of the snowline is not always necessary for channelization both flow concentration between longitudinal moraines and efficient snow pack drainage are not exclusive to but may be more prevalent on debris covered glaciers the drainage network emanating from upglacier remained channelized from june to september indicated by relatively fast and single peaked return curves in both years however between june and july 2011 there was a relative reduction in channel efficiency section 4 2 2 2 likely due to cold weather in july resulting in partial closure of the main subglacial conduit when the weather warmed after 28 july 2011 the conduit was unable to evacuate the increased discharges efficiently resulting in hydraulic damming caused by the conduit geometry being small relative to the flow through the conduit supplementary material b discusses this interpretation by the end of july and beginning of august the dye breakthrough curves suggested an increase in channel efficiency likely a result of rapid conduit growth in response to the increased input discharges 5 2 2 englacial and subglacial drainage beneath continuous debris co existence of inefficient distributed and efficient channelized drainage several characteristics of dye return curves at miage glacier indicate that the hydrological system draining the continuously debris covered zone was far less efficient than that draining the upper debris free area these include low flow velocities multiple peaks high dispersion and low percentage dye returns since dye breakthrough curves integrate the effects of the whole drainage path the source of this inefficiency could be the supraglacial englacial and or subglacial part of the network supraglacial streams on the lower glacier all had low discharges and velocities so any supraglacial dye transport would be slower and more dispersed section 4 1 similarly flow within the englacial network would likely be slow if inputs are relatively small the englacial path may also be longer if the stream becomes englacial by the cut and closure mechanism rather than a vertical moulin e g s7 a less efficient englacial network in the debris covered zone is therefore a result of the debris reducing the supraglacial stream size and velocity as explained in section 5 1 single peaked return curves with a similar u to supraglacial stream velocity could be the result of inefficient slow transport through a channelized englacial and subglacial system however the multi peaked nature of the june dye breakthrough curves from s5 and s7 indicates the existence of a distributed subglacial system emanating from these streams this interpretation is based on the lack of other convincing mechanisms that could result in multi peaked traces englacial networks may alter the trace u and d but observations of their structure gulley and benn 2007 gulley et al 2009a b benn et al 2009 2017 suggests flow remains channelized meaning multi peaked traces would be unlikely variations in supraglacial and main channel discharge nienow et al 1996 schuler et al 2004 werder et al 2010 or an increase in roughness gulley et al 2012 have also resulted in breakthrough curves with low u and large d and b values however curves from these studies still exhibited one main peak although some displayed a shoulder or small secondary peak where multi peaked breakthrough curves have been detected they have been interpreted as resulting from flow in a distributed system e g at midtdalsbreen resulting from flow in a linked cavity system willis et al 1990 storglaciaren due to flow in an anabranching braided system seaberg et al 1988 the debris covered dokriani glacier suggesting a distributed system hasnain et al 2001 or from boreholes e g hooke and pohjola 1994 and iken and bindschadler 1986 the s5 and s7 streams therefore likely drained into an inefficient distributed system early in the melt season the role of debris in reducing meltwater inputs section 5 1 below the critical discharge at which channels develop appears crucial in inhibiting channelization hewitt and fowler 2008 these low magnitude and low amplitude inputs are not able to create water pressures great enough to reach the ice overburden pressure so there is no initiation of the unstable cavity growth needed to create an efficient channelized system downstream of where englacial water reaches the bed walder 1986 the sediment at the bed of the lower glacier pavan et al 1999 cited in deline 2002 may also inhibit channelization since the transfer of water within a soft bed acts to reduce subglacial water pressures and therefore prevent conduit formation flowers 2008 these results imply the coexistence of an inefficient distributed drainage system with an efficient channelized system beneath the continuously debris covered zone distributed and channelized systems are known to co exist on other glaciers e g beneath haut glacier d arolla nienow et al 1996 midtalsbreen willis et al 1990 and south cascade glacier fountain 1993 beneath miage glacier channelized drainage from the upper glacier travels beneath the lower glacier before exiting at the northern lobe proglacial stream meanwhile sub debris melt from the lower glacier is routed from supraglacial streams into the inefficient englacial subglacial system which subglacially may consist of a distributed or inefficient channelized system before joining the main efficient subglacial channel system with the rest of the water from upglacier those lower glacier streams with a relatively fast u s6 and s8 may have a more direct link to the main subglacial channel system the overall drainage system structure implied from dye tracing is shown schematically in fig 11 given the apparent association between surface topography and the geometry of the englacial and subglacial systems it is possible that the topographic evolution of debris covered glaciers during deglaciation could influence their hydrological system as the topography changes from youth debris cover restricted to moraines to maturity continuous thick debris uneven topography clayton 1963 supraglacial drainage would become constrained to small catchments draining to supraglacial lakes e g on the ngozumpa benn et al 2001 2017 and tasman glaciers kirkbride 1995 röhl 2008 subglacial drainage would be mainly inefficient except for conduit systems emanating from upglacier moulins or from sporadic lake drainage clearly further investigations of debris covered glaciers with a more mature topographic development are required 6 conclusion through an extensive dye tracing investigation of the hydrological system of a debris covered glacier this paper demonstrates that the structure and seasonal evolution of the hydrological system of debris covered glaciers is distinct from that of debris free glaciers this is significant because it influences the timing and magnitude of proglacial runoff with the slower transport of sub debris melt through an inefficient system resulting in a more attenuated proglacial hydrograph it also influences glacier dynamics with faster and more variable glacier velocities observed in the mid glacier corresponding with the locations of the largest moulins on the lower tongue glacier velocities are slower even though the subglacial drainage is inefficient likely because of the smaller meltwater inputs from the continuously debris covered area fyffe 2012 there are also implications for future runoff models which should consider the influence of supraglacial debris on the hydrological system since it cannot be assumed that the runoff models determined for clean glaciers will hold for debris covered glaciers the key findings are that 1 on miage glacier i the formation of an efficient channelized network develops downglacier of areas of clean ice snow and discontinuous debris on the upper ablation zone but drainage is inefficient beneath the continuously debris covered lower ablation zone and ii transit velocity through the hydrological system increases linearly with distance upglacier in contrast to debris free glaciers 2 runoff from the upper ablation zone is connected to the main proglacial stream via an efficient channelized system which becomes established early in the melt season when snow cover is still extensive and is maintained throughout the ablation season the establishment and maintenance of this efficient system is promoted both by very high ablation rates on dirty ice areas and by the topographic concentration of flow into large channels within the inter moraine troughs these troughs are themselves a result of differential ablation between the debris covered moraines and mainly debris free valleys 3 the majority of meltwater from the lower continuously debris covered area is drained via an inefficient englacial subglacial network which may feed gradually into the main channelized network although on occasion there is a more direct link with the main conduit system hence both efficient and inefficient drainage systems co exist beneath the continuous debris zone the inefficient network is a consequence of the dispersed low magnitude melt inputs which result in slower transport through the system and may prevent water pressure fluctuations becoming great enough to destabilise a distributed subglacial system the small discharges in this area are themselves a consequence of both low and attenuated melt peaks beneath thick debris possible delays as water is transferred through the debris layer and the hummocky topography which

6728,supraglacial debris is known to strongly influence the distribution of glacier surface melt since melt inputs drive the formation and evolution of glacial drainage systems it should follow that the drainage systems of debris covered glaciers will differ from those of debris free glaciers this would have implications for the proglacial runoff regime subglacial erosion and glacier dynamics this paper presents analysis of return curves from 33 successful dye injections into the extensively debris covered miage glacier italian alps it demonstrates that the spatial distribution of supraglacial debris influences the structure and seasonal evolution of the glacial drainage system where the debris cover is continuous melt is lower and the surface topography is chaotic with many small supraglacial catchments these factors result in an inefficient englacial subglacial drainage network beneath continuous debris which drains to the conduit system emanating from the upper ablation zone melt rates are high in areas of clean and dirty ice above the continuous debris runoff from these areas is concentrated by inter moraine troughs into large supraglacial streams which encourages the early season development of an efficient englacial subglacial conduit system downstream of this area drainage efficiency from the debris covered area increases over the melt season but dye trace transit velocity remains lower than from moulins on the upper glacier future runoff models should account for the influence of supraglacial debris on the hydrological system keywords debris covered glaciers dye tracing glacier hydrology 1 introduction this paper presents a systematic glacier scale study of the internal hydrology of a debris covered glacier based on data collected over two ablation seasons debris covered glaciers are especially prevalent in mid latitude high elevation mountain ranges scherler et al 2018 such as the pamirs karakoram and himalaya scherler et al 2011 bolch et al 2012 minora et al 2016 caucasus mountains russia stokes et al 2007 and the western alps deline et al 2012 glacier runoff is important for downstream water resources in these regions especially during dry seasons xu et al 2009 maurya et al 2011 due to negative glacier mass balance the extent and thickness of supraglacial debris appears to be increasing globally with implications for future glacier mass balance bolch et al 2008 bhambri et al 2011 lambrecht et al 2011 kirkbride and deline 2013 scherler et al 2018 debris more than a few cm thick attenuates the diurnal melt signal due to the time taken for energy to be conducted through the debris to the ice surface fyffe et al 2014 the dominant effect of a continuous debris cover is a reduction in the melt rate compared to bare ice except where debris is thin or patchy where melt is enhanced østrem 1959 mattson et al 1993 kirkbride and dugmore 2003 mihalcea et al 2006 nicholson and benn 2006 brock et al 2010 lejeune et al 2013 fyffe et al 2014 minora et al 2015 understanding the nature and evolution of the drainage system of debris covered glaciers is important because it controls how meltwater inputs influence both glacier dynamics and proglacial runoff regimes e g mair et al 2002 considering the strong influence debris has on surface ablation rates extensive debris cover can be expected to influence the morphology and evolution of a glacier s hydrological system but the nature and extent of this impact is not currently known on debris covered glaciers melt rates are particularly high just above the limit of continuous debris fyffe et al 2014 contrasting with clean glaciers where melt rates increase towards the terminus it is this change to the patterns of meltwater generation that may alter the structure and evolution of the hydrological system of debris covered glaciers on debris free temperate glaciers dye tracing has demonstrated that the seasonal evolution of the englacial subglacial hydrological system is characterised by increasing efficiency over time this increase in efficiency is linked to the increase in volume and daily amplitude of surface meltwater inputs associated with the upglacier retreat of the seasonal snowline nienow et al 1998 willis et al 2002 campbell et al 2006 understanding these processes is as important for debris covered glaciers which can display significant velocity variations both seasonally with faster summer than winter velocities as found at baltoro glacier pakistan karakoram quincey et al 2009 mayer et al 2006 gangotri glacier indian himalaya scherler et al 2008 biafo glacier central karakoram scherler and strecker 2012 and miage glacier italian alps fyffe 2012 and in response to daily weather fluctuations with short term periods of faster flow also measured on miage glacier fyffe 2012 any impact on drainage form and development would also be expected to alter the relationship between melt production and the proglacial runoff regime relative to a debris free glacier studies of debris covered glaciers are therefore needed to examine whether the influence of debris on melt rates affects the glacier hydrological system there have been only a few preliminary dye tracing studies on debris covered glaciers hasnain et al 2001 studied the autumn close down of the hydrological system on dokriani glacier and pottakkal et al 2014 traced the transfer of proglacial stream water beneath the tongue of gangotri glacier neither study dealt explicitly with the influence of the debris cover table 1 direct investigation of englacial conduit systems within debris covered glaciers see table 1 for details has not yet revealed the morphology of inaccessible regions of the glacial drainage network nor gauged the efficiency of the entire system this dye tracing study of miage glacier has two objectives i to assess the influence of debris cover on supraglacial topography and hydrology and therefore on the amplitude magnitude and spatial distribution of meltwater inputs into the glacial drainage system and ii to determine the morphology and seasonal evolution of the coupled englacial subglacial hydrological system and its relationship to the spatial distribution of supraglacial debris cover these objectives provide the structural sub headings used in the following methods results and discussions sections 2 study site miage glacier is situated in the western italian alps fig 1 it originates from four main icefall tributaries the mont blanc dome bionassay and tête carrée glaciers as the main glacier tongue enters val veny it bends eastwards before splitting into the large northern and southern lobes and smaller central lobe the glacier area is 10 5 km2 over an elevation range of 1740 4640 m a s l the lower 5 km of the glacier is completely covered by debris which averages 0 25 m in thickness foster et al 2012 except for isolated debris free ice cliffs reid and brock 2014 debris thickness increases down glacier with sub debris ice melt suppressed over most of the lower tongue at higher elevations above c 2500 m a s l debris is confined to medial and lateral moraines with the intervening ice having a patchy covering of dust to boulder sized sediment hereafter dirty ice the debris originates predominantly from rockfalls and mixed snow and rock avalanches from the steep valley sides deline 2009 debris cover has been shown to influence the distribution of glacier thinning across the ablation zone smiraglia et al 2000 thomson et al 2000 diolaiuti et al 2009 annual horizontal glacier velocity measured between june 2010 and june 2011 was c 32 m a 1 for most of the main tongue decreasing downstream to c 13 m a 1 at 1 5 km above the southern terminus fyffe 2012 summer velocities exceed winter velocities by 26 on the main tongue although the difference decreases to 20 above the divergence of the three lobes fyffe 2012 ice thickness along the glacier centre line is a maximum of 380 m at around 2350 m a s l decreasing down the main tongue to 250 m before shallowing past the bend to c 120 m supplementary material a details the derivation of the ice thickness data a distributed surface energy balance melt model fyffe et al 2014 was used to quantify spatial and temporal variation in surface melting over the 2010 and 2011 summers 3 methods 3 1 background data field data were collected over two ablation seasons from 5 june 2010 to 13 september 2010 and from 4 june 2011 to 16 september 2011 three meteorological stations were located on the glacier the lower and upper weather stations lws and uws hereafter were full energy balance stations situated on continuous debris cover with the ice weather station iws measuring only air temperature on an area of dirty ice fig 1 details of the instruments installed on lws uws and iws are given in brock et al 2010 and fyffe et al 2014 the main outflow stream from the glacier exits the northern lobe while very little drainage exits the southern lobe discharge was monitored at a gauging station directly downstream of the northern portal fig 1 stage was measured using a pressure transducer mounted in a well attached to a large stable boulder see table 2 for details the onset hobo pressure data were compensated using air pressure data from mont de la saxe 7 6 km from the gauging station a high flow event in june 2011 caused damage to the well resulting in data loss between 18 june 2011 and 3 august 2011 and the repositioning of the well other data voids are 27 28 august 2010 and 4 8 september 2010 all recorded stages were adjusted to the datum of the june 2010 stilling well so that a single stage discharge rating could be applied to the entire record the stage discharge rating was derived from discharges calculated from dye dilution gauging using rhodamine wt in total 16 dye dilution gaugings performed in both 2010 and 2011 provided a two part rating curve which has a standard error of the estimate of 0 76 m3 s 1 which gave a percentage error of 14 6 using the average daily discharge in 2010 of 5 37 m3 s 1 the use of a single rating curve for the whole period was justified by the correspondence of gaugings from different field visits 3 2 the influence of debris on the supraglacial topography and hydrology 3 2 1 delimiting supraglacial catchments and routing supraglacial streams and their catchments were defined by applying arnold s 2010 lake and catchment identification algorithm lcia to a digital elevation model dem this supraglacial algorithm is favoured because it does not rely on the artificial filling of sinks before calculating the flow routing arnold 2010 provides detailed model methods the dem was derived from airborne lidar surveys in 2008 provided by regione autonoma valle d aosta vda dem hereafter and has a spatial resolution of 2 m and a vertical accuracy of 0 5 m the vda dem was resampled to a 4 m cell size and was clipped to the glacier area supraglacial catchments were categorised by surface cover type debris covered ice clean ice or dirty ice as shown in fig 1 by determining the surface cover within which their centroid was located 3 2 2 supraglacial stream measurements prior to conducting a dye trace the discharge and velocity of the chosen supraglacial stream qs and us respectively were measured in 2011 only either the velocity area method or salt dilution gauging was used to measure supraglacial stream discharge dilution gauging was preferred but was not always possible the cross sectional area was calculated by multiplying stream width by depth measured on average at 9 points across the channel surface velocity was measured by timing the passage of floats which probably overestimate mean depth averaged velocity dingman 2002 floats usually followed the stream thalweg and so travelled faster than the width and depth averaged flow salt dilution gauging was performed using a portable conductivity probe table 2 where the dilution gauging velocity was the distance between injection and detection points divided by the time between injection and peak of the concentration curve this gives a better measure of velocity than is provided by the float method therefore discharges measured using the velocity area method were adjusted using the ratio of dilution velocity to float velocity found from simultaneous measurements 3 3 the influence of debris on the englacial and subglacial hydrological system in total 48 dye injections were conducted into 16 surface streams with 33 breakthrough curves successfully detected all dye injections were carried out using 21 rhodamine wt liquid dye between 40 and 280 ml of dye was used per injection to allow comparison of breakthrough curves from the same streams repeat injections were conducted at similar times of day particularly for upglacier streams the injection times for streams traced on multiple occasions resulting in successful traces are 14 27 16 50 s3 13 00 17 10 s5 s5b 16 31 19 02 s7 15 15 16 22 s12 s12b 12 08 15 12 s14 s14b and 13 18 15 29 s15 dye traces were detected at the gauging station using a fluorometer see table 2 and a campbell data logger cr500 until 14 june 2011 when it was replaced with a cr10x at either 5 or 1 min intervals each fluorometer was calibrated in the field with each batch of dye with the dye concentration calculated after subtraction of the background fluorescence which was either a constant value or occasionally a gradient over time however high frequency background variation remained genuine dye breakthrough curves were therefore distinguished from background variability on the basis of a the dye concentration being greater than 2 the standard deviation of the background concentration and b a period of continuous above background dye concentration surrounding the peak value lasting at least 10 min the latter condition is necessary to distinguish from short term noise which can on occasion exceed the background concentration threshold for 1 2 min the standard deviation of the background variability was calculated using data from the first 30 min after dye injection this time period was chosen to be sufficient to capture the background variation which had a period in the order of several minutes while not including data influenced by dye emergence the minimum period of continuous above background dye concentration for interpreted traces was 15 min mean 2 h 59 min this supports the initial qualitative assessment that all interpreted breakthrough curves are due to dye dye was always injected into flowing streams on the lower glacier streams could be obscured by debris hiding moulins from view or contain clasts but the streams used for injections did not flow through the debris matrix itself on the lower glacier moulins were not located for the s1 s2 and s6 streams the s3 and s4 streams did apparently sink into a moulin a few metres from the injection point but this was hidden by large boulders s7 became englacial a short distance from the injection site through the cut and closure mechanism rather than via a moulin and the s8 injection was directly into an englacial conduit the injection point into s5 was into a stream 446 m upstream of the moulin and so the trace transit velocity u was adjusted to account for the time spent in the supraglacial stream using the measured supraglacial stream velocity us at the time of the test 2011 only henceforth only adjusted u is given on the upper glacier all successfully traced streams s10 s12 s13 s14 and s15 flowed directly into a moulin except s11 which likely flowed into the s10 moulin during 2011 repeat injections at individual points were prioritized five injection points were chosen two on the lower glacier s5 and s7 and three on the upper glacier s12 s14 and s15 see fig 1 the three upper points were intended to be spread equally along the glacier but all the moulins present were clustered in a relatively small area the parameters calculated for each dye breakthrough curve are given in table 3 4 results 4 1 the influence of debris on the supraglacial topography and hydrology the tributary ice falls have small surface catchments due to the crevassing creating a chaotic surface fig 2 and table 4 drainage capture will keep inputs small and widely distributed although large subglacial streams were exposed at the base of the tributary glaciers indicating that subglacial drainage does become channelized at this elevation in the mid glacier area the catchments are relatively large since areas of dirty ice are laterally enclosed by debris covered moraine crests figs 2 and 3 a table 4 shows that the dirty ice catchments which include the main medial and lateral moraines correspond to a larger mean catchment area streams injected in this area include s12 the main stream draining the eastern side of the upper glacier supplementary fig 1a and s14 the main stream draining the western side of the upper glacier supplementary fig 1b these streams had the highest qs and us of those measured table 6 with the qs range 0 378 0 888 m3 s 1 for s14 and 0 025 0 341 m3 s 1 for s12 and the us range 0 92 2 16 m s 1 for s14 and 0 43 0 50 m s 1 for s12 in contrast the crevassed debris covered lateral moraines had smaller supraglacial catchments due to the en echelon crevasses intersecting surface runoff on the heavily debris covered lower tongue the debris cover resulted in hummocky topography and consequently consistently small supraglacial catchments the maximum catchment area and mean area of the largest 10 catchments are much lower than for clean and dirty ice figs 2 3b and table 4 supraglacial streams were difficult to find in this region of the glacier and there was a lack of well defined moulins streams injected in the continuously debris covered zone included s5 the largest stream observed on the lower glacier and s7 both of which had relatively low qs and us the qs range was 0 027 0 032 m3 s 1 for s5 and 0 006 0 032 m3 s 1 for s7 and the us range was 0 13 0 25 m s 1 for s5 and 0 17 0 28 m s 1 for s7 crevasses are scarce here confirming the importance of the debris cover in determining the supraglacial catchment boundaries fig 2 4 2 the influence of debris on the englacial and subglacial hydrological system for context meteorological and proglacial runoff fluctuations are given in fig 4 dye trace parameters for all 2010 and 2011 injections are reported in tables 5 and 6 with dye return curves shown in figs 5 8 injections into s10 and above are termed upper glacier injections draining patchy debris and bare ice while those into s8 and below are termed lower glacier injections continuously debris covered ice no successful traces were obtained from s9 4 2 1 spatial patterns generally water entering the glacier via the main moulins around the upper limit of continuous debris cover travelled quickly to the proglacial stream with mean u of the s10 to s15 dye traces being 0 56 m s 1 these traces mostly had single peaked return curves fig 6a and 7b d f and relatively high percentage dye returns pr confirming that the majority of the water was routed efficiently most streams from the lower glacier had low u the average for all lower glacier injection points was 0 26 m s 1 with the exception of s6 and s8 fig 6a which had a higher u of 0 58 m s 1 and 0 43 m s 1 respectively return curves from lower glacier injections were generally broader and several displayed multiple peaks figs 5 6b and 7a c e a striking result is that average u increases with distance upglacier and is significantly positively correlated with the distance from the gauging station in june of both years and september 2011 with all time periods giving positive correlations see fig 9 a pr was also significantly positively correlated with distance from the gauging station in june of both years excluding pr values greater than 100 see fig 9b 4 2 2 seasonal evolution 4 2 2 1 lower glacier lower glacier traces in early june generally showed low u e g injections into s1 s3 s5 and s7 had u 0 2 m s 1 and often displayed multiple peaks e g s5 06jun11 and s7 05jun11 fig 5 an increase in the efficiency of the drainage network during june was evidenced by a decrease in the number of peaks in the s5 from seven to three more prominent peaks and s7 from multi to single peaked dye breakthrough curves fig 5 further evolution of the drainage network between june and july was shown at s5 by an increase in u and pr and a decrease in the dispersion coefficient d and dispersivity b alongside the increased prominence of the first peak in the breakthrough curve fig 7c the s3 29jul10 injection produced a single peak much clearer than its june counterpart with a higher u and much larger pr fig 7a a slight reduction in drainage efficiency between july and september was shown at s3 in 2010 by a reduced u and d fig 7a and table 5 and at s5 in 2011 by a reduced u and increase in the number of peaks in the breakthrough curve fig 7c 4 2 2 2 upper glacier most upper glacier injections in june into s10 s12 s13 s14 had u 0 4 m s 1 with low d and b despite the early season stage and extensive snow cover on the upper glacier traces tended to have discrete narrow peaks although the secondary peak on the s13 11jun10 trace suggests temporary water storage in the moulin or a secondary channel fig 8 the shoulder of the s15 13jun11 trace fig 8 indicates that water was being released gradually most likely past an englacial channel constriction comparing june and july traces the s15 28jul11 u was much higher than in june fig 7f and no longer had a flat top to the trace causing a reduction in d and b conversely the late july return curves s12 30jul11 and s14 29jul11 were slower and more dispersed than in june although they still had single peaks fig 7b and d respectively indicating the efficiency of the channel system had decreased s12 s14 and s15 were all injected again 3 or 4 days later at the start of august all three traces showed a strong increase in u fig 10 a a decrease in d and b and an increase in am fig 10b compared to the return curves prior to 31 july 2011 indicating an increase in channel efficiency between late july and early august the september traces from s12 s14 and s15 had higher u than the june and end of july traces but similar to or in the case of s12 slightly lower than their early august traces fig 7b d f and table 6 5 discussion 5 1 the influence of debris on the supraglacial topography and hydrology in the region of the glacier between c 2300 and 2500 m a s l surface topography is strongly controlled by contrasting ablation rates between thick moraine crest debris 0 02 m w e d 1 fyffe et al 2014 and more sparsely debris covered ice in the intervening troughs 0 05 m w e d 1 fyffe et al 2014 generating predominantly large valley shaped catchments medial moraines grow downglacier to 30 40 m vertical amplitude fig 3a thus relatively high meltwater discharges are focused into the inter moraine troughs resulting in a small number of high discharge streams feeding the cluster of moulins at s12 s15 this explains the relatively large qs and us measured at s12 and s14 section 4 1 surface relief decreases downglacier below 2300 m a s l due to the gravitational redistribution of debris down moraine flanks into the troughs this inverts relief development by reversing the ablation gradient down the moraine flanks resulting in the hummocky and chaotic topography of the lower tongue fig 3b consequently there is less potential for the formation of an integrated channel network on the continuously debris covered zone resulting in a local stream network with a large number of small catchments and hollows which may form ponds fig 2 and table 4 melt rates beneath continuous debris on the lower glacier averaged 0 019 m w e d 1 in 2010 fyffe et al 2014 hence much less meltwater per unit area is produced on the lower glacier despite the low elevation and relatively high air temperatures this explains the small qs and low us of the streams on the lower tongue the diurnal amplitude of qs on the debris covered part of the glacier is also likely reduced because the melt signal is attenuated beneath thick debris due to the time taken for the energy receipt at the surface to be conducted through the debris to the ice debris interface see figs 10 and 11 of fyffe et al 2014 furthermore meltwater may be further delayed while flowing through the debris matrix prior to reaching a supraglacial stream although this delay has not yet been quantified the cumulative effect of the surface debris cover is to reduce and attenuate the inputs into the rest of the hydrological system 5 2 the influence of debris on the englacial and subglacial hydrological system 5 2 1 early formation and evolution of a channelized system draining the upper glacier fast peaked and low dispersion dye breakthrough curves from the upper glacier indicate that a channelized system connects surface streams originating on clean and dirty ice above the continuously debris covered zone to the proglacial stream this was the case even in early june 2010 when the glacier was snow covered well below the elevation of the upper moulins the seasonal evolution of a temperate glacier s hydrological system is caused by an increase in the magnitude and amplitude of inputs into the system usually initiated by the switch from snow to ice melt which causes pressure fluctuations large enough to destabilise the hydraulically inefficient distributed system into a more efficient discrete channel system e g nienow et al 1998 willis et al 2002 campbell et al 2006 the establishment of a channelized network draining the upper glacier moulins prior to the depletion of the winter snow cover cannot be due to the year round survival of subglacial conduits because this is precluded by our closure rate calculations supplementary material a it is therefore argued that early season snowmelt inputs were able to initiate channelization this could be a consequence of the large catchment areas upstream of the moulins in the central ablation area section 5 1 the s12 and s14 catchments are at a relatively low elevation 2400 2500 m a s l for the region lower than the terminus elevation of most debris free glaciers in the western european alps melt induced evolution of a persistent snow pack may allow the development of an efficient supraglacial drainage system beneath the early summer snowpack to give input hydrographs of sufficient amplitude to channelize the system mair et al 2002 the evidence from miage glacier therefore adds to mair et al s 2002 argument that the retreat of the snowline is not always necessary for channelization both flow concentration between longitudinal moraines and efficient snow pack drainage are not exclusive to but may be more prevalent on debris covered glaciers the drainage network emanating from upglacier remained channelized from june to september indicated by relatively fast and single peaked return curves in both years however between june and july 2011 there was a relative reduction in channel efficiency section 4 2 2 2 likely due to cold weather in july resulting in partial closure of the main subglacial conduit when the weather warmed after 28 july 2011 the conduit was unable to evacuate the increased discharges efficiently resulting in hydraulic damming caused by the conduit geometry being small relative to the flow through the conduit supplementary material b discusses this interpretation by the end of july and beginning of august the dye breakthrough curves suggested an increase in channel efficiency likely a result of rapid conduit growth in response to the increased input discharges 5 2 2 englacial and subglacial drainage beneath continuous debris co existence of inefficient distributed and efficient channelized drainage several characteristics of dye return curves at miage glacier indicate that the hydrological system draining the continuously debris covered zone was far less efficient than that draining the upper debris free area these include low flow velocities multiple peaks high dispersion and low percentage dye returns since dye breakthrough curves integrate the effects of the whole drainage path the source of this inefficiency could be the supraglacial englacial and or subglacial part of the network supraglacial streams on the lower glacier all had low discharges and velocities so any supraglacial dye transport would be slower and more dispersed section 4 1 similarly flow within the englacial network would likely be slow if inputs are relatively small the englacial path may also be longer if the stream becomes englacial by the cut and closure mechanism rather than a vertical moulin e g s7 a less efficient englacial network in the debris covered zone is therefore a result of the debris reducing the supraglacial stream size and velocity as explained in section 5 1 single peaked return curves with a similar u to supraglacial stream velocity could be the result of inefficient slow transport through a channelized englacial and subglacial system however the multi peaked nature of the june dye breakthrough curves from s5 and s7 indicates the existence of a distributed subglacial system emanating from these streams this interpretation is based on the lack of other convincing mechanisms that could result in multi peaked traces englacial networks may alter the trace u and d but observations of their structure gulley and benn 2007 gulley et al 2009a b benn et al 2009 2017 suggests flow remains channelized meaning multi peaked traces would be unlikely variations in supraglacial and main channel discharge nienow et al 1996 schuler et al 2004 werder et al 2010 or an increase in roughness gulley et al 2012 have also resulted in breakthrough curves with low u and large d and b values however curves from these studies still exhibited one main peak although some displayed a shoulder or small secondary peak where multi peaked breakthrough curves have been detected they have been interpreted as resulting from flow in a distributed system e g at midtdalsbreen resulting from flow in a linked cavity system willis et al 1990 storglaciaren due to flow in an anabranching braided system seaberg et al 1988 the debris covered dokriani glacier suggesting a distributed system hasnain et al 2001 or from boreholes e g hooke and pohjola 1994 and iken and bindschadler 1986 the s5 and s7 streams therefore likely drained into an inefficient distributed system early in the melt season the role of debris in reducing meltwater inputs section 5 1 below the critical discharge at which channels develop appears crucial in inhibiting channelization hewitt and fowler 2008 these low magnitude and low amplitude inputs are not able to create water pressures great enough to reach the ice overburden pressure so there is no initiation of the unstable cavity growth needed to create an efficient channelized system downstream of where englacial water reaches the bed walder 1986 the sediment at the bed of the lower glacier pavan et al 1999 cited in deline 2002 may also inhibit channelization since the transfer of water within a soft bed acts to reduce subglacial water pressures and therefore prevent conduit formation flowers 2008 these results imply the coexistence of an inefficient distributed drainage system with an efficient channelized system beneath the continuously debris covered zone distributed and channelized systems are known to co exist on other glaciers e g beneath haut glacier d arolla nienow et al 1996 midtalsbreen willis et al 1990 and south cascade glacier fountain 1993 beneath miage glacier channelized drainage from the upper glacier travels beneath the lower glacier before exiting at the northern lobe proglacial stream meanwhile sub debris melt from the lower glacier is routed from supraglacial streams into the inefficient englacial subglacial system which subglacially may consist of a distributed or inefficient channelized system before joining the main efficient subglacial channel system with the rest of the water from upglacier those lower glacier streams with a relatively fast u s6 and s8 may have a more direct link to the main subglacial channel system the overall drainage system structure implied from dye tracing is shown schematically in fig 11 given the apparent association between surface topography and the geometry of the englacial and subglacial systems it is possible that the topographic evolution of debris covered glaciers during deglaciation could influence their hydrological system as the topography changes from youth debris cover restricted to moraines to maturity continuous thick debris uneven topography clayton 1963 supraglacial drainage would become constrained to small catchments draining to supraglacial lakes e g on the ngozumpa benn et al 2001 2017 and tasman glaciers kirkbride 1995 röhl 2008 subglacial drainage would be mainly inefficient except for conduit systems emanating from upglacier moulins or from sporadic lake drainage clearly further investigations of debris covered glaciers with a more mature topographic development are required 6 conclusion through an extensive dye tracing investigation of the hydrological system of a debris covered glacier this paper demonstrates that the structure and seasonal evolution of the hydrological system of debris covered glaciers is distinct from that of debris free glaciers this is significant because it influences the timing and magnitude of proglacial runoff with the slower transport of sub debris melt through an inefficient system resulting in a more attenuated proglacial hydrograph it also influences glacier dynamics with faster and more variable glacier velocities observed in the mid glacier corresponding with the locations of the largest moulins on the lower tongue glacier velocities are slower even though the subglacial drainage is inefficient likely because of the smaller meltwater inputs from the continuously debris covered area fyffe 2012 there are also implications for future runoff models which should consider the influence of supraglacial debris on the hydrological system since it cannot be assumed that the runoff models determined for clean glaciers will hold for debris covered glaciers the key findings are that 1 on miage glacier i the formation of an efficient channelized network develops downglacier of areas of clean ice snow and discontinuous debris on the upper ablation zone but drainage is inefficient beneath the continuously debris covered lower ablation zone and ii transit velocity through the hydrological system increases linearly with distance upglacier in contrast to debris free glaciers 2 runoff from the upper ablation zone is connected to the main proglacial stream via an efficient channelized system which becomes established early in the melt season when snow cover is still extensive and is maintained throughout the ablation season the establishment and maintenance of this efficient system is promoted both by very high ablation rates on dirty ice areas and by the topographic concentration of flow into large channels within the inter moraine troughs these troughs are themselves a result of differential ablation between the debris covered moraines and mainly debris free valleys 3 the majority of meltwater from the lower continuously debris covered area is drained via an inefficient englacial subglacial network which may feed gradually into the main channelized network although on occasion there is a more direct link with the main conduit system hence both efficient and inefficient drainage systems co exist beneath the continuous debris zone the inefficient network is a consequence of the dispersed low magnitude melt inputs which result in slower transport through the system and may prevent water pressure fluctuations becoming great enough to destabilise a distributed subglacial system the small discharges in this area are themselves a consequence of both low and attenuated melt peaks beneath thick debris possible delays as water is transferred through the debris layer and the hummocky topography which restricts catchment and stream size declaration of interest none acknowledgements this work was undertaken while c fyffe was in receipt of a studentship from the school of the environment university

6729,drywells are increasingly used to capture stormwater runoff for surface infiltration and aquifer recharge but little research has examined the role of ubiquitous subsurface heterogeneity in hydraulic properties on drywell performance numerical experiments were therefore conducted using the hydrus 2d 3d software to systematically study the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on drywell infiltration subsurface heterogeneity was described deterministically by defining soil layers or lenses or by generating stochastic realizations of soil hydraulic properties with selected variance σ and horizontal x and vertical z correlation lengths the infiltration rate increased when a high permeability layer lens was located at the bottom of the drywell and had larger vertical and especially horizontal dimensions furthermore the average cumulative infiltration i for 100 stochastic realizations of a given subsurface heterogeneity increased with σ and x but decreased with z this indicates that the presence of many highly permeable laterally extending lenses provides a larger surface area for enhanced infiltration than the presence of isolated highly permeable lenses the ability to inversely determine soil hydraulic properties from numerical drywell infiltration results was also investigated the hydraulic properties and the lateral extension of a highly permeable lens could be accurately determined for certain idealized situations e g simple layered profiles using constant head tests however variability in soil hydraulic properties could not be accurately determined for systems that exhibited more realistic stochastic heterogeneity in this case the heterogeneous profile could be replaced with an equivalent homogeneous profile and values of an effective isotropic saturated conductivity k s and the shape parameter in the soil water retention function α could be inversely determined the average value of k s for 100 stochastic realizations showed a similar dependency to i on σ x and z whereas the average value of α had large confidence interval for soil heterogeneity parameters and played a secondary role in drywell infiltration this research provides valuable insight on the selection of site design installation and long term performance of a drywell keywords drywell infiltration stochastic simulation inverse optimization effective hydraulic properties hydrus 2d 3d 1 introduction freshwater resources determine the balance between food security public health industrial growth economic development environmental sustainability and the survival of ecosystems across the world rosegrant et al 2002 however water scarcity occurs in many parts of the world about 1 1 billion people worldwide lack access to safe water and at least two thirds of the global population over 4 0 billion people live under conditions of severe water scarcity at least 1 month each year kummu et al 2016 groundwater decline low or nonexistent river flow and water pollution are some of the major signs of water scarcity postel 2000 although the global hydrologic cycle produces more freshwater than is needed to sustain the current global population 69 of this resource is not available to humans due to rapid runoff or distribution in geographically isolated regions postel 2000 growing food to meet the needs of the global population requires extraction of a large volume of water and irrigated agriculture accounts for two thirds of all water withdrawals from natural water resources shiklomanov 2000 the unsustainable pumping of groundwater exceeds the renewable water limits in many regions postel 2000 postel et al 1996 therefore there is an urgency to find alternative sources of freshwater to invest in water infrastructure to develop innovative technologies to recycle reuse and preserve stormwater and to improve water management several countries around the world are practicing artificial or managed aquifer recharge using engineered systems to collect surface water and enhance its infiltration and subsequent movement to aquifers to augment groundwater resources infiltration and managed aquifer recharge can be achieved using surface infiltration e g infiltration basins direct injection e g aquifer storage transfer and recovery and vadose zone infiltration e g drywells bouwer 2002 bouwer et al 1999 dillon 2005 edwards et al 2016 sasidharan et al 2018 techniques in recent years drywells have gained a lot of attention in the united states and across the world drywells are vadose zone infiltration wells that end at least 1 3 m above the water table lacdpw 2014 there are several potential advantages associated with vadose zone infiltration over surface infiltration and direct injection wells this includes a minimal evaporative loss of water a small installation area a large ponding depth and removal of contaminants in the vadose zone edwards et al 2016 sasidharan et al 2018 there are currently 75 000 drywells in the states of washington oregon california and arizona of the united states edwards et al 2016 and their number is increasing annually however not many studies have evaluated the long term performance of drywells and their environmental impact the purpose of a drywell is to transfer water from a poorly drained or low permeable surface capture area to an aquifer for subsurface water storage the current installation practice involves drilling a drywell at a site and inspecting soil borings or profiles for the presence of layers with adequate permeability to ensure drainage for design storm events watt and marsalek 2013 however the lateral extension and vertical continuity of these permeable layers are not determined during well installation it is logical to anticipate that the position lateral extension thickness and spatial variability of a permeable layer lens adjacent to a drywell will play a critical role in determining the infiltration behavior indeed an understanding of the soil hydraulic properties has been reported to be a very important factor for the successful design installation execution and long term performance of a drywell edwards et al 2016 in our previous study numerical and field scale experiments were conducted to characterize the drywell infiltration behavior hydrus 2d 3d computer software was modified to simulate the transient boundary conditions of the maxwell type iv drywell geometry effective soil hydraulic properties of two drywell sites across california were estimated via inverse optimization of the field scale falling head data sasidharan et al 2018 however no studies have systematically investigated the role of subsurface heterogeneity on drywell performance previous studies have attempted to estimate the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity of an unsaturated soil using a constant head borehole test for example analytical solutions have been developed to determine the hydraulic properties of a homogenous soil domain using constant head data and numerical simulations have been conducted to evaluate the accuracy of these analytical solutions reynolds and elrick 1985 xiang et al 1997 however estimates of the hydraulic conductivity were often unrealistic due to the assumption of soil homogeneity in these analytical solutions reynolds and elrick 1985 and inherent soil heterogeneity later xiang et al 1997 proposed an analytical approach to analyze the flow contribution of each layer to the total flow and numerically evaluated the approach and its assumptions however this test neglected unsaturated flow and was only suitable for determining the hydraulic conductivity of layered media in thick unsaturated zones drywells are used not only to recharge deep groundwater aquifers but also as a flood control system in paved urban settings where a shallow aquifer may be present alternatively numerical solutions that account for both unsaturated and saturated flow can be used to inversely estimate the unsaturated soil hydraulic parameters of thin as well as thick soil layers lenses fractures that are needed to accurately evaluate the performance of a drywell the above approaches considered idealized homogeneous or layered soil systems however most field soils are highly heterogeneous and the hydraulic conductivity may change over a short distance the heterogeneity of a field site can be estimated using ground topography soil logs and other geophysical techniques however these methods are very expensive and time consuming and it is unlikely that such detailed information can be obtained for all drywell sites alternatively numerical solutions and stochastic approaches such as the scaling methodology can be used to study drywell infiltration the scaling approach was first introduced by miller and miller 1956 who derived scaling relationships between the pressure head and the hydraulic conductivity using the microscopic laws for capillary pressure forces and viscous flow based on the similarity of the pore space vereecken et al 2007 the miller and miller 1956 similitude approach has been widely used in the past to analyze flow and transport processes in heterogeneous unsaturated soil systems hammel and roth 1998 roth 1995 roth and hammel 1996 tseng and jury 1994 in the last few decades several other approaches such as stochastic perturbation methods the scaleway approach the stream tube approach the aggregation concept inverse modeling approaches and data fusion approaches were developed for upscaling of soil water processes vereecken et al 2007 to the best of our knowledge no published studies have investigated the influence of stochastic vadose zone heterogeneity on the drywell infiltration behavior and the determination of effective unsaturated soil hydraulic properties the objective of this study was to investigate the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on drywell infiltration the hydrus 2d 3d software was used to directly simulate cumulative infiltration volumes for selected drywell geometries and soil heterogeneities under constant or falling head conditions subsurface heterogeneity was described in this model deterministically by defining soil layers or lenses or by generating stochastic realizations of soil hydraulic properties with selected variance and correlation lengths the numerically generated data were then used in inverse optimizations to determine the hydraulic properties and the lateral extension of individual layers or lenses or to determine soil hydraulic properties of an equivalent homogeneous profile the influence of stochastic subsurface heterogeneity parameters e g the variance horizontal and vertical correlation length on cumulative drywell infiltration and equivalent homogeneous profile values of the saturated isotropic hydraulic conductivity k s and the soil water retention function van genuchten 1980 shape factor α were determined 2 materials and method 2 1 mathematical model the hydrus 2d 3d software package šimůnek et al 2018 šimůnek et al 2016 was used to simulate drywell infiltration and redistribution in the vadose zone by numerically solving the 2 dimensional axisymmetric form of richards equation the unsaturated soil hydraulic functions were those of van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 unless otherwise noted default values of soil hydraulic parameters e g the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k s the shape parameter in the soil water retention function α the residual soil water content θ r the saturated soil water content θ s the pore size distribution parameter in the soil water retention function n and the tortuosity parameter in the hydraulic conductivity function l were taken from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog šimůnek et al 2011 table 1 the van genuchten hydraulic parameters in the soil catalog of the hydrus 2d 3d software for selected soil textures were taken from carsel and parrish 1988 fig 1 shows a schematic of an example simulation flow domain initial conditions and boundary conditions this hypothetical 2 dimensional axisymmetrical domain was adapted from the engineering design and the soil log information collected from the fort irwin drywell site presented in our previous study sasidharan et al 2018 the initial condition was specified in terms of the soil water pressure head h x z and was set to a constant pressure head of 0 5 m for the entire flow domain the nodes at the bottom boundary were assigned a free drainage boundary condition a no flux boundary condition was assigned to the upper right and lower left sides of the flow domain fig 1 the complex geometry and the dynamics of water flow in and out of the drywell were implemented as a reservoir boundary condition which is described in detail by šimůnek et al 2018 and sasidharan et al 2018 the reservoir boundary condition was specified along the left and bottom boundary of the drywell fig 1 some simulations employed a constant head boundary condition for 200 min at the surface of the drywell or at textural interfaces others considered that the drywell was initially filled to its surface and then allowed for the water level to fall over time to a selected depth as a result of infiltration into the soil profile the size of the hypothetical simulation domain was adjusted depending on the considered soil heterogeneity simulations that examined the location lateral extension thickness of a sandy lens systems fig 2 employed a 3 m wide and 35 m deep domain the layered system simulations figs 6 8 employed a 5 m wide and 35 m deep domain and 5 m and 20 m wide domains for 1000 and 5000 min simulation fig 8d and e simulations that examined lateral extension of lenses fig 9 considered a 15 m wide and 50 m deep domain and stochastic simulations figs 3 5 10 13 considered a 12 m wide by 40 m deep domain the simulation domain was discretized into a two dimensional triangular finite element mesh using the meshgen tool available within hydrus 2d 3d šejna et al 2014 the mesh was refined at the left part of the domain where infiltration from the drywell was simulated to reduce the mass balance error the finite element mesh was adjusted such that the size of elements was smaller 0 05 m near the drywell and the grid size was gradually increased with the radial distance from the drywell with a maximum element size of 0 75 m in numerical experiments with multiple soil layers fig 8 the finite element mesh was further refined finite elements between 0 05 and 0 25 m near the drywell with a maximum element size of 0 75 m to obtain a smaller mass balance error 2 2 numerical experiments 2 2 1 deterministic heterogeneity highly permeable lens numerical experiments were initially conducted to understand the effects of the position z 8 10 5 20 5 and 29 m the lateral extension width w 0 09 0 39 0 89 and 1 9 m and thickness h of 0 91 m and the thickness h 0 91 1 91 3 91 5 91 m and w 0 09 m of a highly permeable lens i e a sandy lens surrounded by a sandy clay loam soil on drywell infiltration behavior for 1481 min a homogeneous sandy clay loam flow domain w 3 m h 35 m with an inclusion of a sandy lens was considered in these simulations the two dimensional 2d axisymmetrical flow domain drywell geometry initial values of the pressure head at the beginning of the simulation time variable boundary conditions and observed obs data fig 2 were adapted from the fort irwin drywell falling head experiment presented in sasidharan et al 2018 in brief a fire hydrant was used to flood the detention pond at the fort irwin drywell a pressure transducer connected to a datalogger was lowered into the drywell and the water depth in the drywell was measured every minute for 1481 min the in situ soil hydraulic properties k s and α were determined by the inverse parameter optimization of the observed falling head data for an equivalent sandy clay loam soil profile using hydrus 2d 3d software the fitted values of k s and α for sandy clay loam were 2 25 10 6 m min 1 and 2 63 m 1 respectively and were employed in this study to be consistent with the drywell at fort irwin ca sasidharan et al 2018 additional drywell infiltration experiments w 15 m h 50 m were conducted to see if the lateral extension w 0 2 5 5 7 5 or 10 m and h 0 5 m of the sandy lens in a sandy clay domain could be accurately identified in this case a constant head was maintained at the surface of the drywell and the cumulative infiltration volume i and infiltration flux i were collected for 5000 min 2 2 2 deterministic heterogeneity layered soil profile numerical experiments were then conducted to determine the effective hydraulic properties of a layered soil profile a simulation domain of w 5 m h 35 m was used and divided into two or more soil layers various layers of the flow domain were assigned different soil hydraulic properties as described in table 2 sequential numerical experiments were then conducted to determine infiltration in the layered systems and to inversely estimate the hydraulic properties from soil layers at the bottom to the top of the drywell using falling from the drywell inlet to the textural interface or constant head 200 min at the interface of a soil layer conditions the cumulative infiltration volumes i from the hydrus 2d 3d direct simulations were determined over time values of k s and α for the bottom soil type were then inversely estimated by fitting to this i data using the parameter estimation procedure in hydrus 2d 3d that is based on the levenberg marquardt nonlinear parameter optimization method marquardt 1963 table 2 provides a summary of numerical experiments carried out for various two and multi layered soil systems including the sequence of different soil layers and soil hydraulic parameters used in direct simulations direct simulations employed k s and α values for each soil type from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog k s hydrus and α hydrus respectively table 2 the flow domain was kept the same in both direct and indirect simulations while the hydraulic parameters for non fitted layers were kept constant in falling head experiments the final pressure head profile after one falling head experiment half full well fig 6 was imported as the initial condition for the next simulation full well fig 6 and the parameter estimation procedure was repeated for the next layer fig 6 on the other hand for the constant head simulations the initial condition was always kept as a constant pressure head of 0 5 m for the entire flow domain for both direct and inverse simulations figs 7 and 8 2 2 3 stochastic heterogeneity the hydrus 2d 3d computer software has an option to generate stochastic random distributions of hydraulic conductivity and pressure head scaling factors αk and αh respectively using the miller miller similitude approximation miller and miller 1956 using this option a specific k s value can be assigned to the flow domain or a part of it that is then multiplied in each node by a scaling factor αk the miller miller scaling procedure requires that αk αh 2 the stochastic distribution requires three input parameters the standard deviation σ of log10 αk and its correlation length in the lateral the x correlation length and vertical the z correlation length directions the value of σ determines the extent of variations in the scaling factors with higher values leading to higher variations in scaling factors on the other hand the correlation length is a measure of the distance in a specific direction that scaling factors are related a high value of the x correlation length means that the scaling factor maintains similar values for a greater horizontal distance the same applies for the z correlation length in the vertical direction rassam et al 2003 in this study the following combinations of the scaling factors with variable σ σ 0 0 25 0 5 1 x 1 m z 0 1 m a variable x correlation length σ 1 with x 0 1 1 10 and z 0 1 and σ 1 with x 1 10 and z 2 and a variable z correlation length σ 1 with x 1 and z 0 1 1 2 were used sandy loam was used in the flow domain w 12 m h 40 m forward simulations were conducted for 100 min by maintaining a constant head in the drywell the i output was collected from each simulation and a total of 100 simulations were done for each combination of stochastic parameters the mean cumulative infiltration volume μ i 95 confidence interval upper limit 95 ci ul and 95 confidence interval lower limit 95 ci ll were calculated accurate determination of soil hydraulic properties of a field site is the key to estimating infiltration from a drywell a numerical model that can determine the hydraulic properties based on the stratigraphic information of a site can help to identify the best location for the drywell installation therefore the possibility of developing a correlation between the type of the stochastic parameter combination used in the forward simulation the resultant cumulative infiltration volume and the effective hydraulic properties of the stochastic field was investigated inverse optimization of the i output data obtained from each direct simulation a total of 100 simulations per a stochastic parameter combination was conducted only the hydraulic parameters k s and α were optimized while the remaining hydraulic parameters θ r θ s n and l were kept constant at default values from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog table 1 for sandy loam ibm cloud computing virtual servers ibm usa with four computing instances with 48 2 00 ghz core and 192 gb ram were used to perform 800 inverse simulations python scripts were used for importing and exporting of input and output data and for further data analysis mean values of k s α 95 ci ul and 95 ci ll were calculated from a total of 80 inverse simulations 3 results and discussion 3 1 a direct forward numerical simulations 3 1 1 deterministic heterogeneity highly permeable lens the current drywell installation practice involves drilling at a potential drywell site until a permeable layer is detected the permeability of this layer is assumed to infiltrate water efficiently and guarantee the successful performance of the drywell over a specified time duration numerical experiments were conducted to investigate the validity of this assumption by simulating drywell infiltration behavior for different high permeability lens locations lateral extensions and thicknesses fig 2 presents a comparison of the observed data obtained from the fort irwin drywell field scale falling head experiment sasidharan et al 2018 and simulated falling heads for heterogeneous lenses domains fig 2a shows the influence of the vertical position of a 50 cm thick continuous sandy lens on the simulated matrix potential h profile in the soil adjacent to the drywell after 1481 min and changes in the drywell head h dw over time the drywell infiltrates water and h dw falls at a faster rate when the sandy lens occurs at a deeper vertical position because of a larger pressure head at the lens boundary fig 2b and c show the effect of a sandy lens s lateral extension and thickness respectively on changes in simulated soil matric potential and the drywell h dw over time increasing the lateral extension and thickness of the sandy lens also increases the water infiltration and the rate of decrease in h dw the numerical results demonstrated that a highly permeable lens layer at the bottom of a drywell can infiltrate water at a much faster rate than the same sized lens at the top of a drywell furthermore the cumulative infiltration volume from a drywell increases with an increasing lateral extension and a thickness of a highly permeable lens however a thin lateral lens at the bottom of a drywell infiltrated a larger amount of water than an isolated highly permeable lens a thick vertically extended lens due to its greater infiltration surface area these simulation results clearly indicate that the drywell infiltration performance is sensitive to the high permeability lens location lateral extension and thickness high permeability lens that occurs deeper in the soil profile and has greater lateral and vertical extensions are preferred for infiltration 3 1 2 stochastic heterogeneity the above simulations considered highly idealized scenarios whereas the natural subsurface is inherently highly heterogeneous stochastic simulations were therefore conducted to better understand the effect of random heterogeneities represented by stochastic fields of scaling factors on the cumulative infiltration volume from a drywell fig 3a shows a sandy loam soil profile with increasing heterogeneity from left to right i e σ 0 0 25 0 5 1 x 1 m z 0 1 m the scaling factor for k s sf k s shows 8 orders of magnitude variations 0 0001 10000 for σ 1 which indicates a highly heterogeneous soil profile fig 3b and c show the corresponding h and θ profiles respectively at 100 min of simulation for a constant head experiment a full reservoir similar information is presented for the homogeneous domain σ 0 as a comparison for results from the heterogeneous domains the homogeneous wetting front reached a distance of 2 8 m in both horizontal and vertical directions from the bottom of the drywell in contrast the wetting front in the heterogeneous profiles extended laterally 3 0 4 0 and 5 6 m and vertically 2 6 2 7 and 5 6 m when the value of σ increased to 0 25 0 50 and 1 respectively the same stochastic parameters will produce different realizations of heterogeneity and drywell infiltration behavior multiple stochastic realizations were therefore conducted to determine the mean cumulative infiltration volume μ i and the mean standard deviation of the cumulative infiltration volume σ i fig 4a and b show μ i and σ i respectively as a function of the total number of simulation realizations for all different combinations of stochastic parameters the values of μ i and σ i stabilize when the total number of simulations was 75 to be extra conservative 100 realizations of stochastic heterogeneity parameters were conducted to determine values of μ i and σ i in this study it should be mentioned that the values of μ i reflect the net effects of the position lateral extension and thickness of high permeability lenses the value of i μ i and its 95 confidence interval as a function of σ 0 25 0 5 and 1 when x 1 and z 0 1 m is shown in fig 5a for these stochastic parameters μ i increased with σ and exhibited narrow 95 confidence intervals an increase in σ increases the variability in the k s scaling factor and leads to the formation of more permeable layers regions in the soil profile and consequently enhanced infiltration from a drywell multiple realizations of drywell infiltration were also conducted for other stochastic parameter combinations fig 5 also presents the calculated values of μ i and its 95 confidence interval as a function of various x and z correlation lengths when σ 1 fig 5b indicates that values of μ i increased with x and showed narrow 95 confidence intervals when z 0 1 the value of μ i also increased with x when z 2 fig 5c but this increase was more rapid and the 95 confidence intervals broadened with x in comparison to fig 5b this increase in μ i with x is due to the formation of highly permeable lateral lenses and that enhances the rapid movement of the wetting front in the horizontal direction and facilities infiltration of water over a larger area the infiltration area is greater when z was smaller and this produced larger values of μ i fig 5b in comparison to fig 5c similarly fig 5d shows that μ i decreased and exhibited very narrow 95 confidence intervals when z increased this decrease in μ i with z is attributed to the formation of highly permeable isolated lenses and ponded regions with limited infiltration area the cumulative infiltration volume averaged from 100 stochastic realizations increased with increasing σ and a lateral correlation length but decreased with an increasing vertical correlation length collectively these results indicate that the lateral extent of highly permeable thin layers with a great vertical connectivity enhances rapid infiltration of water from a drywell to the surrounding soil 3 2 indirect inverse numerical simulations drywell infiltration experiments provide an opportunity to inversely determine equivalent homogeneous hydraulic properties for heterogeneous soil profiles sasidharan et al 2018 below we numerically investigate the ability to determine soil hydraulic properties of individual layers and lenses as well as the potential limitations of such an approach in more complex heterogeneous systems 3 2 1 deterministic heterogeneity layered soil profile table 2 provides a summary of numerical experiments carried out for various two and multi layered soil systems hydraulic parameters and the statistical parameters for the inverse simulations initial simulations considered the effect of a simple two layered system on drywell infiltration with a sandy clay layer on the top sct and a sandy loam layer on the bottom slb using falling head from the surface of the drywell to the textural interface or constant head water level at the textural interface conditions in the drywell similar simulations were also conducted with the soil layers reversed e g sandy loam layer on top slt and sandy clay layer on the bottom scb table 2 indicates that a very good agreement was obtained between the direct and inversely simulated i data with a coefficient of determination r 2 0 99 furthermore the fitted values of k s k s fit and k s hydrus were always consistent similarly the fitted values of α α fit and α hydrus showed good agreement for constant head experiments but α fit for sl was underpredicted during the sct slb experiment with the falling head drywell condition an explanation for this behavior can be obtained from the simulated profiles of h for these layered simulations figs 6 and 7 a distinct wetting front occurs in both sc and sl layers as well as between them during the constant head experiments due to the continuous flow of water fig 7 in contrast only a relatively small volume of water was available for infiltration during the falling head experiments and this produced a gradual change in the pressure heads of both soil layers especially when the highly permeable sl was below a less conductive sc layer fig 6 additional numerical experiments were conducted to see if hydraulic properties for a soil profile consisting of 7 soil layers could be inversely determined from constant head infiltration studies at the top of each layer from top to bottom the soil layers are sil s sc scl sl sil and sc fig 8a where s scl and sil denote sand sandy clay loam and silty loam respectively similar to the two layered experiments i data was well described by the model r 2 0 99 and values of k s fit and α fit were consistent with k s hydrus and α hydrus respectively a very distinct pattern in h and θ profiles was observed in fig 8b and c respectively which reflects the k s value of each layer table 2 for example a large lateral extension of the wetting front is apparent in the highly permeable s layer followed by sl scl sil and sc note however that the lateral extension of the wetting front in a specific layer is also affected by its location in the profile and neighboring two soil layers for example when the sand k s 4 95 10 3 m min 1 layer is on top of the sc layer k s 2 0 10 5 m min 1 water extents laterally in the sc layer despite of its low permeability the interface between the sc and s layers provides a large infiltration area for the sandy layer on the other hand when the scl k s 2 18 10 4 m min 1 layer is present on top of the sl k s 7 37 10 4 m min 1 layer which has a similar permeability the two layers facilitates the vertical movement of water over time fig 8d and e in contrast to fig 2 these results demonstrate that the presence of a high permeable layer in a more heterogeneous soil profile has a complex influence on the drywell infiltration capacity which depends on its location and the hydraulic properties of the neighboring layers several field scale approaches have been developed to determine soil hydraulic properties of boreholes the atmospheric pressure wave test measures the bulk air permeability of the vadose zone sediments as a function of time lag and subsurface pressure attenuation between the surface and subsurface weeks 1978 however this method only provides information about the vertical permeability rather than the horizontal permeability and is not suitable for soil with a high moisture content or near surface soil layers weeks 1978 similarly gamma and neutron logs of boreholes only provide information on the vertical distribution of soil stratigraphy and water filled porosity hodges et al 2012 xiang et al 1997 presented a multistep constant head permeameter test to determine k s value for a layered soil using the layerk model layerk is an analytic code that was designed to determine the field saturated hydraulic conductivity and the matric flux potential for individual layers using input parameters including layer thickness the water level in the borehole the radius of the borehole and flow rate however this approach is only suitable for estimating the k s value for thick unsaturated zones where the ratio of the water depth h and the borehole radius a was h a 20 jain et al 2006 xiang and chen 1993 xiang et al 1997 in contrast a drywell s h a value can range from approximately 10 to 60 also in the absence of an independent determination of α there are some doubts about the practicality of using borehole permeameter test to measure k s archer et al 2014 philip 1985 moreover drilling of an additional borehole to perform the above techniques might not be practical at every drywell site because they are expensive energy intensive time consuming require a dry drilling method a difficult technique and need vast expertise on the other hand the presented numerical modeling approach using hydrus 2d 3d software can be used to successfully design experimental methodologies to determine effective soil hydraulic properties of a field site regardless of the depth and radius of a drywell however we acknowledge that validation of the model using site specific infiltration experiment is essential but goes beyond the scope of this study 3 2 2 deterministic heterogeneity highly permeable lens the infiltration capacity of a drywell is not only determined by the presence of a highly permeable lens but also by its lateral extent fig 2 however the inverse optimization technique discussed above only considered layered soil profiles surrounding the drywell but not the lateral extension of a lens additional numerical experiments were therefore conducted to investigate the ability to identify the lateral extension of a sandy lens that embedded in a sandy clay domain these simulations considered a constant head boundary condition in the drywell reservoir and different horizontal extensions 0 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 m of a 0 5 m thick sandy lens fig 9a and b show the cumulative infiltration volumes i and infiltration rates i as a function of time in these simulations note that i increases with the length of the sandy lens in fig 9a the value of i also decreases precipitously when the sandy lens gets fully saturated fig 9b for example fig 9c at 800 min shows the θ distribution after 800 min when the lateral extension of the sandy layer is 10 m in this case the sandy lens has become completely saturated at 761 min while the corresponding infiltration rate blue line in fig 9b shows a sudden decrease however it should be mentioned that it was much more difficult to discern the influence of the horizontal length of lens on i and i when properties of sandy clay loam were assigned to the lens rather than sand when a constant head boundary was assigned at the top of the sandy lens rather than assuming a full reservoir and for greater subsurface heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties 3 2 3 stochastic heterogeneity although the above results demonstrate that the soil hydraulic properties of individual soil layers can be accurately determined during constant head infiltration experiments the noted limitations indicate that it is unlikely to accurately determine the lateral extension of these layers lenses under heterogeneous field conditions the heterogeneous stochastic simulations discussed in figs 3 and 5 were therefore analyzed in terms of equivalent homogeneous profile values of k s and α that were inversely fitted to i for each stochastic realization average values of k s and α and their 95 confidence intervals were determined from 100 realizations using a given set of stochastic parameters fig 10 presents average values of k s as a function of the stochastic parameters σ fig 10a with x 1 and z 0 1 x fig 10b with σ 1 and z 0 1 and fig 10c with σ 1 and z 2 and z fig 10d with σ 1 and x 1 and the k s value of sandy loam from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog the average values of k s were found to be highly sensitive to different stochastic parameters and exhibited very narrow 95 confidence intervals in particular average values of k s increase with σ and x but decrease with z similar to i in figs 3 and 5 this can be attributed to increasing amounts of high permeability lenses with greater lateral extensions with increasing σ and x and isolated high permeability zones with increasing z the average k s value for stochastic heterogeneous domains was always higher than the homogeneous domain fig 12a a highly heterogeneous σ 1 domain with many high and low permeable lateral lenses connected vertically via short highly permeable lenses i e x 10 z 0 1 x 10 z 2 x 0 1 z 0 1 and x 1 z 0 1 had the highest average k s value fig 12a fig 11 presents average values of α as a function of the stochastic parameters σ fig 11a with x 1 and z 0 1 x fig 11b with σ 1 and z 0 1 and fig 11c with σ 1 and z 2 and z fig 11d with σ 1 and x 1 and the α value of sandy loam from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog average values of α ranged between 2 44 and 8 46 m 1 and had a relatively large confidence interval fig 12b compared to the average values of k s with a very tight confidence interval fig 12a furthermore a sensitivity analysis of k s and α were conducted where one of the parameters i e either k s or α was kept as constant in each direct simulation and the cumulative infiltration volume was determined data is not shown average value of k s 3 94 10 3 8 19 10 4 and 2 44 10 4 m min 1 and α 8 46 7 5 and 2 44 m 1 were used fig 12 the results from the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the cumulative infiltration volume increases with increase in k s and α values at a given condition however the observations from sensitivity analysis figs 10 12 indicate that the average value of k s plays a primary role and the value of α played a secondary role in determining the cumulative infiltration volume and long term performance of a drywell a large k s value indicates the presence of a highly conductive soil that leads to the faster infiltration whereas a large α value indicates a uniform and sharp wetting front and a small α value indicates a nonuniform and dispersed wetting front carsel and parrish 1988 elrick et al 1989 rawls et al 1982 van genuchten et al 1991 additional numerical experiments are needed to understand this topic better which was not further investigated in this study fig 13 shows a comparison of i simulated for a homogeneous sandy loam soil profile with k s and α values obtained from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog k s 7 37 10 4 m min 1 and α 7 5 m 1 table 1 inversely optimized average value of k s 3 94 10 3 m min 1 and α 6 17 m 1 upper confidence interval values of k s 3 68 10 3 m min 1 and α 5 40 m 1 and lower confidence interval values of k s 4 20 10 3 m min 1 and α 6 94 m 1 for the heterogeneous domain with the following stochastic parameters σ 1 x 10 and z 0 1 average values of k s and i increased by 435 and 396 for the stochastic domain note that all these simulations were conducted for a homogeneous flow domain with a sandy loam soil for 5760 min 96 h by keeping a constant head at the surface of the drywell replacing the heterogeneous domain with an equivalent homogeneous domain as presented in this study can accurately predict long term cumulative infiltration 96 h which is relevant for the low impact development standard for drywells lacdpw 2014 therefore a detailed characterization of heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties which is very time consuming and expensive may not be required when water quantity is the only criterion for evaluating drywell performance this research demonstrates that falling or constant head drywell infiltration experiments can be used in conjunction with hydrus 2d 3d numerical modeling to inversely estimate effective hydraulic properties for a heterogeneous drywell site that can be used to accurately assess its infiltration performance a constant head experiment can accurately provide the average hydraulic properties of a drywell site however a constant head experiment may not account for hydraulic properties position lateral extension and thickness of high permeable lenses of sites presented in fig 2 that are highly relevant factors affecting the cumulative infiltration volume in a falling head experiment the hydraulic properties determined using a falling head experiment may thus underestimate or overestimate the cumulative infiltration volume compared to the hydraulic properties obtained from a constant head experiment therefore this research demonstrates that a constant head drywell infiltration experiment coupled with hydrus 2d 3d inverse optimization of hydraulic parameters of each layer of a multi layered soil system table 2 and fig 8 is the best method to accurately estimate the hydraulic property of a drywell site and to assess the long term performance of a drywell 4 conclusions the numerical modeling results presented in this study demonstrate the application of hydrus 2d 3d in predicting the cumulative infiltration volume and in determining soil hydraulic properties adjacent to a drywell in particular numerical experiments were conducted to better understand the influence of deterministic and stochastic heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties on drywell infiltration behavior results demonstrated that a highly permeable lens layer at the bottom of a drywell can infiltrate water at a much faster rate than the same sized lens at the top of a drywell furthermore the cumulative infiltration volume from a drywell increases with an increasing lateral extension and thickness of a high permeable lens similarly the average cumulative infiltration volume from 100 stochastic realizations increased with increasing σ and lateral correlation length but decreased with an increasing vertical correlation length the result from direct and indirect numerical experiments provided insight in developing field scale falling head and constant head experimental methods for drywell to determine the in situ soil hydraulic properties of multiple soil layers and high permeable lenses to characterize drywell infiltration numerical experiments demonstrated that constant head experiments provide higher accuracy in inversely optimized hydraulic parameters than falling head experiments however inverse determination of soil hydraulic properties for individual soil lenses of varying lateral extensions may be impractical for highly heterogeneous systems the hydraulic properties for stochastic experiments with heterogeneous soil distributions were therefore characterized in terms of an equivalent homogeneous soil profile the average value of k s from multiple stochastic realizations with the same parameter sets had the greatest influence and played a primary role on drywell cumulative infiltration the α value showed a larger confidence interval and thus played a secondary role in the overall drywell performance similar to cumulative infiltration the average value of k s increased with σ and the lateral correlation length but decreased with an increasing vertical correlation length the equivalent homogeneous hydraulic properties obtained from a heterogeneous domain can be used to estimate the infiltration from a drywell however the hydraulic properties obtained from a falling head experiment may over or underestimate the cumulative infiltration volume compared to the hydraulic properties obtained from a constant head experiment therefore a constant head experiment for multi layered soil system would be the best method to accurately determine the drywell site hydraulic property and its long term performance this research demonstrates that extensive soil characterization may not be necessary if water quantity is the only concern however if the drywell performance also needs to account for water quality including the fate and transport of pathogenic microbial contaminants such as virus and or bacteria an accurate estimation of site heterogeneity is expected to be very important ongoing

6729,drywells are increasingly used to capture stormwater runoff for surface infiltration and aquifer recharge but little research has examined the role of ubiquitous subsurface heterogeneity in hydraulic properties on drywell performance numerical experiments were therefore conducted using the hydrus 2d 3d software to systematically study the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on drywell infiltration subsurface heterogeneity was described deterministically by defining soil layers or lenses or by generating stochastic realizations of soil hydraulic properties with selected variance σ and horizontal x and vertical z correlation lengths the infiltration rate increased when a high permeability layer lens was located at the bottom of the drywell and had larger vertical and especially horizontal dimensions furthermore the average cumulative infiltration i for 100 stochastic realizations of a given subsurface heterogeneity increased with σ and x but decreased with z this indicates that the presence of many highly permeable laterally extending lenses provides a larger surface area for enhanced infiltration than the presence of isolated highly permeable lenses the ability to inversely determine soil hydraulic properties from numerical drywell infiltration results was also investigated the hydraulic properties and the lateral extension of a highly permeable lens could be accurately determined for certain idealized situations e g simple layered profiles using constant head tests however variability in soil hydraulic properties could not be accurately determined for systems that exhibited more realistic stochastic heterogeneity in this case the heterogeneous profile could be replaced with an equivalent homogeneous profile and values of an effective isotropic saturated conductivity k s and the shape parameter in the soil water retention function α could be inversely determined the average value of k s for 100 stochastic realizations showed a similar dependency to i on σ x and z whereas the average value of α had large confidence interval for soil heterogeneity parameters and played a secondary role in drywell infiltration this research provides valuable insight on the selection of site design installation and long term performance of a drywell keywords drywell infiltration stochastic simulation inverse optimization effective hydraulic properties hydrus 2d 3d 1 introduction freshwater resources determine the balance between food security public health industrial growth economic development environmental sustainability and the survival of ecosystems across the world rosegrant et al 2002 however water scarcity occurs in many parts of the world about 1 1 billion people worldwide lack access to safe water and at least two thirds of the global population over 4 0 billion people live under conditions of severe water scarcity at least 1 month each year kummu et al 2016 groundwater decline low or nonexistent river flow and water pollution are some of the major signs of water scarcity postel 2000 although the global hydrologic cycle produces more freshwater than is needed to sustain the current global population 69 of this resource is not available to humans due to rapid runoff or distribution in geographically isolated regions postel 2000 growing food to meet the needs of the global population requires extraction of a large volume of water and irrigated agriculture accounts for two thirds of all water withdrawals from natural water resources shiklomanov 2000 the unsustainable pumping of groundwater exceeds the renewable water limits in many regions postel 2000 postel et al 1996 therefore there is an urgency to find alternative sources of freshwater to invest in water infrastructure to develop innovative technologies to recycle reuse and preserve stormwater and to improve water management several countries around the world are practicing artificial or managed aquifer recharge using engineered systems to collect surface water and enhance its infiltration and subsequent movement to aquifers to augment groundwater resources infiltration and managed aquifer recharge can be achieved using surface infiltration e g infiltration basins direct injection e g aquifer storage transfer and recovery and vadose zone infiltration e g drywells bouwer 2002 bouwer et al 1999 dillon 2005 edwards et al 2016 sasidharan et al 2018 techniques in recent years drywells have gained a lot of attention in the united states and across the world drywells are vadose zone infiltration wells that end at least 1 3 m above the water table lacdpw 2014 there are several potential advantages associated with vadose zone infiltration over surface infiltration and direct injection wells this includes a minimal evaporative loss of water a small installation area a large ponding depth and removal of contaminants in the vadose zone edwards et al 2016 sasidharan et al 2018 there are currently 75 000 drywells in the states of washington oregon california and arizona of the united states edwards et al 2016 and their number is increasing annually however not many studies have evaluated the long term performance of drywells and their environmental impact the purpose of a drywell is to transfer water from a poorly drained or low permeable surface capture area to an aquifer for subsurface water storage the current installation practice involves drilling a drywell at a site and inspecting soil borings or profiles for the presence of layers with adequate permeability to ensure drainage for design storm events watt and marsalek 2013 however the lateral extension and vertical continuity of these permeable layers are not determined during well installation it is logical to anticipate that the position lateral extension thickness and spatial variability of a permeable layer lens adjacent to a drywell will play a critical role in determining the infiltration behavior indeed an understanding of the soil hydraulic properties has been reported to be a very important factor for the successful design installation execution and long term performance of a drywell edwards et al 2016 in our previous study numerical and field scale experiments were conducted to characterize the drywell infiltration behavior hydrus 2d 3d computer software was modified to simulate the transient boundary conditions of the maxwell type iv drywell geometry effective soil hydraulic properties of two drywell sites across california were estimated via inverse optimization of the field scale falling head data sasidharan et al 2018 however no studies have systematically investigated the role of subsurface heterogeneity on drywell performance previous studies have attempted to estimate the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity of an unsaturated soil using a constant head borehole test for example analytical solutions have been developed to determine the hydraulic properties of a homogenous soil domain using constant head data and numerical simulations have been conducted to evaluate the accuracy of these analytical solutions reynolds and elrick 1985 xiang et al 1997 however estimates of the hydraulic conductivity were often unrealistic due to the assumption of soil homogeneity in these analytical solutions reynolds and elrick 1985 and inherent soil heterogeneity later xiang et al 1997 proposed an analytical approach to analyze the flow contribution of each layer to the total flow and numerically evaluated the approach and its assumptions however this test neglected unsaturated flow and was only suitable for determining the hydraulic conductivity of layered media in thick unsaturated zones drywells are used not only to recharge deep groundwater aquifers but also as a flood control system in paved urban settings where a shallow aquifer may be present alternatively numerical solutions that account for both unsaturated and saturated flow can be used to inversely estimate the unsaturated soil hydraulic parameters of thin as well as thick soil layers lenses fractures that are needed to accurately evaluate the performance of a drywell the above approaches considered idealized homogeneous or layered soil systems however most field soils are highly heterogeneous and the hydraulic conductivity may change over a short distance the heterogeneity of a field site can be estimated using ground topography soil logs and other geophysical techniques however these methods are very expensive and time consuming and it is unlikely that such detailed information can be obtained for all drywell sites alternatively numerical solutions and stochastic approaches such as the scaling methodology can be used to study drywell infiltration the scaling approach was first introduced by miller and miller 1956 who derived scaling relationships between the pressure head and the hydraulic conductivity using the microscopic laws for capillary pressure forces and viscous flow based on the similarity of the pore space vereecken et al 2007 the miller and miller 1956 similitude approach has been widely used in the past to analyze flow and transport processes in heterogeneous unsaturated soil systems hammel and roth 1998 roth 1995 roth and hammel 1996 tseng and jury 1994 in the last few decades several other approaches such as stochastic perturbation methods the scaleway approach the stream tube approach the aggregation concept inverse modeling approaches and data fusion approaches were developed for upscaling of soil water processes vereecken et al 2007 to the best of our knowledge no published studies have investigated the influence of stochastic vadose zone heterogeneity on the drywell infiltration behavior and the determination of effective unsaturated soil hydraulic properties the objective of this study was to investigate the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on drywell infiltration the hydrus 2d 3d software was used to directly simulate cumulative infiltration volumes for selected drywell geometries and soil heterogeneities under constant or falling head conditions subsurface heterogeneity was described in this model deterministically by defining soil layers or lenses or by generating stochastic realizations of soil hydraulic properties with selected variance and correlation lengths the numerically generated data were then used in inverse optimizations to determine the hydraulic properties and the lateral extension of individual layers or lenses or to determine soil hydraulic properties of an equivalent homogeneous profile the influence of stochastic subsurface heterogeneity parameters e g the variance horizontal and vertical correlation length on cumulative drywell infiltration and equivalent homogeneous profile values of the saturated isotropic hydraulic conductivity k s and the soil water retention function van genuchten 1980 shape factor α were determined 2 materials and method 2 1 mathematical model the hydrus 2d 3d software package šimůnek et al 2018 šimůnek et al 2016 was used to simulate drywell infiltration and redistribution in the vadose zone by numerically solving the 2 dimensional axisymmetric form of richards equation the unsaturated soil hydraulic functions were those of van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 unless otherwise noted default values of soil hydraulic parameters e g the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k s the shape parameter in the soil water retention function α the residual soil water content θ r the saturated soil water content θ s the pore size distribution parameter in the soil water retention function n and the tortuosity parameter in the hydraulic conductivity function l were taken from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog šimůnek et al 2011 table 1 the van genuchten hydraulic parameters in the soil catalog of the hydrus 2d 3d software for selected soil textures were taken from carsel and parrish 1988 fig 1 shows a schematic of an example simulation flow domain initial conditions and boundary conditions this hypothetical 2 dimensional axisymmetrical domain was adapted from the engineering design and the soil log information collected from the fort irwin drywell site presented in our previous study sasidharan et al 2018 the initial condition was specified in terms of the soil water pressure head h x z and was set to a constant pressure head of 0 5 m for the entire flow domain the nodes at the bottom boundary were assigned a free drainage boundary condition a no flux boundary condition was assigned to the upper right and lower left sides of the flow domain fig 1 the complex geometry and the dynamics of water flow in and out of the drywell were implemented as a reservoir boundary condition which is described in detail by šimůnek et al 2018 and sasidharan et al 2018 the reservoir boundary condition was specified along the left and bottom boundary of the drywell fig 1 some simulations employed a constant head boundary condition for 200 min at the surface of the drywell or at textural interfaces others considered that the drywell was initially filled to its surface and then allowed for the water level to fall over time to a selected depth as a result of infiltration into the soil profile the size of the hypothetical simulation domain was adjusted depending on the considered soil heterogeneity simulations that examined the location lateral extension thickness of a sandy lens systems fig 2 employed a 3 m wide and 35 m deep domain the layered system simulations figs 6 8 employed a 5 m wide and 35 m deep domain and 5 m and 20 m wide domains for 1000 and 5000 min simulation fig 8d and e simulations that examined lateral extension of lenses fig 9 considered a 15 m wide and 50 m deep domain and stochastic simulations figs 3 5 10 13 considered a 12 m wide by 40 m deep domain the simulation domain was discretized into a two dimensional triangular finite element mesh using the meshgen tool available within hydrus 2d 3d šejna et al 2014 the mesh was refined at the left part of the domain where infiltration from the drywell was simulated to reduce the mass balance error the finite element mesh was adjusted such that the size of elements was smaller 0 05 m near the drywell and the grid size was gradually increased with the radial distance from the drywell with a maximum element size of 0 75 m in numerical experiments with multiple soil layers fig 8 the finite element mesh was further refined finite elements between 0 05 and 0 25 m near the drywell with a maximum element size of 0 75 m to obtain a smaller mass balance error 2 2 numerical experiments 2 2 1 deterministic heterogeneity highly permeable lens numerical experiments were initially conducted to understand the effects of the position z 8 10 5 20 5 and 29 m the lateral extension width w 0 09 0 39 0 89 and 1 9 m and thickness h of 0 91 m and the thickness h 0 91 1 91 3 91 5 91 m and w 0 09 m of a highly permeable lens i e a sandy lens surrounded by a sandy clay loam soil on drywell infiltration behavior for 1481 min a homogeneous sandy clay loam flow domain w 3 m h 35 m with an inclusion of a sandy lens was considered in these simulations the two dimensional 2d axisymmetrical flow domain drywell geometry initial values of the pressure head at the beginning of the simulation time variable boundary conditions and observed obs data fig 2 were adapted from the fort irwin drywell falling head experiment presented in sasidharan et al 2018 in brief a fire hydrant was used to flood the detention pond at the fort irwin drywell a pressure transducer connected to a datalogger was lowered into the drywell and the water depth in the drywell was measured every minute for 1481 min the in situ soil hydraulic properties k s and α were determined by the inverse parameter optimization of the observed falling head data for an equivalent sandy clay loam soil profile using hydrus 2d 3d software the fitted values of k s and α for sandy clay loam were 2 25 10 6 m min 1 and 2 63 m 1 respectively and were employed in this study to be consistent with the drywell at fort irwin ca sasidharan et al 2018 additional drywell infiltration experiments w 15 m h 50 m were conducted to see if the lateral extension w 0 2 5 5 7 5 or 10 m and h 0 5 m of the sandy lens in a sandy clay domain could be accurately identified in this case a constant head was maintained at the surface of the drywell and the cumulative infiltration volume i and infiltration flux i were collected for 5000 min 2 2 2 deterministic heterogeneity layered soil profile numerical experiments were then conducted to determine the effective hydraulic properties of a layered soil profile a simulation domain of w 5 m h 35 m was used and divided into two or more soil layers various layers of the flow domain were assigned different soil hydraulic properties as described in table 2 sequential numerical experiments were then conducted to determine infiltration in the layered systems and to inversely estimate the hydraulic properties from soil layers at the bottom to the top of the drywell using falling from the drywell inlet to the textural interface or constant head 200 min at the interface of a soil layer conditions the cumulative infiltration volumes i from the hydrus 2d 3d direct simulations were determined over time values of k s and α for the bottom soil type were then inversely estimated by fitting to this i data using the parameter estimation procedure in hydrus 2d 3d that is based on the levenberg marquardt nonlinear parameter optimization method marquardt 1963 table 2 provides a summary of numerical experiments carried out for various two and multi layered soil systems including the sequence of different soil layers and soil hydraulic parameters used in direct simulations direct simulations employed k s and α values for each soil type from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog k s hydrus and α hydrus respectively table 2 the flow domain was kept the same in both direct and indirect simulations while the hydraulic parameters for non fitted layers were kept constant in falling head experiments the final pressure head profile after one falling head experiment half full well fig 6 was imported as the initial condition for the next simulation full well fig 6 and the parameter estimation procedure was repeated for the next layer fig 6 on the other hand for the constant head simulations the initial condition was always kept as a constant pressure head of 0 5 m for the entire flow domain for both direct and inverse simulations figs 7 and 8 2 2 3 stochastic heterogeneity the hydrus 2d 3d computer software has an option to generate stochastic random distributions of hydraulic conductivity and pressure head scaling factors αk and αh respectively using the miller miller similitude approximation miller and miller 1956 using this option a specific k s value can be assigned to the flow domain or a part of it that is then multiplied in each node by a scaling factor αk the miller miller scaling procedure requires that αk αh 2 the stochastic distribution requires three input parameters the standard deviation σ of log10 αk and its correlation length in the lateral the x correlation length and vertical the z correlation length directions the value of σ determines the extent of variations in the scaling factors with higher values leading to higher variations in scaling factors on the other hand the correlation length is a measure of the distance in a specific direction that scaling factors are related a high value of the x correlation length means that the scaling factor maintains similar values for a greater horizontal distance the same applies for the z correlation length in the vertical direction rassam et al 2003 in this study the following combinations of the scaling factors with variable σ σ 0 0 25 0 5 1 x 1 m z 0 1 m a variable x correlation length σ 1 with x 0 1 1 10 and z 0 1 and σ 1 with x 1 10 and z 2 and a variable z correlation length σ 1 with x 1 and z 0 1 1 2 were used sandy loam was used in the flow domain w 12 m h 40 m forward simulations were conducted for 100 min by maintaining a constant head in the drywell the i output was collected from each simulation and a total of 100 simulations were done for each combination of stochastic parameters the mean cumulative infiltration volume μ i 95 confidence interval upper limit 95 ci ul and 95 confidence interval lower limit 95 ci ll were calculated accurate determination of soil hydraulic properties of a field site is the key to estimating infiltration from a drywell a numerical model that can determine the hydraulic properties based on the stratigraphic information of a site can help to identify the best location for the drywell installation therefore the possibility of developing a correlation between the type of the stochastic parameter combination used in the forward simulation the resultant cumulative infiltration volume and the effective hydraulic properties of the stochastic field was investigated inverse optimization of the i output data obtained from each direct simulation a total of 100 simulations per a stochastic parameter combination was conducted only the hydraulic parameters k s and α were optimized while the remaining hydraulic parameters θ r θ s n and l were kept constant at default values from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog table 1 for sandy loam ibm cloud computing virtual servers ibm usa with four computing instances with 48 2 00 ghz core and 192 gb ram were used to perform 800 inverse simulations python scripts were used for importing and exporting of input and output data and for further data analysis mean values of k s α 95 ci ul and 95 ci ll were calculated from a total of 80 inverse simulations 3 results and discussion 3 1 a direct forward numerical simulations 3 1 1 deterministic heterogeneity highly permeable lens the current drywell installation practice involves drilling at a potential drywell site until a permeable layer is detected the permeability of this layer is assumed to infiltrate water efficiently and guarantee the successful performance of the drywell over a specified time duration numerical experiments were conducted to investigate the validity of this assumption by simulating drywell infiltration behavior for different high permeability lens locations lateral extensions and thicknesses fig 2 presents a comparison of the observed data obtained from the fort irwin drywell field scale falling head experiment sasidharan et al 2018 and simulated falling heads for heterogeneous lenses domains fig 2a shows the influence of the vertical position of a 50 cm thick continuous sandy lens on the simulated matrix potential h profile in the soil adjacent to the drywell after 1481 min and changes in the drywell head h dw over time the drywell infiltrates water and h dw falls at a faster rate when the sandy lens occurs at a deeper vertical position because of a larger pressure head at the lens boundary fig 2b and c show the effect of a sandy lens s lateral extension and thickness respectively on changes in simulated soil matric potential and the drywell h dw over time increasing the lateral extension and thickness of the sandy lens also increases the water infiltration and the rate of decrease in h dw the numerical results demonstrated that a highly permeable lens layer at the bottom of a drywell can infiltrate water at a much faster rate than the same sized lens at the top of a drywell furthermore the cumulative infiltration volume from a drywell increases with an increasing lateral extension and a thickness of a highly permeable lens however a thin lateral lens at the bottom of a drywell infiltrated a larger amount of water than an isolated highly permeable lens a thick vertically extended lens due to its greater infiltration surface area these simulation results clearly indicate that the drywell infiltration performance is sensitive to the high permeability lens location lateral extension and thickness high permeability lens that occurs deeper in the soil profile and has greater lateral and vertical extensions are preferred for infiltration 3 1 2 stochastic heterogeneity the above simulations considered highly idealized scenarios whereas the natural subsurface is inherently highly heterogeneous stochastic simulations were therefore conducted to better understand the effect of random heterogeneities represented by stochastic fields of scaling factors on the cumulative infiltration volume from a drywell fig 3a shows a sandy loam soil profile with increasing heterogeneity from left to right i e σ 0 0 25 0 5 1 x 1 m z 0 1 m the scaling factor for k s sf k s shows 8 orders of magnitude variations 0 0001 10000 for σ 1 which indicates a highly heterogeneous soil profile fig 3b and c show the corresponding h and θ profiles respectively at 100 min of simulation for a constant head experiment a full reservoir similar information is presented for the homogeneous domain σ 0 as a comparison for results from the heterogeneous domains the homogeneous wetting front reached a distance of 2 8 m in both horizontal and vertical directions from the bottom of the drywell in contrast the wetting front in the heterogeneous profiles extended laterally 3 0 4 0 and 5 6 m and vertically 2 6 2 7 and 5 6 m when the value of σ increased to 0 25 0 50 and 1 respectively the same stochastic parameters will produce different realizations of heterogeneity and drywell infiltration behavior multiple stochastic realizations were therefore conducted to determine the mean cumulative infiltration volume μ i and the mean standard deviation of the cumulative infiltration volume σ i fig 4a and b show μ i and σ i respectively as a function of the total number of simulation realizations for all different combinations of stochastic parameters the values of μ i and σ i stabilize when the total number of simulations was 75 to be extra conservative 100 realizations of stochastic heterogeneity parameters were conducted to determine values of μ i and σ i in this study it should be mentioned that the values of μ i reflect the net effects of the position lateral extension and thickness of high permeability lenses the value of i μ i and its 95 confidence interval as a function of σ 0 25 0 5 and 1 when x 1 and z 0 1 m is shown in fig 5a for these stochastic parameters μ i increased with σ and exhibited narrow 95 confidence intervals an increase in σ increases the variability in the k s scaling factor and leads to the formation of more permeable layers regions in the soil profile and consequently enhanced infiltration from a drywell multiple realizations of drywell infiltration were also conducted for other stochastic parameter combinations fig 5 also presents the calculated values of μ i and its 95 confidence interval as a function of various x and z correlation lengths when σ 1 fig 5b indicates that values of μ i increased with x and showed narrow 95 confidence intervals when z 0 1 the value of μ i also increased with x when z 2 fig 5c but this increase was more rapid and the 95 confidence intervals broadened with x in comparison to fig 5b this increase in μ i with x is due to the formation of highly permeable lateral lenses and that enhances the rapid movement of the wetting front in the horizontal direction and facilities infiltration of water over a larger area the infiltration area is greater when z was smaller and this produced larger values of μ i fig 5b in comparison to fig 5c similarly fig 5d shows that μ i decreased and exhibited very narrow 95 confidence intervals when z increased this decrease in μ i with z is attributed to the formation of highly permeable isolated lenses and ponded regions with limited infiltration area the cumulative infiltration volume averaged from 100 stochastic realizations increased with increasing σ and a lateral correlation length but decreased with an increasing vertical correlation length collectively these results indicate that the lateral extent of highly permeable thin layers with a great vertical connectivity enhances rapid infiltration of water from a drywell to the surrounding soil 3 2 indirect inverse numerical simulations drywell infiltration experiments provide an opportunity to inversely determine equivalent homogeneous hydraulic properties for heterogeneous soil profiles sasidharan et al 2018 below we numerically investigate the ability to determine soil hydraulic properties of individual layers and lenses as well as the potential limitations of such an approach in more complex heterogeneous systems 3 2 1 deterministic heterogeneity layered soil profile table 2 provides a summary of numerical experiments carried out for various two and multi layered soil systems hydraulic parameters and the statistical parameters for the inverse simulations initial simulations considered the effect of a simple two layered system on drywell infiltration with a sandy clay layer on the top sct and a sandy loam layer on the bottom slb using falling head from the surface of the drywell to the textural interface or constant head water level at the textural interface conditions in the drywell similar simulations were also conducted with the soil layers reversed e g sandy loam layer on top slt and sandy clay layer on the bottom scb table 2 indicates that a very good agreement was obtained between the direct and inversely simulated i data with a coefficient of determination r 2 0 99 furthermore the fitted values of k s k s fit and k s hydrus were always consistent similarly the fitted values of α α fit and α hydrus showed good agreement for constant head experiments but α fit for sl was underpredicted during the sct slb experiment with the falling head drywell condition an explanation for this behavior can be obtained from the simulated profiles of h for these layered simulations figs 6 and 7 a distinct wetting front occurs in both sc and sl layers as well as between them during the constant head experiments due to the continuous flow of water fig 7 in contrast only a relatively small volume of water was available for infiltration during the falling head experiments and this produced a gradual change in the pressure heads of both soil layers especially when the highly permeable sl was below a less conductive sc layer fig 6 additional numerical experiments were conducted to see if hydraulic properties for a soil profile consisting of 7 soil layers could be inversely determined from constant head infiltration studies at the top of each layer from top to bottom the soil layers are sil s sc scl sl sil and sc fig 8a where s scl and sil denote sand sandy clay loam and silty loam respectively similar to the two layered experiments i data was well described by the model r 2 0 99 and values of k s fit and α fit were consistent with k s hydrus and α hydrus respectively a very distinct pattern in h and θ profiles was observed in fig 8b and c respectively which reflects the k s value of each layer table 2 for example a large lateral extension of the wetting front is apparent in the highly permeable s layer followed by sl scl sil and sc note however that the lateral extension of the wetting front in a specific layer is also affected by its location in the profile and neighboring two soil layers for example when the sand k s 4 95 10 3 m min 1 layer is on top of the sc layer k s 2 0 10 5 m min 1 water extents laterally in the sc layer despite of its low permeability the interface between the sc and s layers provides a large infiltration area for the sandy layer on the other hand when the scl k s 2 18 10 4 m min 1 layer is present on top of the sl k s 7 37 10 4 m min 1 layer which has a similar permeability the two layers facilitates the vertical movement of water over time fig 8d and e in contrast to fig 2 these results demonstrate that the presence of a high permeable layer in a more heterogeneous soil profile has a complex influence on the drywell infiltration capacity which depends on its location and the hydraulic properties of the neighboring layers several field scale approaches have been developed to determine soil hydraulic properties of boreholes the atmospheric pressure wave test measures the bulk air permeability of the vadose zone sediments as a function of time lag and subsurface pressure attenuation between the surface and subsurface weeks 1978 however this method only provides information about the vertical permeability rather than the horizontal permeability and is not suitable for soil with a high moisture content or near surface soil layers weeks 1978 similarly gamma and neutron logs of boreholes only provide information on the vertical distribution of soil stratigraphy and water filled porosity hodges et al 2012 xiang et al 1997 presented a multistep constant head permeameter test to determine k s value for a layered soil using the layerk model layerk is an analytic code that was designed to determine the field saturated hydraulic conductivity and the matric flux potential for individual layers using input parameters including layer thickness the water level in the borehole the radius of the borehole and flow rate however this approach is only suitable for estimating the k s value for thick unsaturated zones where the ratio of the water depth h and the borehole radius a was h a 20 jain et al 2006 xiang and chen 1993 xiang et al 1997 in contrast a drywell s h a value can range from approximately 10 to 60 also in the absence of an independent determination of α there are some doubts about the practicality of using borehole permeameter test to measure k s archer et al 2014 philip 1985 moreover drilling of an additional borehole to perform the above techniques might not be practical at every drywell site because they are expensive energy intensive time consuming require a dry drilling method a difficult technique and need vast expertise on the other hand the presented numerical modeling approach using hydrus 2d 3d software can be used to successfully design experimental methodologies to determine effective soil hydraulic properties of a field site regardless of the depth and radius of a drywell however we acknowledge that validation of the model using site specific infiltration experiment is essential but goes beyond the scope of this study 3 2 2 deterministic heterogeneity highly permeable lens the infiltration capacity of a drywell is not only determined by the presence of a highly permeable lens but also by its lateral extent fig 2 however the inverse optimization technique discussed above only considered layered soil profiles surrounding the drywell but not the lateral extension of a lens additional numerical experiments were therefore conducted to investigate the ability to identify the lateral extension of a sandy lens that embedded in a sandy clay domain these simulations considered a constant head boundary condition in the drywell reservoir and different horizontal extensions 0 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 m of a 0 5 m thick sandy lens fig 9a and b show the cumulative infiltration volumes i and infiltration rates i as a function of time in these simulations note that i increases with the length of the sandy lens in fig 9a the value of i also decreases precipitously when the sandy lens gets fully saturated fig 9b for example fig 9c at 800 min shows the θ distribution after 800 min when the lateral extension of the sandy layer is 10 m in this case the sandy lens has become completely saturated at 761 min while the corresponding infiltration rate blue line in fig 9b shows a sudden decrease however it should be mentioned that it was much more difficult to discern the influence of the horizontal length of lens on i and i when properties of sandy clay loam were assigned to the lens rather than sand when a constant head boundary was assigned at the top of the sandy lens rather than assuming a full reservoir and for greater subsurface heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties 3 2 3 stochastic heterogeneity although the above results demonstrate that the soil hydraulic properties of individual soil layers can be accurately determined during constant head infiltration experiments the noted limitations indicate that it is unlikely to accurately determine the lateral extension of these layers lenses under heterogeneous field conditions the heterogeneous stochastic simulations discussed in figs 3 and 5 were therefore analyzed in terms of equivalent homogeneous profile values of k s and α that were inversely fitted to i for each stochastic realization average values of k s and α and their 95 confidence intervals were determined from 100 realizations using a given set of stochastic parameters fig 10 presents average values of k s as a function of the stochastic parameters σ fig 10a with x 1 and z 0 1 x fig 10b with σ 1 and z 0 1 and fig 10c with σ 1 and z 2 and z fig 10d with σ 1 and x 1 and the k s value of sandy loam from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog the average values of k s were found to be highly sensitive to different stochastic parameters and exhibited very narrow 95 confidence intervals in particular average values of k s increase with σ and x but decrease with z similar to i in figs 3 and 5 this can be attributed to increasing amounts of high permeability lenses with greater lateral extensions with increasing σ and x and isolated high permeability zones with increasing z the average k s value for stochastic heterogeneous domains was always higher than the homogeneous domain fig 12a a highly heterogeneous σ 1 domain with many high and low permeable lateral lenses connected vertically via short highly permeable lenses i e x 10 z 0 1 x 10 z 2 x 0 1 z 0 1 and x 1 z 0 1 had the highest average k s value fig 12a fig 11 presents average values of α as a function of the stochastic parameters σ fig 11a with x 1 and z 0 1 x fig 11b with σ 1 and z 0 1 and fig 11c with σ 1 and z 2 and z fig 11d with σ 1 and x 1 and the α value of sandy loam from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog average values of α ranged between 2 44 and 8 46 m 1 and had a relatively large confidence interval fig 12b compared to the average values of k s with a very tight confidence interval fig 12a furthermore a sensitivity analysis of k s and α were conducted where one of the parameters i e either k s or α was kept as constant in each direct simulation and the cumulative infiltration volume was determined data is not shown average value of k s 3 94 10 3 8 19 10 4 and 2 44 10 4 m min 1 and α 8 46 7 5 and 2 44 m 1 were used fig 12 the results from the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the cumulative infiltration volume increases with increase in k s and α values at a given condition however the observations from sensitivity analysis figs 10 12 indicate that the average value of k s plays a primary role and the value of α played a secondary role in determining the cumulative infiltration volume and long term performance of a drywell a large k s value indicates the presence of a highly conductive soil that leads to the faster infiltration whereas a large α value indicates a uniform and sharp wetting front and a small α value indicates a nonuniform and dispersed wetting front carsel and parrish 1988 elrick et al 1989 rawls et al 1982 van genuchten et al 1991 additional numerical experiments are needed to understand this topic better which was not further investigated in this study fig 13 shows a comparison of i simulated for a homogeneous sandy loam soil profile with k s and α values obtained from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog k s 7 37 10 4 m min 1 and α 7 5 m 1 table 1 inversely optimized average value of k s 3 94 10 3 m min 1 and α 6 17 m 1 upper confidence interval values of k s 3 68 10 3 m min 1 and α 5 40 m 1 and lower confidence interval values of k s 4 20 10 3 m min 1 and α 6 94 m 1 for the heterogeneous domain with the following stochastic parameters σ 1 x 10 and z 0 1 average values of k s and i increased by 435 and 396 for the stochastic domain note that all these simulations were conducted for a homogeneous flow domain with a sandy loam soil for 5760 min 96 h by keeping a constant head at the surface of the drywell replacing the heterogeneous domain with an equivalent homogeneous domain as presented in this study can accurately predict long term cumulative infiltration 96 h which is relevant for the low impact development standard for drywells lacdpw 2014 therefore a detailed characterization of heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties which is very time consuming and expensive may not be required when water quantity is the only criterion for evaluating drywell performance this research demonstrates that falling or constant head drywell infiltration experiments can be used in conjunction with hydrus 2d 3d numerical modeling to inversely estimate effective hydraulic properties for a heterogeneous drywell site that can be used to accurately assess its infiltration performance a constant head experiment can accurately provide the average hydraulic properties of a drywell site however a constant head experiment may not account for hydraulic properties position lateral extension and thickness of high permeable lenses of sites presented in fig 2 that are highly relevant factors affecting the cumulative infiltration volume in a falling head experiment the hydraulic properties determined using a falling head experiment may thus underestimate or overestimate the cumulative infiltration volume compared to the hydraulic properties obtained from a constant head experiment therefore this research demonstrates that a constant head drywell infiltration experiment coupled with hydrus 2d 3d inverse optimization of hydraulic parameters of each layer of a multi layered soil system table 2 and fig 8 is the best method to accurately estimate the hydraulic property of a drywell site and to assess the long term performance of a drywell 4 conclusions the numerical modeling results presented in this study demonstrate the application of hydrus 2d 3d in predicting the cumulative infiltration volume and in determining soil hydraulic properties adjacent to a drywell in particular numerical experiments were conducted to better understand the influence of deterministic and stochastic heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties on drywell infiltration behavior results demonstrated that a highly permeable lens layer at the bottom of a drywell can infiltrate water at a much faster rate than the same sized lens at the top of a drywell furthermore the cumulative infiltration volume from a drywell increases with an increasing lateral extension and thickness of a high permeable lens similarly the average cumulative infiltration volume from 100 stochastic realizations increased with increasing σ and lateral correlation length but decreased with an increasing vertical correlation length the result from direct and indirect numerical experiments provided insight in developing field scale falling head and constant head experimental methods for drywell to determine the in situ soil hydraulic properties of multiple soil layers and high permeable lenses to characterize drywell infiltration numerical experiments demonstrated that constant head experiments provide higher accuracy in inversely optimized hydraulic parameters than falling head experiments however inverse determination of soil hydraulic properties for individual soil lenses of varying lateral extensions may be impractical for highly heterogeneous systems the hydraulic properties for stochastic experiments with heterogeneous soil distributions were therefore characterized in terms of an equivalent homogeneous soil profile the average value of k s from multiple stochastic realizations with the same parameter sets had the greatest influence and played a primary role on drywell cumulative infiltration the α value showed a larger confidence interval and thus played a secondary role in the overall drywell performance similar to cumulative infiltration the average value of k s increased with σ and the lateral correlation length but decreased with an increasing vertical correlation length the equivalent homogeneous hydraulic properties obtained from a heterogeneous domain can be used to estimate the infiltration from a drywell however the hydraulic properties obtained from a falling head experiment may over or underestimate the cumulative infiltration volume compared to the hydraulic properties obtained from a constant head experiment therefore a constant head experiment for multi layered soil system would be the best method to accurately determine the drywell site hydraulic property and its long term performance this research demonstrates that extensive soil characterization may not be necessary if water quantity is the only concern however if the drywell performance also needs to account for water quality including the fate and transport of pathogenic microbial contaminants such as virus and or bacteria an accurate estimation of site heterogeneity is expected to be very important ongoing
