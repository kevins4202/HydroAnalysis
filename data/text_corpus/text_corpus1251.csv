6255,atmospheric and streamflow drought back to 1600 were reconstructed with provenance verified regional pinus sylvestris and pinus nigra chronologies of earlywood latewood and ring width detrended by signal free regional curve standardization from the weinviertel a dry region in eastern austria linear regression models with weinviertel latewood indices as predictor variables were used to estimate regional april august precipitation totals r2 0 47 and seven day minimum flow from may to october best fit r2 0 65 as a novelty the well known dendrochronology quality measure expressed population signal in a modified version is used to define a scaling factor for empirically estimating the reconstructions time varying reliability for the detection of drought years in the reconstructed time series four stages of drought of increasing intensity were defined as conditions below median and below the 33rd 20th and 5th percentile representing 2 year 3 year 5 year and 20 year recurrence intervals the method for the extension of time series of low flows into the past is applicable in the weinviertel and can be a useful source of historical hydrological and meteorological information restricted by the uncertainties coming along with proxy records of the analyzed period back to 1600 the 19th century is the driest one closely followed by the 18th century sharing the overall driest period from 1775 to 1813 the phase with the longest continuous atmospheric dry period is 1807 1811 the longest hydrological drought lasted from 1832 to 1839 keywords weinviertel low flow dendrohydrology drought expressed population signal 1 introduction austria is well known for abundant water resources but outside the alpine range especially in the northeastern part of the country the study area of this investigation water availability is limited due to semi arid conditions in summer bmlfuw 2007 but it is required by numerous stakeholders agriculture is dependent on sufficient precipitation or irrigation communities require sufficient supply of drinking water and more than 50 of austria s electricity is generated by hydro power plants in the light of climate change it is of interest for any water dependent sector to gain a deeper understanding and ability to quantitatively estimate the natural short and long term variability of critical components of the hydrological cycle e g precipitation evapotranspiration groundwater recharge river discharge especially in the case of drought events however observations of these measures are limited in their temporal extent and tree rings can potentially serve as proxy data sources in eastern austria water availability is a crucial limiting factor for tree growth karanitsch ackerl et al 2017 strumia 1999 it is common knowledge that tree ring width varies with precipitation e g fritts 1976 stockton and meko 1983 with restrictions in terms of storage and groundwater runoff this relationship should also be valid for river discharge e g meko and woodhouse 2011 as for the indirect link between tree rings and river discharge both are driven by precipitation as an input variable into the regional water budget equation as wood may be preserved for centuries when kept in completely dry or wet state e g grabner et al 2017 kłusek and grabner 2016 mchale et al 2017 it has the potential to store

flow reconstruction based on dendrochronological data yet reconstructions of hydrometeorological data are highly relevant and beneficial for water management plans but as this is the first austrian pilot study on that topic decision makers are currently unaware of the possibilities that dendrohydrology can offer in austria earliest low flow gauging stations started operating in 1951 bmnt 2018 decent data coverage was achieved in the 1970s when the network of gauges was densified and automatized measurement was implemented for vienna the precipitation time series starts in 1841 auer et al 2007 going further back in time proxy records are the only source of information preferably with at least annual resolution for eastern austria there is a compilation of several documentary sources covering the time span 1700 to 1830 strömmer 2003 regional tree ring chronologies of different tree species such as norway spruce picea abies l karst silver fir abies alba mill pine pinus sylvestris l pinus nigra arnold and oak quercus robur l quercus petraea liebl spanning several centuries are also available e g grabner et al 2014 strumia 1999 existing tree ring chronologies in this region are usually composed of living trees and wooden samples from historical buildings with the growth sites of the construction wood often unknown which is a problem for regional hydroclimatic reconstructions to assure that only regionally grown wood is used for chronology building the material has to undergo a dendro provenancing routine described for example by bridge 2012 for austria the first provenance verified chronologies were presented by karanitsch ackerl et al 2017 unlike most central european chronologies e g becker and giertz siebenlist 1970 grabner et al 2014 prokop et al 2016 often compiled for dating purposes and not for climate reconstructions these multi century chronologies do not only provide an annual tree increment index but also earlywood and latewood indices a set of three proxies per year the chronologies consist of austrian black pine pinus nigra arnold and scots pine pinus sylvestris l which are both long living softwood species capable of becoming 600 years and older their tree rings are distinct with sharp transitions from earlywood to latewood schweingruber 1993 they cover a wide ecological range and are very competitive on drought prone sites ellenberg and leuschner 2010 this makes them excellent recorders of meteorological drought and low flow events the reconstruction of summer low flow is a novelty in dendrohydrology most often in dendrohydrological investigations water year streamflow is targeted e g case and macdonald 2003 margolis et al 2011 meko et al 2007 wise 2010 woodhouse and lukas 2006 several studies focus on seasonal mostly summer streamflow e g akkemik et al 2008 may august cleaveland 2000 june august coulthard and smith 2016 july august and coulthard et al 2016 july august ferrero et al 2015 may october güner et al 2017 june july jones et al 1984 may august stagge et al 2018 reconstructed monthly mean streamflow of two rivers in utah from tree rings but without a specific focus on low flows the objectives of the paper are 1 to reconstruct regional meteorological spring and summer drought defining four stages of drought as conditions below the median below the 33rd percentile below the 20th percentile and below the 5th percentile to investigate at which intensity tree rings are most reliable as a proxy to use information from provenance verified regional tree ring chronologies to 2 augment the summer low flow may october 7 day minimum denoted as am7 records of several gauges in the weinviertel as well as 3 to investigate whether those chronologies are also representative for rivers outside the actual growing region of the trees additionally 4 a new approach of estimating the reliability of tree ring reconstructions the reconstruction reliability range rrr is presented 2 study area weinviertel the study area fig 1 is situated in northern lower austria and covers roughly 4 500 km2 it is delimited by the borders to the czech republic in the north and slovakia in the east east of the city of vienna the southern border is formed by the danube river west of vienna it follows the boundary of the forest ecological zone 8 1 pannonic plains and hills by kilian et al 1994 which also runs along the ecological and topographical transition zone between weinviertel and the adjacent waldviertel in the west harlfinger and knees 1999 only 13 6 to 21 of the weinviertel s area is covered by forests according to data provided by political districts agriculture and viticulture are the dominant land uses in the region elevation reaches from 150 m to almost 500 m a s l and most of the area is covered by tertiary and quarternary sediments the weinviertel is one of the warmest and driest austrian regions and has a negative long term annual climatic water balance bmlfuw 2007 mean annual air temperature based on histalp auer et al 2007 station data 1981 2010 lies between 9 5 c in retz and 10 4 c in vienna the coldest month with 1 1 c retz and 0 3 c vienna is january highest monthly mean temperatures are reached in july 20 2 c in retz 20 9 c in vienna mean annual precipitation totals range from less than 500 mm retz to 650 mm vienna with a summer maximum of up to 70 mm per month over the last 100 years 1916 2015 summers have become warmer fig a 1 by 2 95 c difference between june july august mean 2006 2015 and 1916 1925 for precipitation the trend is less obvious but years below the mean 1916 2015 are more frequent during the last 50 years 1966 2015 centennial trend analyses are impossible for most of the discharge data as the longest available time series reach back to 1951 more than 50 of the gauge records are even shorter table a 1 the region exhibits pronounced summer low flow regimes see fig 2 for an example monthly mean discharge of all rivers discussed in the text can be found in appendix a fig a 2 with a seasonality ratio of summer and winter discharge from 0 8 to more than 0 5 laaha and blöschl 2006 low flows typically occur between july and october mean seasonal occurrence in august and are triggered by persistent dry weather with evaporation exceeding precipitation because of the relatively low altitude and the low amount of winter precipitation snow storage and freezing processes have a subordinate influence on the low flow regime but do still influence the soil water balance and therefore tree growth in the spring season 3 materials and methods all data analysis for this study as well as all figures have been done either with r r core team 2008 or microsoft excel 2010 relevant specific r packages are mentioned in the respective sections 3 1 tree ring data the weinviertel earlywood latewood and ring width chronologies are arithmetic means of 286 samples stemming from 37 sites 146 living trees 12 sites and 140 historical timbers 25 sites and covering a time span of 540 years table 1 the dataset was already used by karanitsch ackerl et al 2017 who collected a great part of the data during a dendroclimatology project between 2010 and 2012 and combined them with data from the region already available at the boku tree ring lab dendro at sample depth and site replication vary with time the overall highest sample depth was reached with living trees for the period between 1951 and 1973 with 145 trees the best represented period covered with 57 historical samples was between 1658 and 1659 highest site replication is 14 in the earlier 17th century 3 1 1 regional curve standardization tree ring data are inherently autocorrelated the greatest part of autocorrelation is caused by the age size related trend e g cook 1990 which has to be removed before using tree ring data as a proxy for hydroclimatic reconstructions e g fritts 1976 speer 2010 for this purpose a variety of methods exists each of them having its pros and cons the way tree ring data are detrended or standardized ultimately influences the resulting reconstructions e g fritts 1976 hughes 2002 schofield et al 2016 the state of the art method for detrending tree ring time series and keeping as much long term variability as possible in the data is the signal free regional curve standardization sf rcs helama et al 2017 melvin and briffa 2014 which was also applied in this study a signal free regional curve rc was calculated from the age aligned tree ring data earlywood latewood and ring width and smoothed with a cubic smoothing spline with 50 frequency response at a knot distance of 10 of the curve length this was done with the rcs function of the r package dplr bunn et al 2015 detrended chronologies were created by dividing the originally measured value of each year by the respective value of the fitted regional curve resulting in an annual index the chronologies for earlywood ew latewood lw and ring width rw were calculated as the indices arithmetic means more details on regional curve standardization and dendrochronological detrending can be found in appendix b1 3 1 2 chronology confidence expressed population signal a tree ring chronology s confidence in terms of reconstruction of past environmental conditions is highly dependent on its replication and agreement among series statistical robustness increases with the number of samples geographic representativeness is tied to the number and spatial distribution of sites as a standard in dendrochronology the expressed population signal eps wigley et al 1984 is used as a measure of the detrended chronology s signal for calculation see equation b 1 in appendix b2 since it only takes sample size into account but neglects site replication mérian et al 2013 developed a modified eps which includes the effects of sample depth and site replication we used the modified eps by mérian et al 2013 to assess the chronologies quality with some additional alterations mérian et al 2013 developed their equation for chronologies consisting of always the same number of trees per site for always the same timeframe as the dataset of this study consists of series from historical material as well as series from living trees with varying sample depth and replication within sites over time correlations of pairwise complete observations were calculated for the overlapping series correlations were assessed using spearman correlation coefficients for the center of a moving window of 31 years for more details and background information on eps as well as equations see appendix b2 3 2 correlations between hydroclimatic data and tree ring chronologies the atmospheric drought reconstruction model is based on homogenized monthly precipitation totals from 1896 to 2010 histalp data auer et al 2007 on a 5 x 5 grid overlaying the study area fig 1 for assessing the tree ring chronologies climate growth relationships gridded precipitation and temperature data were averaged for the whole area represented by the respective tree ring chronologies the regional averages were summed up precipitation or averaged temperature for one to ten successive months with end months of the aggregated period from january to december of the year of ring formation 120 different periods fig a 3 longer aggregation periods of up to 24 months were also tested since they showed lower correlations with tree ring data they were not further used in this study since tree rings and precipitation are linked via atmosphere soil tree interactions one could also reconstruct climatic water balance calculated according to e g either thornthwaite thornthwaite and mather 1955 or penman monteith based on penman 1948 or related indices as the standardized precipitation evaporation index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 as well as the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 nevertheless preliminary investigations karanitsch ackerl et al 2012 mayer et al 2017 have shown that neither climatic water balance nor a variety of drought indices perform significantly better than precipitation in correlation analysis with tree rings in this region so the use of the more complex metrics would not have added valuable information but potentially increased error due to additionally required input data the low flow reconstruction model is based on daily discharge data from 144 austrian gauges which exhibit a near natural flow regime nine of these gauges are situated within the study area table a 1 the remaining gauges are situated in other parts of austria this extended dataset enables us to assess the correlation of the chronologies with catchments outside the trees actual growing region for the weinviertel gauges catchment areas range from 202 to 516 km2 excluding the danube river the longest records go back to 1951 but most records are available since 1977 for each calendar year the seven day minimum for the period may october am7 was calculated using the r package lfstat koffler et al 2016 this low flow statistic represents the magnitude of a summer low flow event and has been used in a number of hydrological studies and water resources management applications in austria and across europe e g laaha et al 2017 van lanen et al 2016 as a first step a correlation analysis was performed to assess the strength of the relationships between tree rings and hydroclimatic data spearman rank correlations as a non parametric alternative to pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for ew lw and rw sf rcs chronologies vs aggregated precipitation and temperature data as well as between ew lw and rw chronologies and am7 1 for the longest possible period beginning with the onset of the respective hydrological time series and 2 for a common interval for all gauges defined by the shortest series of measurements of all gauges starting in 1984 see table a 1 3 3 modelling 3 3 1 precipitation model for precipitation totals at the aggregation period showing the overall highest spearman correlation coefficient with tree ring indices a linear regression model was fitted lags and leads for two years were used for the model so that the model can take the form yt a b xt 2 c xt 1 d xt e xt 1 f xt 2 similar approaches were applied by carson and munroe 2005 1 to 2 years stockton and meko 1983 1 year and meko et al 2007 2 years to compensate for the trees distributing the effect of a single year s climate anomaly over several rings stockton and meko 1983 and to address the autocorrelation that is evident in the tree ring records carson and munroe 2005 being aware that these variables are not independent of each other which can lead to biased results due to multicollinearity their use is still justified because the inherent auto correlation fig a 4 has biological reasons stored carbohydrates which are synthesized by the tree in late summer autumn influence next spring s growth fritts 1976 for conifers like pines needle retention also plays a role p nigra and p sylvestris do not defoliate annually but keep their needles for several years according to an investigation from poljanšek et al 2015 at the dinaric mountains needles of p sylvestris are on average 2 9 0 5 years old needles of p nigra are 4 5 0 7 years old so environmental conditions of the preceding years still have an influence on wood formation this relationship can also be exploited from the opposite direction as for example by coulthard et al 2016 or meko et al 2001 using leads of up to two years the tree rings in year t 1 and t 2 still contain information on climate of the preceding year t the actual predictors were chosen according to akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1974 by stepwise variable selection venables and ripley 2002 predictors with a larger time lag lead were only kept if the preceding lag lead was also included in the final model because from a biological perspective a progressively decreasing influence of preceding years environmental conditions is most probable the fitting period for the model is 1896 to 2011 multiple and adjusted r2 as well as the root mean square error rmse are used to evaluate the model s quality the final model was validated using monte carlo cross validation with 100 replications with a split ratio of 80 20 between training and test dataset using the r package modelr wickham 2017 3 3 2 low flow model as an example and test of our method to extend hydrological time series of basins with short instrumental records linear regression models were fitted for all gauges with significant spearman correlation coefficients of the relationship between summer low flow and tree ring index the same regression procedure with stepwise parameter selection as for precipitation section 3 3 1 using lags and leads of up to two years as predictors was employed which is a common approach in dendrohydrology to incorporate differences in the timing of the response of the trees and streams to inputs and outputs of water sauchyn et al 2015 the calibration period depends on the length of the hydrological time series for each gauge the maximum possible overlap between the tree ring data and the minimum flow was used multiple and adjusted r2 as well as the rmse divided by the mean of the fitted time series to obtain comparable values are used to evaluate the models quality and the predictive performance was again evaluated by the same monte carlo cross validation approach as for precipitation 3 4 reconstruction of meteorological and streamflow drought the best linear models from section 3 3 were finally applied to reconstruct precipitation totals and low flow over the maximum possible time span of the tree ring chronology 3 4 1 introducing a new approach for assessing the reconstruction reliability of tree ring chronologies that changing sample size and site replication can make calibration period statistics misleading as measures of accuracy of long term reconstructions stockton and meko 1983 has been observed and communicated by dendroclimatologists for many years on the basis of the idea of wigley et al 1984 who suggested to multiply the explained variance of the model with the subsample signal strength sss see appendix b2 value to account for the increasing uncertainty of the reconstruction with decreasing replication of the chronology the adapted eps mérian et al 2013 equations b 1 b 5 is used here to define an empirical scaling factor for calculating an approximative prediction interval of the reconstructed time series equations b 6 to b 11 representing the newly introduced reconstruction reliability range rrr 1 rrr y t n 2 1 α 2 s y 2 s y 2 1 e p s t 1 e p s cal rrr reconstruction reliability range is calculated in the style of a pi with y as the predicted value t n 2 1 α 2 as the quantile of the t distribution for α 2 with n 2 degrees of freedom and the residual standard error of prediction s y 2 s y 2 eps t refers to a certain year during the reconstruction period while eps cal represents the mean of the calibration period of the reconstruction model the scaling factor 1 e p s t 1 e p s cal is 1 1 in years with more less noise contained in the chronology relative to the contained noise in the calibration period and is therefore widening narrowing the reconstruction reliability range rrr as our adapted eps varies with sample and site replication rrr enables capturing the degradation of signal back in time meko et al 2012 at a glance when plotting it with the reconstruction different from conventional confidence intervals as for example used by agafonov et al 2016 coulthard et al 2016 and derose et al 2015 more details on the idea and calculation of rrr can be found in appendix b3 3 4 2 detection of drought events in the second part of the analysis we aim to address the ability of the tree ring chronologies to detect low flow and drought events defined by various thresholds according to the goals set in the introduction four stages of drought are defined for the time series of april august precipitation totals and am7 as conditions below the median which is equivalent to a two year event return period t 2 years as an upper bound for low flows smakhtin 2001 below the 33rd percentile t 3 years below the 20th percentile t 5 years and below the 5th percentile t 20 years which is a commonly used low flow characteristic in austria the use of percentiles of precipitation time series is mentioned as one possibility of drought definition in the wmo handbook of drought indicators and indices wmo and gwp 2016 in addition for summer low flow a second approach of defining drought is tested by setting thresholds based on low flow quantiles calculated from the daily hydrograph at q50 q67 q80 and q95 flow that is equaled or exceeded 50 67 80 95 of the time of the daily summer season discharge data may october for the full length of the respective observed time series a similar set of thresholds was already used by haslinger et al 2014 for low flows in the same region to assess the reliability of the precipitation and am7 reconstructions confusion matrices a special form of contingency tables used to describe the performance of a classifier e g james et al 2013 sokolova and lapalme 2009 also applied in hydrological contexts e g by lagrange et al 2018 mehr et al 2017 yi et al 2016 and for the analysis of low flows haslinger et al 2014 as well as accuracy correctly predicted cases n in this case correctly predicted drought years correctly predicted non drought years number of years and a drought hit score correctly predicted droughts observed droughts are presented additionally the detected drought years are set into context with several other reconstructions 1 brázdil et al 2013 combined instrumental records and documentary sources to reconstruct dry months in the czech republic adjoining the study area in the north from 1090 to 2012 here their dry months from april to september 1600 2012 are used 2 briffa et al 2009 used instrumental records for a reconstruction of european summer self calibrating pdsi from 1750 to 2005 for this study dry summers in brno 1800 1999 are extracted 3 holawe unpublished data analyzed p nigra tree ring widths from 1237 to 1996 and their relationship to precipitation rings coded as narrow by holawe from 1600 1996 are used for comparison purposes 4 strömmer 2003 compiled a climate history of eastern austria from 1700 to 1830 using several documentary sources as well as tree rings to come to a detailed description of weather conditions on monthly resolution summers coded as dry by the author from 1701 1830 are extracted for this study 5 cook et al 2015 published detailed annual european maps of self calibrating pdsi based on tree ring data dry years in eastern austria from 1600 to 2012 based on visual inspection of the maps are extracted for this study especially for adjacent eastern europe several additional tree ring reconstructions exist e g dobrovolný et al 2015 for czech republic büntgen et al 2010 for slovakia which are valuable sources of information but not considered in the analysis because the data was not extracted as easily as for the selected references and geographically redundant given that brázdil et al 2013 as well as briffa et al 2009 cover a similar region 4 results and discussion 4 1 correlations 4 1 1 tree rings vs precipitation and temperature the highest spearman correlation coefficients with precipitation of the weinviertel chronologies table 2 are for a level of aggregation of five months covering the spring and summer season max 0 591 for lw and april august for temperature correlations peak in late spring and summer with a negative sign max 0 389 for ew may and june meaning that high spring and summer temperatures are hampering wood formation likely because of enhanced evapotranspiration 4 1 2 tree rings vs low flows the overall highest spearman correlation coefficient between tree ring chronologies and low flows fig 3 and table a 4 is 0 780 for the leitha river at the gauge at nickelsdorf and the weinviertel latewood chronology for earlywood it is 0 447 for the mödling river at the gauge mödling higher values at this gauge are achieved with latewood 0 666 and ring width 0 668 the maximum correlation coefficient for ring width is 0 701 for the schwechat river at schwechat again for this gauge the correlation is higher with latewood 0 761 considering correlation coefficients higher than 0 3 latewood outperforms earlywood and ring width in almost all cases only at two gauges there are significant earlywood values but no significant latewood values ring width correlation coefficients are higher than for latewood in only three cases and there are only two gauges where there are significant correlation coefficients for ring width but not for latewood the common interval correlations table a 4 are different from the correlations for the maximum possible time span defined by the length of the hydrological time series for the weinviertel lw chronology only three of the top five gauges are the same for both analyses indicating a certain temporal instability of the correlation there is a tendency to lower correlation coefficients for the maximum time span compared to the shorter common interval analysis the longest time series starting in 1951 show the greatest difference between correlation coefficients of maximum length and common interval for a detailed comparison see table a 4 in appendix a 4 2 models for drought reconstruction linear models described in section 3 3 were fitted for the combinations of tree ring and hydroclimatic data showing the overall highest of the significant correlation coefficients as latewood outperformed earlywood and ring width current year s lw index as well as lw indices of the two preceding and following years were used as predictor variables for the linear models possibly existing non linear connections were not considered in this study 4 2 1 precipitation the linear regression procedure described in section 3 3 1 identified the weinviertel latewood chronology index of current year and previous year as predictors for april august precipitation table 3 on average for the region the model exhibits a multiple r2 of 0 47 this is higher than for comparable reconstruction models for bavaria wilson et al 2005 40 explained variance eastern austria wimmer et al 2000 31 explained variance and spain tejedor et al 2017 45 the cross validation table 4 shows that the weinviertel precipitation model is relatively robust with an r2 ranging from 0 40 to 0 53 4 2 2 low flow for the 70 gauges with significant correlation results with the weinviertel latewood chronology index section 4 1 2 table a 4 the linear regression procedure described in section 3 3 2 was performed to identify the predictors for the summer may october 7 day minimum flow table 3 lists the models for the 23 rivers for geographical location see fig 1 with a multiple r2 higher than 0 3 to restrict the analysis to the most relevant results the current year s latewood index is part of all 23 models in 13 cases the previous year is included based on the aic the following year and the year t 2 are included into the final models 12 resp 7 times the year t 2 is not included in any of the 70 analyzed gauges only for three gauges neumarkt dürre aschach riedau pram rastenberg purzelkamp t 1 t t 1 and t 2 are part of the model the highest overall multiple r2 is 0 65 for the river leitha at the gauge nickelsdorf this is higher than other european hydrological reconstructions in turkey akkemik et al 2008 reconstructed may august streamflow with an explained variance of 53 güner et al 2017 also turkey estimated june july mean discharge with 44 explained variance jones et al 1984 explained 49 of the variance of the may august flow of a river in southern britain explained variances of hydrological reconstructions in the semiarid regions of north america are usually higher r2 of up to 81 meko et al 2001 stagge et al 2018 explained 86 variance of monthly mean flow in utah although this is not fully comparable to the approach presented here because besides tree ring data they also use other predictors e g derived from climate models at nickelsdorf the calibration period is the shortest consisting of only 28 years the longest calibration period of 61 years is seen at the gauges at matzleinsdorf at the river melk r2 0 31 and at imbach at the river krems r2 0 37 except for niederabsdorf zaya r2 0 34 siegersdorf große tulln r2 0 36 and imbach krems r2 0 37 all listed gauges and respective catchments are outside the weinviertel this may be due to the low number of gauges available in the study area eight gauges altogether but also due to the similar climatology of neighboring regions additionally some weinviertel streamflows show pronounced multi annual variations not related to climate but to long term variations of groundwater haslinger et al 2014 which could be an explanation for the lack of significant results within the study area also non linear relationships not considered in this study are possible while most of the 23 best fitted gauges are not far south of weinviertel alfersham pfudabach r2 0 38 riedau pram r2 0 36 as well as neumarkt dürre aschach r2 0 31 lie in upper austria but also close to the right side of the danube which forms part of the southern border of the study area in lower austria according to haslinger et al 2014 hydrogeological conditions are quite similar to the weinviertel in this area as the same predictor variables weinviertel latewood chronology are used for multiple models of am7 reconstructions correlation between reconstructed time series is higher than between observations fig a 5 the median am7 spearman correlation coefficient of all 23 observed reconstructed gauges is 0 48 0 75 according to the cross validation the model for the gauge at matzleinsdorf melk is the most robust one with the smallest range from minimum to maximum multiple r2 the second robust model is the one for the gauge at siegersdorf große tulln the model for riedau pram is the least robust one the five rivers with the highest explained variance are leitha r2 0 65 schwechat 0 64 ybbs 0 45 mödling 0 44 and triesting 0 43 their catchment sizes vary from 59 km2 mödling to 2 131 km2 leitha leitha as well as mödling and triesting which both flow into the schwechat have their catchments in the southern part of lower austria which is climatically similar to the weinviertel the results show that the statistical reconstruction of hydrological time series in eastern austria is feasible with the weinviertel latewood chronology albeit the generally short calibration periods 28 61 years for the gauges with an r2 0 3 for the available hydrological time series surely increase uncertainty in the resulting reconstructions as three examples the river with the highest explained variance leitha the only river catchment completely within the weinviertel zaya and the river with the longest calibration period krems were chosen for reconstruction of seven day summer minimum flow 4 3 reconstructed meteorological and streamflow drought the basis of the reconstruction of atmospheric and hydrological drought is the relationship between precipitation totals and 7 day summer minimum flow and the weinviertel latewood chronology 4 3 1 predictions vs observations the estimated weinviertel april august precipitation follows the time series of observed values quite well fig 4 a the observed extreme values positive and negative are not fully captured by the estimates but this is a general problem in tree ring based reconstructions e g woodhouse and lukas 2006 interestingly in 1976 the estimates are more extreme drier than the observations in fact april august precipitation was only slightly below average in 1976 in the weinviertel analyzing the climate data of the growing seasons 1975 and 1976 on a monthly basis data not shown one can see that september 1975 14 mm monthly precipitation at the station retz as well as march 1976 4 mm were exceptionally dry additionally daily data from the station retz shows a period without any precipitation from 17 june to 12 july in 1976 26 days combined with above average temperatures this dry period is blurred in the monthly data but visible in the tree ring widths the graphs of observed and estimated summer seven day minimum flow fig 4bcd are similar but inferences made are of higher uncertainty because the time series are quite short in dendrochronological terms the thresholds for drought were set at four stages of increasing severity see section 3 4 table 5 sheds light on the match between observed and reconstructed data using thresholds based on daily discharge quantiles leads to a very high number of events drought years higher than the expected number according to the percentage given by the threshold for the leitha river the q50 threshold defines 85 of all years as drought years 74 for the zaya river 81 for the krems river the q67 threshold flags 74 of the years as event years for leitha 63 for zaya 69 for krems q80 still leads to as many as 63 drought years for leitha and zaya krems 51 and at the q95 level there are still nine years 33 defined as drought years for leitha eight years 23 for zaya and 13 years 22 for krems the high number of events is on the one hand attributable to the fact that the target variable seven day minimum flow may october is naturally placed at the extreme end of the distribution of the hydrograph and so necessarily falls below the respective thresholds very often on the other hand as visible in fig b 2c the period in which hydrological observations are available 1951 2011 for krems 1977 2011 for zaya and 1984 2011 for leitha is relatively dry in the long term context according to the precipitation time series so the accumulation of events in this period is definitely not spurious but may be overestimated by setting the thresholds based on the daily hydrograph regarding the thresholds based on event return periods the picture is a bit different the number of drought years is predefined by the threshold as 5 20 33 50 of the observed time series accuracy number of correctly reconstructed droughts and non droughts number of years is high for all four thresholds the drought hit score correctly reconstructed drought years observed drought events decreases as thresholds are becoming more extreme the same is true for the low flow estimates accuracy for the three rivers is comparable to precipitation drought hit score is decreasing with intensity for the recurrence interval thresholds with the classical hydrological low flow characteristics q50 q67 q80 q95 performance is significantly better than with the recurrence thresholds 2 year 3 year 5 year 20 year interval this is due to the generally lower thresholds in absolute terms for the latter nonetheless the recurrence approach enables a comparison between precipitation and low flow predictive performance the most promising threshold for predicting meteorological and hydrological drought with tree ring data in this region is the three year recurrence interval here the drought hit score is lower than for the 50 threshold at which the information content concerning drought events is rather low at the 33 level accuracy is even higher for zaya and krems as well as for precipitation than at the median level the hit score is lower than for the 2 year recurrence interval but still significantly higher than for the 5 year interval 0 49 for precipitation 0 45 for krems minimum flow 0 33 for zaya minimum flow and 0 44 for leitha minimum flow considering that the models were not fit for event classification purposes but for reconstructing continuous time series of precipitation aggregates and low flow characteristics and the confusion matrix was intended as an additional proof of concept the weinviertel latewood chronology is capable of detecting meteorological drought and streamflow drought as long as the threshold is not set too low for only the most extreme events as the hit score seems too small for the 20th percentile t 5 years to draw reasonable conclusions and the median threshold also includes near normal conditions which does not allow deriving deductions about drought further analyses are restricted to the 33rd percentile threshold 4 3 2 reliability of the reconstructions in the past the newly introduced rrr fig 5 is wider than the classical pi when eps during the reconstruction period is lower than during the calibration period for the precipitation reconstructions it is on average 106 mm for the pi and 134 mm for rrr for the hydrological reconstructions it is 0 88 m3s 1 with and 0 62 m3s 1 without eps rescaling for the krems river 0 29 m3s 1 with and 0 21 m3s 1 without scaling factor for the zaya and 2 90 m3s 1 pi and 4 45 m3s 1 rrr for the leitha in years with a reconstruction period eps value comparable to the mean eps value during the calibration period resulting in a weight close to 1 this deviation is almost invisible when eps is lower inversely proportional to increasing noise the rrr becomes significantly wider making the reconstruction less reliable the year with the greatest absolute deviation between the classically calculated prediction interval and the rrr is 1795 for all four reconstructions 125 mm for precipitation 0 89 m3s 1 for krems 0 29 m3s 1 for zaya and 4 71 m3s 1 leitha which is also the year with the lowest eps value 0 64 of the chronology see also fig b 3 note that the negative part of the pi and rrr of the hydrological reconstructions is not shown in fig 5bcd as the flow cannot be below zero in reality but is still included in the calculations of the figures mentioned above dendrochronologists have developed a set of measures for assessing the signal strength of their chronologies e g cook and pederson 2011 but usually do not provide standard uncertainty measures for their reconstructions also used by related disciplines as climatology e g ipcc 2014 which impairs inter comparability of different reconstructions streamflow reconstructions published in the journal of hydrology over the last 10 years show a wide variety of ways dealing with uncertainty from omitting the topic harley et al 2017 margolis et al 2011 over different interpretations of the confidence interval according to e g weisberg 2005 agafonov et al 2016 coulthard et al 2016 derose et al 2015 ferrero et al 2015 to alternative methods like ensemble modelling sauchyn et al 2015 or the maximum entropy bootstrap cook et al 2013 earlier by meko et al 2001 and meko et al 2007 monte carlo simulations were used to produce confidence bands or sub periods of the reconstruction were defined to acknowledge the time dependent quality of the dendrohydrologic information meko et al 2001 by introducing the reconstruction reliability range rrr we contribute to this variety the advantage of this approach is that the changing confidence over time can be spotted at a glance when plotted with the reconstruction time series and that it is based on the two well known and widely accepted concepts of prediction intervals e g weisberg 2005 and eps wigley et al 1984 but from its first application presented here it is not clear whether the empirically chosen ratio 1 epst 1 epscal is the most suitable scaling factor or if it over underestimates the increase of uncertainty with decreasing eps other scaling factors as well as alternative approaches to address the issue of reliability of tree ring based reconstructions need to be further investigated 4 3 3 comparison with other reconstructions for putting the precipitation and minimum flow reconstructions into perspective they are compared to other reconstructions with regional and or methodological similarities fig 6 and table 6 in general the weinviertel reconstructions show good agreement 51 87 with the reconstructions from other sources 87 are reached for the zaya am7 reconstruction compared to holawe unpublished data who has analyzed data from southern lower austria in the vicinity of the leitha catchment taking only drought years into account black or colored bars in fig 6 agreement drops to 13 64 64 for zaya and cook et al 2015 based on the assumption that the 33 threshold should represent a 3 year return period the reconstructions detect fewer drought years than expected during the 395 year period with 132 expected drought years 88 precipitation droughts and 80 streamflow droughts for krems as well as only 36 droughts for zaya and 75 for leitha are reconstructed while the precipitation reconstruction is comparably close to the expectations given the fact that regression models tend to underestimate extremes the reason for the even fewer streamflow drought years could lie in the short calibration period for streamflow which represents a relatively dry phase in recent eastern austrian climate history auer et al 2014 see also fig b 2c the five years with the least reconstructed precipitation from april to august are 1976 and 1666 in accordance with all references 1842 1719 and 1887 the five years with the lowest reconstructed summer minimum flows for the krems river are 1615 preceding 1616 a well known european drought year büntgen et al 2011 1983 very dry year according to auer et al 2014 1645 1835 also in the list of driest years in central europe according to büntgen et al 2011 and 1720 the five years with the lowest summer minimum flows for the zaya are 1835 1842 1808 1719 and 1976 in accordance with all references 1976 is also one of the driest years in more recent european history according to büntgen et al 2011 albeit with a focus in north western europe the driest years according to the leitha summer minimum flow reconstruction are 1835 1719 1808 1811 and 1834 the phase with the longest and most frequent drought events according to the reconstructions of this study is around 1780 to 1840 with an interruption from 1813 to 1830 fig 6 which may be due to the volcanic eruption of tambora indonesia in 1815 causing a very cold 1816 and following years in central europe e g brönnimann and krämer 2016 in the 17th century the weinviertel reconstruction detected 14 meteorological drought years and also 14 hydrological drought years for the krems river three drought years for zaya as well as six for leitha most of these droughts are single year events the 17th century is entirely contained within the little ice age with the maunder minimum starting around 1645 auer et al 2014 when temperatures were significantly lower than today lower temperatures could be favorable for trees in eastern austria because they reduce drought stress due to less transpiration making the 17th century the period with the fewest drought years of the four reconstructed centuries büntgen et al 2011 list the years 1608 1616 1624 1636 1653 1681 1685 1697 as the driest years in central europe of this century 1616 1653 and 1681 were also dry in the weinviertel according to the reconstruction during the 18th century 26 reconstructed meteorological drought years as well as 26 krems 12 zaya and 28 leitha hydrological drought years occurred already by 1704 a dry phase also detected by brázdil et al 2013 began another event of sustained drought started in 1718 and from 1778 to 1813 multi year drought events as well as frequent single year droughts occurred in eastern austria at the end of the century and also lasting after 1800 a generally drier phase was also captured by other reconstructions strömmer 2003 1783 1811 strumia 1999 1760 1810 cook et al 2015 state persistently drier than average conditions over north central europe for 1779 1827 and in 1773 and from 1811 to 1813 the lake neusiedl a large endorheic steppe lake not far south east of the study area ran completely dry österreichisch ungarische gewässerkommission 1996 the 19th century is the driest of the four analyzed centuries very closely followed by the 18th according to the 27 drought years detected by the weinviertel precipitation reconstruction 26 krems 16 zaya and 27 leitha streamflow droughts are reconstructed in this period after a very long multi year event ending around 1840 single year events occurred during the 19th century the little ice age came to an end around 1860 auer et al 2014 since 1800 ad relative air humidity has been decreasing in austria since 1870 especially in the eastern part of the country auer et al 2014 the driest periods during the 19th century are the 1830s strumia 1999 also visible in the weinviertel reconstruction and the 1860s auer et al 2014 strumia 1999 which were not extremely dry in the weinviertel according to this study still lake neusiedl again fell dry for several years during this decade österreichisch ungarische gewässerkommission 1996 but not due to heavy droughts but because wet extremes filling up the lake again were missing during this time haslinger pers communication over the 20th century single year events were dominating their frequency increased from the 1970s on the weinviertel meteorological reconstruction detected 21 drought years and 14 krems and leitha resp five zaya hydrological drought years a dry phase reported by auer et al 2014 for eastern austria from 1970 to 1999 is represented by frequent single year events in the weinviertel with 1976 as the driest reconstructed year of the century the reconstructions of spring summer droughts april august and summer seven day minimum flows may october back to 1600 are not very different as they all use the weinviertel latewood chronology of the analyzed period back to 1600 the 19th century is the driest one closely followed by the 18th century sharing the overall driest period from 1775 to 1813 as a summary it appears that current low flow and drought events fall within the range of historical events indicating that recent drought events are not unusual keeping in mind that the error term in regression causes reconstructed values to be compressed toward the calibration period mean meko et al 2001 reconstructed highs and lows are less dramatic than those of the gauged record and therefore also tend to underestimate the severity of historical drought events for the weinviertel reconstructions this is reflected by the fewer than expected reconstructed events compared to the more than expected events in the calibration period section 4 3 1 in all the four analysed centuries for a return period t 3 years 33 drought years in 100 years could be expected but on average only 22 events per century are detected by the reconstructions resulting in an actual return period of t 4 5 years between 1600 and 1750 fewer droughts than today are indicated but as they seem to better relate to droughts reported by other references one can speculate on more widespread drought events periods with more frequent and more extreme events can be observed e g within 1780 1840 with 1807 1811 being the longest period of consecutive atmospheric drought years and 1832 1839 as the longest period of hydrological drought years with low flow discharges 10 20 below the current conditions such information is valuable for austrian water management to put current and projected future low flows e g laaha et al 2016 into context the reconstructed extreme events are in line with other historical sources giving credence to the estimates although 12 to 24 of the reconstructed dry years do not agree with other reconstructions surrounding the study area which may indicate regional differences drought can be a spatially very heterogeneous phenomenon as demonstrated for example by cook et al 2015 this emphasizes the importance of provenance verified regional tree ring chronologies for reconstructing meteorological and hydrological droughts at this spatial scale 5 conclusions the goals of this first dendrohydrological investigation focusing on droughts and low flows in central europe were 1 to reconstruct regional meteorological spring and summer drought to 2 augment the summer low flow am7 records of several gauges in the weinviertel and 3 to investigate whether those chronologies are also representative for rivers outside the actual growing region of the trees additionally 4 we presented the rrr as a new idea of estimating the reliability of tree ring reconstructions the weinviertel latewood chronology is capable of detecting meteorological and streamflow drought even outside the actual growing region of the trees as long as the threshold is not set too low for only the most extreme events and with the caveat that the calibration periods for streamflow reconstructions are quite short and therefore correlations with am7 may be temporally instable the link between tree rings and low flows in the study area needs to be explored in more detail before the method can be transferred to other regions but it was shown that the method of augmenting hydrological time series is working and can be a useful source of information for austrian hydrologists in the future bearing in mind the uncertainties coming along with proxies methodologically applying other lags and leads to linear regression analysis or other methods of calculating tree ring chronologies e g not using arithmetic means but quantiles are options for further research further testing the newly introduced rrr with additional tree ring chronologies from other regions and developing alternative approaches of depicting the reconstruction performance of dendrochronological data varying with time due to changing sample and site replication may eventually pave the way to an established measure standardly used with tree ring reconstructions by the

weinviertel low flow dendrohydrology drought expressed population signal 1 introduction austria is well known for abundant water resources but outside the alpine range especially in the northeastern part of the country the study area of this investigation water availability is limited due to semi arid conditions in summer bmlfuw 2007 but it is required by numerous stakeholders agriculture is dependent on sufficient precipitation or irrigation communities require sufficient supply of drinking water and more than 50 of austria s electricity is generated by hydro power plants in the light of climate change it is of interest for any water dependent sector to gain a deeper understanding and ability to quantitatively estimate the natural short and long term variability of critical components of the hydrological cycle e g precipitation evapotranspiration groundwater recharge river discharge especially in the case of drought events however observations of these measures are limited in their temporal extent and tree rings can potentially serve as proxy data sources in eastern austria water availability is a crucial limiting factor for tree growth karanitsch ackerl et al 2017 strumia 1999

pilot study on that topic decision makers are currently unaware of the possibilities that dendrohydrology can offer in austria earliest low flow gauging stations started operating in 1951 bmnt 2018

usually composed of living trees and wooden samples from historical buildings with the growth sites of the construction wood often unknown which is a problem for regional hydroclimatic reconstructions to assure that only regionally grown wood is used for chronology building the material has to undergo a dendro provenancing routine described for example by bridge 2012 for austria the first

of three proxies per year the chronologies consist of austrian black pine pinus nigra arnold and scots pine pinus sylvestris l which are both long living softwood species capable of becoming 600 years and older their tree rings are distinct with sharp transitions from earlywood to latewood schweingruber 1993 they cover a wide ecological range and are very competitive on drought prone sites

weinviertel the study area fig 1 is situated in northern lower austria and covers roughly 4 500 km2 it is delimited by the borders to the czech republic in the north and slovakia in the east east of the city of vienna the southern border is formed by the danube river west of vienna it follows the boundary of the forest ecological zone 8 1 pannonic plains and hills by kilian et al 1994 which also runs along the ecological and topographical transition zone between weinviertel and the adjacent waldviertel in the west harlfinger and knees 1999 only 13 6 to 21 of the weinviertel s area is covered by forests according to data provided by political districts agriculture and viticulture are the dominant land uses in the region elevation reaches from 150 m to almost 500 m a s l and most of the area is covered by tertiary and quarternary sediments the weinviertel is one of the warmest and driest austrian regions and has a negative long term annual climatic water balance bmlfuw 2007 mean annual air temperature based on histalp auer et al 2007 station data 1981 2010 lies between 9 5 c in retz and 10 4 c in vienna the coldest month with 1 1 c retz and 0 3 c vienna is january highest monthly mean temperatures are reached in july 20 2 c in retz 20 9 c in vienna mean annual precipitation totals range from less than 500 mm retz to 650 mm vienna with a summer maximum of up to 70 mm

reach back to 1951 more than 50 of the gauge records are even shorter table a 1 the region exhibits pronounced summer low flow regimes see fig 2 for an example monthly mean discharge of all rivers discussed in the text can be found in appendix a fig a 2 with a seasonality ratio of summer and winter discharge from 0 8 to more than 0 5 laaha and blöschl 2006 low flows typically occur between july and october mean seasonal occurrence in august and are triggered by persistent dry weather with evaporation exceeding precipitation because of the relatively low altitude and the low amount of winter precipitation snow storage and freezing processes have a subordinate influence on the low flow regime but do still influence the soil water balance and therefore tree growth in the spring season 3 materials and methods all data analysis for this study as well as all figures have been done either with r r core team 2008 or microsoft excel 2010 relevant specific r packages are mentioned in the respective sections 3 1 tree ring data the weinviertel earlywood latewood and ring width chronologies are arithmetic means of 286 samples stemming from 37 sites 146 living trees 12 sites and 140 historical timbers 25 sites and covering a time span of 540 years table 1 the dataset was already used by karanitsch ackerl et al 2017 who collected a great part of the data during a dendroclimatology project between 2010 and 2012 and combined them with data from the region already available at the boku tree ring lab dendro at sample depth and site replication vary with time the overall highest sample depth was reached with living trees for the period between 1951 and 1973 with 145 trees the best represented period covered with 57 historical samples was between 1658 and 1659 highest site replication is 14 in the earlier 17th century 3 1 1 regional curve standardization tree ring data are inherently autocorrelated the greatest part of autocorrelation is caused by the age size related trend e g cook 1990 which has to be removed before using tree ring data as a proxy for hydroclimatic reconstructions e g fritts 1976 speer 2010 for this purpose a variety of methods exists each of them having its pros and cons the way tree ring data are detrended or standardized ultimately influences the resulting reconstructions e g fritts 1976 hughes 2002 schofield et al 2016 the state of the art method for detrending tree ring time series and keeping as much long term variability as possible in the data is the signal free regional curve standardization sf rcs helama et al 2017 melvin and briffa 2014 which was also applied in this study a signal free regional curve rc was calculated from the age aligned tree ring data earlywood latewood and ring width and smoothed with a cubic smoothing spline with 50 frequency response at a knot distance of 10 of the curve length this was done with the rcs function of the r package dplr bunn et al 2015 detrended chronologies were created by dividing the originally measured value of each year by the respective value of the fitted regional curve resulting in an annual index the chronologies for earlywood ew latewood lw and ring width rw were calculated as the indices arithmetic means more details on regional curve standardization and dendrochronological detrending can be found in appendix b1 3 1 2 chronology confidence expressed

robustness increases with the number of samples geographic representativeness is tied to the number and spatial distribution of sites as a standard in dendrochronology the expressed population signal eps wigley et al 1984 is used as a measure of the detrended chronology s signal for calculation see equation b 1 in appendix b2 since it only takes sample size into account but neglects site replication mérian et al 2013 developed a modified eps which includes the effects of sample depth and site replication we used the modified eps by mérian et al 2013 to assess the chronologies quality with some additional alterations mérian et al 2013 developed their equation for chronologies consisting of always the same number of trees per site for always the same timeframe as the dataset of this study consists of series from historical material as well as series from living trees with varying sample depth and replication within sites over time correlations of pairwise complete observations were calculated for the overlapping series correlations were assessed using spearman correlation coefficients for the center of a moving window of 31 years for more details and background information on eps as well as equations see appendix b2 3 2 correlations between hydroclimatic data and tree ring chronologies the atmospheric drought reconstruction model is based on homogenized monthly precipitation totals from 1896 to 2010 histalp data auer et al 2007 on a 5 x 5 grid overlaying the study area fig 1 for assessing the tree ring chronologies climate growth relationships gridded precipitation and temperature data were averaged for the whole area represented by the respective tree ring chronologies the regional averages were summed up precipitation or averaged temperature for one to ten successive months with end months of the aggregated period from january to december of the year of ring formation 120 different periods fig a 3 longer aggregation periods of up to 24 months were also tested since they showed lower correlations with tree ring data they were not further used in this study since tree rings and precipitation are linked via atmosphere soil tree interactions one could also reconstruct climatic water balance calculated according to e g either thornthwaite thornthwaite and mather 1955 or penman monteith based on penman 1948 or related indices as the standardized precipitation evaporation index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 as well as the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 nevertheless preliminary investigations karanitsch ackerl et al 2012 mayer et al 2017 have shown that neither climatic water balance nor a variety of drought indices perform significantly better than precipitation in correlation analysis with tree rings in this region so the use of the more complex metrics would not have added valuable information but potentially increased error due to additionally required input data the low flow reconstruction model is based on daily discharge data from 144 austrian gauges which exhibit a near natural flow regime nine of these gauges are situated within the study area table a 1 the remaining gauges are situated in other parts of austria this extended dataset enables us to assess the correlation of the chronologies with catchments outside the trees actual growing region for the weinviertel gauges catchment areas range from 202 to 516 km2 excluding the danube river the longest records go back to 1951 but most records are available since 1977 for each calendar year the seven day minimum for the period may october am7 was calculated using the r package lfstat koffler et al 2016 this low flow statistic represents the magnitude of a summer low flow event and has been used in a number of hydrological studies and water resources management applications in austria and across europe e g laaha et al 2017 van lanen et al 2016 as a first step a correlation analysis was performed to assess the strength of the relationships between tree rings and hydroclimatic data spearman rank correlations as a non parametric alternative to pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for ew lw and rw sf rcs chronologies vs aggregated precipitation and temperature data as well as between ew lw and rw chronologies and am7 1 for the longest possible period beginning with the onset of the respective hydrological time series and 2 for a common interval for all gauges defined by the shortest series of measurements of all gauges starting in 1984 see table a 1 3 3 modelling 3 3 1 precipitation model for precipitation totals at the aggregation period showing the overall highest spearman correlation coefficient with tree ring indices a linear regression model was fitted lags and leads for two years were used for the model so that the model can take the form yt a b xt 2 c xt 1 d xt e xt 1 f xt 2 similar approaches were applied by carson and munroe 2005 1 to 2 years stockton and meko 1983 1 year and meko et al 2007 2 years to compensate for the trees distributing the effect of a single year s climate anomaly over several rings stockton and meko 1983 and to address the autocorrelation that is evident in the tree ring records carson and munroe 2005 being aware that these variables are not independent of each other which can lead to biased results due to multicollinearity their use is still justified because the inherent auto correlation fig a 4 has biological reasons stored carbohydrates which are synthesized by the tree in late summer autumn influence next spring s growth fritts 1976 for conifers like pines needle retention also plays a role p nigra and p sylvestris do not defoliate annually but keep their needles for several years according to an investigation from poljanšek et al 2015 at the dinaric mountains needles of p sylvestris are on average 2 9 0 5 years old needles of p nigra are 4 5 0 7 years old so environmental conditions of the preceding years still have an influence on wood formation this relationship can also be exploited from the opposite direction as for example by coulthard et al 2016 or meko et al 2001 using leads of up to two years the tree rings in year t 1 and t 2 still contain information on climate of the preceding year t the actual predictors were chosen according to akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1974 by stepwise variable selection venables and ripley 2002 predictors with a larger time lag lead were only kept if the preceding lag lead was also included in the final model because from a biological perspective a progressively decreasing influence of preceding years environmental conditions is most probable the fitting period for the model is 1896 to 2011 multiple and adjusted r2 as well as the root mean square error rmse are used to evaluate the model s quality the final model was validated using monte carlo cross validation with 100 replications with a split ratio of 80 20 between training and test dataset using the r package modelr wickham 2017 3 3 2 low flow model as an example and test of our method to extend hydrological time series of basins with short instrumental records linear regression models were fitted for all gauges with significant spearman correlation coefficients of the relationship between summer low flow and tree ring index the same regression procedure with stepwise parameter selection as for precipitation section 3 3 1 using lags and leads of up to two years as predictors was employed which is a common approach in dendrohydrology to incorporate differences in the timing of the response of the trees and streams to inputs and outputs of water sauchyn et al 2015 the calibration period depends on the length of the hydrological time series for each gauge the maximum possible overlap between the tree ring data and the minimum flow was used multiple and adjusted r2 as well as the rmse divided by the mean of the fitted time series to obtain comparable values are used to evaluate the models quality and the predictive performance was again evaluated by the same monte carlo cross validation approach as for precipitation 3 4 reconstruction of meteorological and streamflow drought the best linear models from section 3 3 were finally applied to reconstruct precipitation totals and low flow over the maximum possible time span of the tree ring chronology 3 4 1 introducing a new approach for assessing the reconstruction reliability of tree ring chronologies that changing sample size and site replication can make calibration period statistics misleading as measures of accuracy of long term reconstructions stockton and meko 1983 has been observed and communicated by dendroclimatologists for many years on the basis of the idea of wigley et al 1984 who suggested to multiply the explained variance of the model with the subsample signal strength sss see appendix b2 value to account for the increasing uncertainty of the reconstruction with decreasing replication of the chronology the adapted eps mérian et al 2013 equations b 1 b 5 is used here to define an empirical scaling factor for calculating an approximative prediction interval of the reconstructed time series equations b 6 to b 11 representing the newly introduced reconstruction reliability range rrr 1 rrr y t n 2 1 α 2 s y 2 s y 2 1 e p s t 1 e p s cal rrr reconstruction reliability range is calculated in the style of a pi with y as the predicted value t n 2 1 α 2 as the quantile of the t distribution for α 2 with n 2 degrees of freedom and the residual standard error of prediction s y 2 s y 2 eps t refers to a certain year during the reconstruction period while eps cal represents the mean of the calibration period of the reconstruction model the scaling factor 1 e p s t 1 e p s cal is 1 1 in years with more less noise contained in the chronology relative to the contained noise in the calibration period and is therefore widening narrowing the reconstruction reliability range rrr as our adapted eps varies with sample and site replication rrr enables capturing the degradation of signal back in time meko et al 2012 at a glance when plotting it with the reconstruction different from conventional confidence intervals as for example used by agafonov et al 2016 coulthard et al 2016 and derose et al 2015 more details on the idea and calculation of rrr can be found in appendix b3 3 4 2 detection of drought events in the second part of the analysis we aim to address the ability of the tree ring chronologies to detect low flow and drought events defined by various thresholds according to the goals set in the introduction four stages of drought are defined for the time series of april august precipitation totals and am7 as conditions below the median which is equivalent to a two year event return period t 2 years as an upper bound for low flows smakhtin 2001 below the 33rd percentile t 3 years below the 20th percentile t 5 years and below the 5th percentile t 20 years which is a commonly used low flow characteristic in austria the use of percentiles of precipitation time series is mentioned as one possibility of drought definition in the wmo handbook of drought indicators and indices wmo and gwp 2016 in addition for summer low flow a second approach of defining drought is tested by setting thresholds based on low flow quantiles calculated from the daily hydrograph at q50 q67 q80 and q95 flow that is equaled or exceeded 50 67 80 95 of the time of the daily summer season discharge data may october for the full length of the respective observed time series a similar set of thresholds was already used by haslinger et al 2014 for low flows in the same region to assess the reliability of the precipitation and am7 reconstructions confusion matrices a special form of contingency tables used to describe the performance of a classifier e g james et al 2013 sokolova and lapalme 2009 also applied in hydrological contexts e g by lagrange et al 2018 mehr et al 2017 yi et al 2016 and for the analysis of low flows haslinger et al 2014 as well as accuracy correctly predicted cases n in this case correctly predicted drought years correctly predicted non drought years number of years and a drought hit score correctly predicted droughts observed droughts are presented additionally the detected drought years are set into context with several other reconstructions 1 brázdil et al 2013 combined instrumental records and documentary sources to reconstruct dry months in the czech republic adjoining the study area in the north from 1090 to 2012 here their dry months from april to september 1600 2012 are used 2 briffa et al 2009 used instrumental records for a reconstruction of european summer self calibrating pdsi from 1750 to 2005 for this study dry summers in brno 1800 1999 are extracted 3 holawe unpublished data analyzed p nigra tree ring widths from 1237 to 1996 and their relationship to precipitation rings coded as narrow by holawe from 1600 1996 are used for comparison purposes 4 strömmer 2003 compiled a climate history of eastern austria from 1700 to 1830 using several documentary sources as well as tree rings to come to a detailed description of weather conditions on monthly resolution summers coded as dry by the author from 1701 1830 are extracted for this study 5 cook et al 2015 published detailed annual european maps of self calibrating pdsi based on tree ring data dry years in eastern austria from 1600 to 2012 based on visual inspection of the maps are extracted for this study especially for adjacent eastern europe several additional tree ring reconstructions exist e g dobrovolný et al 2015 for czech republic büntgen et al 2010 for slovakia which are valuable sources of information but not considered in the analysis because the data was not extracted as easily as for the selected references and geographically redundant given that brázdil et al 2013 as well as briffa et al 2009 cover a similar region 4 results and discussion 4 1 correlations 4 1 1 tree rings vs precipitation and temperature the highest spearman correlation coefficients with precipitation of the weinviertel chronologies table 2 are for a level of aggregation of five months covering the spring and summer season max 0 591 for lw and april august for temperature correlations peak in late spring and summer with a negative sign max 0 389 for ew may and june meaning that high spring and summer temperatures are hampering wood formation likely because of enhanced evapotranspiration 4 1 2 tree rings vs low flows the overall highest spearman correlation coefficient between tree ring chronologies and low flows fig 3 and table a 4 is 0 780 for the leitha river at the gauge at nickelsdorf and the weinviertel latewood chronology for earlywood it is 0 447 for the mödling river at the gauge mödling higher values at this gauge are achieved with latewood 0 666 and ring width 0 668 the maximum correlation coefficient for ring width is 0 701 for the schwechat river at schwechat again for this gauge the correlation is higher with latewood 0 761 considering correlation coefficients higher than 0 3 latewood outperforms earlywood and ring width in almost all cases only at two gauges there are significant earlywood values but no significant latewood values ring width correlation coefficients are higher than for latewood in only three cases and there are only two gauges where there are significant correlation coefficients for ring width but not for latewood the common interval correlations table a 4 are different from the correlations for the maximum possible time span defined by the length of the hydrological time series for the weinviertel lw chronology only three of the top five gauges are the same for both analyses indicating a certain temporal instability of the correlation there is a tendency to lower correlation coefficients for the maximum time span compared to the shorter common interval analysis the longest time series starting in 1951 show the greatest difference between correlation coefficients of maximum length and common interval for a detailed comparison see table a 4 in appendix a 4 2 models for drought reconstruction linear models described in section 3 3 were fitted for the combinations of tree ring and hydroclimatic data showing the overall highest of the significant correlation coefficients as latewood outperformed earlywood and ring width current year s lw index as well as lw indices of the two preceding and following years were used as predictor variables for the linear models possibly existing non linear connections were not considered in this study 4 2 1 precipitation the linear regression procedure described in section 3 3 1 identified the weinviertel latewood chronology index of current year and previous year as predictors for april august precipitation table 3 on average for the region the model exhibits a multiple r2 of 0 47 this is higher than for comparable reconstruction models for bavaria wilson et al 2005 40 explained variance eastern austria wimmer et al 2000 31 explained variance and spain tejedor et al 2017 45 the cross validation table 4 shows that the weinviertel precipitation model is relatively robust with an r2 ranging from 0 40 to 0 53 4 2 2 low flow for the 70 gauges with significant correlation results with the weinviertel latewood chronology index section 4 1 2 table a 4 the linear regression procedure described in section 3 3 2 was performed to identify the predictors for the summer may october 7 day minimum flow table 3 lists the models for the 23 rivers for geographical location see fig 1 with a multiple r2 higher than 0 3 to restrict the analysis to the most relevant results the current year s latewood index is part of all 23 models in 13 cases the previous year is included based on the aic the following year and the year t 2 are included into the final models 12 resp 7 times the year t 2 is not included in any of the 70 analyzed gauges only for three gauges neumarkt dürre aschach riedau pram rastenberg purzelkamp t 1 t t 1 and t 2 are part of the model the highest overall multiple r2 is 0 65 for the river leitha at the gauge nickelsdorf this is higher than other european hydrological reconstructions in turkey akkemik et al 2008 reconstructed may august streamflow with an explained variance of 53 güner et al 2017 also turkey estimated june july mean discharge with 44 explained variance jones et al 1984 explained 49 of the variance of the may august flow of a river in southern britain explained variances of hydrological reconstructions in the semiarid regions of north america are usually higher r2 of up to 81 meko et al 2001 stagge et al 2018 explained 86 variance of monthly mean flow in utah although this is not fully comparable to the approach presented here because besides tree ring data they also use other predictors e g derived from climate models at nickelsdorf the calibration period is the shortest consisting of only 28 years the longest calibration period of 61 years is seen at the gauges at matzleinsdorf at the river melk r2 0 31 and at imbach at the river krems r2 0 37 except for niederabsdorf zaya r2 0 34 siegersdorf große tulln r2 0 36 and imbach krems r2 0 37 all listed gauges and respective catchments are outside the weinviertel this may be due to the low number of gauges available in the study area eight gauges altogether but also due to the similar climatology of neighboring regions additionally some weinviertel streamflows show pronounced multi annual variations not related to climate but to long term variations of groundwater haslinger et al 2014 which could be an explanation for the lack of significant results within the study area also non linear relationships not considered in this study are possible while most of the 23 best fitted gauges are not far south of weinviertel alfersham pfudabach r2 0 38 riedau pram r2 0 36 as well as neumarkt dürre aschach r2 0 31 lie in upper austria but also close to the right side of the danube which forms part of the southern border of the study area in lower austria according to haslinger et al 2014 hydrogeological conditions are quite similar to the weinviertel in this area as the same predictor variables weinviertel latewood chronology are used for multiple models of am7 reconstructions correlation between reconstructed time series is higher than between observations fig a 5 the median am7 spearman correlation coefficient of all 23 observed reconstructed gauges is 0 48 0 75 according to the cross validation the model for the gauge at matzleinsdorf melk is the most robust one with the smallest range from minimum to maximum multiple r2 the second robust model is the one for the gauge at siegersdorf große tulln the model for riedau pram is the least robust one the five rivers with the highest explained variance are leitha r2 0 65 schwechat 0 64 ybbs 0 45 mödling 0 44 and triesting 0 43 their catchment sizes vary from 59 km2 mödling to 2 131 km2 leitha leitha as well as mödling and triesting which both flow into the schwechat have their catchments in the southern part of lower austria which is climatically similar to the weinviertel the results show that the statistical reconstruction of hydrological time series in eastern austria is feasible with the weinviertel latewood chronology albeit the generally short calibration periods 28 61 years for the gauges with an r2 0 3 for the available hydrological time series surely increase uncertainty in the resulting reconstructions as three examples the river with the highest explained variance leitha the only river catchment completely within the weinviertel zaya and the river with the longest calibration period krems were chosen for reconstruction of seven day summer minimum flow 4 3 reconstructed meteorological and streamflow drought the basis of the reconstruction of atmospheric and hydrological drought is the relationship between precipitation totals and 7 day summer minimum flow and the weinviertel latewood chronology 4 3 1 predictions vs observations the estimated weinviertel april august precipitation follows the time series of observed values quite well fig 4 a the observed extreme values positive and negative are not fully captured by the estimates but this is a general problem in tree ring based reconstructions e g woodhouse and lukas 2006 interestingly in 1976 the estimates are more extreme drier than the observations in fact april august precipitation was only slightly below average in 1976 in the weinviertel analyzing the climate data of the growing seasons 1975 and 1976 on a monthly basis data not shown one can see that september 1975 14 mm monthly precipitation at the station retz as well as march 1976 4 mm were exceptionally dry additionally daily data from the station retz shows a period without any precipitation from 17 june to 12 july in 1976 26 days combined with above average temperatures this dry period is blurred in the monthly data but visible in the tree ring widths the graphs of observed and estimated summer seven day minimum flow fig 4bcd are similar but inferences made are of higher uncertainty because the time series are quite short in dendrochronological terms the thresholds for drought were set at four stages of increasing severity see section 3 4 table 5 sheds light on the match between observed and reconstructed data using thresholds based on daily discharge quantiles leads to a very high number of events drought years higher than the expected number according to the percentage given by the threshold for the leitha river the q50 threshold defines 85 of all years as drought years 74 for the zaya river 81 for the krems river the q67 threshold flags 74 of the years as event years for leitha 63 for zaya 69 for krems q80 still leads to as many as 63 drought years for leitha and zaya krems 51 and at the q95 level there are still nine years 33 defined as drought years for leitha eight years 23 for zaya and 13 years 22 for krems the high number of events is on the one hand attributable to the fact that the target variable seven day minimum flow may october is naturally placed at the extreme end of the distribution of the hydrograph and so necessarily falls below the respective thresholds very often on the other hand as visible in fig b 2c the period in which hydrological observations are available 1951 2011 for krems 1977 2011 for zaya and 1984 2011 for leitha is relatively dry in the long term context according to the precipitation time series so the accumulation of events in this period is definitely not spurious but may be overestimated by setting the thresholds based on the daily hydrograph regarding the thresholds based on event return periods the picture is a bit different the number of drought years is predefined by the threshold as 5 20 33 50 of the observed time series accuracy number of correctly reconstructed droughts and non droughts number of years is high for all four thresholds the drought hit score correctly reconstructed drought years observed drought events decreases as thresholds are becoming more extreme the same is true for the low flow estimates accuracy for the three rivers is comparable to precipitation drought hit score is decreasing with intensity for the recurrence interval thresholds with the classical hydrological low flow characteristics q50 q67 q80 q95 performance is significantly better than with the recurrence thresholds 2 year 3 year 5 year 20 year interval this is due to the generally lower thresholds in absolute terms for the latter nonetheless the recurrence approach enables a comparison between precipitation and low flow predictive performance the most promising threshold for predicting meteorological and hydrological drought with tree ring data in this region is the three year recurrence interval here the drought hit score is lower than for the 50 threshold at which the information content concerning drought events is rather low at the 33 level accuracy is even higher for zaya and krems as well as for precipitation than at the median level the hit score is lower than for the 2 year recurrence interval but still significantly higher than for the 5 year interval 0 49 for precipitation 0 45 for krems minimum flow 0 33 for zaya minimum flow and 0 44 for leitha minimum flow considering that the models were not fit for event classification purposes but for reconstructing continuous time series of precipitation aggregates and low flow characteristics and the confusion matrix was intended as an additional proof of concept the weinviertel latewood chronology is capable of detecting meteorological drought and streamflow drought as long as the threshold is not set too low for only the most extreme events as the hit score seems too small for the 20th percentile t 5 years to draw reasonable conclusions and the median threshold also includes near normal conditions which does not allow deriving deductions about drought further analyses are restricted to the 33rd percentile threshold 4 3 2 reliability of the reconstructions in the past the newly introduced rrr fig 5 is wider than the classical pi when eps during the reconstruction period is lower than during the calibration period for the precipitation reconstructions it is on average 106 mm for the pi and 134 mm for rrr for the hydrological reconstructions it is 0 88 m3s 1 with and 0 62 m3s 1 without eps rescaling for the krems river 0 29 m3s 1 with and 0 21 m3s 1 without scaling factor for the zaya and 2 90 m3s 1 pi and 4 45 m3s 1 rrr for the leitha in years with a reconstruction period eps value comparable to the mean eps value during the calibration period resulting in a weight close to 1 this deviation is almost invisible when eps is lower inversely proportional to increasing noise the rrr becomes significantly wider making the reconstruction less reliable the year with the greatest absolute deviation between the classically calculated prediction interval and the rrr is 1795 for all four reconstructions 125 mm for precipitation 0 89 m3s 1 for krems 0 29 m3s 1 for zaya and 4 71 m3s 1 leitha which is also the year with the lowest eps value 0 64 of the chronology see also fig b 3 note that the negative part of the pi and rrr of the hydrological reconstructions is not shown in fig 5bcd as the flow cannot be below zero in reality but is still included in the calculations of the figures mentioned above dendrochronologists have developed a set of measures for assessing the signal strength of their chronologies e g cook and pederson 2011 but usually do not provide standard uncertainty measures for their reconstructions also used by related disciplines as climatology e g ipcc 2014 which impairs inter comparability of different reconstructions streamflow reconstructions published in the journal of hydrology over the last 10 years show a wide variety of ways dealing with uncertainty from omitting the topic harley et al 2017 margolis et al 2011 over different interpretations of the confidence interval according to e g weisberg 2005 agafonov et al 2016 coulthard et al 2016 derose et al 2015 ferrero et al 2015 to alternative methods like ensemble modelling sauchyn et al 2015 or the maximum entropy bootstrap cook et al 2013 earlier by meko et al 2001 and meko et al 2007 monte carlo simulations were used to produce confidence bands or sub periods of the reconstruction were defined to acknowledge the time dependent quality of the dendrohydrologic information meko et al 2001 by introducing the reconstruction reliability range rrr we contribute to this variety the advantage of this approach is that the changing confidence over time can be spotted at a glance when plotted with the reconstruction time series and that it is based on the two well known and widely accepted concepts of prediction intervals e g weisberg 2005 and eps wigley et al 1984 but from its first application presented here it is not clear whether the empirically chosen ratio 1 epst 1 epscal is the most suitable scaling factor or if it over underestimates the increase of uncertainty with decreasing eps other scaling factors as well as alternative approaches to address the issue of reliability of tree ring based reconstructions need to be further investigated 4 3 3 comparison with other reconstructions for putting the precipitation and minimum flow reconstructions into perspective they are compared to other reconstructions with regional and or methodological similarities fig 6 and table 6 in general the weinviertel reconstructions show good agreement 51 87 with the reconstructions from other sources 87 are reached for the zaya am7 reconstruction compared to holawe unpublished data who has analyzed data from southern lower austria in the vicinity of the leitha catchment taking only drought years into account black or colored bars in fig 6 agreement drops to 13 64 64 for zaya and cook et al 2015 based on the assumption that the 33 threshold should represent a 3 year return period the reconstructions detect fewer drought years than expected during the 395 year period with 132 expected drought years 88 precipitation droughts and 80 streamflow droughts for krems as well as only 36 droughts for zaya and 75 for leitha are reconstructed while the precipitation reconstruction is comparably close to the expectations given the fact that regression models tend to underestimate extremes the reason for the even fewer streamflow drought years could lie in the short calibration period for streamflow which represents a relatively dry phase in recent eastern austrian climate history auer et al 2014 see also fig b 2c the five years with the least reconstructed precipitation from april to august are 1976 and 1666 in accordance with all references 1842 1719 and 1887 the five years with the lowest reconstructed summer minimum flows for the krems river are 1615 preceding 1616 a well known european drought year büntgen et al 2011 1983 very dry year according to auer et al 2014 1645 1835 also in the list of driest years in central europe according to büntgen et al 2011 and 1720 the five years with the lowest summer minimum flows for the zaya are 1835 1842 1808 1719 and 1976 in accordance with all references 1976 is also one of the driest years in more recent european history according to büntgen et al 2011 albeit with a focus in north western europe the driest years according to the leitha summer minimum flow reconstruction are 1835 1719 1808 1811 and 1834 the phase with the longest and most frequent drought events according to the reconstructions of this study is around 1780 to 1840 with an interruption from 1813 to 1830 fig 6 which may be due to the volcanic eruption of tambora indonesia in 1815 causing a very cold 1816 and following years in central europe e g brönnimann and krämer 2016 in the 17th century the weinviertel reconstruction detected 14 meteorological drought years and also 14 hydrological drought years for the krems river three drought years for zaya as well as six for leitha most of these droughts are single year events the 17th century is entirely contained within the little ice age with the maunder minimum starting around 1645 auer et al 2014 when temperatures were significantly lower than today lower temperatures could be favorable for trees in eastern austria because they reduce drought stress due to less transpiration making the 17th century the period with the fewest drought years of the four reconstructed centuries büntgen et al 2011 list the years 1608 1616 1624 1636 1653 1681 1685 1697 as the driest years in central europe of this century 1616 1653 and 1681 were also dry in the weinviertel according to the reconstruction during the 18th century 26 reconstructed meteorological drought years as well as 26 krems 12 zaya and 28 leitha hydrological drought years occurred already by 1704 a dry phase also detected by brázdil et al 2013 began another event of sustained drought started in 1718 and from 1778 to 1813 multi year drought events as well as frequent single year droughts occurred in eastern austria at the end of the century and also lasting after 1800 a generally drier phase was also captured by other reconstructions strömmer 2003 1783 1811 strumia 1999 1760 1810 cook et al 2015 state persistently drier than average conditions over north central europe for 1779 1827 and in 1773 and from 1811 to 1813 the lake neusiedl a large endorheic steppe lake not far south east of the study area ran completely dry österreichisch ungarische gewässerkommission 1996 the 19th century is the driest of the four analyzed centuries very closely followed by the 18th according to the 27 drought years detected by the weinviertel precipitation reconstruction 26 krems 16 zaya and 27 leitha streamflow droughts are reconstructed in this period after a very long multi year event ending around 1840 single year events occurred during the 19th century the little ice age came to an end around 1860 auer et al 2014 since 1800 ad relative air humidity has been decreasing in austria since 1870 especially in the eastern part of the country auer et al 2014 the driest periods during the 19th century are the 1830s strumia 1999 also visible in the weinviertel reconstruction and the 1860s auer et al 2014 strumia 1999 which were not extremely dry in the weinviertel according to this study still lake neusiedl again fell dry for several years during this decade österreichisch ungarische gewässerkommission 1996 but not due to heavy droughts but because wet extremes filling up the lake again were missing during this time haslinger pers communication over the 20th century single year events were dominating their frequency increased from the 1970s on the weinviertel meteorological reconstruction detected 21 drought years and 14 krems and leitha resp five zaya hydrological drought years a dry phase reported by auer et al 2014 for eastern austria from 1970 to 1999 is represented by frequent single year events in the weinviertel with 1976 as the driest reconstructed year of the century the reconstructions of spring summer droughts april august and summer seven day minimum flows may october back to 1600 are not very different as they all use the weinviertel latewood chronology of the analyzed period back to 1600 the 19th century is the driest one closely followed by the 18th century sharing the overall driest period from 1775 to 1813 as a summary it appears that current low flow and drought events fall within the range of historical events indicating that recent drought events are not unusual keeping in mind that the error term in regression causes reconstructed values to be compressed toward the calibration period mean meko et al 2001 reconstructed highs and lows are less dramatic than those of the gauged record and therefore also tend to underestimate the severity of historical drought events for the weinviertel reconstructions this is reflected by the fewer than expected reconstructed events compared to the more than expected events in the calibration period section 4 3 1 in all the four analysed centuries for a return period t 3 years 33 drought years in 100 years could be expected but on average only 22 events per century are detected by the reconstructions resulting in an actual return period of t 4 5 years between 1600 and 1750 fewer droughts than today are indicated but as they seem to better relate to droughts reported by other references one can speculate on more widespread drought events periods with more frequent and more extreme events can be observed e g within 1780 1840 with 1807 1811 being the longest period of consecutive atmospheric drought years and 1832 1839 as the longest period of hydrological drought years with low flow discharges 10 20 below the current conditions such information is valuable for austrian water management to put current and projected future low flows e g laaha et al 2016 into context the reconstructed extreme events are in line with other historical sources giving credence to the estimates although 12 to 24 of the reconstructed dry years do not agree with other reconstructions surrounding the study area which may indicate regional differences drought can be a spatially very heterogeneous phenomenon as demonstrated for example by cook et al 2015 this emphasizes the importance of provenance verified regional tree ring chronologies for reconstructing meteorological and hydrological droughts at this spatial scale 5 conclusions the goals of this first dendrohydrological investigation focusing on droughts and low flows in central europe were 1 to reconstruct regional meteorological spring and summer drought to 2 augment the summer low flow am7 records of several gauges in the weinviertel and 3 to investigate whether those chronologies are also representative for rivers outside the actual growing region of the trees additionally 4 we presented the rrr as a new idea of estimating the reliability of tree ring reconstructions the weinviertel latewood chronology is capable of detecting meteorological and streamflow drought even outside the actual growing region of the trees as long as the threshold is not set too low for only the most extreme events and with the caveat that the calibration periods for streamflow reconstructions are quite short and therefore correlations with am7 may be temporally instable the link between tree rings and low flows in the study area needs to be explored in more detail before the method can be transferred to other regions but it was shown that the method of augmenting hydrological time series is working and can be a useful source of information for austrian hydrologists in the future bearing in mind the uncertainties coming along with proxies methodologically applying other lags and leads to linear regression analysis or other methods of calculating tree ring chronologies e g not using arithmetic means but quantiles are options for further research further testing the newly introduced rrr with additional tree ring chronologies from other regions and developing alternative approaches of depicting the reconstruction performance of dendrochronological data varying with time due to changing sample and site replication may eventually pave the way to an established measure standardly used with tree ring reconstructions by the

6256,frequent occurrence of flood and ice disasters caused by river channel sedimentation in the upper yellow river of china has seriously threatened the lives and property of downstream residents which has become the most challenging issues in harnessing the yellow river in this paper we aim at optimizing water sediment regulation that considers two cascade reservoirs longyangxia and liujiaxia as the regulatory bodies using one multi objective model sediment transport and hydropower generation and two single objective models sediment transport only and hydropower generation only we propose an innovative approach fss mopso that hybrids the feasible search space fss with the multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso algorithm to search the optimal solutions for the multi objective joint operation of cascade reservoirs we analyze the transformation rules of water sediment regulation among five objectives hydropower generation sediment transport water supply flood control and ice control under various optimization schemes the results indicate that the conflict between the hydropower generation objective and the sediment transport objective is prominent an extreme case indicates that an increase in hydropower output by 2 31 billion kw h 17 6 increase would greatly reduce the amount of sediment transport 73 5 decrease while only makes little effects on the other three objectives the results demonstrate that the optimal water sediment regulation not only can ensure to meet water demands in the future 2030 but can provide an important guideline to safely operate cascade reservoirs during ice and flood periods the research findings contribute to the identification of the relationship among objectives and strategy recommendations on water sediment

activities and climate change have notable effects on river systems kiss and blanka 2012 tripathi et al 2006 as a result of land use changes and other anthropogenic influences significant quantities of soil have eroded from landscapes with subsequent transport into rivers reservoirs or lakes alighalehbabakhani et al 2016 which has caused serious river siltation river sedimentation has resulted in the emergence of floods and ice disasters which could seriously affect residents lives property and economic development in basins especially in the yellow river basin of china li et al 2017 wang et al 2010 fan et al 2017 wang et al 2010 with the goal to maintain the health of the yellow river the joint reservoir operation technology has been used to establish a harmonious water sediment relationship under the water sediment regulation scheme for creating artificial flood peaks to scour river channels yang et al 2017 the water sediment regulation scheme wsrs has been implemented using the xiaolangdi reservoir to manage the yellow river since 2002 leading to two main benefits the main river channel has been fully scoured in the lower reaches and the reduction in riverbed elevation has slowed down obviously since 2005 miao et al 2016 wang et al 2017a b under this background there is a need to explore multi objective transformation rules of water sediment regulation for mitigating disasters and improving the benefits of water conservancy facilities especially in the upper yellow river reservoir operation is a complex task that involves many decision variables multiple conflicting objectives as well as considerable risk and uncertainty chang et al 2010 guo et al 2004 wang et al 2011 reservoirs operation problems are mostly formulated as multi objective ones with many conflicting objectives and constraints when tackling multi objective problems evolutionary algorithms eas are commonly used to generate non dominated solutions for obtaining the optima from a population of pareto optimal solutions rather than from a single solution these features make eas attractive for addressing complex water resources problems the results produced by eas are useful for decision makers to ensure equitable distribution of resources among competing users nowadays many multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas have been developed to solve various water resources problems for instance the particle swarm optimization pso bai et al 2015 delgarm et al 2016 fu et al 2018 hojjati et al 2018 jia et al 2018 taormina chau 2015 ostadrahimi et al 2012 and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii azadeh et al 2017 chang et al 2016 lei et al 2018 sadatsakkak et al 2015 tsai et al 2015 uen et al 2018 zhou et al 2018a b 2019 have been used to optimize multi objective reservoir operation existing multi objective algorithms however have been criticized for lacking efficient and robust generic methods to handle constraints low computational efficiency and easily falling into local optima although various techniques were applied to improving multi objective evolution efficiency the study of the relationship among objectives still suffers from a lack of in depth discussions to clarify the types of relationship for instance fierce competition or little connection between each other improving the systematic analysis of multi objective relationship is needed to guide the development of reservoir operation plans sediment transport is one of the most important processes responsible for shaping the earth s surface elias 2013 houssais et al 2015 song et al 2018 wang et al 2016 riverine sediment is becoming a worldwide concern because of its great importance in engineering fields dai and lu 2014 gomez 2018 dam and reservoir construction since the 1950s has caused an average of 44 decline in sediment supply at 33 major deltas in the world kemp et al 2016 on the other hand due to long term coal based electricity generation china s power industry has produced not only heavy burdens on provincial coal supplies but has also caused serious environmental deterioration zhao et al 2014 being one of the most effective and mature forms of clean and renewable energy hydropower has attracted more and more attention since last decades bilgili et al 2018 ifaei et al 2018 tarroja et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 however sediment transport and hydropower generation constitutes a fuzzy relationship which will lead to a series of problems like flood disasters if the relationship cannot be recognized in this study cascade reservoirs longyangxia and liujiaxia located in the upper yellow river basin of china forms the study case and various optimization models are established upon five important objectives to better manage the cascade reservoirs a multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm equipped with the feasible search space technology is developed to effectively and efficiently obtain the optimal reservoir operation this study would identify the relationship between various objectives and suggest reservoir operation strategies for sediment reduction flood control and ice control fig 1 the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly introduces the study area and cascade reservoirs section 3 establishes a multi objective operation model involving three parts objectives based on the functions of cascade reservoirs related constraints and the optimization methods section 4 presents and discusses the optimal results associated with different scenarios the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 research area and data the yellow river known as the mother river in china is the fifth longest river in the world it is also known as a river with the most massive sediment residing in its middle reach that flows through the loess plateau the desert wide valley sections in the upper yellow river across the tengger desert hedong sandy ulanbuh desert and kubuqi desert extend 1080 km from the xiheyan county of the ningxia to the tuoketuo county of the inner mongolia the desert wide valley sections have undergone the most dramatic evolution of the river channel and the most complicated interactions between water and sediment longyangxia and liujiaxia reservoirs fig 2 have great capacities of regulation and storage and play an important role in water supply irrigation flood control ice control and river sediment control for the upper yellow river the values of the characteristic parameters for the cascade reservoirs are given in table 1 in general the operations of water sediment regulation can only be carried out in wet years so that there is enough water to ensure a smooth implementation of water sediment regulation the reservoir operation in 2010 was selected as a study case because reservoir water levels were high in this wet year bai et al 2015 reservoir inflow mainly includes the inflows from the longyangxia reservoir the section of longyangxia liujiaxia and the section of the liujiaxia lanzhou table 2 the flood season lasts from july to october whereas the ice season lasts from november to march the monthly flow limit in the ice season is shown in table 3 to meet the balance of water supply and demand in the yellow river basin a certain flow in the lanzhou section must be guaranteed therefore this study takes the lanzhou station as the control station of water resources in the context of water supply and demand for the whole yellow river basin meanwhile to investigate the effect of water supply on the upper yellow river under different scenarios the water demands of 2010 and 2030 are selected to measure water supply efficiency respectively du et al 2013 the water supply efficiency for 2010 and the future 2030 are assessed based on the water distribution plan in 1987 and the comprehensive planning of the yellow river basin 2012 2030 respectively xue 2011 the monthly water demand in 2010 and 2030 are shown in table 4 the xiaheyan toudaoguai section is the key sediment control section in the upper yellow river therefore sediment transport effects in this section are identified regulation period and flow rate are two key factors in water sediment regulation in this study the flow rates of the water sediment regulation are set as 2240 m3 s and 2580 m3 s respectively while the duration of the water sediment regulation is set to be 30 days ha et al 2017 based on historical flood data the end of flood season early april is selected as the best period for water and sediment transport in this study 3 multi objectives optimization model with rapid economic development the role of reservoirs has become substantially important to meet energy and water requirements zhou and guo 2013 zhou et al 2019 serving as regulation hubs in the upper yellow river longyangxia and liujiaxia cascade reservoirs have undertaken comprehensive resource utilization tasks it not only needs to meet the water demands of different sectors and hydropower generation but also needs to carry out the task of sediment transport in the yellow river moreover it requires to ensure the safety of lives and property of downstream residents during flood and ice seasons therefore five objectives including requirements for hydropower generation sediment transport water supply flood control and ice control are considered as regulation objectives for longyangxia and liujiaxia cascade reservoirs 3 1 objective functions 3 1 1 objective 1 hydropower generation hydropower generation is one of the most important objectives in this study hydropower outputs associated with hydropower stations built in the upper yellow river basin are calculated as follows 1 max f 1 max i 1 m t 1 t n i t δ t 2 n i t k i q e i t

time t respectively 3 1 2 objective 2 sediment transport sediment transport is another important objective in this study the xiaheyan toudaoguai river reach section is the key section with hydrological stations for managing the sediment transport of the desert wide valley reach therefore the sediment transport maximum in this section is used as the measure of the effect of sediment transport on the upper yellow river presented as follows 3 max f 2 max n 1 nu t 1 t ω n t δ t 4 ω n t k q s a n t s b n t where f2 is the total amount of sediment transport in a given period nu is the

et al 2008 3 1 3 objective 3 water supply to meet water demands a certain flow in the lanzhou section must be guaranteed therefore the water supply objective can be expressed by water shortage minimum shown as follows 5 min f 3 min t 1 t α t q w t q s t δ t 6 α t 0 q w t q s t 1 q w t q s t 7 q s t q o l j x t q o l l t where f3 is the total amount of water shortage in a given period α t is the

reservoir to the lanzhou section at time t which refers to the measured data of the yrcc and δ t is the time interval 3 1 4 objective 4 ice control the main channel of the ningxia inner mongolia reaches would freeze when the temperature dips below freezing during the end of november and the next coming march bai et al 2015 therefore the ice control objective is to control the water level minimum of the liujiaxia reservoir at the beginning of the ice season early november under the premise of meeting the flow requirements of ice control 8 min f 4 min z l j x n o v z max l j x n o v 9

outflow of the liujiaxia reservoir at time t during the ice season q o max l j x is the maximum outflow of the liujiaxia reservoir at time t during the ice season to ensure ice control safety which is a known parameter q o max l j x is given by the ice flood control preparedness ifcp of the yrcc to ensure ice control safety of the whole ningxia inner mongolia reaches 3 1 5 objective 5 flood control in the yellow river basin flood disasters occur frequently each year in order to meet the water demand for flood control the flood control objective can be described to control the water level minimum

make efficient water resources management for cascade reservoirs the explored multi objective water resources management model for the upper yellow river basin involves inherent complex and high dimensional variables with a large number of constraints on cascade reservoir operation many optimization algorithms have been applied to reservoir operation ahmad et al 2014 labadie 2004 wurbs 1993 yeh 1985 among them eas like the multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso and the non dominated genetic algorithm nsga ii are good prospective tools to deal with nonlinear and multi objective problems and they become popular in reservoir operation owing to their ability to find optimal solutions within reasonable computation time as known every method has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the types of problems involved in water resources especially in reservoir operation ahmad et al 2014 the particle swarm optimization pso proposed by eberhart and kennedy 1995 is one of the swarm intelligent methods the pso has been applied in many types of optimization problems zhang et al 2014 whereas many researchers have developed various mopso for solving multi purpose reservoir operation problems reddy nagesh kumar 2007 ostadrahimi et al 2012 farshad et al 2017 zain et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 baltar and fontane 2008 proposed an mopso to solve a multi purpose reservoir operation and indicated that the mopso could make obtain better results as compared to the nsga ii and the pareto archived evolution strategy paes in this study we use the pso to solve the single objective model while using the mopso to solve the multi objective model 3 3 1 optimization procedure for the feasible search space to effectively solve the high dimensional multi objective cascade reservoirs operation problem we first develop strategies for dimensionality reduction and constraint transformation to obtain a feasible search space fss the core idea is to speed up solution convergence through reducing the search space which can be achieved by effectively handling constraints a detailed description of the methods adopted in this study is shown as follows constraints can be divided into two categories 1 transformable constraints such as water level and flow constraints where variables involved can be transformed directly into constraints and 2 non transformable constraints such as outputs variables involved are mostly associated with implicit functions and cannot be directly transformed into constraints bai et al 2017 for a non transformable constraint since the range of its relevant variable cannot be directly converted into constraints it will be controlled in the algorithm by identifying whether the decision variable satisfies the non transformable constraint for transformable constraints a two stage simulation method is used to eliminate infeasible solutions step by step fig 3 implementation steps are addressed as follows step 1 set i t 1 the water levels of the reservoir at initial and final stages are set as z0 0 and z1 t respectively step 2 the first stage starts with z0 0 and the middle stage is controlled by the transport restriction the water level range at the end of the first stage is obtained and denoted as z 0 i z min 0 i z max 0 i step 3 taking z1 i 1 as the final water level at the second stage this period is controlled according to the transport constraint where the initial water level that changes the water level range at the second stage is obtained from back pushing that is to say the change in the water level range at the end of the first stage is recorded as z1 i z1 m in i z1 m ax i step 4 taking the intersection of z0 i and z1 i as the water level range at the end of the ith stage z m in i z m ax i the water level at the end of the ith stage is randomly generated and recorded as z i then let i i 1 z1 i z i step 5 terminate the judgment if i 0 go to step 2 otherwise go to step 6 step 6 output the result 3 3 2 implementation procedure of the fss mopso to increase computation efficiency an improved multi objective algorithm fss mopso that fuses the feasible search space into the mopso is proposed in this study the procedure is described as follows step 1 set the maximum number of iterations t the size of the population n and the number of dimensions m the water level during the scheduled period serves as the decision variable step 2 based on the known initial and final water levels of each reservoir the initial sequence z 1 z 2 z i can be randomly assigned within the refined fss step 3 initialize the population x j j 1 n and the speed ve l j 0 j 1 n for each particle within the fss then evaluate each particle based on eqs 1 and 3 and store non dominated solutions in the archived repository rep step 4 generate a hypercube step 5 initialize the memory of each particle by storing initial x j positions as the best positions found bpf so far b pf j is set as follow b pf j x j step 6 compute the speed of each particle shown below coello et al 2004 17 ve l j w v e l j r 1 b pf j x j r 2 b pf j x j where w is the inertia weight r 1 and r 2 are random numbers falling within the interval of 0 1 step 7 maintain the particles within the search boundaries coello et al 2004 when the value of a decision variable goes beyond its boundaries then carry out two actions 1 the decision variable takes the value of its corresponding boundary either the lower or the upper bound and 2 its velocity is multiplied by 1 so that the search moves toward the opposite direction step 8 evaluate each particle based on eqs 1 and 3 step 9 apply mutation to each particle coello et al 2004 step 10 update the rep and the hypercube by inserting non dominated solutions into the repository and eliminating dominated solutions from the repository step 11 update each particle memory by replacing the previous best position with the current best position found by each particle step 12 if the maximum iteration is achieved terminate and output multi objective optimization results for cascade reservoirs e g water level flow hydropower output otherwise repeat step 6 4 results and discussion 4 1 model design in this study two single objective models configured by the pso and one multi objective model configured by the fss mopso are established to analyze the transformation rules of water sediment regulation in the upper yellow river then the transformation rules of water sediment regulation for cascade reservoirs are clarified based on three designed schemes shown as follows 4 1 1 scheme 1 hydropower generation maximization model scheme 1 assume that hydropower generation is the only optimization objective in the optimal operation which does not consider the maximization of sediment transport the other three objectives i e water supply flood control and ice control are converted into constraints however aiming at comparing sediment transport results among different schemes the sediment transport must be calculated by eqs 3 and 4 after obtaining the single objective optimization results associated with hydropower generation maximization and the other three objectives are converted into water level and outflow constraints as shown in eqs 7 13 and 14 the pso is used to solve this model with data collected in 2010 4 1 2 scheme 2 sediment transport maximization model scheme 2 assume that sediment transport is the only optimization objective in the optimal operation which does not consider the maximization of hydropower generation the other three objectives i e water supply flood control and ice control are converted into constraints similarly aiming at comparing hydropower generation results among different schemes the hydropower generation objective is converted into constraint as shown in eq 16 and the other three objectives are converted into water level and outflow constraints same as the above the pso is also used to solve this model with data collected in 2010 4 1 3 scheme 3 joint operation model for maximizing hydropower generation and sediment transport scheme 3 assume that hydropower generation and sediment transport are the main objectives in flow regulation the other three objectives i e water supply flood control and ice control are converted into water level and outflow constraints same as the above it means that this model needs to consider both objectives for obtaining a set of compromised solutions the fss mopso is proposed to solve the model with data collected in 2010 for the three schemes the value of the flow rates of the water sediment regulation is set as 2580 m3 s bai et al 2016 the water level is selected as the decision variable the parameters of the pso and the fss mopso algorithm are shown in table 5 4 2 results and discussion of the single objective optimization model the two maximization models associated with sediment transport and hydropower generation respectively are solved by the pso the optimal results are shown in tables 6 and 7 respectively in order to visually analyze the variations in water level and power output monthly water level and monthly hydropower output obtained from the hydropower generation and sediment transport optimization models for longyangxia and liujiaxia cascade reservoirs are shown in figs 4 7 respectively as shown in figs 4 7 the year initial and year end water levels of the longyangxia and the liujiaxia are the same so that the total amount of water consumption for both optimization models are the same compared to that of the hydropower generation maximization model the hydropower output obtained from the sediment transport maximization model is reduced by 17 6 which causes a loss of 525 million rmb in power generation benefits the reason could be that the sediment transport maximization model generated a large flow to flush the river in april which resulted in a large amount of abandoned water meanwhile the hydropower head of the longyangxia is in a lower position during the late period resulting in greater power loss the water supply amounts of the lanzhou section obtained from the hydropower generation and sediment transport maximization models schemes are 37 3 billion m3 and 36 3 billion m3 respectively which do not show much difference it can be because that the two different schemes change the flow process only without consuming water the total water supply of the lanzhou section will not make much difference under the premise of the same amount of outflow in the longyangxia liujiaxia section which indicates hydropower generation and sediment transport will not cause conflicts in water supply the water levels of the liujiaxia reservoir in early november early july are 1725 9 m 1721 7 m and 1724 7 m 1725 8 m under the schemes of sediment transport maximization and hydropower generation maximization respectively that means the water levels of the liujiaxia reservoir in early july under both schemes are less than the water level for flood control 1726 m meanwhile the water level of the sediment transport maximization model is lower than that of the hydropower generation maximization model which means the scheme for sediment transport maximization has a larger flood storage capacity and can be more conducive to flood control the reason accounting for the phenomenon is that the objectives of flood control and ice control are influenced by the subsequent effects of large flow for channel scouring in april in other words the closer the regulation timing such as july to april is the more significant the impact of flow on the objective is in addition to the greater negative impact on hydropower generation the sediment transport maximization model has no significant impacts on water supply and flood control but has a positive impact on flood control among them the effect of sediment transport is related to sediment transport flow the sediment transport of each section is calculated by eqs 3 and 4 and the results are shown in table 8 as shown in table 8 the total amount of sediment transport reaches 59 74 million tons for the sediment transport maximization model although the river sections qingtongxia shizuishan bayangaole sanhehukou and sanhehukou toudaoguai shows micro scouring situations for the hydropower generation maximization model in contrast the sediment transport effect for the hydropower generation maximization model is very small with a total amount of sediment transport reaching 15 83 million tons only the effect of sediment transport is greatly reduced by the hydropower generation maximization model for example the amount of sediment transport in the sanhehukou toudaoguai section is 4 12 million tons which decreases 18 05 million tons or 81 as compared to that 22 17 million tons of the sediment transport maximization model the hydropower generation maximization scheme represents the objective of maximizing hydropower generation efficiency for cascade reservoirs whereas the sediment transport maximization scheme produces the largest sediment transport effect on the upper yellow river if we want to further increase the amount of sediment transport in river sections based on the hydropower generation maximization scheme the balance between hydropower generation and sediment transport will inevitably be broken which means longyangxia and liujiaxia cascade reservoirs will abandon more water and therefore reduce hydropower outputs how to find a balance between the two objectives to increase the amount of sediment transport without significantly increasing the amount of abandoned water and reducing hydropower output will be analyzed in section 4 3 4 3 results and discussion of the multi objective optimization model the fss mopso is used to solve the multi objective optimization model the pareto front curve of hydropower generation and sediment transport is shown in fig 8 hydropower generation and sediment transport present a nonlinear contradiction i e an increase in hydropower output will inevitably lead to a decrease in the amount of sediment transport according to the characteristics of the pareto optimal solutions it can be observed that any point lying on the pareto front curve serves as an optimal solution to the multi objective problem additionally in order to verify the rationality of the multi objective optimal solution the pareto front curve is combined with the solutions associated with the two single objective optimization models and the relationship between single and multi objective optimization models is compared that is to say the distance between a multi objective extremum solution and the optimal solution of the single objective optimization model would determine whether the proximity is reasonable results show that the optimal solutions associated with the two single objective optimization models just fall on the endpoints of the pareto front curve confirming that the results of the three models are reasonable fig 8 to further analyze the difference between the multi objective joint operation and the single objective operation a joint operation scheme the black point in fig 8 is selected from the pareto front curve according to the objective weight 1 1 as shown in table 9 both longyangxia and liujiaxia reservoirs have abandoned water 75 m3 s and 1146 m3 s respectively during the operation of water sediment regulation compared with the sediment transport maximization model table 6 the flows of abandoned water are reduced by 1500 m3 s and 430 m3 s for longyagxia and liujiaxia reservoirs respectively the difference between the joint operation scheme and the sediment transport maximization model is that the former not only can make full use of the annually adjusted storage capacity of the liujiaxia reservoir but also can replenish water during water sediment regulation by this way the longyangxia reservoir can prevent from being the only hub for sediment scouring and large flow discharging which may cause a large amount of abandoned water and affect the operation of the hydropower station seriously furthermore the results associated with the five objectives of the three optimization models are analyzed table 10 in order to eliminate the impact of different dimensionality of the five objectives on the regulation analysis normalization of objective values is conducted as shown in table 11 meanwhile the normalized values of objectives for each scheme is plotted in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 the objectives of hydropower generation and sediment transport show significant differences under different schemes however the objectives of ice control flood control and water supply show less differences the values of hydropower generation and sediment transport under different schemes the sediment transport maximization scheme the hydropower generation maximization scheme and the joint operation scheme are 0 851 1 000 0 959 hydropower generation and 1 000 0 265 0 645 sediment transport respectively taking the two single objective schemes as an example when the hydropower output increases from 13 145 billion kw h to 15 455 billion kw h the amount of the corresponding sediment transport decreases from 0 5974 million tons to 0 1583 million tons this can be described as an increase in hydropower output by 2 31 billion kw h 17 6 increase would greatly reduce the amount of sediment transport 73 5 decrease at the same time it also shows that the appropriate reduction of hydropower output can obtain a larger benefit of sediment transport water supply flood control and ice control can meet their requirements and overall the values of these three objectives do not change significantly it means sediment transport has little effect on these three objectives 4 4 multi objective transformation under different scenarios in order to further analyze the above mentioned multi objective transformation rules and investigate the changes of multi objectives associated with water and sediment over the reaches of the upper yellow river in the future we choose 2030 as the operation year therefore this study designs four scenarios according to the initial water level of the longyangxia and the flow for sediment regulation with respect to 2010 and 2030 as shown in table 12 the four scenarios are optimized using the multi objective model that considers the objectives of hydropower generation and sediment transport the fss mopso is used to solve these four multi objective models in order to facilitate the comparative analysis of the four scenarios the joint operation scheme is selected form the pareto front curve according to the objective weight 1 1 the values of objective functions under each scenario are shown in figs 10 and 11 fig 10 reveals several findings with an increase in sediment regulation flow the loss of hydropower output for the longyangxia liujiaxia cascade reservoirs becomes 400 million kw h but the amount of water supply from the liujiaxia reservoir increases such that the reservoir has a lower water level before the flood season which is more conducive to flood control for the liujiaxia reservoir besides the water supply in the lanzhou section is increased by 700 million m3 which is more conducive to the balance between water supply and demand in yellow river basin under the premise of satisfying water supply requirements the amount of sediment transport increases from 25 million tons to 39 million tons in the desert wide valley section which means the effect of water sediment regulation is significantly enhanced the average loss of power generation is 1 kw h which can increase 0 039 ton of sediment transport therefore in 2010 further increase in water sediment regulation flow can result in a smaller hydropower loss in exchange for a larger sediment transport effect this can be conducive not only to maintaining the relative balance of river channel erosion and siltation in the reaches of the upper yellow river but also to the realization of objectives with respect to water supply flood control and sediment transport fig 11 illustrates that 1 considering the water demand of 2030 hydropower output will be increased by 100 million kw h when sediment regulation flow is reduced scenario 3 however the water level of the liujiaxia before the flood season will be increased by 1 m and the amount of sediment transport will be decreased by 11 million tons while the amount of water supply will be decreased by 800 million tons and the ice control will be the same in scenario 3 and scenario 4 2 similar to the analysis for fig 10 with an increase in the comprehensive water demand over the upper yellow river basin an appropriate increase in sediment regulation flow will result in a smaller loss of hydropower generation in exchange for greater sediment transport benefits meanwhile increasing sediment regulation flow also increases the water supply of the lanzhou section which will not cause flood disasters in the downstream reaches of the liujiaxia reservoir above all as the comprehensive water demand increases increasing the sediment regulation flow to control water and sediment will result in the loss of hydropower generation for example the loss in 2010 under scenario 2 is 400 million kw h compared to 2010 under scenario 1 and the loss in 2030 under scenario 4 is 100 million kw h compared to 2030 under scenario 3 however the loss of hydropower output will increase the water supply by 700 and 800 million tons for scenario 2 and scenario 4 respectively which will be more conducive to ensuring water supply meets comprehensive water requirements therefore with an increase of the comprehensive water demand in the future the regulation of water and sediment with appropriately large flow can ensure the dam safety in the upper reaches of the yellow river during the flood season which will not aggravate the contradiction between water supply and demand 5 conclusion maintaining a healthy yellow river through establishing a harmonious water sediment relationship is a challenging and crucial task in this study we optimize multi objective water sediment regulation for reducing disasters and improving benefits of water conservancy facilities for two cascade reservoirs regulatory bodies the multi objective cascade reservoir operation model involves inherent complex and high dimensional variables with a large amounts of constraints in this study we establish three optimization models i e the sediment transport maximization model the hydropower generation maximization model and the joint optimal operation model for deriving transformation rules of water sediment regulation for the upper yellow river the pso and the fss mospo are proposed to cope with the conflicts between five objectives including sediment transport flood control ice control hydropower generation and water supply the main findings are drawn as follows 1 the pareto front curve of hydropower generation and sediment transport fig 8 obtained from the fss mospo indicates a nonlinear contradiction between these two objectives where an increase in hydropower output will inevitably result in a decrease in sediment transport the quantitative transformation rule of these two objectives reveals an average loss of 1 kw h in power generation would increase 0 039 ton of sediment transport in the case of year 2010 in other words it s worthwhile exchanging a small amount loss of power generation for a larger sediment transport volume 2 when sediment transport is maximized water requirements associated with the objectives of water supply flood control and ice control can also be fulfilled nevertheless the changes in the outcomes of the three objectives are not obvious which discloses sediment transport is related to the three objectives while making little effects on them 3 expecting an increase of water demand in the future 2030 the derived water sediment regulation using large flows can ensure the dam safety in the upper reaches of the yellow river during the flood season however competition in water resources between power generation and sediment transport has been significantly mitigated as compared to scenario 2010 this provides an efficient and

6256,frequent occurrence of flood and ice disasters caused by river channel sedimentation in the upper yellow river of china has seriously threatened the lives and property of downstream residents which has become the most challenging issues in harnessing the yellow river in this paper we aim at optimizing water sediment regulation that considers two cascade reservoirs longyangxia and liujiaxia as the regulatory bodies using one multi objective model sediment transport and hydropower generation and two single objective models sediment transport only and hydropower generation only we propose an innovative approach fss mopso that hybrids the feasible search space fss with the multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso algorithm to search the optimal solutions for the multi objective joint operation of cascade reservoirs we analyze the transformation rules of water sediment regulation among five objectives hydropower generation sediment transport water supply flood control and ice control under various optimization schemes the results indicate that the conflict between the hydropower generation objective and the sediment transport objective is prominent an extreme case indicates that an increase in hydropower output by 2 31 billion kw h 17 6 increase would greatly reduce the amount of sediment transport 73 5 decrease while only makes little effects on the other three objectives the results demonstrate that the optimal water sediment regulation not only can ensure to meet water demands in the future 2030 but can provide an important guideline to safely operate cascade reservoirs during ice and flood periods the research findings contribute to the identification of the relationship among objectives and strategy recommendations on water sediment

activities and climate change have notable effects on river systems kiss and blanka 2012 tripathi et al 2006 as a result of land use changes and other anthropogenic influences significant quantities of soil have eroded from landscapes with subsequent transport into rivers reservoirs or lakes alighalehbabakhani et al 2016 which has caused serious river siltation river sedimentation has resulted in the emergence of floods and ice disasters which could seriously affect residents lives property and economic development in basins especially in the yellow river basin of china li et al 2017 wang et al 2010 fan et al 2017 wang et al 2010 with the goal to maintain the health of the yellow river the joint reservoir operation technology has been used to establish a harmonious water sediment relationship under the water sediment regulation scheme for creating artificial flood peaks to scour river channels yang et al 2017 the water sediment regulation scheme wsrs has been implemented using the xiaolangdi reservoir to manage the yellow river since 2002 leading to two main benefits the main river channel has been fully scoured in the lower reaches and the reduction in riverbed elevation has slowed down obviously since 2005 miao et al 2016 wang et al 2017a b under this background there is a need to explore multi objective transformation rules of water sediment regulation for mitigating disasters and improving the benefits of water conservancy facilities especially in the upper yellow river reservoir operation is a complex task that involves many decision variables multiple conflicting objectives as well as considerable risk and uncertainty chang et al 2010 guo et al 2004 wang et al 2011 reservoirs operation problems are mostly formulated as multi objective ones with many conflicting objectives and constraints when tackling multi objective problems evolutionary algorithms eas are commonly used to generate non dominated solutions for obtaining the optima from a population of pareto optimal solutions rather than from a single solution these features make eas attractive for addressing complex water resources problems the results produced by eas are useful for decision makers to ensure equitable distribution of resources among competing users nowadays many multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas have been developed to solve various water resources problems for instance the particle swarm optimization pso bai et al 2015 delgarm et al 2016 fu et al 2018 hojjati et al 2018 jia et al 2018 taormina chau 2015 ostadrahimi et al 2012 and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii azadeh et al 2017 chang et al 2016 lei et al 2018 sadatsakkak et al 2015 tsai et al 2015 uen et al 2018 zhou et al 2018a b 2019 have been used to optimize multi objective reservoir operation existing multi objective algorithms however have been criticized for lacking efficient and robust generic methods to handle constraints low computational efficiency and easily falling into local optima although various techniques were applied to improving multi objective evolution efficiency the study of the relationship among objectives still suffers from a lack of in depth discussions to clarify the types of relationship for instance fierce competition or little connection between each other improving the systematic analysis of multi objective relationship is needed to guide the development of reservoir operation plans sediment transport is one of the most important processes responsible for shaping the earth s surface elias 2013 houssais et al 2015 song et al 2018 wang et al 2016 riverine sediment is becoming a worldwide concern because of its great importance in engineering fields dai and lu 2014 gomez 2018 dam and reservoir construction since the 1950s has caused an average of 44 decline in sediment supply at 33 major deltas in the world kemp et al 2016 on the other hand due to long term coal based electricity generation china s power industry has produced not only heavy burdens on provincial coal supplies but has also caused serious environmental deterioration zhao et al 2014 being one of the most effective and mature forms of clean and renewable energy hydropower has attracted more and more attention since last decades bilgili et al 2018 ifaei et al 2018 tarroja et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 however sediment transport and hydropower generation constitutes a fuzzy relationship which will lead to a series of problems like flood disasters if the relationship cannot be recognized in this study cascade reservoirs longyangxia and liujiaxia located in the upper yellow river basin of china forms the study case and various optimization models are established upon five important objectives to better manage the cascade reservoirs a multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm equipped with the feasible search space technology is developed to effectively and efficiently obtain the optimal reservoir operation this study would identify the relationship between various objectives and suggest reservoir operation strategies for sediment reduction flood control and ice control fig 1 the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly introduces the study area and cascade reservoirs section 3 establishes a multi objective operation model involving three parts objectives based on the functions of cascade reservoirs related constraints and the optimization methods section 4 presents and discusses the optimal results associated with different scenarios the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 research area and data the yellow river known as the mother river in china is the fifth longest river in the world it is also known as a river with the most massive sediment residing in its middle reach that flows through the loess plateau the desert wide valley sections in the upper yellow river across the tengger desert hedong sandy ulanbuh desert and kubuqi desert extend 1080 km from the xiheyan county of the ningxia to the tuoketuo county of the inner mongolia the desert wide valley sections have undergone the most dramatic evolution of the river channel and the most complicated interactions between water and sediment longyangxia and liujiaxia reservoirs fig 2 have great capacities of regulation and storage and play an important role in water supply irrigation flood control ice control and river sediment control for the upper yellow river the values of the characteristic parameters for the cascade reservoirs are given in table 1 in general the operations of water sediment regulation can only be carried out in wet years so that there is enough water to ensure a smooth implementation of water sediment regulation the reservoir operation in 2010 was selected as a study case because reservoir water levels were high in this wet year bai et al 2015 reservoir inflow mainly includes the inflows from the longyangxia reservoir the section of longyangxia liujiaxia and the section of the liujiaxia lanzhou table 2 the flood season lasts from july to october whereas the ice season lasts from november to march the monthly flow limit in the ice season is shown in table 3 to meet the balance of water supply and demand in the yellow river basin a certain flow in the lanzhou section must be guaranteed therefore this study takes the lanzhou station as the control station of water resources in the context of water supply and demand for the whole yellow river basin meanwhile to investigate the effect of water supply on the upper yellow river under different scenarios the water demands of 2010 and 2030 are selected to measure water supply efficiency respectively du et al 2013 the water supply efficiency for 2010 and the future 2030 are assessed based on the water distribution plan in 1987 and the comprehensive planning of the yellow river basin 2012 2030 respectively xue 2011 the monthly water demand in 2010 and 2030 are shown in table 4 the xiaheyan toudaoguai section is the key sediment control section in the upper yellow river therefore sediment transport effects in this section are identified regulation period and flow rate are two key factors in water sediment regulation in this study the flow rates of the water sediment regulation are set as 2240 m3 s and 2580 m3 s respectively while the duration of the water sediment regulation is set to be 30 days ha et al 2017 based on historical flood data the end of flood season early april is selected as the best period for water and sediment transport in this study 3 multi objectives optimization model with rapid economic development the role of reservoirs has become substantially important to meet energy and water requirements zhou and guo 2013 zhou et al 2019 serving as regulation hubs in the upper yellow river longyangxia and liujiaxia cascade reservoirs have undertaken comprehensive resource utilization tasks it not only needs to meet the water demands of different sectors and hydropower generation but also needs to carry out the task of sediment transport in the yellow river moreover it requires to ensure the safety of lives and property of downstream residents during flood and ice seasons therefore five objectives including requirements for hydropower generation sediment transport water supply flood control and ice control are considered as regulation objectives for longyangxia and liujiaxia cascade reservoirs 3 1 objective functions 3 1 1 objective 1 hydropower generation hydropower generation is one of the most important objectives in this study hydropower outputs associated with hydropower stations built in the upper yellow river basin are calculated as follows 1 max f 1 max i 1 m t 1 t n i t δ t 2 n i t k i q e i t

time t respectively 3 1 2 objective 2 sediment transport sediment transport is another important objective in this study the xiaheyan toudaoguai river reach section is the key section with hydrological stations for managing the sediment transport of the desert wide valley reach therefore the sediment transport maximum in this section is used as the measure of the effect of sediment transport on the upper yellow river presented as follows 3 max f 2 max n 1 nu t 1 t ω n t δ t 4 ω n t k q s a n t s b n t where f2 is the total amount of sediment transport in a given period nu is the

et al 2008 3 1 3 objective 3 water supply to meet water demands a certain flow in the lanzhou section must be guaranteed therefore the water supply objective can be expressed by water shortage minimum

reaches would freeze when the temperature dips below freezing during the end of november and the next coming march bai et al 2015 therefore the ice control objective is to control the water level minimum of the liujiaxia reservoir at the beginning of the ice season early november under the premise of meeting the flow requirements of ice control 8 min f 4 min z l j x n o v z max l j x n o v 9

make efficient water resources management for cascade reservoirs the explored multi objective water resources management model for the upper yellow river basin involves inherent complex and high dimensional variables with a large number of constraints on cascade reservoir operation many optimization algorithms have been applied to reservoir operation ahmad et al 2014 labadie 2004 wurbs 1993 yeh 1985 among them eas like the multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso and the non dominated genetic algorithm nsga ii are good prospective tools to deal with nonlinear and multi objective problems and they become popular in reservoir operation owing to their ability to find optimal solutions within reasonable computation time as known every method has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the types of problems involved in water resources especially in reservoir operation ahmad et al 2014 the particle swarm optimization pso proposed by eberhart and kennedy 1995 is one of the swarm intelligent methods the pso has been applied in many types of optimization problems zhang et al 2014 whereas many researchers have developed various mopso for solving multi purpose reservoir operation problems reddy nagesh kumar 2007 ostadrahimi et al 2012 farshad et al 2017 zain et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 baltar and fontane 2008 proposed an mopso to solve a multi purpose reservoir operation and indicated that the mopso could make obtain better results as compared to the nsga ii and the pareto archived evolution strategy paes in this study we use the pso to solve the single objective model while using the mopso to solve the multi objective model 3 3 1 optimization procedure for the feasible search space to effectively solve the high dimensional multi objective cascade reservoirs operation problem we first develop strategies for dimensionality reduction and constraint transformation to obtain a feasible search space fss the core idea is to speed up solution convergence through reducing the search space which can be achieved by effectively handling constraints a detailed description of the methods adopted in this study is shown as follows constraints can be divided into two categories 1 transformable constraints such as water level and flow constraints where variables involved can be transformed directly into constraints and 2 non transformable constraints such as outputs variables involved are mostly associated with implicit functions and cannot be directly transformed into constraints bai et al 2017 for a non transformable constraint since the range of its relevant variable cannot be directly converted into constraints it will be controlled in the algorithm by identifying whether the decision variable satisfies the non transformable constraint for transformable constraints a two stage simulation method is used to eliminate infeasible solutions step by step fig 3 implementation steps are addressed as follows step 1 set i t 1 the water levels of the reservoir at initial and final stages are set as z0 0 and z1 t respectively step 2 the first stage starts with z0 0 and the middle stage is controlled by the transport restriction the water level range at the end of the first stage is obtained and denoted as z 0 i z min 0 i z max 0 i step 3 taking z1 i 1 as the final water level at the second stage this period is controlled according to the transport constraint where the initial water level that changes the water level range at the second stage is obtained from back pushing that is to say the change in the water level range at the end of the first stage is recorded as z1 i z1 m in i z1 m ax i step 4 taking the intersection of z0 i and z1 i as the water level range at the end of the ith stage z m in i z m ax i the water level at the end of the ith stage is randomly generated and recorded as z i then let i i 1 z1 i z i step 5 terminate the judgment if i 0 go to step 2 otherwise go to step 6 step 6 output the result 3 3 2 implementation procedure of the fss mopso to increase computation efficiency an improved multi objective algorithm fss mopso that fuses the feasible search space into the mopso is proposed in this study the procedure is described as follows step 1 set the maximum number of iterations t the size of the population n and the number of dimensions m the water level during the scheduled period serves as the decision variable step 2 based on the known initial and final water levels of each reservoir the initial sequence z 1 z 2 z i can be randomly assigned within the refined fss step 3 initialize the population x j j 1 n and the speed ve l j 0 j 1 n for each particle within the fss then evaluate each particle based on eqs 1 and 3 and store non dominated solutions in the archived repository rep step 4 generate a hypercube step 5 initialize the memory of each particle by storing initial x j positions as the best positions found bpf so far b pf j is set as follow b pf j x j step 6 compute the speed of each particle shown below coello et al 2004 17 ve l j w v e l j r 1 b pf j x j r 2 b pf j x j where w is the inertia weight r 1 and r 2 are random numbers falling within the interval of 0 1 step 7 maintain the particles within the search boundaries coello et al 2004 when the value of a decision variable goes beyond its boundaries then carry out

and discussion 4 1 model design in this study two single objective models configured by the pso and one multi objective model configured by the fss mopso are established to analyze the transformation rules of water sediment regulation in the upper yellow river then the transformation rules of water sediment regulation for cascade reservoirs are clarified based on three designed schemes shown as follows 4 1 1 scheme 1 hydropower generation maximization model scheme 1 assume that hydropower generation is the only optimization objective in the optimal operation which does not consider the maximization of sediment transport the other three objectives i e water supply flood control and ice control are converted into constraints however aiming at comparing sediment transport results among different schemes the sediment transport must be calculated by eqs 3 and 4 after obtaining the single objective optimization results associated with hydropower generation maximization and the other three objectives are converted into water level and outflow constraints as shown in eqs 7 13 and 14 the pso is used to solve this model with data collected in 2010 4 1 2 scheme 2 sediment transport maximization model scheme 2 assume that sediment transport is the only optimization objective in the optimal operation which does not consider the maximization of hydropower generation the other three objectives i e water supply flood control and ice control are converted into constraints similarly aiming at comparing hydropower generation results among different schemes the hydropower generation objective is converted into constraint as shown in eq 16 and the other three objectives are converted into water level and outflow constraints same as the above the pso is also used to solve this model with data collected in 2010 4 1 3 scheme 3 joint operation model for maximizing hydropower generation and sediment transport scheme 3 assume that hydropower generation and sediment transport are the main objectives in flow regulation the other three objectives i e water supply flood control and ice control are converted into water level and outflow constraints same as the above it means that this model needs to consider both objectives for obtaining a set of compromised solutions the fss mopso is proposed to solve the model with data collected in 2010 for the three schemes the value of the flow rates of the water sediment regulation is set as 2580 m3 s bai et al 2016 the water level is selected as the decision variable the parameters of the pso and the fss mopso algorithm are shown in table 5 4 2 results and discussion of the single objective optimization model the two maximization models associated with sediment transport and hydropower generation respectively are solved by the pso the optimal results are shown in tables 6 and 7 respectively in order to visually analyze the variations in water level and power output monthly water level and monthly hydropower output obtained from the hydropower generation and sediment transport optimization models for longyangxia and liujiaxia cascade reservoirs are shown in figs 4 7 respectively as shown in figs 4 7 the year initial and year end water levels of the longyangxia and the liujiaxia are the same so that the total amount of water consumption for both optimization models are the same compared to that of the hydropower generation maximization model the hydropower output obtained from the sediment transport maximization model is reduced by 17 6 which causes a loss of 525 million rmb in power generation benefits the reason could be that the sediment transport maximization model generated a large flow to flush the river in april which resulted in a large amount of abandoned water meanwhile the hydropower head of the longyangxia is in a lower position during the late period resulting in greater power loss the water supply amounts of the lanzhou section obtained from the hydropower generation and sediment transport maximization models schemes are 37 3 billion m3 and 36 3 billion m3 respectively which do not show much difference it can be because that the two different schemes change the flow process only without consuming water the total water supply of the lanzhou section will not make much difference under the premise of the same amount of outflow in the longyangxia liujiaxia section which indicates hydropower generation and sediment transport will not cause conflicts in water supply the water levels of the liujiaxia reservoir in early november early july are 1725 9 m 1721 7 m and 1724 7 m 1725 8 m under the schemes of sediment transport maximization and hydropower generation maximization respectively that means the water levels of the liujiaxia reservoir in early july under both schemes are less than the water level for flood control 1726 m meanwhile the water level of the sediment transport maximization model is lower than that of the hydropower generation maximization model which means the scheme for sediment transport maximization has a larger flood storage capacity and can be more conducive to flood control the reason accounting for the phenomenon is that the objectives of flood control and ice control are influenced by the subsequent effects of large flow for channel scouring in april in other words the closer the regulation timing such as july to april is the more significant the impact of flow on the objective is in addition to the greater negative impact on hydropower generation the sediment transport maximization model has no significant impacts on water supply and flood control but has a positive impact on flood control among them the effect of sediment transport is related to sediment transport flow the sediment transport of each section is calculated by eqs 3 and 4 and the results are shown in table 8 as shown in table 8 the total amount of sediment transport reaches 59 74 million tons for the sediment transport maximization model although the river sections qingtongxia shizuishan bayangaole sanhehukou and sanhehukou toudaoguai shows micro scouring situations for the hydropower generation maximization model in contrast the sediment transport effect for the hydropower generation maximization model is very small with a total amount of sediment transport reaching 15 83 million tons only the effect of sediment transport is greatly reduced by the hydropower generation maximization model for example the amount of sediment transport in the sanhehukou toudaoguai section is 4 12 million tons which decreases 18 05 million tons or 81 as compared to that 22 17 million tons of the sediment transport maximization model the hydropower generation maximization scheme represents the objective of maximizing hydropower generation efficiency for cascade reservoirs whereas the sediment transport maximization scheme produces the largest sediment transport effect on the upper yellow river if we want to further increase the amount of sediment transport in river sections based on the hydropower generation maximization scheme the balance between hydropower generation and sediment transport will inevitably be broken which means longyangxia and liujiaxia cascade reservoirs will abandon more water and therefore reduce hydropower outputs how to find a balance between the two objectives to increase the amount of sediment transport without significantly increasing the amount of abandoned water and reducing hydropower output will be analyzed in section 4 3 4 3 results and discussion of the multi objective optimization model the fss mopso is used to solve the multi objective optimization model the pareto front curve of hydropower generation and sediment transport is shown in fig 8 hydropower generation and sediment transport present a nonlinear contradiction i e an increase in hydropower output will inevitably lead to a decrease in the amount of sediment transport according to the characteristics of the pareto optimal solutions it can be observed that any point lying on the pareto front curve serves as an optimal solution to the multi objective problem additionally in order to verify the rationality of the multi objective optimal solution the pareto front curve is combined with the solutions associated with the two single objective optimization models and the relationship between single and multi objective optimization models is compared that is to say the distance between a multi objective extremum solution and the optimal solution of the single objective optimization model would determine whether the proximity is reasonable results show that the optimal solutions associated with the two single objective optimization models just fall on the endpoints of the pareto front curve confirming that the results of the three models are reasonable fig 8 to further analyze the difference between the multi objective joint operation and the single objective operation a joint operation scheme the black point in fig 8 is selected from the pareto front curve according to the objective weight 1 1 as shown in table 9 both longyangxia and liujiaxia reservoirs have abandoned water 75 m3 s and 1146 m3 s respectively during the operation of water sediment regulation compared with the sediment transport maximization model table 6 the flows of abandoned water are reduced by 1500 m3 s and 430 m3 s for longyagxia and liujiaxia reservoirs respectively the difference between the joint operation scheme and the sediment transport maximization model is that the former not only can make full use of the annually adjusted storage capacity of the liujiaxia reservoir but also can replenish water during water sediment regulation by this way the longyangxia reservoir can prevent from being the only hub for sediment scouring and large flow discharging which may cause a large amount of abandoned water and affect the operation of the hydropower station seriously furthermore the results associated with the five objectives of the three optimization models are analyzed table 10 in order to eliminate the impact of different dimensionality of the five objectives on the regulation analysis normalization of objective values is conducted as shown in table 11 meanwhile the normalized values of objectives for each scheme is plotted in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 the objectives of hydropower generation and sediment transport show significant differences under different schemes however the objectives of ice control flood control and water supply show less differences the values of hydropower generation and sediment transport under different schemes the sediment transport maximization scheme the hydropower generation maximization scheme and the joint operation scheme are 0 851 1 000 0 959 hydropower generation and 1 000 0 265 0 645 sediment transport respectively taking the two single objective schemes as an example when the hydropower output increases from 13 145 billion kw h to 15 455 billion kw h the amount of the corresponding sediment transport decreases from 0 5974 million tons to 0 1583 million tons this can be described as an increase in hydropower output by 2 31 billion kw h 17 6 increase would greatly reduce the amount of sediment transport 73 5 decrease at the same time it also shows that the appropriate reduction of hydropower output can obtain a larger benefit of sediment transport water supply flood control and ice control can meet their requirements and overall the values of these three objectives do not change significantly it means sediment transport has little effect on these three objectives 4 4 multi objective transformation under different scenarios in order to further analyze the above mentioned multi objective transformation rules and investigate the changes of multi objectives associated with water and sediment over the reaches of the upper yellow river in the future we choose 2030 as the operation year therefore this study designs four scenarios according to the initial water level of the longyangxia and the flow for sediment regulation with respect to 2010 and 2030 as shown in table 12 the four scenarios are optimized using the multi objective model that considers the objectives of hydropower generation and sediment transport the fss mopso is used to solve these four multi objective models in order to facilitate the comparative analysis of the four scenarios the joint operation scheme is selected form the pareto front curve according to the objective weight 1 1 the values of objective functions under each scenario are shown in figs 10 and 11 fig 10 reveals several findings with an increase in sediment regulation flow the loss of hydropower output for the longyangxia liujiaxia cascade reservoirs becomes 400 million kw h but the amount of water supply from the liujiaxia reservoir increases such that the reservoir has a lower water level before the flood season which is more conducive to flood control for the liujiaxia reservoir besides the water supply in the lanzhou section is increased by 700 million m3 which is more conducive to the balance between water supply and demand in yellow river basin under the premise of satisfying water supply requirements the amount of sediment transport increases from 25 million tons to 39 million tons in the desert wide valley section which means the effect of water sediment regulation is significantly enhanced the average loss of power generation is 1 kw h which can increase 0 039 ton of sediment transport therefore in 2010 further increase in water sediment regulation flow can result in a smaller hydropower loss in exchange for a larger sediment transport effect this can be conducive not only to maintaining the relative balance of river channel erosion and siltation in the reaches of the upper yellow river but also to the realization of objectives with respect to water supply flood control and sediment transport fig 11 illustrates that 1 considering the water demand of 2030 hydropower output will be increased by 100 million kw h when sediment regulation flow is reduced scenario 3 however the water level of the liujiaxia before the flood season will be increased by 1 m and the amount of sediment transport will be decreased by 11 million tons while the amount of water supply will be decreased by 800 million tons and the ice control will be the same in scenario 3 and scenario 4 2 similar to the analysis for fig 10 with an increase in the comprehensive water demand over the upper yellow river basin an appropriate increase in sediment regulation flow will result in a smaller loss of hydropower generation in exchange for greater sediment transport benefits meanwhile increasing sediment regulation flow also increases the water supply of the lanzhou section which will not cause flood disasters in the downstream reaches of the liujiaxia reservoir above all as the comprehensive water demand increases increasing the sediment regulation flow to control water and sediment will result in the loss of hydropower generation for example the loss in 2010 under scenario 2 is 400 million kw h compared to 2010 under scenario 1 and the loss in 2030 under scenario 4 is 100 million kw h compared to 2030 under scenario 3 however the loss of hydropower output will increase the water supply by 700 and 800 million tons for scenario 2 and scenario 4 respectively which will be more conducive to ensuring water supply meets comprehensive water requirements therefore with an increase of the comprehensive water demand in the future the regulation of water and sediment with appropriately large flow can ensure the dam safety in the upper reaches of the yellow river during the flood season which will not aggravate the contradiction between water supply and demand 5 conclusion maintaining a healthy yellow river through establishing a harmonious water sediment relationship is a challenging and crucial task in this study we optimize multi objective water sediment regulation for reducing disasters and improving benefits of water conservancy facilities for two cascade reservoirs regulatory bodies the multi objective cascade reservoir operation model involves inherent complex and high dimensional variables with a large amounts of constraints in this study we establish three optimization models i e the sediment transport maximization model the hydropower generation maximization model and the joint optimal operation model for deriving transformation rules of water sediment regulation for the upper yellow river the pso and the fss mospo are proposed to cope with the conflicts between five objectives including sediment transport flood control ice control hydropower generation and water supply the main findings are drawn as follows 1 the pareto front curve of hydropower generation and sediment transport fig 8 obtained from the fss mospo indicates a nonlinear contradiction between these two objectives where an increase in hydropower output will inevitably result in a decrease in sediment transport the quantitative transformation rule of these two objectives reveals an average loss of 1 kw h in power generation would increase 0 039 ton of sediment transport in the case of year 2010 in other words it s worthwhile exchanging a small amount loss of power generation for a larger sediment transport volume 2 when sediment transport is maximized water requirements associated with the objectives of water supply flood control and ice control can also be fulfilled nevertheless the changes in the outcomes of the three objectives are not obvious which discloses sediment transport is related to the three objectives while making little effects on them 3 expecting an increase of water demand in the future 2030 the derived water sediment regulation using large flows can ensure the dam safety in the upper reaches of the yellow river during the flood season however competition in water resources between power generation and sediment transport has been significantly mitigated as compared to scenario 2010 this provides an efficient and

6257,industrialization and urbanization expansion may change the groundwater quality in the pearl river delta prd the aims of this study were to evaluate the groundwater quality in various aquifers and areas with different urbanization levels in the prd to extract the main impact indicators and to discuss the driving forces for the groundwater quality nearly 400 groundwater samples were collected and 23 indicators were analyzed in the prd 83 groundwater was drinkable good quality by using a fuzzy synthetic evaluation method groundwater in karst aquifers was drinkable and its quality was better than those in granular and fissured aquifers in the latter two aquifer types groundwater quality in non urbanized areas was much better than those in peri urban and urbanized areas in granular aquifers mn fe i ni mn and mn as i were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas peri urban areas and non urbanized areas respectively correspondingly reductive dissolution of fe mn oxy hydroxides infiltration of industrial wastewater and reductive dissolution of i and mn and reductive dissolution of mn as and i were likely responsible for poor quality groundwater in these areas respectively by contrast in fissured aquifers no3 no3 pb and i were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas peri urban areas and non urbanized areas respectively correspondingly infiltration of domestic sewage infiltration of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater and mineralization of i rich organic matter were probably responsible for poor quality groundwater in these areas respectively industrialization was one of the main driving forces for groundwater quality in granular and fissured aquifers in peri urban areas while urbanization was one of the main driving forces for groundwater quality in fissured aquifers in urbanized and peri urban areas in the prd keywords groundwater quality pearl river delta urbanization expansion fuzzy synthetic evaluation granular aquifers fissured aquifers 1 introduction pearl river delta prd is one of the most important economic zones in china rapid urbanization and industrialization in this area has occurred during the last decades correspondingly the expansion of construction land in the prd has shown rapidly for example the area occupied by construction land in the prd had increased to 6816 km2 in 2006 more than two times of that in 1988 ye et al 2013 urbanization and industrialization are usually powerful forces for the change of environment huang et al 2018a zhang and mcsaveney 2018 they have accelerated the contamination and deterioration of surface water quality in the prd huang et al 2013a by contrast abundant groundwater is stored in aquifers and it is free of charge in this area huang et al 2013b as a result groundwater resource becomes more important and the groundwater quality assessment and management are the important issues in the prd that has undergone three decades of urbanization and industrialization moreover the influence of urbanization and industrialization on the groundwater quality in the prd should be understood because urbanization and industrialization are the most environmental changes in this area however the groundwater quality in the prd on a regional scale remains unclear and the effects of urbanization and industrialization on the groundwater quality in the prd have received little attention in this study 399 groundwater samples were collected from the prd 23 indicators in groundwater samples were used to evaluate the groundwater quality the groundwater quality was evaluated by a method of fuzzy synthetic evaluation fse dahiya et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 venkatramanan et al 2015 the objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of groundwater quality in various aquifers and areas with different urbanization levels of the prd to extract the main impact indicators from water quality indicators related to the poor quality groundwater and to discuss the driving forces for groundwater quality moreover the effects of urbanization and industrialization on the groundwater quality in the prd at a regional scale were evaluated qualitatively the conclusions would improve groundwater management and increase the availability of good quality groundwater for sustainable development in the prd 2 study area 2 1 geographical geological and hydrogeological conditions the prd was formed as a result of the tibetan plateau uplift during the tertiary and quaternary periods and is located in southern china fig 1 it has a total area of 41 698 km2 with a population of over 57 million in 2016 the east river west river and north river merge in the south of the area and form the pearl river which finally discharges into the south china sea the central and southern parts of the prd are mostly covered by quaternary sediments quaternary sediments consist of two terrestrial sequences and two marine sequences interbedded with each other zong et al 2009 the younger marine sequence has an elevation above 20 m and the older marine sequence is located between 15 m and 40 m fig 1 the younger terrestrial sequence can be sandy fluvial deposits or clayey silt the older terrestrial sequence is dominated by sand and gravel jiao et al 2010 groundwater in quaternary sediments is recharged by vertical infiltration from precipitation and agricultural irrigation and the lateral flow of bedrock groundwater in hilly regions fig 2 the bedrocks include limestone mudstone sandstone shale dolomite granite and gneiss ranging in age from cambrian to tertiary and crop out in the hilly areas in the prd fig 3 among them limestone mudstone and sandstone formed from devonian to jurassic are dominant ghst 1981 aquifers in these areas are mainly associated with fractures and with springs discharging up to hundreds cubic meters per day karst aquifers account for less than 10 of the total area and are around the prd plain while the groundwater yield can be as high as thousands of cubic meters per day the general direction of regional groundwater flow in the aquifers of the prd follows roughly the major river flow which is from northwest and northeast to the coast fig 2 2 2 expansion of urbanization and industrial activities characteristics the prd promoted rural urbanization and industrialization during the last decades correspondingly the increases of construction land in the prd were 0 5 times from 1988 to 1998 and from 1998 to 2006 respectively ye et al 2013 the urbanization expansion was characterized by numerous factories a high proportion of non local population and a lack of sewer systems especially in newly formed peri urban areas huang et al 2013a in contrast only a small number of factories were built on the urbanized areas formed before 1988 huang et al 2018a as a result factories near rivers directly discharged wastewater into rivers illegally in these newly formed urbanized areas and wastewater infiltration into groundwater commonly occurred in these newly formed peri urban areas huang et al 2018b 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection groundwater samples were collected from three aquifer types 257 wells in granular aquifers 132 wells in fissured aquifers and 10 wells in karst aquifers and the sampling densities were 30 50 samples and 5 10 samples for every thousand square kilometers in plain and hilly regions respectively two 250 ml polyethylene bottles were used to store groundwater for the analysis of trace elements and other inorganic chemicals one bottle used for trace elements analysis was acidified with nitric acid to a ph of less than 2 all samples were stored at 4 c until laboratory procedures could be performed groundwater tables were measured using a dip meter by once during the sampling period wet season it is worth mentioning that groundwater was collected from shallow aquifers and the groundwater tables were within 6 m in depth table s1 3 2 analytical techniques all analyses were carried out at the groundwater mineral water and environmental monitoring center of the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology chinese academy of geological sciences metal ions and trace elements na fe mn cu zn se as crvi pb be ni ba co hg cd were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7500ce icp ms tokyo japan total hardness th was measured by edta titration method nh4 and anions no3 so4 2 cl no2 f i were carried out on ion chromatography ic shimadzu lc 10advp japan to assure data quality for indicators each groundwater sample was analyzed in triplicate sample batches were regularly interspersed with standards and blanks and all data were corrected for instrument drift the relative errors were less than 6 for all analyzed indicators 3 3 fuzzy synthetic evaluation fse method fuzzy sets and fuzzy optimization provide a useful technique in addressing the imprecision of groundwater quality assessment zhang et al 2012 in this study the fuzzy membership function was used to assess groundwater quality according to the groundwater quality standards of china table s2 general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china gaqsiqprc 2017 to reduce the complexity of the model the linear membership functions are used as follows 1 r ij 0 c i s ij 1 o r c i s ij 1 c i s ij 1 s ij s ij 1 s ij 1 c i s ij s ij 1 c i s ij 1 s ij s ij c i s ij 1 1 c i s i where r ij indicates the fuzzy membership of indicator i to class j every indicator is characterized by five classes i ii iii iv v according to the groundwater quality standards of china gaqsiqprc 2017 c i stands for analytical value of groundwater quality indicator i s ij stands for the allowable value of groundwater quality indicator the fuzzy membership matrix r consists of groundwater quality indicators and classes other details related to the fse method are in section 3 3 of supporting information si zhang et al 2012 liu et al 2016 3 4 principal components analysis pca concentrations of some indicators in groundwater above the allowable values probably lead to the poor quality groundwater we need to know which ones are the main impact indicators it is known that pca is a useful tool for data reduction and parameters in the same pc with positive loadings mean a same origin or similar geochemical behaviors huang et al 2014 2018b thus in this study pca was used to reduce the indicators and extract the main impact indicators in the same pc with results of groundwater quality assessment which are responsible for the poor quality groundwater in the pca the rotation of principal components pcs was carried out using the varimax method and only pcs with eigenvalues that exceed one were retained for analyses this study selected the maximum absolute pc loading of one index to evaluate the relationships between the pcs and indicators the spss release 23 0 spss inc chicago usa was used to analyze the groundwater quality data 4 results and discussion 4 1 characteristics of groundwater quality indicators the descriptive statistics for the indicators analyzed in groundwater samples in the prd are summarized in table 1 th ranged from 4 9 mg l to 1040 8 mg l with the median of 93 5 mg l among anions in groundwater of the prd cl showed the highest median concentration of 29 9 mg l followed by no3 so4 2 f no2 and i high concentrations of nh4 occurred in groundwater in the prd and up to 60 mg l na was a range of 0 5 mg l to 1008 8 mg l with the median of 19 1 mg l among trace metal loid s in groundwater of the prd fe showed the highest median concentration of 0 06 mg l followed by mn ba zn pb cu as se co be ni cd crvi and hg according to the standard for groundwater quality of china gaqsiqprc 2017 the percent of groundwater samples with the concentrations of indicators exceeded the allowable values pev for drinking purpose are also in table 1 in the prd mn showed the highest pev of 35 6 followed by fe nh4 i no3 as pb no2 cl na th be so4 2 f ni ba zn se hg while the pevs of other four indicators were zero 4 2 distribution of groundwater quality the groundwater quality was evaluated by the fse method and classified into five classes according to the groundwater quality standards of china table s2 gaqsiqprc 2017 the assessment parameters were concentrations of 19 indicators while other four indicators cu co crvi cd with zero pevs were not included table 1 in the prd the percentages of classes i ii iii iv and v of groundwater samples were 54 4 7 3 21 3 3 5 and 13 5 respectively fig 4 of the total groundwater samples 83 samples were good quality and drinkable classes i ii and iii while 17 samples were poor quality and undrinkable classes iv and v it is worth mentioning that the result for groundwater quality in this study is qualitative but not quantitative because only about 400 samples from such a large area in addition the result for groundwater quality is based on the concentrations of 23 inorganic chemicals in this study while organic chemicals and other inorganic chemicals were not included 4 2 1 groundwater quality in various aquifers groundwater quality in various aquifers was shown in figs 4 and 5 groundwater quality in granular aquifers was grouped into five classes the number of samples within the classes i ii iii iv and v accounts for 47 4 7 8 23 0 3 5 and 18 3 respectively and 78 2 samples in granular aquifers were suitable for drinking groundwater quality in fissured aquifers was also classified into five classes the contributions of classes i ii iii iv and v were 65 2 6 8 18 9 3 8 and 5 3 respectively and 90 9 groundwater samples in fissured aquifers were drinkable by contrast groundwater quality in karst aquifers was grouped into classes i and iii accounting for 90 and 10 respectively and all groundwater samples in karst aquifers were drinkable consequently in the prd groundwater quality in karst aquifers was the best in fissured aquifers was the second and in granular aquifers was the worst it is known that various aquifers in the prd are in areas with different urbanization levels huang et al 2018b in other words the above results of the groundwater quality assessment in various aquifers may include the contribution of urbanization therefore to eliminate the contribution of urbanization the groundwater quality in various aquifers was discussed based on the groundwater samples collected from non urbanized areas in granular aquifers groundwater quality in non urbanized areas was grouped into four classes the contributions of classes i ii iii and v were 62 7 1 5 20 9 and 14 9 respectively and about 85 groundwater samples were drinkable fig 4 by contrast in fissured aquifers groundwater quality in non urbanized areas was grouped into five classes the contributions of classes i ii iii iv and v were 72 6 6 8 15 1 1 4 and 4 1 respectively and nearly 95 groundwater samples were drinkable fig 4 consequently after removing the contribution of urbanization groundwater quality in fissured aquifers was also better than that in granular aquifers due to the higher proportion of groundwater samples with poor quality in granular aquifers in non urbanized areas it is worth mentioning that groundwater quality in karst aquifers in areas with different urbanization levels was not discussed because samples collected from karst aquifers were too few 4 2 2 groundwater quality in areas with different urbanization levels groundwater quality in areas with different urbanization levels was exhibited in figs 4 and 6 the contributions of classes i ii iii iv and v for groundwater quality in urbanized areas were 39 2 8 8 31 1 4 7 and 16 2 respectively and 20 9 groundwater samples in urbanized areas were undrinkable groundwater quality in peri urban areas was grouped into i ii iii iv and v classes accounting for 56 4 9 3 13 0 5 6 and 15 7 respectively and 21 3 groundwater samples in peri urban areas were unsuitable for drinking similarly groundwater quality in non urbanized areas was also classified into five classes and contributions of classes i ii iii iv and v were 68 5 4 2 17 5 0 7 and 9 1 respectively and 9 8 groundwater samples in non urbanized areas were undrinkable as a result in the prd groundwater quality in urbanized and peri urban areas was close and both of them were significantly worse than that in non urbanized areas however the above results of groundwater quality assessment in areas with different urbanization levels include the contribution of different aquifer types thus we further to discuss the groundwater quality in a same aquifer type in areas with different urbanization levels to eliminate the contribution of different aquifer types in granular aquifers the proportions of poor quality groundwater samples in urbanized areas 24 6 and peri urban areas 23 8 were close fig 4 by contrast in fissured aquifers the proportion of poor quality groundwater samples in urbanized areas 12 5 was significantly lower than that in peri urban areas 15 8 in both of granular and fissured aquifers the proportions of poor quality groundwater samples in urbanized and peri urban areas were much higher than that in non urbanized areas fig 4 indicating a remarkable influence of urbanization on the groundwater quality in granular and fissured aquifers in the prd groundwater quality in urbanized areas formed at different periods was further investigated figs 4 and 6 in urbanized areas formed before 1988 the contributions of classes i ii iii iv and v for groundwater quality were 47 5 5 22 5 2 5 and 22 5 respectively and 25 groundwater samples in these areas were undrinkable in urbanized areas formed at 1988 1998 the percentages of classes i ii iii iv and v for groundwater quality were 30 9 11 9 31 0 9 5 and 16 7 and 26 2 groundwater samples in these areas were unsuitable for drinking similarly groundwater quality in urbanized areas formed at 1998 2006 was also grouped into five classes and the percentages of classes i ii iii iv and v were 39 4 9 1 36 4 3 0 and 12 1 respectively and 15 1 groundwater samples in these areas were undrinkable as a consequence in the prd groundwater quality in urbanized areas formed before 1988 and at 1988 1998 was close and both of them were significantly worse than that in urbanized areas formed at 1998 2006 4 3 main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater 4 3 1 main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in various aquifers parameters in pca include indicators with pevs 0 and the result of groundwater quality assessment rgqa therefore 20 parameters in granular aquifers and 10 parameters in fissured aquifers were selected tables s3 and s4 no impact indicator in karst aquifers was discussed because groundwater in karst aquifers was drinkable in granular aquifers a seven factor model controlled the groundwater quality indicators and rgqa and the cumulative variance by the seven pcs was 68 6 table 2 pc4 explained 9 4 of the total variance with moderate positive loadings of no2 nh4 and rgqa and weak positive loading of mn indicating that no2 nh4 and mn were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers in the prd after removing the contribution of urbanization groundwater quality indicators and rgqa in granular aquifers in non urbanized areas were controlled by a three factor model table 3 pc2 consists of strong positive loadings of rgqa and mn and moderate positive loadings of as and i accounted for 18 9 of the total variance this indicates that mn as and i were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers in non urbanized areas in the prd by contrast the groundwater quality indicators and rgqa in fissured aquifers were controlled by a four factor model table 4 pc2 which comprises strong positive loading of no3 moderate positive loadings of rgqa and pb and weak positive loading of be this indicates that no3 pb and be were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers in the prd after removing the contribution of urbanization a three factor model controlled groundwater quality indicators and rgqa in fissured aquifers in non urbanized areas table 5 pc3 consists of strong positive loading of i and moderate positive loading of rgqa indicating that i was the main impact indicator for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers in non urbanized areas in the prd 4 3 2 main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in areas with different urbanization levels in urbanized areas a seven factor model and a five factor model controlled the groundwater quality indicators and rgqa of granular aquifers and fissured aquifers tables 2 and 4 respectively rgqa was accompanied with mn and fe in the same pc with positive loadings in granular aquifers table 2 while that was accompanied with no3 in the same pc with positive loadings in fissured aquifers table 4 this indicates that in urbanized areas mn and fe were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers while no3 was the main impact indicator for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers differing from urbanized areas a five factor model and a two factor model controlled the groundwater quality indicators and rgqa of granular aquifers and fissured aquifers in peri urban areas tables 3 and 5 respectively rgqa was accompanied with i ni and mn in the same pc with positive loadings in granular aquifers table 3 while that was accompanied with no3 and pb in the same pc with positive loadings in fissured aquifers table 5 this indicates that in peri urban areas i ni and mn were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers while no3 and pb were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers main impact indicators of groundwater quality in urbanized areas formed at different periods were further investigated a five factor model a six factor model and a four factor model controlled the groundwater quality indicators and rgqa in urbanized areas formed at 1998 2006 at 1988 1998 and before 1988 respectively table s5 rgqa was accompanied with fe mn and hg in the same pc with positive loadings in urbanized areas formed at 1998 2006 indicating that fe mn and hg were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas formed at 1998 2006 by contrast nh4 no2 and mn were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas formed at 1988 1998 because rgqa was accompanied with nh4 no2 and mn in the same pc with positive loadings in urbanized areas formed at 1988 1998 mn and rgqa in the same pc with positive loadings in urbanized areas formed before 1988 indicating that mn was the main impact indicator for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas formed before 1988 4 4 driving forces for poor quality groundwater 4 4 1 driving forces for poor quality groundwater in various aquifers as mentioned previously after eliminating the contribution of urbanization mn as and i were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers in the prd table 3 it is known that terrestrial detrital deposits were the major sources of solid mn and as in quaternary sediments of the prd and solid as was mainly associated with fe and mn hydr oxides ghst 1981 wang et al 2012 by contrast marine deposits were likely to the major sources of solid iodine in quaternary sediments because abundant organic matter such as i rich organic matter is in marine sequences of the prd wang et al 2012 hou et al 2018 jiao et al 2010 reported that marine sequences overlaid terrestrial sequences were characterized by abundant organic matter and reducing environment in the prd leading to the mineralization of organic matter including i rich organic matter and the reduction of fe and mn hydr oxides wang et al 2012 consequently the release of i mn and as in quaternary sediments of the prd was expected because the iodine in marine sequences was commonly associated with organic matter such as humic substances francois 1987 and as in sediments was mainly associated with fe and mn hydr oxides wang et al 2012 some evidences have supported the above conclusions for example groundwater in granular aquifers of the prd was characterized by eh 300 mv and ph 7 8 hou et al 2018 huang et al 2018a indicating that the form of mn in groundwater of granular aquifers was soluble mn ii because mn occurs mainly as the reduced soluble mn ii at ph 8 and at eh 500 mv homoncik et al 2010 thus the reduction of mn from insoluble mn iv to soluble mn ii occurred in granular aquifers in addition in granular aquifers mean and maximum concentrations of i in no3 type groundwater were much lower than those in other three types groundwater table s6 indicating that high concentration of i in groundwater of granular aquifers was probably geogenic sources but not anthropogenic sources because the occurrence of no3 type in groundwater of the prd originated from several human activities such as the infiltration of domestic sewage and fertilizers zhang et al 2015 huang et al 2018a therefore we speculate that naturally reductive dissolution of mn and as in sediments and mineralization of i rich organic matter in marine sequences overlaid granular aquifers are the main driving forces for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers in non urbanized areas in the prd by contrast in fissured aquifers in non urbanized areas i was the main impact indicator for poor quality groundwater mentioned before it is known that oxidation of organic matter is commonly responsible for the high concentration of i in groundwater of carbonate aquifers edmunds et al 1989 similarly high concentration of i in groundwater of fissured aquifers in the prd is also probably derived from the decomposition of i rich organic matter because mostly groundwater with high concentration of i in fissured aquifers in the prd showed ca hco3 type sun et al 2009 consequently naturally decomposition of i rich organic matter in fissured aquifers is likely the main driving force for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers in non urbanized areas in the prd 4 4 2 driving forces for poor quality groundwater in areas with different urbanization levels as mentioned above mn and fe were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers in urbanized areas it is known that formation of reducing condition by the mineralization of organic matter resulted in the reductive dissolution of fe mn oxy hydroxides in granular aquifers in the prd jiao et al 2010 huang et al 2018a thus naturally reductive dissolution of fe mn oxy hydroxides in granular aquifers is probably the main driving force for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers in urbanized areas in the prd by contrast no3 was the main impact indicator for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers in urbanized areas in fissured aquifers of the prd mean concentration of groundwater no3 in urbanized areas was about 1 7 times of that in non urbanized areas and the pev of groundwater no3 in urbanized areas was also more than double times of that in non urbanized areas table s7 in addition a couple of previously studies pointed out that high concentration of no3 in groundwater in urbanized areas in the prd was mainly derived from the infiltration of domestic sewage during the urbanization zhang et al 2015 huang et al 2018a due to a large production of domestic sewage and lacking of sewer systems in newly formed peri urban areas in the prd huang et al 2013a therefore urbanization accompanied with the infiltration of domestic sewage should be the main driving force for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers in urbanized areas in the prd different to urbanized areas i ni and mn were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers in peri urban areas mentioned before it is known that high concentration of ni in groundwater in the prd was derived from the infiltration of industrial wastewater because numerous factories formed in peri urban areas and wastewater infiltration into groundwater commonly occurred in these areas in the prd huang et al 2018b as a consequence both of naturally reductive dissolution of i and mn in quaternary sediments and the industrialization accompanied by the infiltration of industrial wastewater were the two main driving forces for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers in peri urban areas in the prd by contrast no3 and pb were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers in peri urban areas on the one hand as it can be seen from fig s1 more than 60 groundwater with high concentrations of pb 0 01 mg l was located on peri urban areas where a large number of small factories such as printing and dyeing factories were also located sun et al 2009 wastewater containing high concentrations of pb from these factories was directly discharged into the nearby ground surface due to lacking of effective sewer systems in peri urban areas huang et al 2013a moreover fissured aquifers with high concentrations of groundwater pb in peri urban areas were characterized by acidic groundwater ph 4 16 to 5 37 and it is beneficial to pb with soluble forms in groundwater thus it can be concluded that high concentrations of groundwater pb in fissured aquifers in peri urban areas originated from the infiltration of industrial wastewater on the other hand as it can be seen from table s7 in fissured aquifers of the prd mean concentration of groundwater no3 in peri urban areas was approximately 1 7 times of that in non urbanized areas and the pev of groundwater no3 in peri urban areas was about two times of that in non urbanized areas in addition it is known that more than 70 groundwater with no3 type occurred in peri urban areas huang et al 2018a and a large amount of no3 rich domestic sewage produced by local population was commonly discharged into the nearby ground surface directly due to lacking of sewer systems in peri urban areas huang et al 2013a consequently it can be inferred that high concentrations of groundwater no3 in fissured aquifers in peri urban areas mainly originated from the infiltration of domestic sewage therefore urbanization accompanied with the infiltration of domestic sewage and the industrialization accompanied by the infiltration of industrial wastewater were the two main driving forces for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers in peri urban areas in the prd as mentioned before mn nh4 no2 mn fe mn hg were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas formed before 1988 formed at 1988 1998 and formed at 1998 2006 respectively it is known that high concentration of nh4 in groundwater in the prd mainly originated from the degradation of organic nitrogen in the aquitard overlaying the granular aquifers in the prd jiao et al 2010 huang et al 2018a it is also known that the infiltration of domestic sewage was responsible for the high concentration of no2 in groundwater in urbanized areas in the prd because leakage of sewage pipes occurred frequently in urbanized areas and the mean concentration of groundwater no2 in urbanized areas was more than three times higher than that in non urbanized areas in the prd sun et al 2009 meanwhile it is known that the infiltration of industrial wastewater was responsible for the high concentration of hg in groundwater in urbanized areas in the prd because numerous factories formed in newly formed urbanized areas and the infiltration of industrial wastewater occurred in these areas in the prd huang et al 2018b therefore we speculate that naturally reductive dissolution of mn oxy hydroxides in quaternary sediments was the main driving force for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas formed before 1988 in the prd both of the infiltration of domestic sewage and naturally reductive dissolution of mn oxy hydroxides and degradation of organic nitrogen in quaternary sediments were the main driving forces for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas formed at 1988 1998 in the prd and both of naturally reductive dissolution of fe mn oxy hydroxides in quaternary sediments and the infiltration of industrial wastewater were the main driving forces for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas formed at 1998 2006 in the prd in addition groundwater table depth may be an important factor controlling the concentrations of some impact indicators in groundwater especially in urbanized areas because the concentrations of some contaminants in groundwater often decrease with the increase of the depth when groundwater contaminants originated from ground surface correspondingly the relationship between groundwater table depth and the concentrations of some impact indicators in this area was investigated fig 7 however none significant correlation between them was observed indicating that depth was likely to be a secondary factor but not the main one on controlling groundwater quality in the prd 5 conclusions groundwater quality in various aquifers and areas with different urbanization levels in the prd was evaluated by a fse method groundwater in karst aquifers was drinkable good quality while 9 1 groundwater in fissured aquifers and 21 8 groundwater in granular aquifers were poor quality in both of granular and fissured aquifers groundwater quality in non urbanized areas was better than those in peri urban and urbanized areas main impact indicators related to the poor quality groundwater were extracted by a pca method in granular aquifers mn fe i ni mn and mn as i were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas peri urban areas and non urbanized areas respectively correspondingly the reductive dissolution of fe mn oxy hydroxides the infiltration of industrial wastewater and the reductive dissolution of i and mn and the reductive dissolution of mn as and i were likely responsible for poor quality groundwater in these areas respectively by contrast in fissured aquifers no3 no3 pb and i were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas peri urban areas and non urbanized areas respectively correspondingly the infiltration of domestic sewage the infiltration of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater and the mineralization of i rich organic matter were probably responsible for poor quality groundwater in these areas respectively industrialization accompanied by the infiltration of industrial wastewater was one of the main driving forces for groundwater quality in granular and fissured aquifers in peri urban areas while urbanization accompanied with the infiltration of domestic sewage was one of the main driving forces for groundwater quality in fissured aquifers in urbanized and peri urban areas in the prd therefore the local governmental agencies should pay more attention to the contamination prevention of groundwater in peri urban areas during the urbanization and industrialization as well as in urbanized areas where occurs fissured aquifers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

6257,industrialization and urbanization expansion may change the groundwater quality in the pearl river delta prd the aims of this study were to evaluate the groundwater quality in various aquifers and areas with different urbanization levels in the prd to extract the main impact indicators and to discuss the driving forces for the groundwater quality nearly 400 groundwater samples were collected and 23 indicators were analyzed in the prd 83 groundwater was drinkable good quality by using a fuzzy synthetic evaluation method groundwater in karst aquifers was drinkable and its quality was better than those in granular and fissured aquifers in the latter two aquifer types groundwater quality in non urbanized areas was much better than those in peri urban and urbanized areas in granular aquifers mn fe i ni mn and mn as i were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas peri urban areas and non urbanized areas respectively correspondingly reductive dissolution of fe mn oxy hydroxides infiltration of industrial wastewater and reductive dissolution of i and mn and reductive dissolution of mn as and i were likely responsible for poor quality groundwater in these areas respectively by contrast in fissured aquifers no3 no3 pb and i were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas peri urban areas and non urbanized areas respectively correspondingly infiltration of domestic sewage infiltration of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater and mineralization of i rich organic matter were probably responsible for poor quality groundwater in these areas respectively industrialization was one of the main driving forces for groundwater quality in granular and fissured aquifers in peri urban areas while urbanization was one of the main driving forces for groundwater quality in fissured aquifers in urbanized and peri urban areas in the prd keywords groundwater quality pearl river delta urbanization expansion fuzzy synthetic evaluation granular aquifers fissured aquifers 1 introduction pearl river delta prd is one of the most important economic zones in china rapid urbanization and industrialization in this area has occurred during the last decades correspondingly the expansion of construction land in the prd has shown rapidly for example the area occupied by construction land in the prd had increased to 6816 km2 in 2006 more than two times of that in 1988 ye et al 2013 urbanization and industrialization are usually powerful forces for the change of environment huang et al 2018a zhang and mcsaveney 2018 they have accelerated the contamination and deterioration of surface water quality in the prd huang et al 2013a by contrast abundant groundwater is stored in aquifers and it is free of charge in this area huang et al 2013b as a result groundwater resource becomes more important and the groundwater quality assessment and management are the important issues in the prd that has undergone three decades of urbanization and industrialization moreover the influence of urbanization and industrialization on the groundwater quality in the prd should be understood because urbanization and industrialization are the most environmental changes in this area however the groundwater quality in the prd on a regional scale remains unclear and the effects of urbanization and industrialization on the groundwater quality in the prd have received little attention in this study 399 groundwater samples were collected from the prd 23 indicators in groundwater samples were used to evaluate the groundwater quality the groundwater quality was evaluated by a method of fuzzy synthetic evaluation fse dahiya et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 venkatramanan et al 2015 the objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of groundwater quality in various aquifers and areas with different urbanization levels of the prd to extract the main impact indicators from water quality indicators related to the poor quality groundwater and to discuss the driving forces for groundwater quality moreover the effects of urbanization and industrialization on the groundwater quality in the prd at a regional scale were evaluated qualitatively the conclusions would improve groundwater management and increase the availability of good quality groundwater for sustainable development in the prd 2 study area 2 1 geographical geological and hydrogeological conditions the prd was formed as a result of the tibetan plateau uplift during the tertiary and quaternary periods and is located in southern china fig 1 it has a total area of 41 698 km2 with a population of over 57 million in 2016 the east river west river and north river merge in the south of the area and form the pearl river which finally discharges into the south china sea the central and southern parts of the prd are mostly covered by quaternary sediments quaternary sediments consist of two terrestrial sequences and two marine sequences interbedded with each other zong et al 2009 the younger marine sequence has an elevation above 20 m and the older marine sequence is located between 15 m and 40 m fig 1 the younger terrestrial sequence can be sandy fluvial deposits or clayey silt the older terrestrial sequence is dominated by sand and gravel jiao et al 2010 groundwater in quaternary sediments is recharged by vertical infiltration from precipitation and agricultural irrigation and the lateral flow of bedrock groundwater in hilly regions fig 2 the bedrocks include limestone mudstone sandstone shale dolomite granite and gneiss ranging in age from cambrian to tertiary and crop out in the hilly areas in the prd fig 3 among them limestone mudstone and sandstone formed from devonian to jurassic are dominant ghst 1981 aquifers in these areas are mainly associated with fractures and with springs discharging up to hundreds cubic meters per day karst aquifers account for less than 10 of the total area and are around the prd plain while the groundwater yield can be as high as thousands of cubic meters per day the general direction of regional groundwater flow in the aquifers of the prd follows roughly the major river flow which is from northwest and northeast to the coast fig 2 2 2 expansion of urbanization and industrial activities characteristics the prd promoted rural urbanization and industrialization during the last decades correspondingly the increases of construction land in the prd were 0 5 times from 1988 to 1998 and from 1998 to 2006 respectively ye et al 2013 the urbanization expansion was characterized by numerous factories a high proportion of non local population and a lack of sewer systems especially in newly formed peri urban areas huang et al 2013a in contrast only a small number of factories were built on the urbanized areas formed before 1988 huang et al 2018a as a result factories near rivers directly discharged wastewater into rivers illegally in these newly formed urbanized areas and wastewater infiltration into groundwater commonly occurred in these newly formed peri urban areas huang et al 2018b 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection groundwater samples were collected from three aquifer types 257 wells in granular aquifers 132 wells in fissured aquifers and 10 wells in karst aquifers and the sampling densities were 30 50 samples and 5 10 samples for every thousand square kilometers in plain and hilly regions respectively two 250 ml polyethylene bottles were used to store groundwater for the analysis of trace elements and other inorganic chemicals one bottle used for trace elements analysis was acidified with nitric acid to a ph of less than 2 all samples were stored at 4 c until laboratory procedures could be performed groundwater tables were measured using a dip meter by once during the sampling period wet season it is worth mentioning that groundwater was collected from shallow aquifers and the groundwater tables were within 6 m in depth table s1 3 2 analytical techniques all analyses were carried out at the groundwater mineral water and environmental monitoring center of the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology chinese academy of geological sciences metal ions and trace elements na fe mn cu zn se as crvi pb be ni ba co hg cd were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7500ce icp ms tokyo japan total hardness th was measured by edta titration method nh4 and anions no3 so4 2 cl no2 f i were carried out on ion chromatography ic shimadzu lc 10advp japan to assure data quality for indicators each groundwater sample was analyzed in triplicate sample batches were regularly interspersed with standards and blanks and all data were corrected for instrument drift the relative errors were less than 6 for all analyzed indicators 3 3 fuzzy synthetic evaluation fse method fuzzy sets and fuzzy optimization provide a useful technique in addressing the imprecision of groundwater quality assessment zhang et al 2012 in this study the fuzzy membership function was used to assess groundwater quality according to the groundwater quality standards of china table s2 general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china gaqsiqprc 2017 to reduce the complexity of the model the linear membership functions are used as follows 1 r ij 0 c i s ij 1 o r c i s ij 1 c i s ij 1 s ij s ij 1 s ij 1 c i s ij s ij 1 c i s ij 1 s ij s ij c i s ij 1 1 c i s i where r ij indicates the fuzzy membership of indicator i to class j every indicator is characterized by five classes i ii iii iv v according to the groundwater quality standards of china gaqsiqprc 2017 c i stands for analytical value of groundwater quality indicator i s ij stands for the allowable value of groundwater quality indicator the fuzzy membership matrix r consists of groundwater quality indicators and classes other details related to the fse method are in section 3 3 of supporting information si zhang et al 2012 liu et al 2016 3 4 principal components analysis pca concentrations of some indicators in groundwater above the allowable values probably lead to the poor quality groundwater we need to know which ones are the main impact indicators it is known that pca is a useful tool for data reduction and parameters in the same pc with positive loadings mean a same origin or similar geochemical behaviors huang et al 2014 2018b thus in this study pca was used to reduce the indicators and extract the main impact indicators in the same pc with results of groundwater quality assessment which are responsible for the poor quality groundwater in the pca the rotation of principal components pcs was carried out using the varimax method and only pcs with eigenvalues that exceed one were retained for analyses this study selected the maximum absolute pc loading of one index to evaluate the relationships between the pcs and indicators the spss release 23 0 spss inc chicago usa was used to analyze the groundwater quality data 4 results and discussion 4 1 characteristics of groundwater quality indicators the descriptive statistics for the indicators analyzed in groundwater samples in the prd are summarized in table 1 th ranged from 4 9 mg l to 1040 8 mg l with the median of 93 5 mg l among anions in groundwater of the prd cl showed the highest median concentration of 29 9 mg l followed by no3 so4 2 f no2 and i high concentrations of nh4 occurred in groundwater in the prd and up to 60 mg l na was a range of 0 5 mg l to 1008 8 mg l with the median of 19 1 mg l among trace metal loid s in groundwater of the prd fe showed the highest median concentration of 0 06 mg l followed by mn ba zn pb cu as se co be ni cd crvi and hg according to the standard for groundwater quality of china gaqsiqprc 2017 the percent of groundwater samples with the concentrations of indicators exceeded the allowable values pev for drinking purpose are also in table 1 in the prd mn showed the highest pev of 35 6 followed by fe nh4 i no3 as pb no2 cl na th be so4 2 f ni ba zn se hg while the pevs of other four indicators were zero 4 2 distribution of groundwater quality the groundwater quality was evaluated by the fse method and classified into five classes according to the groundwater quality standards of china table s2 gaqsiqprc 2017 the assessment parameters were concentrations of 19 indicators while other four indicators cu co crvi cd with zero pevs were not included table 1 in the prd the percentages of classes i ii iii iv and v of groundwater samples were 54 4 7 3 21 3 3 5 and 13 5 respectively fig 4 of the total groundwater samples 83 samples were good quality and drinkable classes i ii and iii while 17 samples were poor quality and undrinkable classes iv and v it is worth mentioning that the result for groundwater quality in this study is qualitative but not quantitative because only about 400 samples from such a large area in addition the result for groundwater quality is based on the concentrations of 23 inorganic chemicals in this study while organic chemicals and other inorganic chemicals were not included 4 2 1 groundwater quality in various aquifers groundwater quality in various aquifers was shown in figs 4 and 5 groundwater quality in granular aquifers was grouped into five classes the number of samples within the classes i ii iii iv and v accounts for 47 4 7 8 23 0 3 5 and 18 3 respectively and 78 2 samples in granular aquifers were suitable for drinking groundwater quality in fissured aquifers was also classified into five classes the contributions of classes i ii iii iv and v were 65 2 6 8 18 9 3 8 and 5 3 respectively and 90 9 groundwater samples in fissured aquifers were drinkable by contrast groundwater quality in karst aquifers was grouped into classes i and iii accounting for 90 and 10 respectively and all groundwater samples in karst aquifers were drinkable consequently in the prd groundwater quality in karst aquifers was the best in fissured aquifers was the second and in granular aquifers was the worst it is known that various aquifers in the prd are in areas with different urbanization levels huang et al 2018b in other words the above results of the groundwater quality assessment in various aquifers may include the contribution of urbanization therefore to eliminate the contribution of urbanization the groundwater quality in various aquifers was discussed based on the groundwater samples collected from non urbanized areas in granular aquifers groundwater quality in non urbanized areas was grouped into four classes the contributions of classes i ii iii and v were 62 7 1 5 20 9 and 14 9 respectively and about 85 groundwater samples were drinkable fig 4 by contrast in fissured aquifers groundwater quality in non urbanized areas was grouped into five classes the contributions of classes i ii iii iv and v were 72 6 6 8 15 1 1 4 and 4 1 respectively and nearly 95 groundwater samples were drinkable fig 4 consequently after removing the contribution of urbanization groundwater quality in fissured aquifers was also better than that in granular aquifers due to the higher proportion of groundwater samples with poor quality in granular aquifers in non urbanized areas it is worth mentioning that groundwater quality in karst aquifers in areas with different urbanization levels was not discussed because samples collected from karst aquifers were too few 4 2 2 groundwater quality in areas with different urbanization levels groundwater quality in areas with different urbanization levels was exhibited in figs 4 and 6 the contributions of classes i ii iii iv and v for groundwater quality in urbanized areas were 39 2 8 8 31 1 4 7 and 16 2 respectively and 20 9 groundwater samples in urbanized areas were undrinkable groundwater quality in peri urban areas was grouped into i ii iii iv and v classes accounting for 56 4 9 3 13 0 5 6 and 15 7 respectively and 21 3 groundwater samples in peri urban areas were unsuitable for drinking similarly groundwater quality in non urbanized areas was also classified into five classes and contributions of classes i ii iii iv and v were 68 5 4 2 17 5 0 7 and 9 1 respectively and 9 8 groundwater samples in non urbanized areas were undrinkable as a result in the prd groundwater quality in urbanized and peri urban areas was close and both of them were significantly worse than that in non urbanized areas however the above results of groundwater quality assessment in areas with different urbanization levels include the contribution of different aquifer types thus we further to discuss the groundwater quality in a same aquifer type in areas with different urbanization levels to eliminate the contribution of different aquifer types in granular aquifers the proportions of poor quality groundwater samples in urbanized areas 24 6 and peri urban areas 23 8 were close fig 4 by contrast in fissured aquifers the proportion of poor quality groundwater samples in urbanized areas 12 5 was significantly lower than that in peri urban areas 15 8 in both of granular and fissured aquifers the proportions of poor quality groundwater samples in urbanized and peri urban areas were much higher than that in non urbanized areas fig 4 indicating a remarkable influence of urbanization on the groundwater quality in granular and fissured aquifers in the prd groundwater quality in urbanized areas formed at different periods was further investigated figs 4 and 6 in urbanized areas formed before 1988 the contributions of classes i ii iii iv and v for groundwater quality were 47 5 5 22 5 2 5 and 22 5 respectively and 25 groundwater samples in these areas were undrinkable in urbanized areas formed at 1988 1998 the percentages of classes i ii iii iv and v for groundwater quality were 30 9 11 9 31 0 9 5 and 16 7 and 26 2 groundwater samples in these areas were unsuitable for drinking similarly groundwater quality in urbanized areas formed at 1998 2006 was also grouped into five classes and the percentages of classes i ii iii iv and v were 39 4 9 1 36 4 3 0 and 12 1 respectively and 15 1 groundwater samples in these areas were undrinkable as a consequence in the prd groundwater quality in urbanized areas formed before 1988 and at 1988 1998 was close and both of them were significantly worse than that in urbanized areas formed at 1998 2006 4 3 main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater 4 3 1 main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in various aquifers parameters in pca include indicators with pevs 0 and the result of groundwater quality assessment rgqa therefore 20 parameters in granular aquifers and 10 parameters in fissured aquifers were selected tables s3 and s4 no impact indicator in karst aquifers was discussed because groundwater in karst aquifers was drinkable in granular aquifers a seven factor model controlled the groundwater quality indicators and rgqa and the cumulative variance by the seven pcs was 68 6 table 2 pc4 explained 9 4 of the total variance with moderate positive loadings of no2 nh4 and rgqa and weak positive loading of mn indicating that no2 nh4 and mn were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers in the prd after removing the contribution of urbanization groundwater quality indicators and rgqa in granular aquifers in non urbanized areas were controlled by a three factor model table 3 pc2 consists of strong positive loadings of rgqa and mn and moderate positive loadings of as and i accounted for 18 9 of the total variance this indicates that mn as and i were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers in non urbanized areas in the prd by contrast the groundwater quality indicators and rgqa in fissured aquifers were controlled by a four factor model table 4 pc2 which comprises strong positive loading of no3 moderate positive loadings of rgqa and pb and weak positive loading of be this indicates that no3 pb and be were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers in the prd after removing the contribution of urbanization a three factor model controlled groundwater quality indicators and rgqa in fissured aquifers in non urbanized areas table 5 pc3 consists of strong positive loading of i and moderate positive loading of rgqa indicating that i was the main impact indicator for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers in non urbanized areas in the prd 4 3 2 main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in areas with different urbanization levels in urbanized areas a seven factor model and a five factor model controlled the groundwater quality indicators and rgqa of granular aquifers and fissured aquifers tables 2 and 4 respectively rgqa was accompanied with mn and fe in the same pc with positive loadings in granular aquifers table 2 while that was accompanied with no3 in the same pc with positive loadings in fissured aquifers table 4 this indicates that in urbanized areas mn and fe were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers while no3 was the main impact indicator for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers differing from urbanized areas a five factor model and a two factor model controlled the groundwater quality indicators and rgqa of granular aquifers and fissured aquifers in peri urban areas tables 3 and 5 respectively rgqa was accompanied with i ni and mn in the same pc with positive loadings in granular aquifers table 3 while that was accompanied with no3 and pb in the same pc with positive loadings in fissured aquifers table 5 this indicates that in peri urban areas i ni and mn were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers while no3 and pb were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers main impact indicators of groundwater quality in urbanized areas formed at different periods were further investigated a five factor model a six factor model and a four factor model controlled the groundwater quality indicators and rgqa in urbanized areas formed at 1998 2006 at 1988 1998 and before 1988 respectively table s5 rgqa was accompanied with fe mn and hg in the same pc with positive loadings in urbanized areas formed at 1998 2006 indicating that fe mn and hg were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas formed at 1998 2006 by contrast nh4 no2 and mn were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas formed at 1988 1998 because rgqa was accompanied with nh4 no2 and mn in the same pc with positive loadings in urbanized areas formed at 1988 1998 mn and rgqa in the same pc with positive loadings in urbanized areas formed before 1988 indicating that mn was the main impact indicator for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas formed before 1988 4 4 driving forces for poor quality groundwater 4 4 1 driving forces for poor quality groundwater in various aquifers as mentioned previously after eliminating the contribution of urbanization mn as and i were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers in the prd table 3 it is known that terrestrial detrital deposits were the major sources of solid mn and as in quaternary sediments of the prd and solid as was mainly associated with fe and mn hydr oxides ghst 1981 wang et al 2012 by contrast marine deposits were likely to the major sources of solid iodine in quaternary sediments because abundant organic matter such as i rich organic matter is in marine sequences of the prd wang et al 2012 hou et al 2018 jiao et al 2010 reported that marine sequences overlaid terrestrial sequences were characterized by abundant organic matter and reducing environment in the prd leading to the mineralization of organic matter including i rich organic matter and the reduction of fe and mn hydr oxides wang et al 2012 consequently the release of i mn and as in quaternary sediments of the prd was expected because the iodine in marine sequences was commonly associated with organic matter such as humic substances francois 1987 and as in sediments was mainly associated with fe and mn hydr oxides wang et al 2012 some evidences have supported the above conclusions for example groundwater in granular aquifers of the prd was characterized by eh 300 mv and ph 7 8 hou et al 2018 huang et al 2018a indicating that the form of mn in groundwater of granular aquifers was soluble mn ii because mn occurs mainly as the reduced soluble mn ii at ph 8 and at eh 500 mv homoncik et al 2010 thus the reduction of mn from insoluble mn iv to soluble mn ii occurred in granular aquifers in addition in granular aquifers mean and maximum concentrations of i in no3 type groundwater were much lower than those in other three types groundwater table s6 indicating that high concentration of i in groundwater of granular aquifers was probably geogenic sources but not anthropogenic sources because the occurrence of no3 type in groundwater of the prd originated from several human activities such as the infiltration of domestic sewage and fertilizers zhang et al 2015 huang et al 2018a therefore we speculate that naturally reductive dissolution of mn and as in sediments and mineralization of i rich organic matter in marine sequences overlaid granular aquifers are the main driving forces for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers in non urbanized areas in the prd by contrast in fissured aquifers in non urbanized areas i was the main impact indicator for poor quality groundwater mentioned before it is known that oxidation of organic matter is commonly responsible for the high concentration of i in groundwater of carbonate aquifers edmunds et al 1989 similarly high concentration of i in groundwater of fissured aquifers in the prd is also probably derived from the decomposition of i rich organic matter because mostly groundwater with high concentration of i in fissured aquifers in the prd showed ca hco3 type sun et al 2009 consequently naturally decomposition of i rich organic matter in fissured aquifers is likely the main driving force for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers in non urbanized areas in the prd 4 4 2 driving forces for poor quality groundwater in areas with different urbanization levels as mentioned above mn and fe were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers in urbanized areas it is known that formation of reducing condition by the mineralization of organic matter resulted in the reductive dissolution of fe mn oxy hydroxides in granular aquifers in the prd jiao et al 2010 huang et al 2018a thus naturally reductive dissolution of fe mn oxy hydroxides in granular aquifers is probably the main driving force for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers in urbanized areas in the prd by contrast no3 was the main impact indicator for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers in urbanized areas in fissured aquifers of the prd mean concentration of groundwater no3 in urbanized areas was about 1 7 times of that in non urbanized areas and the pev of groundwater no3 in urbanized areas was also more than double times of that in non urbanized areas table s7 in addition a couple of previously studies pointed out that high concentration of no3 in groundwater in urbanized areas in the prd was mainly derived from the infiltration of domestic sewage during the urbanization zhang et al 2015 huang et al 2018a due to a large production of domestic sewage and lacking of sewer systems in newly formed peri urban areas in the prd huang et al 2013a therefore urbanization accompanied with the infiltration of domestic sewage should be the main driving force for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers in urbanized areas in the prd different to urbanized areas i ni and mn were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers in peri urban areas mentioned before it is known that high concentration of ni in groundwater in the prd was derived from the infiltration of industrial wastewater because numerous factories formed in peri urban areas and wastewater infiltration into groundwater commonly occurred in these areas in the prd huang et al 2018b as a consequence both of naturally reductive dissolution of i and mn in quaternary sediments and the industrialization accompanied by the infiltration of industrial wastewater were the two main driving forces for poor quality groundwater in granular aquifers in peri urban areas in the prd by contrast no3 and pb were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers in peri urban areas on the one hand as it can be seen from fig s1 more than 60 groundwater with high concentrations of pb 0 01 mg l was located on peri urban areas where a large number of small factories such as printing and dyeing factories were also located sun et al 2009 wastewater containing high concentrations of pb from these factories was directly discharged into the nearby ground surface due to lacking of effective sewer systems in peri urban areas huang et al 2013a moreover fissured aquifers with high concentrations of groundwater pb in peri urban areas were characterized by acidic groundwater ph 4 16 to 5 37 and it is beneficial to pb with soluble forms in groundwater thus it can be concluded that high concentrations of groundwater pb in fissured aquifers in peri urban areas originated from the infiltration of industrial wastewater on the other hand as it can be seen from table s7 in fissured aquifers of the prd mean concentration of groundwater no3 in peri urban areas was approximately 1 7 times of that in non urbanized areas and the pev of groundwater no3 in peri urban areas was about two times of that in non urbanized areas in addition it is known that more than 70 groundwater with no3 type occurred in peri urban areas huang et al 2018a and a large amount of no3 rich domestic sewage produced by local population was commonly discharged into the nearby ground surface directly due to lacking of sewer systems in peri urban areas huang et al 2013a consequently it can be inferred that high concentrations of groundwater no3 in fissured aquifers in peri urban areas mainly originated from the infiltration of domestic sewage therefore urbanization accompanied with the infiltration of domestic sewage and the industrialization accompanied by the infiltration of industrial wastewater were the two main driving forces for poor quality groundwater in fissured aquifers in peri urban areas in the prd as mentioned before mn nh4 no2 mn fe mn hg were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas formed before 1988 formed at 1988 1998 and formed at 1998 2006 respectively it is known that high concentration of nh4 in groundwater in the prd mainly originated from the degradation of organic nitrogen in the aquitard overlaying the granular aquifers in the prd jiao et al 2010 huang et al 2018a it is also known that the infiltration of domestic sewage was responsible for the high concentration of no2 in groundwater in urbanized areas in the prd because leakage of sewage pipes occurred frequently in urbanized areas and the mean concentration of groundwater no2 in urbanized areas was more than three times higher than that in non urbanized areas in the prd sun et al 2009 meanwhile it is known that the infiltration of industrial wastewater was responsible for the high concentration of hg in groundwater in urbanized areas in the prd because numerous factories formed in newly formed urbanized areas and the infiltration of industrial wastewater occurred in these areas in the prd huang et al 2018b therefore we speculate that naturally reductive dissolution of mn oxy hydroxides in quaternary sediments was the main driving force for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas formed before 1988 in the prd both of the infiltration of domestic sewage and naturally reductive dissolution of mn oxy hydroxides and degradation of organic nitrogen in quaternary sediments were the main driving forces for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas formed at 1988 1998 in the prd and both of naturally reductive dissolution of fe mn oxy hydroxides in quaternary sediments and the infiltration of industrial wastewater were the main driving forces for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas formed at 1998 2006 in the prd in addition groundwater table depth may be an important factor controlling the concentrations of some impact indicators in groundwater especially in urbanized areas because the concentrations of some contaminants in groundwater often decrease with the increase of the depth when groundwater contaminants originated from ground surface correspondingly the relationship between groundwater table depth and the concentrations of some impact indicators in this area was investigated fig 7 however none significant correlation between them was observed indicating that depth was likely to be a secondary factor but not the main one on controlling groundwater quality in the prd 5 conclusions groundwater quality in various aquifers and areas with different urbanization levels in the prd was evaluated by a fse method groundwater in karst aquifers was drinkable good quality while 9 1 groundwater in fissured aquifers and 21 8 groundwater in granular aquifers were poor quality in both of granular and fissured aquifers groundwater quality in non urbanized areas was better than those in peri urban and urbanized areas main impact indicators related to the poor quality groundwater were extracted by a pca method in granular aquifers mn fe i ni mn and mn as i were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas peri urban areas and non urbanized areas respectively correspondingly the reductive dissolution of fe mn oxy hydroxides the infiltration of industrial wastewater and the reductive dissolution of i and mn and the reductive dissolution of mn as and i were likely responsible for poor quality groundwater in these areas respectively by contrast in fissured aquifers no3 no3 pb and i were the main impact indicators for poor quality groundwater in urbanized areas peri urban areas and non urbanized areas respectively correspondingly the infiltration of domestic sewage the infiltration of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater and the mineralization of i rich organic matter were probably responsible for poor quality groundwater in these areas respectively industrialization accompanied by the infiltration of industrial wastewater was one of the main driving forces for groundwater quality in granular and fissured aquifers in peri urban areas while urbanization accompanied with the infiltration of domestic sewage was one of the main driving forces for groundwater quality in fissured aquifers in urbanized and peri urban areas in the prd therefore the local governmental agencies should pay more attention to the contamination prevention of groundwater in peri urban areas during the urbanization and industrialization as well as in urbanized areas where occurs fissured aquifers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

6258,the changes in runoff and sediment load due to various approaches in land use management have recently received considerable attention in the present paper the impact of land use change under collaborative management framework on water and sediment load was investigated by combined usage of hydrologic modelling and land use maps three groups of stakeholders viz residents policy makers and executive organizations were involved in decision making process three prioritization procedures of condorcet borda scoring and fallback bargaining were elected to rank sub watersheds and managerial practices the impact of different managerial scenarios was assessed by applying time area concept and through analyzing changes in important components of output hydrographs and sediment graphs results demonstrated significant agreement among stakeholder s attitudes and quantitative outcomes the results illustrated obvious impact on runoff and sediment resulted from scenarios for land use management so that the impact on sediment load with maximum reduction benefit of 19 41 was significantly greater than that of runoff with maximum reduction benefit of 8 07 manipulation of farmlands and poor rangelands and afforestation caused recognizable reduction on runoff and sediment rangelands restoration also satisfied socioeconomic status and environmental criterion of the study area considering basic differences in prioritization procedures there were considerable agreement among stakeholders in land use management and practice prioritization the results further indicated that the watershed management projects should focus on remediation of vegetation cover of the rangelands which simultaneously tackles land degradation and improves economic condition however the present study revealed lack of proper connection between residents and authorities nevertheless as a pioneer comanagement endeavor the present qualitative and quantitative results facilitate group decision making and participated planning procedure at the watershed scale keywords integrated watershed management land use planning rainfall runoff modeling soil and water conservation sustainable development 1 introduction different types of land degradation alter hydrological behaviors of the watersheds can cause soil erosion and lead to endangering ecosystems lørup et al 1998 sillanpää and koivusalo 2015 changes in land use and climate are considered as long term factors affecting land degradation and features van oost et al 2000 wei et al 2007 bakker et al 2008 wei et al 2009 fiener et al 2011 these changes often have important effects on the hydrologic dynamics as well as sediment production transport and delivery to rivers rey 2003 studying impact of land use change as main driving force of land degradation provides invaluable information about water resource management and land use planning strategies assessments of the hydrological responses to land different managerial scenarios are therefore valuable for watershed management yan et al 2013 numerous researches e g collins and bras 2008 garcía ruiz et al 2008 morán tejeda et al 2010 mango et al 2011 cornelissen et al 2013 zuo et al 2016 bhaskar et al 2017 rogger et al 2017 trang et al 2017 abbott et al 2018 christanto et al 2018 yaghmaei et al 2018 yang and lu 2018 have discussed the impacts of land use changes resulted from various managerial approaches on hydrological processes the outcomes of the previously mentioned miss managements of land use were summarized in reduction in low flow exacerbation of soil erosion increasing sediment concentration severity of floods temporal variation of sediment yield and runoff regime and decreasing underground water level since anthropogenic activities play important role in quantity and quality of land resources interfaces with society are part of the integrated treatment in watershed management blöschl et al 2019 integrated watershed management therefore requires stakeholders commitment and scenario oriented studies such approaches develop group decision making process with the support of quantitative assessment ronfort et al 2011 podolak et al 2017 also reported the advantages of the group decision making approaches and scenario based modeling and acclaimed that collaborative process informs the type amount and location of conservation investment in addition kolb and galicia 2018 considered land use and land cover scenarios with contribution of stakeholders they highlighted considerable reduction of land degradation through comanagement process the possibility of making competent land use policy using a comanagement based game theory framework has also been successfully reported by adhami et al 2018 comanagment scenario based analysis at watershed scale are practicable through coupling social studies statistical methods and hydrological models brown et al 2005 archer 2007 li et al 2009 zhao et al 2012 mathematical simulation of hydrological cycles are therefore essential for understanding natural managerial and hydrological elements interactions accordingly some models such as the water erosion prediction project wepp fernández and vega 2018 swat jordan et al 2014 and the hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf xie et al 2019 have been used as the main tools for impact assessment of land use change on runoff and sediment yields simultaneously with hydrologic modelling geographic information systems gis as a supplementary tool was integrated with surface runoff models for the better investigation of physical processes saghafian et al 2000 melesse et al 2003 among many existing hydrologic models the time area ta rainfall runoff model simulates watershed hydrologic response to excess rainfall hyetograph through partitioning the watershed into sub areas the sub division of the whole watershed depends on travel time and the developed ta map which itself is mainly controlled by land surface conditions majorly reflected through land use singh 1988 odeh et al 2015 her and heatwole 2016 sabzevari 2017 it therefore produces the time area histogram tah for the calculation of water on each sub area translated to the watershed outlet as a sequence of the travel time in order to survey the effect of management practices extracted from group decision making process on main characteristics of hydrological behavior of the watershed the current study aimed to use ta hydrologic model in the galazchai watershed west azerbaijan iran a qualitative section was organized using collaborative management framework it was then assessed quantitatively by hydrologic modelling it has been hypothesized that the collaborative management scenarios could differently affect runoff and sediment yield of the study watershed based on which adaptive managerial decisions can be made 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the galazchai watershed located in oshnavieh town west azarbaijan province iran with an area of ca 103 km2 main stream length of 19 3 km and slope of some 32 extends between 44 56 and 45 35 e and 37 01 and 37 09 n fig 1 the elevation of the watershed ranges from 1480 to 3300 m above mean sea level the mean annual precipitation at oshnavieh meteorological station located immediate downstream of the main outlet is 482 mm for the dataset from 1981 to 2010 ab banan azardasht engineering consulting inc 2010 the climate of the study watershed is semi arid with annual average temperature is 11 8 c sadeghi et al 2015 rangelands forest rainfed farming irrigated farming and residential area respectively occupies some 87 4 5 3 5 0 4 7 and 0 6 km2 of the study watershed the mean annual and the maximum observed discharges of the galazchai river are 1 64 and 7 24 m3 s 1 respectively the maximum accessible storm hyetographs and concurrent hydrographs were obtained from the oshnavieh recording rain gauge and the galazchai river gauge stations fig 1 sadeghi et al 2015 2 2 formulating collaborative management the collaborative management framework was formed for the study watershed adhami et al 2018 to negotiate among different stakeholders three groups of relevant beneficiaries local residents political officials and executive organizations were involved to prioritize 13 study sub watersheds afterwards they were asked to suggest management measures to improve socioeconomic condition and natural resources status of the study watershed the initial information were collected during three months through face to face interviews the preferences of the stakeholders were prioritized applying three game theory based algorithms of condorcet borda scoring and fallback bargaining due to high efficiency multipurpose application and transparent procedure adhami et al 2016 besides elected methods are useful for different goals in different societies three mentioned algorithms were used to arrange the candidates sub watersheds and management practices in three groups of stakeholders separately 2 2 1 condorcet procedure the condorcet procedure aims to organize group choice involving all individual priorities current function revealed the preferred options by examining all the pairwise comparisons of the alternatives for each individual a total of n n 1 2 comparisons for n alternatives elkind et al 2011 a condorcet winner is an alternative with the highest preferable for the majority of the participants sheikhmohammady et al 2010 the winner alternative dominates the other choices in a head to head comparison the score for an alternative is inclined by the number of times in which the alternative is ranked higher than the other that is oi aj ak 1 if and only if aj i ak and o aj is summed over n alternatives and m individuals 1 o a j i 1 m k 1 n o i a j a k below rows are supposed the preferences of three voters from high to low level voter 1 a b c voter 2 b a c voter 3 c b a due to above arrangement the condorcet matrix frames compromise the following framework a a b c b a b b c a b b based upon pair comparisons the presence of each alternative emphasizes dominant of that case to other one the winner is identified according to the number of presences of candidates adhami et al 2016 in the given example candidate with the symbol of b with scores of 4 is the winner 2 2 2 borda scoring procedure in the borda scoring method each voter stakeholder provides a linear arrangement of the candidates each candidate n according to its priority from each voter s perspective was assigned a score the scores include 0 to n the candidate which is ranked first the highest priority earns n and the candidate with second priority gains n 1 the last one with the lowest priority gets 0 the points of alternatives was calculates using eq 2 balinski and laraki 2007 2 b i k n r ik imagine below rows are arrangement of candidates based on their priority from three stakeholders perspectives voter 1 a c b voter 2 b c a voter 3 a b c candidate named a earns 2 0 and 2 from each voter b gets 0 2 and 1 and c gains 1 1 and 0 thereby the total score of a b and c are 4 3 and 2 respectively 2 2 3 fallback bargaining procedure the fallback bargaining procedure focuses on minimizing of dissatisfaction of bargainers stakeholders the bargainers try to retreat from their most preferred status to achieve a unanimous decision mahjouri and bizhani manzar 2013 initially they rank their preferences and with stakeholder and y alternative a x y matrix develops if the consensus is not result then bargainers tart to fall back from their first priority to the second third and so on till an agreement is achieved adhami et al 2016 eventually all 13 sub watersheds and proposed management practices were ranked in three categories i e 1st 2nd and 3rd according to the scores the land use map of the galazchai watershed field survey and standards of the forest rangeland and watershed management organization deputy director of presidential planning and control center were analyzed accordingly restoration and improvement of vegetation in erosion prone areas were defined in different management scenarios in gis environment sadoddin et al 2010 sheikh and mostafazadeh 2010 2 3 generation of the managerial scenarios management scenarios were defined based on three various arrangement of sub watersheds and three categories of management practices resulted from the condorcet borda scoring and fallback bargaining algorithms each used method provided a sub watershed arrangement and a management practice arrangement considering present condition of the study watershed as a separate scenario there were 28 management scenarios given the repetition of some scenarios finally some 14 of them were examined the scenarios consisted of vegetation rehabilitation and ecotourism development practices in different sub watersheds 2 4 data analyses a digital elevation model dem of the study watershed with 20 m cell size was used to derive physical properties i e slope stream length watershed delineation and drainage area in arc gis software environment sreedevi et al 2012 sadeghi et al 2015 23 storm events with various intensities from 0 4 to 2 3 mm h 1 and durations from 3 to 14 h were used for the analyses the fixed line method was also used to separate base flow to obtain direct runoff hydrograph drh liu et al 2013 sadeghi et al 2015 gericke and smithers 2018 the phi index method as a very simple and straightforward in excess rainfall determination was then applied to calculate the total volume of storm period loss distributed uniformly across the storm hydrograph sadeghi and asadi 2010 ajibade and tota maharaj 2018 the total runoff volume for each storm event was determined by integrating the drh once the volume of rainfall excess was determined the corresponding phi index line was determined for each storm event and used to the rainfall pattern das 2000 sadeghi et al 2015 2 5 application of hydrologic model the storage attenuation coefficient h representing the storage characteristic of stream channel was determined by dividing the discharge at the point of inflection of the surface runoff hydrograph by the rate of change of discharge slope of the hydrograph at the inflection point as shown in eq 3 subramanya 2000 3 k q dq d t where k is storage coefficient h q is the starting discharge of the time interval m3 s 1 dq is the discharge after time interval m3 s 1 and dt is time interval h spatially distributed travel time method with the help of dem with 20 m grid digital map were used to develop tahs for the clark s instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh model gad 2013 the kinematic wave travel time equation suggested by welle and woodward 1986 was then used to compute travel time for overland flow according to eq 4 martin and mccutcheon 2018 4 tt kc i 0 4 nl s 0 6 where tt is surface flow travel time min kc is a coefficient for unit conversion equals to 6 943 n is roughness coefficient l is flow length m i is rainfall intensity mm h 1 for 2 year return period and 24 h duration and s is surface slope m m 1 the slope slgrid and the flow direction fldrgrid were developed using dem youssef et al 2011 the land use data were initially obtained from the west azarbaijan province general office of natural resources iran and checked by available data reported by former studies mostafazadeh et al 2015 sadeghi et al 2015 saeidi et al 2016 the travel time was calculated using the spatially distributed method based on the manning s roughness coefficient thus the manning s n grid was also prepared using the land use raster grid for the watershed lugrid and the modified roughness coefficient table suggested by engman 1986 and chow et al 1988 the travel time and flow velocity of each grid cell were then calculated according to the cell size of the raster data set using raster gis arcmap 9 3 version and archydro tools were also used for processing the terrain layers the inverse velocity grid and flow direction grids were applied as a weight grid to compute flow length grid of the study watershed usul and yilmaz 2002 hunukumbura et al 2007 the produced tahs were applied as inputs to the clark flow routing model the concept of linear reservoir model was used with considering movement effect and storage coefficient saghafian et al 2002 using eq 5 sadeghi et al 2009 5 i i 2 78 a i δ t c where ii is input discharge in every time interval m3 s 1 ai is contributing area in runoff production km2 and δtc is base time interval of iuh h subsequently flow routing was done using the muskingum method eq 6 and the amounts of iuh were then calculated kumar et al 2002 6 q 2 δ t c k 0 5 δ t c i 1 k 0 5 δ t c k 0 5 δ t c q 1 where δtc is concentration time of each isochrone section h i1 and q1 are primary input and output flow m3 s 1 respectively and q2 is the outflow after t1 time interval m3 s 1 k is the storage coefficient of the study watershed h and was calculated using graphic method chow et al 1988 based on eq 7 7 k δ t ln q 0 q t where q0 is discharge of beginning of time interval m3 s 1 qt is discharge after a logarithmic time base m3 s 1 and δt is time interval h subramanya 2000 then the prepared iuh changed to unit hydrograph of 0 25 h and finally direct hydrograph dh was extracted management scenarios were compared in discharge peak time to peak runoff volume and base time of hydrographs in dhs sediment peak average sediment concentration time to peak and sediment volume regarding sediment graphs were also determined to allow comparing the scenarios effects 3 results 3 1 collaborative management the collected data from interviews of 283 residents 163 households of the galaz village and 80 households from zemmeh village 5 experts of executive organizations governmental organizations and 8 policy makers were analyzed with the game theory among 13 sub watersheds gonbad earned the greatest score using condorcet borda scoring and fallback bargaining methods the priority of sub watersheds based on their points gained from each aforementioned procedures is shown in table1 after prioritization of sub watersheds stakeholders were asked to offer measures to betterment of current condition of the study area the offered management practices were then ranked and classified in three categories using three game theory algorithms combination of three categories of sub watersheds and three classes of management practices resulted from three selected method provided managerial scenarios which is shown in table 2 3 2 assessment of managerial scenarios effect on hydrograph and sediment graph based on the 14 remaining scenarios derived from the application of game theory algorithms a new land use map of sub watersheds was prepared scenarios altered roughness coefficients hence corresponding effects on runoff behavior were investigated given that qazan 3 sub watershed has no agricultural land 9th scenario was virtually inaccessible the new 0 25 h isochrones map and tah of the study watershed were produced after incorporating proposed scenarios the plot of tah has been presented in fig 2 it is clearly seen that there are large differences among tahs in fig 2 include the distribution pattern of the isochrone areas sadeghi et al 2015 after extracting the tahs for each management scenario with the help of design rainfall intensity of rain for 24 h with 2 year return 5 11 mmh 1 corresponding hydrographs and sedimentgraphs were simulated fig 3 changes of discharge peak time to peak runoff volume and base time regarding hydrographs and sediment peak average sediment concentration time to peak and sediment volume regarding sediment graphs were calculated and summarized in table 3 to facilitate comparison 4 discussion 4 1 comanagement framework according to table 1 the gonbad sub watershed was important according to both socioeconomic and environmental criteria the both socioeconomically and environmentally criteria discovered the importance of gonbad sub watershed hence addressing the problems of this sub watershed and exploiting its natural potential would satisfy all stakeholders and causes success in the watersheds management brams and kilgour 2001 existing issues in the galazchai watershed soil erosion water pollution flooding soil compaction low efficiency of rangelands enforce to adopt extensive range of managerial practices two main motivation namely economic concerns and environmental aspect were recognizable in providing of suggestions majority of people were struggling with financial difficulties and subsequently proposed options supposed to improve economic status of villagers such suggestions provide the substitute livelihood through rehabilitation of vegetation cover however experts focused on organizational goals reflecting conservation and reclamation of the environment and natural resources it could be concluded that conflict among various stakeholders is resulted from lack in proper inter and intra communications residents suffer inadequate financial facilities and on the opposite side organizational sector focuses on conservation of natural resources undoubtedly current situation necessitates of comanagement approaches the results of horning et al 2016 indicates the importance of residential in every watershed management plan and also believe that this group of stakeholders is seldom considered in most development projects managerial scenarios were established based on comanagement approach involving three groups of stakeholders in sub watershed and management practice prioritization overviewing table 2 demonstrates the importance of vegetation cover in rangelands which cover 85 percent of the study area ab banan azardasht engineering consulting inc 2010 and are the main land use therefore proper management of rangelands lead to erosion control hillsides are the most attractive sites for farmers animal husbandry and conservational areas as well in order to facilitate site and practice selection assessment the contribution of each part in outlet flow was calculated using the time area distributed model gironás et al 2009 4 2 land use change impact assessment according to the information in fig 3 and table 3 consequences of land use change reflected in hydrographs and sediment graphs sediment graphs were influenced more than hydrograph from the scenarios greater impact on the reduction of sediment yield than that of water due to land cover change was reported by zuo et al 2016 as well this phenomena illustrates that in addition to surface runoff s direct impact on sediment transport the concentration of sediment load has double effect on soil degradation arnold et al 2012 the maximum discharge peak reduction happened by applying 2nd reinforcement of vegetation cover in gonbad shinke bi milan 1 milan 2 qazan 1 and qazan 2 6th afforestation in qazan 3 and 10th reinforcement of vegetation cover in havarkhatoun galaz and shive khezal scenarios the scenario 2 applied to about 20 of the study watershed and therefore decreased runoff velocity because of positive effect of vegetation reinforcement this scenario including poor rangelands of the study watershed and reinforcing them motived effects on runoff volume discharge peak total sediment and sediment peak the scenario 6 was the second effective scenario on runoff inhibition this scenario caused maximum increase in roughness coefficient in comparison to the other scenarios the manning s n roughness coefficient used in time area equation varied from 0 12 to 0 8 through afforestation in qazan 3 the third scenario with high impact 5 83 reduction of peak discharge on hydrograph scenario 10 contained rehabilitation of vegetation cover in most parts of the area caused maximum reduction of runoff volume on the other side all included sub watersheds in this scenario were located about the outlet of the study watershed

6258,the changes in runoff and sediment load due to various approaches in land use management have recently received considerable attention in the present paper the impact of land use change under collaborative management framework on water and sediment load was investigated by combined usage of hydrologic modelling and land use maps three groups of stakeholders viz residents policy makers and executive organizations were involved in decision making process three prioritization procedures of condorcet borda scoring and fallback bargaining were elected to rank sub watersheds and managerial practices the impact of different managerial scenarios was assessed by applying time area concept and through analyzing changes in important components of output hydrographs and sediment graphs results demonstrated significant agreement among stakeholder s attitudes and quantitative outcomes the results illustrated obvious impact on runoff and sediment resulted from scenarios for land use management so that the impact on sediment load with maximum reduction benefit of 19 41 was significantly greater than that of runoff with maximum reduction benefit of 8 07 manipulation of farmlands and poor rangelands and afforestation caused recognizable reduction on runoff and sediment rangelands restoration also satisfied socioeconomic status and environmental criterion of the study area considering basic differences in prioritization procedures there were considerable agreement among stakeholders in land use management and practice prioritization the results further indicated that the watershed management projects should focus on remediation of vegetation cover of the rangelands which simultaneously tackles land degradation and improves economic condition however the present study revealed lack of proper connection between residents and authorities nevertheless as a pioneer comanagement endeavor the present qualitative and quantitative results facilitate group decision making and participated planning procedure at the watershed scale keywords integrated watershed management land use planning rainfall runoff modeling soil and water conservation sustainable development 1 introduction different types of land degradation alter hydrological behaviors of the watersheds can cause soil erosion and lead to endangering ecosystems lørup et al 1998 sillanpää and koivusalo 2015 changes in land use and climate are considered as long term factors affecting land degradation and features van oost et al 2000 wei et al 2007 bakker et al 2008 wei et al 2009 fiener et al 2011 these changes often have important effects on the hydrologic dynamics as well as sediment production transport and delivery to rivers rey 2003 studying impact of land use change as main driving force of land degradation provides invaluable information about water resource management and land use planning strategies assessments of the hydrological responses to land different managerial scenarios are therefore valuable for watershed management yan et al 2013 numerous researches e g collins and bras 2008 garcía ruiz et al 2008 morán tejeda et al 2010 mango et al 2011 cornelissen et al 2013 zuo et al 2016 bhaskar et al 2017 rogger et al 2017 trang et al 2017 abbott et al 2018 christanto et al 2018 yaghmaei et al 2018 yang and lu 2018 have discussed the impacts of land use changes resulted from various managerial approaches on hydrological processes the outcomes of the previously mentioned miss managements of land use were summarized in reduction in low flow exacerbation of soil erosion increasing sediment concentration severity of floods temporal variation of sediment yield and runoff regime and decreasing underground water level since anthropogenic activities play important role in quantity and quality of land resources interfaces with society are part of the integrated treatment in watershed management blöschl et al 2019 integrated watershed management therefore requires stakeholders commitment and scenario oriented studies such approaches develop group decision making process with the support of quantitative assessment ronfort et al 2011 podolak et al 2017 also reported the advantages of the group decision making approaches and scenario based modeling and acclaimed that collaborative process informs the type amount and location of conservation investment in addition kolb and galicia 2018 considered land use and land cover scenarios with contribution of stakeholders they highlighted considerable reduction of land degradation through comanagement process the possibility of making competent land use policy using a comanagement based game theory framework has also been successfully reported by adhami et al 2018 comanagment scenario based analysis at watershed scale are practicable through coupling social studies statistical methods and hydrological models brown et al 2005 archer 2007 li et al 2009 zhao et al 2012 mathematical simulation of hydrological cycles are therefore essential for understanding natural managerial and hydrological elements interactions accordingly some models such as the water erosion prediction project wepp fernández and vega 2018 swat jordan et al 2014 and the hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf xie et al 2019 have been used as the main tools for impact assessment of land use change on runoff and sediment yields simultaneously with hydrologic modelling geographic information systems gis as a supplementary tool was integrated with surface runoff models for the better investigation of physical processes saghafian et al 2000 melesse et al 2003 among many existing hydrologic models the time area ta rainfall runoff model simulates watershed hydrologic response to excess rainfall hyetograph through partitioning the watershed into sub areas the sub division of the whole watershed depends on travel time and the developed ta map which itself is mainly controlled by land surface conditions majorly reflected through land use singh 1988 odeh et al 2015 her and heatwole 2016 sabzevari 2017 it therefore produces the time area histogram tah for the calculation of water on each sub area translated to the watershed outlet as a sequence of the travel time in order to survey the effect of management practices extracted from group decision making process on main characteristics of hydrological behavior of the watershed the current study aimed to use ta hydrologic model in the galazchai watershed west azerbaijan iran a qualitative section was organized using collaborative management framework it was then assessed quantitatively by hydrologic modelling it has been hypothesized that the collaborative management scenarios could differently affect runoff and sediment yield of the study watershed based on which adaptive managerial decisions can be made 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the galazchai watershed located in oshnavieh town west azarbaijan province iran with an area of ca 103 km2 main stream length of 19 3 km and slope of some 32 extends between 44 56 and 45 35 e and 37 01 and 37 09 n fig 1 the elevation of the watershed ranges from 1480 to 3300 m above mean sea level the mean annual precipitation at oshnavieh meteorological station located immediate downstream of the main outlet is 482 mm for the dataset from 1981 to 2010 ab banan azardasht engineering consulting inc 2010 the climate of the study watershed is semi arid with annual average temperature is 11 8 c sadeghi et al 2015 rangelands forest rainfed farming irrigated farming and residential area respectively occupies some 87 4 5 3 5 0 4 7 and 0 6 km2 of the study watershed the mean annual and the maximum observed discharges of the galazchai river are 1 64 and 7 24 m3 s 1 respectively the maximum accessible storm hyetographs and concurrent hydrographs were obtained from the oshnavieh recording rain gauge and the galazchai river gauge stations fig 1 sadeghi et al 2015 2 2 formulating collaborative management the collaborative management framework was formed for the study watershed adhami et al 2018 to negotiate among different stakeholders three groups of relevant beneficiaries local residents political officials and executive organizations were involved to prioritize 13 study sub watersheds afterwards they were asked to suggest management measures to improve socioeconomic condition and natural resources status of the study watershed the initial information were collected during three months through face to face interviews the preferences of the stakeholders were prioritized applying three game theory based algorithms of condorcet borda scoring and fallback bargaining due to high efficiency multipurpose application and transparent procedure adhami et al 2016 besides elected methods are useful for different goals in different societies three mentioned algorithms were used to arrange the candidates sub watersheds and management practices in three groups of stakeholders separately 2 2 1 condorcet procedure the condorcet procedure aims to organize group choice involving all individual priorities current function revealed the preferred options by examining all the pairwise comparisons of the alternatives for each individual a total of n n 1 2 comparisons for n alternatives elkind et al 2011 a condorcet winner is an alternative with the highest preferable for the majority of the participants sheikhmohammady et al 2010 the winner alternative dominates the other choices in a head to head comparison the score for an alternative is inclined by the number of times in which the alternative is ranked higher than the other that is oi aj ak 1 if and only if aj i ak and o aj is summed over n alternatives and m individuals 1 o a j i 1 m k 1 n o i a j a k below rows are supposed the preferences of three voters from high to low level voter 1 a b c voter 2 b a c voter 3 c b a due to above arrangement the condorcet matrix frames compromise the following framework a a b c b a b b c a b b based upon pair comparisons the presence of each alternative emphasizes dominant of that case to other one the winner is identified according to the number of presences of candidates adhami et al 2016 in the given example candidate with the symbol of b with scores of 4 is the winner 2 2 2 borda scoring procedure in the borda scoring method each voter stakeholder provides a linear arrangement of the candidates each candidate n according to its priority from each voter s perspective was assigned a score the scores include 0 to n the candidate which is ranked first the highest priority earns n and the candidate with second priority gains n 1 the last one with the lowest priority gets 0 the points of alternatives was calculates using eq 2 balinski and laraki 2007 2 b i k n r ik imagine below rows are arrangement of candidates based on their priority from three stakeholders perspectives voter 1 a c b voter 2 b c a voter 3 a b c candidate named a earns 2 0 and 2 from each voter b gets 0 2 and 1 and c gains 1 1 and 0 thereby the total score of a b and c are 4 3 and 2 respectively 2 2 3 fallback bargaining procedure the fallback bargaining procedure focuses on minimizing of dissatisfaction of bargainers stakeholders the bargainers try to retreat from their most preferred status to achieve a unanimous decision mahjouri and bizhani manzar 2013 initially they rank their preferences and with stakeholder and y alternative a x y matrix develops if the consensus is not result then bargainers tart to fall back from their first priority to the second third and so on till an agreement is achieved adhami et al 2016 eventually all 13 sub watersheds and proposed management practices were ranked in three categories i e 1st 2nd and 3rd according to the scores the land use map of the galazchai watershed field survey and standards of the forest rangeland and watershed management organization deputy director of presidential planning and control center were analyzed accordingly restoration and improvement of vegetation in erosion prone areas were defined in different management scenarios in gis environment sadoddin et al 2010 sheikh and mostafazadeh 2010 2 3 generation of the managerial scenarios management scenarios were defined based on three various arrangement of sub watersheds and three categories of management practices resulted from the condorcet borda scoring and fallback bargaining algorithms each used method provided a sub watershed arrangement and a management practice arrangement considering present condition of the study watershed as a separate scenario there were 28 management scenarios given the repetition of some scenarios finally some 14 of them were examined the scenarios consisted of vegetation rehabilitation and ecotourism development practices in different sub watersheds 2 4 data analyses a digital elevation model dem of the study watershed with 20 m cell size was used to derive physical properties i e slope stream length watershed delineation and drainage area in arc gis software environment sreedevi et al 2012 sadeghi et al 2015 23 storm events with various intensities from 0 4 to 2 3 mm h 1 and durations from 3 to 14 h were used for the analyses the fixed line method was also used to separate base flow to obtain direct runoff hydrograph drh liu et al 2013 sadeghi et al 2015 gericke and smithers 2018 the phi index method as a very simple and straightforward in excess rainfall determination was then applied to calculate the total volume of storm period loss distributed uniformly across the storm hydrograph sadeghi and asadi 2010 ajibade and tota maharaj 2018 the total runoff volume for each storm event was determined by integrating the drh once the volume of rainfall excess was determined the corresponding phi index line was determined for each storm event and used to the rainfall pattern das 2000 sadeghi et al 2015 2 5 application of hydrologic model the storage attenuation coefficient h representing the storage characteristic of stream channel was determined by dividing the discharge at the point of inflection of the surface runoff hydrograph by the rate of change of discharge slope of the hydrograph at the inflection point as shown in eq 3 subramanya 2000 3 k q dq d t where k is storage coefficient h q is the starting discharge of the time interval m3 s 1 dq is the discharge after time interval m3 s 1 and dt is time interval h spatially distributed travel time method with the help of dem with 20 m grid digital map were used to develop tahs for the clark s instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh model gad 2013 the kinematic wave travel time equation suggested by welle and woodward 1986 was then used to compute travel time for overland flow according to eq 4 martin and mccutcheon 2018 4 tt kc i 0 4 nl s 0 6 where tt is surface flow travel time min kc is a coefficient for unit conversion equals to 6 943 n is roughness coefficient l is flow length m i is rainfall intensity mm h 1 for 2 year return period and 24 h duration and s is surface slope m m 1 the slope slgrid and the flow direction fldrgrid were developed using dem youssef et al 2011 the land use data were initially obtained from the west azarbaijan province general office of natural resources iran and checked by available data reported by former studies mostafazadeh et al 2015 sadeghi et al 2015 saeidi et al 2016 the travel time was calculated using the spatially distributed method based on the manning s roughness coefficient thus the manning s n grid was also prepared using the land use raster grid for the watershed lugrid and the modified roughness coefficient table suggested by engman 1986 and chow et al 1988 the travel time and flow velocity of each grid cell were then calculated according to the cell size of the raster data set using raster gis arcmap 9 3 version and archydro tools were also used for processing the terrain layers the inverse velocity grid and flow direction grids were applied as a weight grid to compute flow length grid of the study watershed usul and yilmaz 2002 hunukumbura et al 2007 the produced tahs were applied as inputs to the clark flow routing model the concept of linear reservoir model was used with considering movement effect and storage coefficient saghafian et al 2002 using eq 5 sadeghi et al 2009 5 i i 2 78 a i δ t c where ii is input discharge in every time interval m3 s 1 ai is contributing area in runoff production km2 and δtc is base time interval of iuh h subsequently flow routing was done using the muskingum method eq 6 and the amounts of iuh were then calculated kumar et al 2002 6 q 2 δ t c k 0 5 δ t c i 1 k 0 5 δ t c k 0 5 δ t c q 1 where δtc is concentration time of each isochrone section h i1 and q1 are primary input and output flow m3 s 1 respectively and q2 is the outflow after t1 time interval m3 s 1 k is the storage coefficient of the study watershed h and was calculated using graphic method chow et al 1988 based on eq 7 7 k δ t ln q 0 q t where q0 is discharge of beginning of time interval m3 s 1 qt is discharge after a logarithmic time base m3 s 1 and δt is time interval h subramanya 2000 then the prepared iuh changed to unit hydrograph of 0 25 h and finally direct hydrograph dh was extracted management scenarios were compared in discharge peak time to peak runoff volume and base time of hydrographs in dhs sediment peak average sediment concentration time to peak and sediment volume regarding sediment graphs were also determined to allow comparing the scenarios effects 3 results 3 1 collaborative management the collected data from interviews of 283 residents 163 households of the galaz village and 80 households from zemmeh village 5 experts of executive organizations governmental organizations and 8 policy makers were analyzed with the game theory among 13 sub watersheds gonbad earned the greatest score using condorcet borda scoring and fallback bargaining methods the priority of sub watersheds based on their points gained from each aforementioned procedures is shown in table1 after prioritization of sub watersheds stakeholders were asked to offer measures to betterment of current condition of the study area the offered management practices were then ranked and classified in three categories using three game theory algorithms combination of three categories of sub watersheds and three classes of management practices resulted from three selected method provided managerial scenarios which is shown in table 2 3 2 assessment of managerial scenarios effect on hydrograph and sediment graph based on the 14 remaining scenarios derived from the application of game theory algorithms a new land use map of sub watersheds was prepared scenarios altered roughness coefficients hence corresponding effects on runoff behavior were investigated given that qazan 3 sub watershed has no agricultural land 9th scenario was virtually inaccessible the new 0 25 h isochrones map and tah of the study watershed were produced after incorporating proposed scenarios the plot of tah has been presented in fig 2 it is clearly seen that there are large differences among tahs in fig 2 include the distribution pattern of the isochrone areas sadeghi et al 2015 after extracting the tahs for each management scenario with the help of design rainfall intensity of rain for 24 h with 2 year return 5 11 mmh 1 corresponding hydrographs and sedimentgraphs were simulated fig 3 changes of discharge peak time to peak runoff volume and base time regarding hydrographs and sediment peak average sediment concentration time to peak and sediment volume regarding sediment graphs were calculated and summarized in table 3 to facilitate comparison 4 discussion 4 1 comanagement framework according to table 1 the gonbad sub watershed was important according to both socioeconomic and environmental criteria the both socioeconomically and environmentally criteria discovered the importance of gonbad sub watershed hence addressing the problems of this sub watershed and exploiting its natural potential would satisfy all stakeholders and causes success in the watersheds management brams and kilgour 2001 existing issues in the galazchai watershed soil erosion water pollution flooding soil compaction low efficiency of rangelands enforce to adopt extensive range of managerial practices two main motivation namely economic concerns and environmental aspect were recognizable in providing of suggestions majority of people were struggling with financial difficulties and subsequently proposed options supposed to improve economic status of villagers such suggestions provide the substitute livelihood through rehabilitation of vegetation cover however experts focused on organizational goals reflecting conservation and reclamation of the environment and natural resources it could be concluded that conflict among various stakeholders is resulted from lack in proper inter and intra communications residents suffer inadequate financial facilities and on the opposite side organizational sector focuses on conservation of natural resources undoubtedly current situation necessitates of comanagement approaches the results of horning et al 2016 indicates the importance of residential in every watershed management plan and also believe that this group of stakeholders is seldom considered in most development projects managerial scenarios were established based on comanagement approach involving three groups of stakeholders in sub watershed and management practice prioritization overviewing table 2 demonstrates the importance of vegetation cover in rangelands which cover 85 percent of the study area ab banan azardasht engineering consulting inc 2010 and are the main land use therefore proper management of rangelands lead to erosion control hillsides are the most attractive sites for farmers animal husbandry and conservational areas as well in order to facilitate site and practice selection assessment the contribution of each part in outlet flow was calculated using the time area distributed model gironás et al 2009 4 2 land use change impact assessment according to the information in fig 3 and table 3 consequences of land use change reflected in hydrographs and sediment graphs sediment graphs were influenced more than hydrograph from the scenarios greater impact on the reduction of sediment yield than that of water due to land cover change was reported by zuo et al 2016 as well this phenomena illustrates that in addition to surface runoff s direct impact on sediment transport the concentration of sediment load has double effect on soil degradation arnold et al 2012 the maximum discharge peak reduction happened by applying 2nd reinforcement of vegetation cover in gonbad shinke bi milan 1 milan 2 qazan 1 and qazan 2 6th afforestation in qazan 3 and 10th reinforcement of vegetation cover in havarkhatoun galaz and shive khezal scenarios the scenario 2 applied to about 20 of the study watershed and therefore decreased runoff velocity because of positive effect of vegetation reinforcement this scenario including poor rangelands of the study watershed and reinforcing them motived effects on runoff volume discharge peak total sediment and sediment peak the scenario 6 was the second effective scenario on runoff inhibition this scenario caused maximum increase in roughness coefficient in comparison to the other scenarios the manning s n roughness coefficient used in time area equation varied from 0 12 to 0 8 through afforestation in qazan 3 the third scenario with high impact 5 83 reduction of peak discharge on hydrograph scenario 10 contained rehabilitation of vegetation cover in most parts of the area caused maximum reduction of runoff volume on the other side all included sub watersheds in this scenario were located about the outlet of the study watershed limited area and dispersion of target areas in other scenarios cause nonsignificant impacts on hydrologic response in other words scenarios including large number of sub watersheds with poor rangeland land use greatly impacted discharge and sediment peak the results of shi et al 2013 confirmed impact of different land uses with various areas on hydrologic response of a watershed in upper du river

and being close to the outlet of the study watershed declined runoff and consequently sediment load besides mentioned scenarios include zemmeh sub watershed which is the main farmlands of the study watershed the achievements of yan et al 2013 proves high impact of management practices application in farming lands on sediment control however the first peak in sediment graph is due to early evacuation of sediment from the sub watershed about outlet the main cause of soil erosion in the farmlands of the galazchai watershed is deforestation for farmland reclamation and cultivation on steep slopes rangelands can consolidate soil with dense root system whereas large areas of cultivation on steep slopes leads to fertility decline water and soil losses similar outcomes were achieved by the study of li et al 2014 and zuo et al 2016 which confirms the rationality of the results obtained in this study the 8th scenario considered afforestation in chehel asiyab sub watershed which contains the most important branch of drainage network change in land cover and implementing forestry stabilized soil particles and reduce soil erosion finally the 13th scenario improved the most area of the study watershed including agricultural lands and poor rangelands it should be noted that the effect of managerial activities may be different in combination with each other and in some cases leads to synergy antagony of individual effects sadeghi et al 2015 4 3 decision making process collaborative management and hydrologic modelling as two mere tools of integrated natural resources management

6259,blending satellite based precipitation estimation spe data and in situ gauge observation data can generate effective spatially continuous precipitation estimates with improved accuracy this study assessed the improvement of the long term spe when blending with in situ gauge observations for drought monitoring using a simple but effective blending method named the geographical difference analysis gda method and with the precipitation estimation from remote sensed information by using artificial neural networks climate data records persiann cdr as case study in situ precipitation observations from three meteorological station sets with different densities the sparse 50 medium 200 dense 727 station set were adopted to evaluate the effect of gauge density on the performance of spe gauge data blending two widely used indices standardized precipitation index spi and self calibrating palmer drought severity index sc pdsi were used as case studies except the case of sparse 50 station subset the spe gauge blending shows apparent improvement to the raw persiann cdr data for both the accuracy of precipitation input and many aspects of drought monitoring e g reproducing drought magnitude and revealing spatial pattern of drought in which sc pdsi shows more significant improvement than spi the dense 727 station set shows the largest improvement in the blending data but the corresponding station only interpolations also exhibit comparable performance to the blending data indicating lower utilization value of the spe data for these cases only the blending results of the medium density 200 station set shows satisfactory drought monitoring performance as well as significant improvements relative to the station only interpolations according to the quantitative analyses the medium density about 50 75 gauges per 106 km2 in our cases might be the most economic gauge density for spe gauge blending as it has satisfactory improvement in blending results can make fullest use of the advantages of spe data and requires relatively fewer gauges our results can help to understand how the spe gauge blending could improve the spe based drought monitoring and serves as a reference for applying drought monitoring under the data limited conditions subsequent studies or applications should also carefully consider the effect of gauge density keywords drought

resource management and drought monitoring lin and wang 2011 verdin et al 2016 lai et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 accurate and reliable precipitation input usually plays a critical role in the hydrologic modeling and calculation of most drought indices to quantify drought conditions under the effect of climate change and global warming drought is continuously aggravated globally and regionally dai 2013 ipcc 2007 2013 wang et al 2018 and has led to considerable economic and ecological losses worldwide piao et al 2010 lai et al 2018 zhong et al 2019 this situation emphasizes the urgency to develop more reliable precipitation products for drought monitoring in situ gauge based observation is a traditional method to derive precipitation measurements and provide accurate point scale precipitation records lin and wang 2011 however gauge networks are often sparsely and unevenly distributed over complex land surface terrains and in various environments particularly in developing countries and regions baez villanueva et al 2018 owing to high levels of uncertainty and the spatial variability of precipitation sparse and uneven gauge networks often prevent the determination of actual local moisture conditions lin and wang 2011 jin et al 2014 wang et al 2017a the inadequacy of low density gauge networks for drought monitoring has been identified in several studies sheffield

analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 climate prediction center morphing cmorph joyce et al 2004 and global precipitation measurement gpm mission hou et al 2013 however these earlier spes commonly have short data records no more than 20 years until 2017 and thus are not suitable for drought monitoring or other climatologic applications that require data records spanning at least 30 years burroughs 2003 guo et al 2016 for this purpose some long term spes spanning more than 30 years have been developed in recent years by combining long term historical ir observations and in situ observations including the persiann climate data record persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 and climate hazards group chg infrared precipitation with stations chirps funk et al 2015 these spes provide high resolution and spatially continuous precipitation estimation fields as well as potential ideal data sources for drought monitoring currently the main challenge to spe application in drought monitoring is low accuracy which is attributed to several factors including the indirect relationship between remote sensing information and actual precipitation sampling error and disturbance of other radiation sources jin et al 2014 some in situ ground observations are also used to correct spes during production however the improvement remains limited because of considerably insufficient in situ gauges available for spe producers sahoo et al 2015 zhong et al 2018a therefore numerous studies are conducted to evaluate the accuracy and performance of spes in drought monitoring yong et al 2010 sahoo et al 2015 duan et al 2016 katsanos et al 2016 zambrano et al 2017 gao et al 2018 baez villanueva et al 2018 lai et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 these studies generally indicate that the performance of spes is highly dependent on the local climate condition topography and gauge network density used for error correction for gauge corrected spes regions with arid climate and severe environment are more likely to show poor spe performance than other regions sahoo et al 2015 guo et al 2016 gao et al 2018 for example guo et al 2016 showed that persiann cdr performs less efficiently over regions in west china than in east china mainly because of the complexity of the environment and sparsity of gauge data for correction zhong et al 2019 confirmed this view by removing the effect of the interpolation error of the reference data even for regions with superior performance in east china long term spes show apparent deviations in quantifying drought conditions lai et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 to summarize errors in spe cannot be disregarded in drought monitoring and thus should be corrected before they are used in drought monitoring particularly in remote areas with sparse gauges blending spe data and in situ gauge precipitation data can effectively combine the advantages of in situ observations accurate precipitation measurement and spe data spatially continuous surface for precipitation estimates lin and wang 2011 the superiority of spe gauge data blending has been verified in several studies lin and wang 2011 jin et al 2014 sun et al 2014 verdin et al 2016 yang et al 2017 and numerous blending methods with different mechanisms have been proposed optimal interpolation oi is suggested to be an ideal method for merging spe and gauge data xie and xiong 2011 li et al 2015 sun et al 2016 wu et al 2018 however oi involves numerous procedures e g bias correction of spe and construction of error distance functions requires more data inputs and computational resource demand which implies relatively high implementation costs and subjectivity sun et al 2014 have demonstrated the slight superiority of oi to simple spe correction methods for midwest regions with sparse gauge data in china geographically weighted regression gwr has been recently adopted to simultaneously downscale spe data and blend spe data with gauge data xu et al 2015 chao et al 2018 chen et al 2018 which more efficiently improves the accuracy and reliability of spe data compared with previous techniques nevertheless gwr based methods require more geographical information e g high resolution elevation data in chen et al 2018 and computing resources which might introduce more uncertainties and restrict the application of these methods geographical difference analysis gda is a simpler and effective method cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 based on the direct construction of the spatial distribution of the differences between spe and in situ observations other blending methods such as bayesian methods or merging of multiple spe data on the basis of in situ data have also been proposed jin et al 2014 verdin et al 2015 ma et al 2018 the aforementioned studies provide valuable information about improving the quality of spe data by blending them with gauge data although previous studies mostly focused on directly assessing the accuracy of the blended precipitation data the improvement resulting from spe gauge data blending in drought monitoring is rarely reported moreover most previous studies generally focused on the methodology of spe gauge blending using a fixed gauge data set the effects of the adopted gauge network density which significantly influence the improvement in accuracy of spe data lin and wang 2011 wang and lin 2015 are usually ignored this kind of information is also important considering that denser gauges usually result in greater enhancements in the performance of spe gauge data blending however denser gauges also usually imply higher costs in deriving gauge data thus the most suitable gauge density for different usages has to be determined nevertheless relevant studies are rare particularly in drought monitoring therefore the objective of this study is two fold i to evaluate the performance of spe gauge data blending of long term spe data for drought monitoring and ii to investigate the effect of gauge density on the accuracy and drought utility of spe gauge data blending in contrast to the former studies that focused on spe data or blending approaches this study aims to evaluate the improvement in raw spe data in different aspects of drought monitoring e g drought event detection by spe gauge data blending and to determine the most suitable gauge density range for spe gauge data blending persiann cdr a commonly used long term spe product spanning 35 years up to 2017 was used as a case study the other long term spes such as chirps were not considered mainly because these spes were mostly directly corrected by in situ gauge observation such type of observation usually involves gauge data for blending and validation in the present study thereby influencing the validation results by contrast persiann cdr was corrected using a gridded precipitation dataset with a coarse spatial resolution 2 5 called the global precipitation climatology project gpcp ashouri et al 2015 which would exert less effect on the results of spe gauge data blending compared with other long term spes the gda method is adopted for spe gauge data blending not only because this method performs reasonably well cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 jongjin et al 2016 verdin et al 2016 chen et al 2017 but also because it has a simpler procedure and fewer extra information dependencies thus introducing fewer external factors and uncertainties mainland china which has abundant terrains and diverse climates was chosen as the study area the standardized precipitation index spi and the self calibrating palmer drought severity index sc pdsi two widely used indices for drought determination and monitoring were used as study cases this study is expected to elucidate how spe gauge data blending can improve drought monitoring by using long term spes present information regarding the effect of gauge density on the accuracy and drought performance of the blended data and provide reference for conducting drought monitoring given limited in situ data 2 study area and data 2 1 study area mainland china fig 1 is located in the northwestern shore of the pacific ocean featuring abundant topography types and diverse climate conditions the vast eastern part of mainland china is dominated by subtropical and temperate monsoon climate the inland northwestern part is dominated by temperate continental climate and the qinghai tibetan plateau in southwestern china is dominated by typical alpine climate over the past decades mainland china has suffered disastrous drought events under climate change and global warming piao et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2017c 2018 for instance a destructive drought hit the southwestern china in 2009 2010 because of severe lack of precipitation which led to economic loss exceeding us 3 5 billion zhang et al 2013 similar to other relevant studies wang et al 2017b li et al 2018 zhong et al 2019 the current study divided mainland china into nine regions for spe evaluation the division was based on local topography climate and landscape see fig 2 including the northeast china nec the huang huai hai region hhh inner mongolia im loess plateau lp the middle and lower regions of the yangtze river yr southwest china swc south china sc gansu xinjiang region gxr and qinghai tibet plateau qtp 2 2 persiann cdr persiann cdr spe ashouri et al 2015 was developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs at the university of california irvine uci it was designed to provide long term precipitation data and meet the requirements for consistent long term and high resolution global precipitation data of climatic studies with a spatial resolution of 0 25 spatial coverage among the 60 ns latitude band and a long term record spanning 35 years from 1983 to 2017 persiann cdr is generated using a merged gridded satellite based infrared ir dataset named gridsat b1 by a neural network trained by the radar based stage iv precipitation product ashouri et al 2015 then the persiann cdr is error corrected based on the coarse scale 2 5 monthly gridded gpcp dataset notably the gpcp dataset also involves several ground based gauge observations which might include some in situ gauge data in this study however the gauge observations for the gpcp are spatial averaged to a coarse resolution 2 5 much larger than that of persiann cdr adler et al 2003 which would then only slightly affect spe gauge data blending in the present study data production and error correction of persiann cdr are carried out by the chrs and the details are provided in ashouri et al 2015 the persiann cdr data were obtained from the chrs website http chrsdata eng uci edu 2 3 observations for spe gauge data blending in situ precipitation observations from 727 meteorological stations over mainland china derived from the china meteorology administration cma were used to blend with spe data these precipitation data have been processed using rigorous quality control procedures e g spatial and temporal consistency check and thus are of high quality the distribution of the blending used stations is shown in figs 1 and 2d to evaluate the impact of the gauge data density on the blending results three station subsets were extracted from all 727 stations with 50 200 and 727 stations over mainland china as shown in fig 2b d to ensure that the subsets were extracted randomly and uniformly extraction was conducted as described by chen et al 2018 the 727 stations were spatially clustered to 25 categories by using the k means algorithm subsequently 2 and 8 stations were randomly selected from each category to generate the 50 and 200 subsets respectively spe gauge data blending would be performed for the three station subsets independently the 50 station subsets with a mean density of 5 2 stations per 10 6 k m 2 2 2 to 13 3 stations per 10 6 k m 2 over the nine regions represented the cases with rather sparse gauge data the 200 station subsets with a mean density of 20 8 stations per 10 6 k m 2 9 5 to 47 7 stations per 10 6 k m 2 over the nine regions represented the cases with medium density gauge data the 727 station set with a mean density of 75 7 stations per 10 6 k m 2 26 3 to 184 2 stations per 10 6 k m 2 over the nine regions represented the cases with rather dense gauge data table 1 lists the number of stations and station density in the nine regions as well as mainland china for the three station subsets other meteorological data such as air temperature exposure to sunshine hours relative humidity and wind speed from the same meteorological stations were also obtained to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet which is necessary for pdsi calculation monthly pets were first calculated at each meteorological station shown in fig 1 by using the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 and then interpolated to the same 0 5 grid cells similar to the method used in other studies wang et al 2017b wu et al 2017 tps interpolation was applied using the r package fields nychka et al 2018 2 4 observations as assessment reference the gridded precipitation data named china monthly precipitation analysis product cpap were used to assess the results of spe gauge data blending this dataset were not used in spe gauge data blending cpap monthly gridded precipitation product was developed by cma with a spatial resolution of 0 5 the cpap is generated by monthly precipitation observations from a dense gauge network consisting of more than 2400 gauges in the mainland china by using terrain based thin plate spline tps interpolation to minimize the interpolation error in the generation of cpap only cpap gridcells containing gauges are used for assessment the 727 stations used in the spe gauge data blending method mentioned in section 2 3 are among the 2400 gauges used to generate cpap see fig 2a therefore to ensure that the results of spe gauge data blending are effectively validated the cpap gridcells containing the stations for the spe gauge data blending mentioned in section 2 3 which are colored in brown in fig 2a are excluded from the assessment ultimately only 897 cpap gridcells colored in sky blue in fig 2a were adopted for the validation therefore the results of spe gauge data blending are assessed using the gauge observations that are independent of the observation data used for blending although we validated the performance of spe gauge data blending only for the gauged grid cells the observations for west china gx and qtp regions are still largely unevenly distributed and might have significantly influenced the assessment therefore less attention would be given for west china the source data of persiann cdr are at a spatial resolution 0 25 higher than that of cpap therefore the persiann cdr data are resampled to a 0 5 resolution by performing spatial averaging prior to spe gauge data blending for direct comparison with cpap 3 methodology 3 1 standardized precipitation index spi the spi mckee et al 1993 is a widely used distribution based drought index that only requires precipitation data as inputs the spi is determined by the standardized anomaly of precipitation based on a given distribution the monthly precipitation records are first fitted by using a given distribution usually by pearson iii lognormal or gamma distribution for each calendar month and the corresponding frequencies of each record are calculated these frequencies are finally transformed to the corresponding quantiles of the standard normal distribution with a mean value of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 to become the spi values the spi can also be calculated on multiple time scales usually on 1 3 6 12 and 24 months to consider short and long term drought events using the moving accumulations of precipitation data the r package spei vicente serrano et al 2010 is used to calculate the spi in the present study for brevity only the spi of the 12 month timescale spi 12 is used spi 12 generally has the highest correlation with pdsi and thus is most comparable to pdsi 3 2 palmer drought severity index pdsi in contrast to the spi the pdsi palmer 1965 is calculated based on water balance to calculate the pdsi the precipitation data are first input into a simple two layer bucket like model along with the pet data to calculate the moisture deficits and then further corrected as the moisture anomaly z indices the z indices are then normalized by the duration factors as the x indices that is the calculated pdsi the pdsi has been widely used in drought monitoring and quantifying the effect of climate change on drought dai 2011 2013 sheffield et al 2012 wang et al 2017c zhong et al 2019 however owing to fixed coefficients for the normalization of the z index derived from central us the conventional pdsi features poor portability and spatial comparability largely limiting its application worldwide vicente serrano et al 2011 guo et al 2016 zhong et al 2018b for this reason the self calibrating pdsi sc pdsi was developed by wells et al 2004 sc pdsi improved the pdsi calculation by re fitting the coefficients of pdsi calculation adaptively for the local climate during the calculation in the current study the sc pdsi was calculated using the r package scpdsi zhong et al 2018a details of the sc pdsi calculation are provided in wells et al 2004 3 3 spe gauge data blending the gda method cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 is used to blend the station observation data with spe data in the study in the gda blend method the differences between in situ observation data usually regarded as true values and the spe surface are first analyzed at the point scale subsequently the spe data is corrected to become the blended data using the spatial surface of these differences generated using geographic interpolation the gda procedure for blending persiann cdr and in situ station observation data is as follows i calculating the differences d s between the in situ station observation data o s and the corresponding persiann cdr value p s at the location of the station s by using d s o s p s similar to sun et al 2014 the persiann cdr value p s at the location of the station s is determined by bilinear interpolation of four persiann cdr grid cells around the station s ii interpolating the differences d s derived in step i into the grid cell i of persiann cdr denoted as d i duan and bastiaanssen 2013 have evaluated the spline kriging and inverse distance weighting idw methods and found that idw outperformed other methods iii adding the interpolated differences d i onto the original persiann cdr values to derive the blended persiann cdr values p bi p bi p i d i negative values can be generated which are simply set to 0 the persiann cdr data are blended with the 50 200 and 727 station subsets referred to in section 2 3 as cdr b50 cdr b200 and cdr b727 respectively for evaluation and comparison the three station subsets were also independently interpolated to the same 0 5 grid cells by idw and referred to as idw50 idw200 and idw727 respectively to investigate the improvement of spe gauge data blending relative to the gauge only interpolation 3 4 assessment metrics several statistical metrics are used to quantify the performance of the spe gauge data blending the pearson correlation coefficient r is used to quantify the consistency between the validated and referenced series the root mean square error rmse is used to measure the absolute error of the validated series the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse is used to evaluate the closeness between the validated and referenced series the log nse is similar to nse but is more sensitive to low values the relative bias is used to quantify the systematic bias of the validated series which is typically used for evaluating the precipitation data the probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far are used to evaluate the ability of spe and blended spe in detecting drought events pod quantifies the probability of spe data to catch drought months and far quantifies the probability of mistaking non drought months for drought months similar to zhong et al 2019 the present study uses 1 and 2 as thresholds for the determination of drought months for the spi and sc pdsi respectively the equations for calculation of these metrics are listed in table 2 4 results 4 1 validation of spe gauge data blending results here the monthly persiann cdr data are blended with the precipitation observations from the three station subsets by using the gda method before the data are applied in drought monitoring the blended data need to be validated to understand their improvements when blended stations with different densities are used spatial patterns of the annual mean precipitation of cpap original and blended persiann cdr data and interpolated station data are presented in fig 3 both the original and blended persiann cdr reveal the spatial trend of precipitation distribution in china however the original persiann cdr loses many details of precipitation patterns which may be attributed to the coarse resolution of the gpcp data for correcting persiann cdr zhong et al 2019 this defect tends to be solved when the in situ observations are blended more details of the precipitation pattern are reproduced when more station data are blended with persiann cdr as shown in fig 3f h the interpolation results of the stations also reveal the superiority of spe gauge data blending because the precipitation patterns of the interpolated results are generally not closer to the cpap than those of spe gauge data blending results when the stations are less dense however when using the densest station data the spe gauge data blending result cdr b727 is considerably close to the corresponding interpolation result idw727 that reproduces almost all cpap precipitation pattern this finding suggests that the spe data show fewer advantages when the in situ data are adequately dense fig 4 presents the spatial patterns of the five assessment metrics for the original and blended persiann cdr as well as the interpolated station data with reference to cpap consistent with the findings of lin and wang 2011 the blended persiann cdr data and station data generally outperform the original persiann cdr data as well as the interpolation data with a wider area featuring higher r nse and log nse values and lower rmse and bias the station density significantly affects the blending results these results indicate that when sparse stations are used the results of spe gauge data blending are superior to the results of station only interpolation when dense stations are used the results of spe gauge data blending are superior to the raw spe data meanwhile the blending results of the medium density cases cdr b200 evidently improve relative to both the original persiann cdr and interpolation results however for the 727 station case on average 76 stations 10 6 k m 2 over mainland china with densely distributed stations the interpolated station data idw727 show comparable performance to the spe gauge data blending results cdr b727 with highly similar magnitudes and patterns of assessment metrics this finding may reveal less improvement of applying spe data in cases with abundant gauges such as the 727 station case presented in this study the assessment metrics for the blending and interpolation results of the validation grid cells in the nine regions of mainland china are listed in table 3 the boxplots of these metrics are shown in fig 5 these results quantitatively illustrate the apparent differences in blending performance among different station densities and regions comparison with the original persiann cdr showed that the improvement in blending results was negligible for the 50 station cases except for the yr region which suggested relatively apparent increases in r rmse and log nse for the gx region decreases in r and nses were observed these results might be related to the station density for the regions considering that the yr region occupied 13 3 stations 10 6 k m 2 whereas the gx region only occupied 2 6 stations 10 6 k m 2 on the average for the 50 station cases for the 200 station case the blending results were more evidently improved relative to the raw persiann cdr data with nse increments reaching 0 14 even for the gx and qtp regions with sparse stations except for some cases the narrow boxes in fig 5 also indicate apparent improvements in the reliability of the blending results for the 200 station case the interpolation results also improved with the denser 200 station set however the blending results still outperformed the interpolation data for the 200 station subsets the blending results for the 727 station cases exhibited the largest improvement with nses increased by about 0 1 0 2 however the interpolated station data without spes are also comparable with the blending results therefore the density of the 200 station subsets with the blending results outperforming the raw persiann cdr data as well as the interpolated station data could be the most suitable density for spe gauge data blending among the three subsets fig 6 shows the intra annual variation in assessment metrics for the blending and interpolation results for brevity only six typical regions were selected as examples in this study for most cases the spe gauge data blending results improved more relative to the original persiann cdr data during the dry seasons winter and relative to the interpolation results during the wet seasons summer the reason might be the difference in error structure between the interpolated precipitation and spe e g spe usually shows different error patterns between the wet and dry seasons aghakouchak et al 2012 fig 6 also shows that the blending results for the 200 station case among the cases evaluated are the most significantly improved relative to the original persiann cdr data and interpolation results 4 2 drought monitoring utility of spe gauge blended data fig 7 presents the spatial patterns of the r value of spi 12 and sc pdsi calculated from the original and blended persiann cdr data and interpolation results with reference to the drought indices of cpap the spatial patterns in r of the drought index are consistent with the r of the precipitation input however the spatial pattern of the r value of the drought index shows greater spatial heterogeneity and variability than the precipitation inputs particularly for sc pdsi the r value of spi 12 was apparently lower than the r value of the precipitation input for areas with lower accuracy differences in r between spi 12 and the precipitation input are considerably larger these differences indicate that the error of the spe data could be aggravated in the spi calculation given that spis are usually calculated using the moving aggregations of the precipitation data sc pdsi performed more poorly than spi 12 as spatial heterogeneity increased markedly in the study by zhong et al 2019 which used a corrected conventional pdsi without a self calibrating procedure the pdsi showed accuracy patterns that were more similar to those of spi 12 over mainland china than in the present study thus the large discrepancies between sc pdsi and spi 12 may be attributed to the instability of the self calibrating procedure developed by wells et al 2004 the high instability and high sensitivity to data sources of the self calibrating procedure has been demonstrated by liu et al 2016 regardless blending with in situ gauge observation data still improved the performance of the calculated drought indices this improvement became more significant as the size of the station sets increased meanwhile the performance of the station only interpolation results also showed a corresponding increase as the station density rose fig 8 shows the spatial patterns of the pod and far of spi 12 and sc pdsi for the blending and interpolation results the results associated with denser station subsets also exhibited better detection of drought events regardless of the method used to obtain data that is blending or interpolation however unlike the results for r the differences in pod and far between interpolation results and blending results are apparently smaller as they showed satisfactory pods and fars for both spi 12 and sc pdsi with pods generally exceeding 0 8 more than 80 drought events could be actually detected and fars below 0 2 less than 20 of the detected drought events are false alarms except for some ungauged areas these results indicate that spe data contribute less to improving the capacity for drought event recognition than to reproducing the drought magnitude table 4 lists the r pod and far values calculated for the drought indices of the validation grid cells in the nine regions similar to tables 3 and 4 shows that the 200 station case generally shows a more evident improvement in blending results compared with both the raw persiann cdr data and the gauge only interpolation results in the assessment metrics for both spi 12 and sc pdsi in the 200 station case spi 12 shows satisfactory performance as the r values are generally improved by up to 0 1 for the nine regions the pods and fars of spi 12 are also improved when blended with more station data however the original persiann cdr features satisfactory pods over 0 9 and fars below 0 1 for spi 12 the overall lower performance of sc pdsi than that of spi 12 is also quantitatively shown however the improvement in spe gauge data blending is more significant with r increased by up to 0 16 for the nine regions the drought detection capacity of the raw persiann cdr for sc pdsi was much lower than that for spi 12 with an average pod and far of about 0 8 and 0 2 respectively however they could be improved to nearly 0 9 and 0 1 respectively after blending with the station data overall spe gauge data blending could apparently improve the temporal performance of spe in the calculation of drought indices when using a medium size or denser station set and the improvement is greater for sc pdsi than spi 12 however the station only interpolation results could be comparable to the spe gauge data blending results when using a dense station set the ability to reveal the spatial pattern of drought is also important for spe to monitor macroscale drought to further evaluate the improvement in the spatial performance of spe gauge data blending spatial rmses for both the blending and interpolation results were calculated over each month from 1983 to 2017 to validate the grid cells for the nine regions the time series is shown in fig 9 owing to the weak spatial representability of sparse observations larger differences were found in spatial performance than in temporal performance between the interpolation results and blending results particularly for the 50 station case the blending results for the 50 station case are still slightly superior to those of the original persiann cdr particularly for the yr region which exhibited the highest density for the 50 station case with regard to the 727 station case the spatial rmses were the lowest and closest between the blending results and interpolation results for all regions the 200 station case remained as the most ideal case for spe gauge data blending to obtain an apparent improvement relative to the raw persiann cdr data and interpolation results to further assess the ability of spe gauge data blending in revealing drought spatial patterns two typical drought events with the largest affected area highest severity and largest losses in mainland china over the past two decades were selected as cases the continuous drought from 1999 to 2000 most severe in may 2000 in north china and the severe drought from 2009 to 2010 most severe in march 2010 in southwest china wang et al 2017d zhong et al 2019 the spatial patterns of the two drought events revealed by spi 12 and sc pdsi are presented in fig 10 with cpap as the benchmark the raw persiann cdr overestimated the extent and severity of drought and the illustrated centroids of the drought varied from those of cpap to a certain degree when integrated with in situ observations the spatial patterns of drought revealed by blending analysis are closer to cpap for the 200 station case the patterns of both drought events shown by blending analysis are sufficiently close to cpap when either spi 12 or sc pdsi are used for interpolation results large discrepancies in the spatial patterns of drought revealed by cpap were found for the low and mid density station cases because of inadequate spatial information particularly for the 50 station cases that could barely match the center and shape of the drought pattern only the interpolation results of the 727 station case with the highest density showed high consistency with both the cpap and blending results notably blending results generally outperformed the original persiann cdr and interpolation results with respect to spatial performance the most superior spe gauge data blending results were observed in the 200 station case station only interpolation could hardly reveal the spatial patterns of drought 5 discussion numerous studies have been conducted on blending spe with in situ gauge observation however the effects of the density of gauge observation data remain largely ignored except in a few studies such as those by lin and wang 2011 and wang and lin 2015 therefore the current study mainly aimed to explore the relationships between the improvement in spe gauge data blending and gauge density according to the number and distribution of available gauge stations over mainland china and with reference to lin and wang 2011 three station subsets were established with the density set from low to high although different interpolation ordinary kriging for lin and wang 2011 and idw for this study and blending methods as well as different time scales were applied lin and wang 2011 and wang and lin 2015 obtained similar results for the sparse density gauge network nearly 6 gauges per 106 km2 close to the 50 station case of this study blending results was superior to gauge only interpolation but the improvement relative to the original spe data was also limited for the high density gauge network nearly 30 gauges per 106 km2 denser than the 200 station case of this study the blending results significantly outperformed the original spe data nevertheless their superiority to the gauge only interpolation results also largely decreased the medium density gauge network seemed the most ideal prospect for using spe data in the blending method because the blending results evidently improved relative to both the original spe data and the interpolation results consistent findings could also be inferred from several related studies although the effects of gauge densities were not discussed chen et al 2018 used considerably denser gauge networks in eastern china to blend the tmpa product and found that the kriging based gda method did not outperform gauge only interpolation by using the same interpolation method however in the studies by chen et al 2017 and he et al 2017 in which the same tmpa data were used but sparser gauges were employed the blending results consistently performed better compared with both the raw spe data and the gauge only interpolation results therefore although the simplest idw method was adopted for blending and interpolation in the present study we suggest the results are reasonable in lin and wang 2011 and wang and lin 2015 although the effect of gauge density on the performance of spe gauge data blending was evaluated the relationship between gauge density and improvement in blending results was not quantitatively analyzed regardless this is important to determine the economic range of gauge density for spe gauge data blending for this reason the differences in some assessment metrics the r and nse values of the precipitation input as well as the r values of the calculated spi 12 and sc pdsi between the blending results and the original persiann cdr results as well as the corresponding interpolation results for different station densities are calculated the results are shown in fig 11 the data samples were the metrics of the seven regions except for gx and qtp for their largely unevenly distributed stations with three station subsets a total of 21 samples for each assessment metric fig 11 shows the strong logarithmic relationships between the station density and the improvement in blending results relative to the raw persiann cdr data and the strong inversely proportional relationship between the station density and the difference in blending results to the interpolation results in the same station set generally for the precipitation input the differences of r and nse between the interpolation results and the blending results converge to 0 when the station density exceeds about 75 per 106 km2 for the spi 12 and sc pdsi the differences of r value converge to 0 when the station density exceeds about 50 per 106 km2 the improvement in spe gauge data blending results relative to the original persiann cdr data also significantly increases with an increase in gauge density before the similar range of 50 75 gauges per 106 km2 in accordance with the results in the previous sections the blending results also show satisfactory drought performance within the aforementioned range of station density when the station density exceeds this range the improvement in blending results relative to raw spe data also apparently decreases consequently the medium gauge density about 50 75 gauges per 106 km2 might be the balance point when performing spe gauge data blending that is the most cost efficient gauge density that fully uses the advantages of the spe data exhibits satisfactory accuracy and drought utility in spe gauge data blending and uses the smallest number of gauges when the density of available gauges is below this range spe gauge blending is also effective however when the density is extremely sparse below 10 gauges per 106 km2 in this study the accuracy of blending results might even be reduced in which case directly using raw spe data would be preferable when the gauge density is above this range the spe data tend to be less valuable rendering gauge only interpolation more suitable notably our results were derived from persiann cdr data by using the simple gda method the integration of other auxiliary data e g elevation and vegetation indices also significantly changed the performance of spe data duan and bastiaanssen 2013 chen et al 2018 further studies on other complicated blending approaches and other areas are not performed in the current study owing to limited data availability and space the proposed gauge density range in this study might be similar for drought monitoring application in other areas outside china with persiann cdr or similar error corrected spe data e g the post processed tmpa or chirps however the suitability might need further local validation we suggest that subsequent studies on spe gauge data blending should emphasize the effects of gauge density moreover we also suggest that the mechanism underlying the effect of gauge density and distribution on the performance of spe gauge data blending needs to be more systematically analyzed 6 conclusions this study mainly assesses the performance of the spe gauge data blending procedure with long term spe for drought monitoring as well as the impact of gauge density on the performance of spe gauge data blending with three station subsets at different densities persiann cdr a widely used long term spe with records spanning 35 years until 2017 is used as a case study the drought monitoring capability of the blending results is determined by the performance of the calculated spi 12 and sc pdsi spe gauge data blending except that using the sparse 50 station subset could apparently improve the accuracy of persiann cdr in revealing spatial patterns of precipitation in addition the improvements are more evident when the adopted station networks are denser however the accuracy and performance of station only interpolation results also increase as the station network density increased indicating the reduced need for combining spe data with gauge data generally only the blending results of the medium density 200 station subset exhibit satisfactory improvement relative to both the raw persiann cdr data and the station only interpolation results apparent improvements in the results of spe gauge data blending is also found for the two drought indices particularly for the magnitude and spatial patterns of drought compared with spi sc pdsi exhibited higher sensitivity to data input and greater improvement in spe gauge blending spi 12 can satisfactorily detect drought events without the need of blending with gauge data whereas sc pdsi still required blending with gauge data the 200 station case seemed to be the most suitable case for spe gauge data blending owing to its enhancement of drought indices and the lowest requirement for number of used gauges in the blending procedure station density and performance showed strong logarithmic relationship and inversely proportional relationship between the station density and improvement of blending results relative to the raw spe and interpolation results respectively the improvement in blending results relative to raw spe increased with increasing gauge density however the improvement relative to interpolation results also decreased correspondingly revealing the reduced need to use additional spe data the range of 50 75 gauges per 106 km2 is determined to be the balance point for blending spe with in situ gauge observations in drought monitoring that is the cost efficient gauge density that shows satisfactory blending performance and required few gauges for different spe data blending methods or application areas the ideal range of gauge density might vary thus the impact of gauge density should be further considered in subsequent relevant studies declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript

6259,blending satellite based precipitation estimation spe data and in situ gauge observation data can generate effective spatially continuous precipitation estimates with improved accuracy this study assessed the improvement of the long term spe when blending with in situ gauge observations for drought monitoring using a simple but effective blending method named the geographical difference analysis gda method and with the precipitation estimation from remote sensed information by using artificial neural networks climate data records persiann cdr as case study in situ precipitation observations from three meteorological station sets with different densities the sparse 50 medium 200 dense 727 station set were adopted to evaluate the effect of gauge density on the performance of spe gauge data blending two widely used indices standardized precipitation index spi and self calibrating palmer drought severity index sc pdsi were used as case studies except the case of sparse 50 station subset the spe gauge blending shows apparent improvement to the raw persiann cdr data for both the accuracy of precipitation input and many aspects of drought monitoring e g reproducing drought magnitude and revealing spatial pattern of drought in which sc pdsi shows more significant improvement than spi the dense 727 station set shows the largest improvement in the blending data but the corresponding station only interpolations also exhibit comparable performance to the blending data indicating lower utilization value of the spe data for these cases only the blending results of the medium density 200 station set shows satisfactory drought monitoring performance as well as significant improvements relative to the station only interpolations according to the quantitative analyses the medium density about 50 75 gauges per 106 km2 in our cases might be the most economic gauge density for spe gauge blending as it has satisfactory improvement in blending results can make fullest use of the advantages of spe data and requires relatively fewer gauges our results can help to understand how the spe gauge blending could improve the spe based drought monitoring and serves as a reference for applying drought monitoring under the data limited conditions subsequent studies or applications should also carefully consider the effect of gauge density keywords drought monitoring satellite precipitation estimate spe spe gauge blending gauge density persiann cdr geographical difference analysis gda 1 introduction precipitation is an important variable for water resource management and drought monitoring lin and wang 2011 verdin et al 2016 lai et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 accurate and reliable precipitation input usually plays a critical role in the hydrologic modeling and calculation of most drought indices to quantify drought conditions under the effect of climate change and global warming drought is continuously aggravated globally and regionally dai 2013 ipcc 2007 2013 wang et al 2018 and has led to considerable economic and ecological losses worldwide piao et al 2010 lai et al 2018 zhong et al 2019 this situation emphasizes the urgency to develop more reliable precipitation products for drought monitoring in situ gauge based observation is a traditional method to derive precipitation measurements and provide accurate point scale precipitation records lin and wang 2011 however gauge networks are often sparsely and unevenly distributed over complex land surface terrains and in various environments particularly in developing countries and regions baez villanueva et al 2018 owing to high levels of uncertainty and the spatial variability of precipitation sparse and uneven gauge networks often prevent the determination of actual local moisture conditions lin and wang 2011 jin et al 2014 wang et al 2017a the inadequacy of low density gauge networks for drought monitoring has been identified in several studies sheffield et al 2012 dai 2013 trenberth et al 2014 highlighting the necessity to develop the spatial continuous precipitation data for drought monitoring with advances in spaceborne remote sensing and retrieval algorithms satellite based precipitation estimates spes provide alternative sources of precipitation data spes are normally retrieved from satellite based infrared ir passive microwave pmw or spaceborne precipitation radar pr tang et al 2017 observation data spes typically feature a wide spatial coverage mostly the latitude band up to 60 ns and a high spatial resolution 0 25 0 04 widely used spes include precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann hsu et al 1997 tropical rainfall measurement mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 climate prediction center morphing cmorph joyce et al 2004 and global precipitation measurement gpm mission hou et al 2013 however these earlier spes commonly have short data records no more than 20 years until 2017 and thus are not suitable for drought monitoring or other climatologic applications that require data records spanning at least 30 years burroughs 2003 guo et al 2016 for this purpose some long term spes spanning more than 30 years have been developed in recent years by combining long term historical ir observations and in situ observations including the persiann climate data record persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 and climate hazards group chg infrared precipitation with stations chirps funk et al 2015 these spes provide high resolution and spatially continuous precipitation estimation fields as well as potential ideal data sources for drought monitoring currently the main challenge to spe application in drought monitoring is low accuracy which is attributed to several factors including the indirect relationship between remote sensing information and actual precipitation sampling error and disturbance of other radiation sources jin et al 2014 some in situ ground observations are also used to correct spes during production however the improvement remains limited because of considerably insufficient in situ gauges available for spe producers sahoo et al 2015 zhong et al 2018a therefore numerous studies are conducted to evaluate the accuracy and performance of spes in drought monitoring yong et al 2010 sahoo et al 2015 duan et al 2016 katsanos et al 2016 zambrano et al 2017 gao et al 2018 baez villanueva et al 2018 lai et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 these studies generally indicate that the performance of spes is highly dependent on the local climate condition topography and gauge network density used for error correction for gauge corrected spes regions with arid climate and severe environment are more likely to show poor spe performance than other regions sahoo et al 2015 guo et al 2016 gao et al 2018 for example guo et al 2016 showed that persiann cdr performs less efficiently over regions in west china than in east china mainly because of the complexity of the environment and sparsity of gauge data for correction zhong et al 2019 confirmed this view by removing the effect of the interpolation error of the reference data even for regions with superior performance in east china long term spes show apparent deviations in quantifying drought conditions lai et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 to summarize errors in spe cannot be disregarded in drought monitoring and thus should be corrected before they are used in drought monitoring particularly in remote areas with sparse gauges blending spe data and in situ gauge precipitation data can effectively combine the advantages of in situ observations accurate precipitation measurement and spe data spatially continuous surface for precipitation estimates lin and wang 2011 the superiority of spe gauge data blending has been verified in several studies lin and wang 2011 jin et al 2014 sun et al 2014 verdin et al 2016 yang et al 2017 and numerous blending methods with different mechanisms have been proposed optimal interpolation oi is suggested to be an ideal method for merging spe and gauge data xie and xiong 2011 li et al 2015 sun et al 2016 wu et al 2018 however oi involves numerous procedures e g bias correction of spe and construction of error distance functions requires more data inputs and computational resource demand which implies relatively high implementation costs and subjectivity sun et al 2014 have demonstrated the slight superiority of oi to simple spe correction methods for midwest regions with sparse gauge data in china geographically weighted regression gwr has been recently adopted to simultaneously downscale spe data and blend spe data with gauge data xu et al 2015 chao et al 2018 chen et al 2018 which more efficiently improves the accuracy and reliability of spe data compared with previous techniques nevertheless gwr based methods require more geographical information e g high resolution elevation data in chen et al 2018 and computing resources which might introduce more uncertainties and restrict the application of these methods geographical difference analysis gda is a simpler and effective method cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 based on the direct construction of the spatial distribution of the differences between spe and in situ observations other blending methods such as bayesian methods or merging of multiple spe data on the basis of in situ data have also been proposed jin et al 2014 verdin et al 2015 ma et al 2018 the aforementioned studies provide valuable information about improving the quality of spe data by blending them with gauge data although previous studies mostly focused on directly assessing the accuracy of the blended precipitation data the improvement resulting from spe gauge data blending in drought monitoring is rarely reported moreover most previous studies generally focused on the methodology of spe gauge blending using a fixed gauge data set the effects of the adopted gauge network density which significantly influence the improvement in accuracy of spe data lin and wang 2011 wang and lin 2015 are usually ignored this kind of information is also important considering that denser gauges usually result in greater enhancements in the performance of spe gauge data blending however denser gauges also usually imply higher costs in deriving gauge data thus the most suitable gauge density for different usages has to be determined nevertheless relevant studies are rare particularly in drought monitoring therefore the objective of this study is two fold i to evaluate the performance of spe gauge data blending of long term spe data for drought monitoring and ii to investigate the effect of gauge density on the accuracy and drought utility of spe gauge data blending in contrast to the former studies that focused on spe data or blending approaches this study aims to evaluate the improvement in raw spe data in different aspects of drought monitoring e g drought event detection by spe gauge data blending and to determine the most suitable gauge density range for spe gauge data blending persiann cdr a commonly used long term spe product spanning 35 years up to 2017 was used as a case study the other long term spes such as chirps were not considered mainly because these spes were mostly directly corrected by in situ gauge observation such type of observation usually involves gauge data for blending and validation in the present study thereby influencing the validation results by contrast persiann cdr was corrected using a gridded precipitation dataset with a coarse spatial resolution 2 5 called the global precipitation climatology project gpcp ashouri et al 2015 which would exert less effect on the results of spe gauge data blending compared with other long term spes the gda method is adopted for spe gauge data blending not only because this method performs reasonably well cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 jongjin et al 2016 verdin et al 2016 chen et al 2017 but also because it has a simpler procedure and fewer extra information dependencies thus introducing fewer external factors and uncertainties mainland china which has abundant terrains and diverse climates was chosen as the study area the standardized precipitation index spi and the self calibrating palmer drought severity index sc pdsi two widely used indices for drought determination and monitoring were used as study cases this study is expected to elucidate how spe gauge data blending can improve drought monitoring by using long term spes present information regarding the effect of gauge density on the accuracy and drought performance of the blended data and provide reference for conducting drought monitoring given limited in situ data 2 study area and data 2 1 study area mainland china fig 1 is located in the northwestern shore of the pacific ocean featuring abundant topography types and diverse climate conditions the vast eastern part of mainland china is dominated by subtropical and temperate monsoon climate the inland northwestern part is dominated by temperate continental climate and the qinghai tibetan plateau in southwestern china is dominated by typical alpine climate over the past decades mainland china has suffered disastrous drought events under climate change and global warming piao et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2017c 2018 for instance a destructive drought hit the southwestern china in 2009 2010 because of severe lack of precipitation which led to economic loss exceeding us 3 5 billion zhang et al 2013 similar to other relevant studies wang et al 2017b li et al 2018 zhong et al 2019 the current study divided mainland china into nine regions for spe evaluation the division was based on local topography climate and landscape see fig 2 including the northeast china nec the huang huai hai region hhh inner mongolia im loess plateau lp the middle and lower regions of the yangtze river yr southwest china swc south china sc gansu xinjiang region gxr and qinghai tibet plateau qtp 2 2 persiann cdr persiann cdr spe ashouri et al 2015 was developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs at the university of california irvine uci it was designed to provide long term precipitation data and meet the requirements for consistent long term and high resolution global precipitation data of climatic studies with a spatial resolution of 0 25 spatial coverage among the 60 ns latitude band and a long term record spanning 35 years from 1983 to 2017 persiann cdr is generated using a merged gridded satellite based infrared ir dataset named gridsat b1 by a neural network trained by the radar based stage iv precipitation product ashouri et al 2015 then the persiann cdr is error corrected based on the coarse scale 2 5 monthly gridded gpcp dataset notably the gpcp dataset also involves several ground based gauge observations which might include some in situ gauge data in this study however the gauge observations for the gpcp are spatial averaged to a coarse resolution 2 5 much larger than that of persiann cdr adler et al 2003 which would then only slightly affect spe gauge data blending in the present study data production and error correction of persiann cdr are carried out by the chrs and the details are provided in ashouri et al 2015 the persiann cdr data were obtained from the chrs website http chrsdata eng uci edu 2 3 observations for spe gauge data blending in situ precipitation observations from 727 meteorological stations over mainland china derived from the china meteorology administration cma were used to blend with spe data these precipitation data have been processed using rigorous quality control procedures e g spatial and temporal consistency check and thus are of high quality the distribution of the blending used stations is shown in figs 1 and 2d to evaluate the impact of the gauge data density on the blending results three station subsets were extracted from all 727 stations with 50 200 and 727 stations over mainland china as shown in fig 2b d to ensure that the subsets were extracted randomly and uniformly extraction was conducted as described by chen et al 2018 the 727 stations were spatially clustered to 25 categories by using the k means algorithm subsequently 2 and 8 stations were randomly selected from each category to generate the 50 and 200 subsets respectively spe gauge data blending would be performed for the three station subsets independently the 50 station subsets with a mean density of 5 2 stations per 10 6 k m 2 2 2 to 13 3 stations per 10 6 k m 2 over the nine regions represented the cases with rather sparse gauge data the 200 station subsets with a mean density of 20 8 stations per 10 6 k m 2 9 5 to 47 7 stations per 10 6 k m 2 over the nine regions represented the cases with medium density gauge data the 727 station set with a mean density of 75 7 stations per 10 6 k m 2 26 3 to 184 2 stations per 10 6 k m 2 over the nine regions represented the cases with rather dense gauge data table 1 lists the number of stations and station density in the nine regions as well as mainland china for the three station subsets other meteorological data such as air temperature exposure to sunshine hours relative humidity and wind speed from the same meteorological stations were also obtained to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet which is necessary for pdsi calculation monthly pets were first calculated at each meteorological station shown in fig 1 by using the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 and then interpolated to the same 0 5 grid cells similar to the method used in other studies wang et al 2017b wu et al 2017 tps interpolation was applied using the r package fields nychka et al 2018 2 4 observations as assessment reference the gridded precipitation data named china monthly precipitation analysis product cpap were used to assess the results of spe gauge data blending this dataset were not used in spe gauge data blending cpap monthly gridded precipitation product was developed by cma with a spatial resolution of 0 5 the cpap is generated by monthly precipitation observations from a dense gauge network consisting of more than 2400 gauges in the mainland china by using terrain based thin plate spline tps interpolation to minimize the interpolation error in the generation of cpap only cpap gridcells containing gauges are used for assessment the 727 stations used in the spe gauge data blending method mentioned in section 2 3 are among the 2400 gauges used to generate cpap see fig 2a therefore to ensure that the results of spe gauge data blending are effectively validated the cpap gridcells containing the stations for the spe gauge data blending mentioned in section 2 3 which are colored in brown in fig 2a are excluded from the assessment ultimately only 897 cpap gridcells colored in sky blue in fig 2a were adopted for the validation therefore the results of spe gauge data blending are assessed using the gauge observations that are independent of the observation data used for blending although we validated the performance of spe gauge data blending only for the gauged grid cells the observations for west china gx and qtp regions are still largely unevenly distributed and might have significantly influenced the assessment therefore less attention would be given for west china the source data of persiann cdr are at a spatial resolution 0 25 higher than that of cpap therefore the persiann cdr data are resampled to a 0 5 resolution by performing spatial averaging prior to spe gauge data blending for direct comparison with cpap 3 methodology 3 1 standardized precipitation index spi the spi mckee et al 1993 is a widely used distribution based drought index that only requires precipitation data as inputs the spi is determined by the standardized anomaly of precipitation based on a given distribution the monthly precipitation records are first fitted by using a given distribution usually by pearson iii lognormal or gamma distribution for each calendar month and the corresponding frequencies of each record are calculated these frequencies are finally transformed to the corresponding quantiles of the standard normal distribution with a mean value of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 to become the spi values the spi can also be calculated on multiple time scales usually on 1 3 6 12 and 24 months to consider short and long term drought events using the moving accumulations of precipitation data the r package spei vicente serrano et al 2010 is used to calculate the spi in the present study for brevity only the spi of the 12 month timescale spi 12 is used spi 12 generally has the highest correlation with pdsi and thus is most comparable to pdsi 3 2 palmer drought severity index pdsi in contrast to the spi the pdsi palmer 1965 is calculated based on water balance to calculate the pdsi the precipitation data are first input into a simple two layer bucket like model along with the pet data to calculate the moisture deficits and then further corrected as the moisture anomaly z indices the z indices are then normalized by the duration factors as the x indices that is the calculated pdsi the pdsi has been widely used in drought monitoring and quantifying the effect of climate change on drought dai 2011 2013 sheffield et al 2012 wang et al 2017c zhong et al 2019 however owing to fixed coefficients for the normalization of the z index derived from central us the conventional pdsi features poor portability and spatial comparability largely limiting its application worldwide vicente serrano et al 2011 guo et al 2016 zhong et al 2018b for this reason the self calibrating pdsi sc pdsi was developed by wells et al 2004 sc pdsi improved the pdsi calculation by re fitting the coefficients of pdsi calculation adaptively for the local climate during the calculation in the current study the sc pdsi was calculated using the r package scpdsi zhong et al 2018a details of the sc pdsi calculation are provided in wells et al 2004 3 3 spe gauge data blending the gda method cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 is used to blend the station observation data with spe data in the study in the gda blend method the differences between in situ observation data usually regarded as true values and the spe surface are first analyzed at the point scale subsequently the spe data is corrected to become the blended data using the spatial surface of these differences generated using geographic interpolation the gda procedure for blending persiann cdr and in situ station observation data is as follows i calculating the differences d s between the in situ station observation data o s and the corresponding persiann cdr value p s at the location of the station s by using d s o s p s similar to sun et al 2014 the persiann cdr value p s at the location of the station s is determined by bilinear interpolation of four persiann cdr grid cells around the station s ii interpolating the differences d s derived in step i into the grid cell i of persiann cdr denoted as d i duan and bastiaanssen 2013 have evaluated the spline kriging and inverse distance weighting idw methods and found that idw outperformed other methods iii adding the interpolated differences d i onto the original persiann cdr values to derive the blended persiann cdr values p bi p bi p i d i negative values can be generated which are simply set to 0 the persiann cdr data are blended with the 50 200 and 727 station subsets referred to in section 2 3 as cdr b50 cdr b200 and cdr b727 respectively for evaluation and comparison the three station subsets were also independently interpolated to the same 0 5 grid cells by idw and referred to as idw50 idw200 and idw727 respectively to investigate the improvement of spe gauge data blending relative to the gauge only interpolation 3 4 assessment metrics several statistical metrics are used to quantify the performance of the spe gauge data blending the pearson correlation coefficient r is used to quantify the consistency between the validated and referenced series the root mean square error rmse is used to measure the absolute error of the validated series the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse is used to evaluate the closeness between the validated and referenced series the log nse is similar to nse but is more sensitive to low values the relative bias is used to quantify the systematic bias of the validated series which is typically used for evaluating the precipitation data the probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far are used to evaluate the ability of spe and blended spe in detecting drought events pod quantifies the probability of spe data to catch drought months and far quantifies the probability of mistaking non drought months for drought months similar to zhong et al 2019 the present study uses 1 and 2 as thresholds for the determination of drought months for the spi and sc pdsi respectively the equations for calculation of these metrics are listed in table 2 4 results 4 1 validation of spe gauge data blending results here the monthly persiann cdr data are blended with the precipitation observations from the three station subsets by using the gda method before the data are applied in drought monitoring the blended data need to be validated to understand their improvements when blended stations with different densities are used spatial patterns of the annual mean precipitation of cpap original and blended persiann cdr data and interpolated station data are presented in fig 3 both the original and blended persiann cdr reveal the spatial trend of precipitation distribution in china however the original persiann cdr loses many details of precipitation patterns which may be attributed to the coarse resolution of the gpcp data for correcting persiann cdr zhong et al 2019 this defect tends to be solved when the in situ observations are blended more details of the precipitation pattern are reproduced when more station data are blended with persiann cdr as shown in fig 3f h the interpolation results of the stations also reveal the superiority of spe gauge data blending because the precipitation patterns of the interpolated results are generally not closer to the cpap than those of spe gauge data blending results when the stations are less dense however when using the densest station data the spe gauge data blending result cdr b727 is considerably close to the corresponding interpolation result idw727 that reproduces almost all cpap precipitation pattern this finding suggests that the spe data show fewer advantages when the in situ data are adequately dense fig 4 presents the spatial patterns of the five assessment metrics for the original and blended persiann cdr as well as the interpolated station data with reference to cpap consistent with the findings of lin and wang 2011 the blended persiann cdr data and station data generally outperform the original persiann cdr data as well as the interpolation data with a wider area featuring higher r nse and log nse values and lower rmse and bias the station density significantly affects the blending results these results indicate that when sparse stations are used the results of spe gauge data blending are superior to the results of station only interpolation when dense stations are used the results of spe gauge data blending are superior to the raw spe data meanwhile the blending results of the medium density cases cdr b200 evidently improve relative to both the original persiann cdr and interpolation results however for the 727 station case on average 76 stations 10 6 k m 2 over mainland china with densely distributed stations the interpolated station data idw727 show comparable performance to the spe gauge data blending results cdr b727 with highly similar magnitudes and patterns of assessment metrics this finding may reveal less improvement of applying spe data in cases with abundant gauges such as the 727 station case presented in this study the assessment metrics for the blending and interpolation results of the validation grid cells in the nine regions of mainland china are listed in table 3 the boxplots of these metrics are shown in fig 5 these results quantitatively illustrate the apparent differences in blending performance among different station densities and regions comparison with the original persiann cdr showed that the improvement in blending results was negligible for the 50 station cases except for the yr region which suggested relatively apparent increases in r rmse and log nse for the gx region decreases in r and nses were observed these results might be related to the station density for the regions considering that the yr region occupied 13 3 stations 10 6 k m 2 whereas the gx region only occupied 2 6 stations 10 6 k m 2 on the average for the 50 station cases for the 200 station case the blending results were more evidently improved relative to the raw persiann cdr data with nse increments reaching 0 14 even for the gx and qtp regions with sparse stations except for some cases the narrow boxes in fig 5 also indicate apparent improvements in the reliability of the blending results for the 200 station case the interpolation results also improved with the denser 200 station set however the blending results still outperformed the interpolation data for the 200 station subsets the blending results for the 727 station cases exhibited the largest improvement with nses increased by about 0 1 0 2 however the interpolated station data without spes are also comparable with the blending results therefore the density of the 200 station subsets with the blending results outperforming the raw persiann cdr data as well as the interpolated station data could be the most suitable density for spe gauge data blending among the three subsets fig 6 shows the intra annual variation in assessment metrics for the blending and interpolation results for brevity only six typical regions were selected as examples in this study for most cases the spe gauge data blending results improved more relative to the original persiann cdr data during the dry seasons winter and relative to the interpolation results during the wet seasons summer the reason might be the difference in error structure between the interpolated precipitation and spe e g spe usually shows different error patterns between the wet and dry seasons aghakouchak et al 2012 fig 6 also shows that the blending results for the 200 station case among the cases evaluated are the most significantly improved relative to the original persiann cdr data and interpolation results 4 2 drought monitoring utility of spe gauge blended data fig 7 presents the spatial patterns of the r value of spi 12 and sc pdsi calculated from the original and blended persiann cdr data and interpolation results with reference to the drought indices of cpap the spatial patterns in r of the drought index are consistent with the r of the precipitation input however the spatial pattern of the r value of the drought index shows greater spatial heterogeneity and variability than the precipitation inputs particularly for sc pdsi the r value of spi 12 was apparently lower than the r value of the precipitation input for areas with lower accuracy differences in r between spi 12 and the precipitation input are considerably larger these differences indicate that the error of the spe data could be aggravated in the spi calculation given that spis are usually calculated using the moving aggregations of the precipitation data sc pdsi performed more poorly than spi 12 as spatial heterogeneity increased markedly in the study by zhong et al 2019 which used a corrected conventional pdsi without a self calibrating procedure the pdsi showed accuracy patterns that were more similar to those of spi 12 over mainland china than in the present study thus the large discrepancies between sc pdsi and spi 12 may be attributed to the instability of the self calibrating procedure developed by wells et al 2004 the high instability and high sensitivity to data sources of the self calibrating procedure has been demonstrated by liu et al 2016 regardless blending with in situ gauge observation data still improved the performance of the calculated drought indices this improvement became more significant as the size of the station sets increased meanwhile the performance of the station only interpolation results also showed a corresponding increase as the station density rose fig 8 shows the spatial patterns of the pod and far of spi 12 and sc pdsi for the blending and interpolation results the results associated with denser station subsets also exhibited better detection of drought events regardless of the method used to obtain data that is blending or interpolation however unlike the results for r the differences in pod and far between interpolation results and blending results are apparently smaller as they showed satisfactory pods and fars for both spi 12 and sc pdsi with pods generally exceeding 0 8 more than 80 drought events could be actually detected and fars below 0 2 less than 20 of the detected drought events are false alarms except for some ungauged areas these results indicate that spe data contribute less to improving the capacity for drought event recognition than to reproducing the drought magnitude table 4 lists the r pod and far values calculated for the drought indices of the validation grid cells in the nine regions similar to tables 3 and 4 shows that the 200 station case generally shows a more evident improvement in blending results compared with both the raw persiann cdr data and the gauge only interpolation results in the assessment metrics for both spi 12 and sc pdsi in the 200 station case spi 12 shows satisfactory performance as the r values are generally improved by up to 0 1 for the nine regions the pods and fars of spi 12 are also improved when blended with more station data however the original persiann cdr features satisfactory pods over 0 9 and fars below 0 1 for spi 12 the overall lower performance of sc pdsi than that of spi 12 is also quantitatively shown however the improvement in spe gauge data blending is more significant with r increased by up to 0 16 for the nine regions the drought detection capacity of the raw persiann cdr for sc pdsi was much lower than that for spi 12 with an average pod and far of about 0 8 and 0 2 respectively however they could be improved to nearly 0 9 and 0 1 respectively after blending with the station data overall spe gauge data blending could apparently improve the temporal performance of spe in the calculation of drought indices when using a medium size or denser station set and the improvement is greater for sc pdsi than spi 12 however the station only interpolation results could be comparable to the spe gauge data blending results when using a dense station set the ability to reveal the spatial pattern of drought is also important for spe to monitor macroscale drought to further evaluate the improvement in the spatial performance of spe gauge data blending spatial rmses for both the blending and interpolation results were calculated over each month from 1983 to 2017 to validate the grid cells for the nine regions the time series is shown in fig 9 owing to the weak spatial representability of sparse observations larger differences were found in spatial performance than in temporal performance between the interpolation results and blending results particularly for the 50 station case the blending results for the 50 station case are still slightly superior to those of the original persiann cdr particularly for the yr region which exhibited the highest density for the 50 station case with regard to the 727 station case the spatial rmses were the lowest and closest between the blending results and interpolation results for all regions the 200 station case remained as the most ideal case for spe gauge data blending to obtain an apparent improvement relative to the raw persiann cdr data and interpolation results to further assess the ability of spe gauge data blending in revealing drought spatial patterns two typical drought events with the largest affected area highest severity and largest losses in mainland china over the past two decades were selected as cases the continuous drought from 1999 to 2000 most severe in may 2000 in north china and the severe drought from 2009 to 2010 most severe in march 2010 in southwest china wang et al 2017d zhong et al 2019 the spatial patterns of the two drought events revealed by spi 12 and sc pdsi are presented in fig 10 with cpap as the benchmark the raw persiann cdr overestimated the extent and severity of drought and the illustrated centroids of the drought varied from those of cpap to a certain degree when integrated with in situ observations the spatial patterns of drought revealed by blending analysis are closer to cpap for the 200 station case the patterns of both drought events shown by blending analysis are sufficiently close to cpap when either spi 12 or sc pdsi are used for interpolation results large discrepancies in the spatial patterns of drought revealed by cpap were found for the low and mid density station cases because of inadequate spatial information particularly for the 50 station cases that could barely match the center and shape of the drought pattern only the interpolation results of the 727 station case with the highest density showed high consistency with both the cpap and blending results notably blending results generally outperformed the original persiann cdr and interpolation results with respect to spatial performance the most superior spe gauge data blending results were observed in the 200 station case station only interpolation could hardly reveal the spatial patterns of drought 5 discussion numerous studies have been conducted on blending spe with in situ gauge observation however the effects of the density of gauge observation data remain largely ignored except in a few studies such as those by lin and wang 2011 and wang and lin 2015 therefore the current study mainly aimed to explore the relationships between the improvement in spe gauge data blending and gauge density according to the number and distribution of available gauge stations over mainland china and with reference to lin and wang 2011 three station subsets were established with the density set from low to high although different interpolation ordinary kriging for lin and wang 2011 and idw for this study and blending methods as well as different time scales were applied lin and wang 2011 and wang and lin 2015 obtained similar results for the sparse density gauge network nearly 6 gauges per 106 km2 close to the 50 station case of this study blending results was superior to gauge only interpolation but the improvement relative to the original spe data was also limited for the high density gauge network nearly 30 gauges per 106 km2 denser than the 200 station case of this study the blending results significantly outperformed the original spe data nevertheless their superiority to the gauge only interpolation results also largely decreased the medium density gauge network seemed the most ideal prospect for using spe data in the blending method because the blending results evidently improved relative to both the original spe data and the interpolation results consistent findings could also be inferred from several related studies although the effects of gauge densities were not discussed chen et al 2018 used considerably denser gauge networks in eastern china to blend the tmpa product and found that the kriging based gda method did not outperform gauge only interpolation by using the same interpolation method however in the studies by chen et al 2017 and he et al 2017 in which the same tmpa data were used but sparser gauges were employed the blending results consistently performed better compared with both the raw spe data and the gauge only interpolation results therefore although the simplest idw method was adopted for blending and interpolation in the present study we suggest the results are reasonable in lin and wang 2011 and wang and lin 2015 although the effect of gauge density on the performance of spe gauge data blending was evaluated the relationship between gauge density and improvement in blending results was not quantitatively analyzed regardless this is important to determine the economic range of gauge density for spe gauge data blending for this reason the differences in some assessment metrics the r and nse values of the precipitation input as well as the r values of the calculated spi 12 and sc pdsi between the blending results and the original persiann cdr results as well as the corresponding interpolation results for different station densities are calculated the results are shown in fig 11 the data samples were the metrics of the seven regions except for gx and qtp for their largely unevenly distributed stations with three station subsets a total of 21 samples for each assessment metric fig 11 shows the strong logarithmic relationships between the station density and the improvement in blending results relative to the raw persiann cdr data and the strong inversely proportional relationship between the station density and the difference in blending results to the interpolation results in the same station set generally for the precipitation input the differences of r and nse between the interpolation results and the blending results converge to 0 when the station density exceeds about 75 per 106 km2 for the spi 12 and sc pdsi the differences of r value converge to 0 when the station density exceeds about 50 per 106 km2 the improvement in spe gauge data blending results relative to the original persiann cdr data also significantly increases with an increase in gauge density before the similar range of 50 75 gauges per 106 km2 in accordance with the results in the previous sections the blending results also show satisfactory drought performance within the aforementioned range of station density when the station density exceeds this range the improvement in blending results relative to raw spe data also apparently decreases consequently the medium gauge density about 50 75 gauges per 106 km2 might be the balance point when performing spe gauge data blending that is the most cost efficient gauge density that fully uses the advantages of the spe data exhibits satisfactory accuracy and drought utility in spe gauge data blending and uses the smallest number of gauges when the density of available gauges is below this range spe gauge blending is also effective however when the density is extremely sparse below 10 gauges per 106 km2 in this study the accuracy of blending results might even be reduced in which case directly using raw spe data would be preferable when the gauge density is above this range the spe data tend to be less valuable rendering gauge only interpolation more suitable notably our results were derived from persiann cdr data by using the simple gda method the integration of other auxiliary data e g elevation and vegetation indices also significantly changed the performance of spe data duan and bastiaanssen 2013 chen et al 2018 further studies on other complicated blending approaches and other areas are not performed in the current study owing to limited data availability and space the proposed gauge density range in this study might be similar for drought monitoring application in other areas outside china with persiann cdr or similar error corrected spe data e g the post processed tmpa or chirps however the suitability might need further local validation we suggest that subsequent studies on spe gauge data blending should emphasize the effects of gauge density moreover we also suggest that the mechanism underlying the effect of gauge density and distribution on the performance of spe gauge data blending needs to be more systematically analyzed 6 conclusions this study mainly assesses the performance of the spe gauge data blending procedure with long term spe for drought monitoring as well as the impact of gauge density on the performance of spe gauge data blending with three station subsets at different densities persiann cdr a widely used long term spe with records spanning 35 years until 2017 is used as a case study the drought monitoring capability of the blending results is determined by the performance of the calculated spi 12 and sc pdsi spe gauge data blending except that using the sparse 50 station subset could apparently improve the accuracy of persiann cdr in revealing spatial patterns of precipitation in addition the improvements are more evident when the adopted station networks are denser however the accuracy and performance of station only interpolation results also increase as the station network density increased indicating the reduced need for combining spe data with gauge data generally only the blending results of the medium density 200 station subset exhibit satisfactory improvement relative to both the raw persiann cdr data and the station only interpolation results apparent improvements in the results of spe gauge data blending is also found for the two drought indices particularly for the magnitude and spatial patterns of drought compared with spi sc pdsi exhibited higher sensitivity to data input and greater improvement in spe gauge blending spi 12 can satisfactorily detect drought events without the need of blending with gauge data whereas sc pdsi still required blending with gauge data the 200 station case seemed to be the most suitable case for spe gauge data blending owing to its enhancement of drought indices and the lowest requirement for number of used gauges in the blending procedure station density and performance showed strong logarithmic relationship and inversely proportional relationship between the station density and improvement of blending results relative to the raw spe and interpolation results respectively the improvement in blending results relative to raw spe increased with increasing gauge density however the improvement relative to interpolation results also decreased correspondingly revealing the reduced need to use additional spe data the range of 50 75 gauges per 106 km2 is determined to be the balance point for blending spe with in situ gauge observations in drought monitoring that is the cost efficient gauge density that shows satisfactory blending performance and required few gauges for different spe data blending methods or application areas the ideal range of gauge density might vary thus the impact of gauge density should be further considered in subsequent relevant studies declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript
