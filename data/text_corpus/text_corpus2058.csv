10290,poor grain filling of inferior kernel of summer maize is a major challenge restricting grain yield of summer maize especially under higher plant densities much work so far has proved that tillage practices could regulate soil properties and grain yield of maize effectively in order to explore the effect of tillage practice on grain filling of inferior kernel of summer maize field experiments were conducted over two consecutive years 2016 2017 and three tillage practices t1 no tillage t2 no tillage with subsoiling t3 deep horizontal rotary tillage were assessed the grain filling parameter showed that final grain weight a the time reaching the maximum grain filling rate t max the dry matter accumulation under the maximum grain filling rate w max the mean grain filling rate g mean and the active grain filling period d of t2 were usually higher than that of t1 and t3 and significant difference was observed between t2 and t1 compared with t1 t2 and t3 reduced the soil bulk density and increased the soil porosity and significantly increased the root dry matter accumulation in the 0 40 cm soil profile by 13 4 and 28 7 respectively soil water content decreased among tillage practices in the order t2 t1 t3 however t2 and t3 increased the water consumption compared to that of t1 moreover t2 and t3 increased post anthesis photosynthetic capacity including the photosynthetic rate leaf area duration and chlorophyll content and further improved the post antheisis and total dry matter accumulation the enzyme activities of susase stsase and adpg ppase of inferior and superior kernel in t2 and t3 were also higher than that of t1 in conclusion the present results indicate that subsoiling could promote the grain filling of inferior kernel of summer maize by regulating soil water content soil water consumption and photosynthetic capacity keywords tillage practices summer maize grain filling inferior kernel soil water content photosynthetic capacity 1 introduction increasing plant density is a key way to improve maize grain yield feng et al 2010 tokatlidis et al 2011 shi et al 2016a 2016b however the poor grain filling in inferior kernel was a common problem under dense population generally the apical kernels of maize ear was defined as inferior kernel shen et al 2017 wang et al 2017 at low plant population the increase in kernel setting is mainly attributed to the superior kernels however at high plant densities the increase in kernel setting is mainly related to the inferior kernels cárcova et al 2000 a better grain filling of inferior kernels could result in higher maize grain yield shen et al 2017 thus it has become a hot issue to promote the grain filling of the inferior kernels in grain yield improvement of summer maize especially under dense populations grain filling in maize is influenced by various factors previous studies on those factors mainly concentrated on cultivars shen et al 2017 xu et al 2018 water xu et al 2016 light shi et al 2013 nitrogen paponov et al 2001 planting patterns and sowing densities jia et al 2018 however few study was carried out to explore the effect of tillage practice on grain filling characteristics of inferior kernel of summer maize it is generally known that tillage is a common management practice in agriculture production it has been reported that tillage practices affected soil properties regulate crop root growth crop growth grain yield and nutrient uptake lampurlanés et al 2001 guan et al 2014 cai et al 2014 shi et al 2016a 2016b some reported that appropriate conservation tillage improved soil water content liu et al 2013 shao et al 2016 wang et al 2020 a higher soil water content at grain filling stage is not only conducive to the accumulation of photosynthate but also conducive to the transfer of photosynthate which is benefit to grain filling li et al 2019 however long term of no tillage or reduced tillage also increased soil bulk density in the top 10 20 cm soil layer in the absence of subsoiling or other deep tillage practices václav et al 2013 zhai et al 2016 which is not beneficial to crop growth therefore more attention has been paid to subsoiling or deep tillage in agriculture production in recent years berhe et al 2013 zhai et al 2017 schneider et al 2017 gong et al 2018 it was demonstrated that subsoiling or deep tillage practices could improve soil physical biological and hydraulic properties wang et al 2020 which was beneficial to crop root growth and development cai et al 2014 zhai et al 2017 and further regulating the canopy photosynthetic physiology he et al 2020 lamptey et al 2020 xu et al 2016 reported that the strong photosynthetic capacity is a main reason to promoting the grain filling of inferior kernel of maize however there is a lack of information on whether tillage practices could improve the grain filling of inferior kernel by regulating canopy photosynthetic physiology in the huang huai hai hhh plain of china winter wheat summer maize double cropping system was the major cropping system in this region however most smallholder farmers adopted the winter shallow rotary tillage before the sowing of winter wheat and no tillage before sowing of summer maize for a long time this single annual tillage practice creates a hard plow pan in the 15 30 soil layers which adversely affects crop productivity zhai et al 2016 in the present study we hypothesis that reasonable tillage practice could improve maize canopy photosynthetic capacity by regulating some soil properties and root growth and finally promoting the grain filling of inferior kernel in order to verify this hypothesis the main objectives of this study were to 1 clarify whether tillage practices affect the grain filling of inferior kernel of summer maize 2 investigate the effect of tillage practices on some soil l properties and root growth of summer maize 3 identify the influence of tillage practice on canopy photosynthetic capacity of summer maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description field experiments were conducted during 2016 and 2017 growing seasons at the luancheng experimental station of the chinese academy of science which is located in shijiazhuang hebei province in the northern part of the huang huai hai hhh plain of china and this region is semi arid with a monsoon climate the average annual temperature is 12 8 c the average annual precipitation is approximately 484 mm of which 70 falls in the growing season of summer maize and the frost free period is 206 days the primary

tillage t1 no tillage with subsoiling to a depth of 25 cm t2 and deep horizontal rotary tillage to a depth of 40 cm t3 deep horizontal rotary tillage is a recently introduced tillage practice in china and provides a new mean of breaking up soil plow pan details of the operation procedures for the three tillage practices are presented in table 1 in both growing seasons all treatments were basically applied with 150 kg n ha 1 80 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 80 kg ha 1 k2o n was top dressed at the v6 stage six leaf stage field management was the same as the management of local smallholder farmers 2 3 sampling

volume of 100 cm3 for soil depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm the bulk density was calculated by dividing the weight of the dried soil by the volume of the soil it calculated as following d w 1 w 0 1 w v where d is the soil bulk density g m 3 w 0 is the weight of cutting ring w 1 is the total weight of soil sample and cutting ring w is the soil water content of the fresh soil samples v is the volume

the is the density of soil solids i e soil particle density here assumed to be 2 65 g cm 3 2 3 2 dry matter accumulation dma in the middle of each plot three successive uniform plants were selected manually and cut at ground level at anthesis and physiological maturity the plants were separated into stalks leaves sheaths tassels and ears and oven dried to measure the dma post anthesis dma was estimated as the difference in dma between physiological maturity and anthesis root dma was measured by using the section root sampling digging method at the early grain filling stage three plants with uniform appearance were selected from the middle of each plot for root sampling boundaries were defined separately based on the area occupied by each plant using row distance half of the row distance on each side of the plant base and plant distance half of the plant distance on each side of the plant base soil and root samples were collected from each 10 cm layer to the depth of 80 cm each layer was numbered and placed in a separate nylon bag for root washing and picking and then oven dried to measure root dry matter 2 3 3 grain filling process measurement at silking stage 80 uniform plants from each plot were chosen and tagged five ears from the tagged plants were sampled at 4 day intervals from pollination to physiological maturity 100 kernels were manually taken from the upper and middle of ears respectively which were defined as inferior kernel and superior kernel after the 100 kernel fresh weight was measured the sample was dried at 70 c to a constant weight and weighed the grain filling process was fitted to richards 1959 growth equation as described by zhu et al 1988 1 w a 1 e b c t 1 d the grain filling rate was calculated as the derivative of eq 1 2 g a c e b c t d 1 e b c t d 1 d where w is the kernel weight mg a is the final grain weight mg t is the time after anthesis days b c and d are the coefficient determined by the regression according zhu et al 1988 the days for the maximum grain filling rate is tmax lneb lnd c the dry matter accumulation under the maximum grain filling rate is wmax a d 1 1 d the active grain filling period was defined as the period when w was between 5 t1 and 95 t2 it calculated as d 2 d 2 c 1 2 3 4 soil water content and water consumption soil water content was measured by oven drying method soil samples were collected at anthesis mid grain filling stage and physiological maturity using a soil auger 4 5 cm diameter at 20 cm increment to a depth of 180 cm in 2016 and it sampled at 10 cm increment to a depth of 100 cm in 2017 the soil water content was calculated as follows 3 s w c w f r e s h w d r y w d r y 100 where swc is the soil water content and w fresh and w dry is the soil fresh weight and soil dry weight respectively evapotranspiration eta during the whole growing season was calculated using the following water balance equation zhang et al 2011 4 e t a p i δ s w d r d c r where p is precipitation mm i is irrigation mm swd is soil water depletion mm r is surface runoff d is drainage below the 200 cm soil profile and cr is the capillary rise into the root zone which was negligible because the groundwater table was more than 37 m deep at the experimental site r and d are also considered negligible on the ncp gao et al 2017 2 3 5 leaf area duration lad net assimilation rate nar

soil plant analysis development spad values of ear leaves were measured using a spad 502m konica minolta tokyo japan values were taken from the different positions of ear leaves between 10 00 and 12 00 at the anthesis and mid grain filling stages eight plants per plot were randomly selected for the measurements 2 3 7 enzyme extraction and assays five uniform ears were fetched 25 days after the pollination from each plot the upper middle and basal kernels were separated from these ears and immediately freeze them in liquid nitrogen for 5 min and then the samples were stored in the cryogenic freezer at 70 c which is used for the determination of the activities of adp glucose pyrophosphosphorylase adpg ppase starch synthase stsase and sucrose synthase susase the method for preparation of enzyme extracts was modified from nakamura et al 1989 and yang et al 2003 five kernels were homogenized with a pestle in an ice cold mortar that contained 6 ml tricine naoh extract medium ph 8 0 contains 10 mmol l 1 mgcl2 2 mmol l 1 edta 50 mmol l 1 2 mercaptoethanol 12 glycerol 15 pvp the homogenate was centrifuged at 15000 g for 10 min the clear supernatant was used to measure enzyme

kernel and superior kernel of summer maize fig 2 in 2016 growing season for the inferior kernel the kernel weight of t2 and t3 were significantly greater than that of t1 since the 30th day after pollination and the grain filling rate of t2 and t3 was higher than that of t1 since the 25th day after pollination for the superior kernels the kernel weight of t2 and t3 was always higher than that of t1 since the 25th day after pollination and the average grain filling rate of t2 and t3 increased by 5 6 and 7 3 in 2017 growing season the inferior kernel weight of t2 and t3 treatment was higher than that of t1 since the 20th day after pollination although the grain filling rate of t2 treatment was lower than that of t1 since the 35th day after pollination the maximum grain filling and average grain filling rate were 10 9 and 2 0 higher in t2 than in t1 treatment respectively the difference in superior kernel weight and grain filling rate among tillage practices was not significant as showed in table 2 the grain filling parameter of inferior kernel indicated that a w max and g mean of t2 and t3 were significantly higher than that of t1 and significant difference in t max and d between t1 and t2 were observed in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons for superior kernel the difference in a t max w max and g max among tillage practice was not obvious in 2016 but the d of t2 and t3 was significantly lower than that of t1 in 2017 the a w max and d of superior kernel under t2 and t3 were significantly higher than that of t1 but the g max of t2 and t3 was significantly lower than that of t1 3 2 soil bulk density and soil porosity as showed in table 3 the soil porosity among tillage practices was in the order t1 t2 t3 in 2016 and the soil bulk density showed the opposite trend soil porosity and soil bulk density were significantly different among tillage practice treatments in 2017 growing season the soil porosity of t2 and t3 was significantly higher than that of t1 and the difference between t2 and t3 was not significant conversely the soil bulk density of t2 and t3 was significantly lower than that of t1 and there was no significant difference in soil bulk density between t2 and t3 3 3 soil water content and evapotranspiration fig 3 showed the soil water content under different tillage practices in 2016 growing season t2 and t3 increased the soil water content at anthesis compared to that of t1 however t1 has a higher soil water content at the mid grain filling stage at physiological maturity the soil water content of t2 was significantly greater than t1 and t3 in most soil layers in 2017 growing season t2 has the greater soil water content than t1 and t3 in the 0 60 cm soil layer at pre sowing and anthesis stage at mid grain filling stage and physiological maturity t2 always has a higher soil water content with the order of t2 t1 t3 and the difference was significant in most soil layers the results indicated that t3 has poor soil water retention compared to that of t2 and t1 moreover tillage practice had a significant effect on evapotranspiration fig 4 in 2016 the eta of t1 t2 and t3 was 420 8 426 1 and 439 6 mm respectively and the eta of t3 was significantly higher than that of t1 and t2 treatments the difference in eta between t1 and t2 was not significant in 2017 the eta of t1 t2 and t3 was 295 2 309 7 and 305 1 mm respectively the eta of t2 and t3 was significantly higher than that of t1 but no obvious difference was observed between t2 and t3 3 4 root dry matter accumulation as it showed in fig 5 tillage practices affect the root dma in the 0 40 cm soil layer in 2016 growing season t3 increased considerably the total root dry matter accumulation by 23 68 and 20 2 compared to that of t1 and t2 in 2017 growing season compared with t1 t2 and t3 increased the root dma by 12 6 and 22 5 respectively significant difference was observed among tillage practices in 0 40 cm soil layer 3 5 chlorophyll content spad value fig 6 showed the dynamic change of spad value of ear leaf during the growth period under different tillage practices the spad value increased along with the growth development and reached its maximum value at the r3 stage the spad value was significantly higher under t3 and t2 treatments than under t1 treatment at the same growth stage and it is always ranked with the order of t3 t2 t1 3 6 leaf area duration lad net assimilation rate nar and photosynthesis rate pn fig 7 showed the pre anthesis and post anthesis lad and nar of different tillage practices in 2016 t3 significantly increased the pre anthesis lad but no obvious difference was observed for pre anthesis nar compared with t1 t3 increased the post anthesis lad by 13 t2 significantly increased the nar by 20 4 in 2017 growing season the pre anthesis and post anthesis lad of t3 was significantly higher than t1 and the difference between t3 and t2 was not obvious for the pre anthesis nar t2 was lower than t1 and t3 but no significant difference was observed between tillage practices for post anthesis nar fig 8 showed that tillage practice had a significant effect on photosynthetic rate in 2016 growing season the photosynthetic rate of t2 and t3 was higher than that of t1 at different growth period after pollination and t2 was always significantly higher than that of t1 but the difference in photosynthetic rate between t2 and t3 was not significant at anthesis and late stage of grain filling in 2017 growing season t2 significantly increased the leaf photosynthesis rate at the middle and late stage of grain filling compared to that of t1 however the difference was not significant between t2 and t3 since anthesis 3 7 above ground dry matter accumulation compared with t1 t2 and t3 significantly increased the post anthesis and total dma table 4 the increased percentage varied from 5 to 26 4 however no significant difference was found for pre anthesis dma with the exception of t3 was significantly higher than t2 in 2017 in 2016 growing season the harvest index of t3 was significantly higher than t2 and t1 but no obvious difference was observed between treatments in 2017 3 8 enzyme activities associated with starch synthesis in inferior kernel table 5 showed the effect of tillage practice on susase adpg ppase and stsase activities of inferior and superior kernels at mid grain filling stage compared with t1 t2 and t3 increased the enzyme activities of susase adpg ppase and stsase but the difference between t2 and t3 was not significant the enzyme activities of susase adpg ppase and stsase of t2 were always significantly higher than that of t1 this result indicated that subsoiling and deep horizontal rotary tillage could improve the enzyme activities related to starch synthesis in kernels 3 9 grain yield and yield components table 6 showed the grain yield was significantly affected by different tillage practice in 2016 growing season when compared with t1 and t2 t3 increased the grain yield by 12 7 and 13 1 respectively however the difference between t1 and t2 was not significant in 2017 growing season t2 and t3 increased the grain yield by 6 8 and 8 8 compared to that of t1 the kernel number per ear of t3 was significantly higher than that of t1 but the difference between t2 and t3 was not obvious the thousand kernel weight of t2 and t3 was significantly higher than that of t1 and the difference in kernel weight between t3 and t2 was not significant 4 discussion 4 1 effect of tillage practices on grain filling the poor grain filling of inferior kernel in summer maize is a key limiting factor of grain yield in dense planting and it has become a hot issue to promote the grain filling of inferior kernel in recent years xu et al 2016 shen et al 2017 2018 grain filling is an important physiological process previous studies have reported that some cultural practices affected the grain filling of cereal crops xu et al 2016 shi et al 2013 paponov et al 2001 jia et al 2018 some studies have reported that deep tillage or subsoiling could increase maize grain filling rate boomsmam et al 2010 li et al 2013 tong and jiang 2014 zhai et al 2017 but these studies mainly focused on superior kernels and there is little information on the effect of tillage practices on the grain filling of inferior kernel of summer maize in the present study t2 and t3 significantly increased the kernel weight since the 25th day after pollination not only for the inferior kernel but also for the superior kernel similarly it increased grain filling rate at the middle or late grain filling period moreover t2 increased some grain filling characteristic parameters including a t max w max and d especially for the inferior kernels these results suggested that subsoiling or deep tillage could improve the grain filling of kernels of summer maize especially for inferior kernel which is beneficial to maize grain yield improvement xu et al 2015 found that the poor grain filling of inferior was associated with the low enzyme activity related to starch synthesis this study showed that t2 and t3 increased susase adpg ppase and stsase activities of inferior kernel and superior kernel compared to that of t1 the increase of starch synthase activity may be one of the important reasons for the improved grain filling of different kernel types which is similar to the report by xu et al 2015 4 2 effect of tillage practice on soil water content and root growth appropriate soil water condition is a key guarantee of grain filling and grain yield lamptey et al 2020 kihoi et al 2019 the present study showed that t2 had higher soil water content in middle and late grain filling stage compared to that of t1 and t3 the results indicated that subsoiling was beneficial to soil water retention which agree with previous studies tao et al 2013 he et al 2019 lamptey et al 2020 xie et al 2020 kuang et al 2020 increased soil water content with subsoiling in the present study may be attributed to increased infiltration of precipitation and irrigation water due to the improved soil properties including soil porosity and soil bulk density this assumption agrees with huang et al 2012 and xie et al 2020 who reported increased soil water content as a result of improved infiltrate rate and reduced runoff compared with t1 t3 significantly improved the soil porosity but its soil water content was lower than that of t1 zhang et al 2020 reported that higher soil porosity increased soil evaporation therefore the lowest soil water content in t3 may be closely related to its higher soil porosity which could speed up the evaporation of soil water the further analysis of eta showed that the soil water consumption of t2 and t3 was higher than that of t1 indicating that subsoiling or deep tillage increased soil water consumption which agrees with xue et al 2019 and kuang et al 2020 the more water consumed under t2 and t3 compared to t1 could be from soil evaporation and plant transpiration however further studies are needed to verify it crop roots act as a bridge between soil and above ground canopy and it plays a key role in grain yield formation the present results showed that t2 and t3 significantly improved the root distribution in the 0 40 cm soil layer it suggested that subsoiling or deep tillage improved maize growth this is consistent with previous reports cai et al 2014 zhai et al 2017 kaur and arora 2019 the increased root distribution in 0 40 cm soil profile under t2 and t3 treatment was associated to the improved soil physical properties i e improved soil porosity and reduced soil bulk density zhai et al 2016 reported that long term of conventional tillage practice creates a hard plow pan in the 15 30 cm soil layers in the present study t2 and t3 could break the soil plow pan to effectively alleviate soil compaction which is beneficial to root growth increased root distribution was usually conducive to active water absorption and further regulating the above ground physiological process qi et al 2020 niu et al 2020 4 3 effect of tillage practice on photosynthetic characteristics and dry matter accumulation previous studies have shown that insufficient supply of assimilates is one of the major factors causing the poor grain filling of inferior kernel of summer maize shen et al 2018 the present study showed that t2 and t1 significantly increased the post anthesis and total dry matter accumulation indicating that subsoiling or deep tillage could increase the assimilate accumulation during maize grain filling period which is beneficial to kernel grain filling this agrees with cai et al 2014 and zhai et al 2017 who reported similar results the increased post antheisis dry matter accumulation under t2 and t3 treatment was due mainly to its higher photosynthetic rate leaf area duration chlorophyll content during the grain filling period compared to that of t1 the higher photosynthetic rate of t2 and t3 were associated with the increased water consumption kuang et al 2020 reported that subsoiling increased soil water consumption and grain yield which agrees with our results however inconsistent results was observed from lamptey et al 2020 who reported that the increased photosynthetic parameters were associated with the increased soil water content moreover the increased photosynthetic capacity and dry matter accumulation is related to the improved root growth guan et al 2014 tao et al 2013 niu et al 2020 because strong root system could facilitate the supply of nutrients and water needed for photosynthetic physiology 5 conclusion this study demonstrates that subsoiling and deep horizontal rotary tillage could improve the grain filling of inferior kernel of summer maize compared to that of no tillage the improved grain filling of inferior kernel was associated with the improvement in root system water consumption and photosynthetic capacity which is resulted by improved soil properties under subsoiling and deep horizontal rotary tillage in view of the lower soil water retention under the deep horizontal rotary tillage subsoiling would be an optimal tillage practice in regulating the grain filling of inferior kernel of summer maize declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10290,poor grain filling of inferior kernel of summer maize is a major challenge restricting grain yield of summer maize especially under higher plant densities much work so far has proved that tillage practices could regulate soil properties and grain yield of maize effectively in order to explore the effect of tillage practice on grain filling of inferior kernel of summer maize field experiments were conducted over two consecutive years 2016 2017 and three tillage practices t1 no tillage t2 no tillage with subsoiling t3 deep horizontal rotary tillage were assessed the grain filling parameter showed that final grain weight a the time reaching the maximum grain filling rate t max the dry matter accumulation under the maximum grain filling rate w max the mean grain filling rate g mean and the active grain filling period d of t2 were usually higher than that of t1 and t3 and significant difference was observed between t2 and t1 compared with t1 t2 and t3 reduced the soil bulk density and increased the soil porosity and significantly increased the root dry matter accumulation in the 0 40 cm soil profile by 13 4 and 28 7 respectively soil water content decreased among tillage practices in the order t2 t1 t3 however t2 and t3 increased the water consumption compared to that of t1 moreover t2 and t3 increased post anthesis photosynthetic capacity including the photosynthetic rate leaf area duration and chlorophyll content and further improved the post antheisis and total dry matter accumulation the enzyme activities of susase stsase and adpg ppase of inferior and superior kernel in t2 and t3 were also higher than that of t1 in conclusion the present results indicate that subsoiling could promote the grain filling of inferior kernel of summer maize by regulating soil water content soil water consumption and photosynthetic capacity keywords tillage practices summer maize grain filling inferior kernel soil water content photosynthetic capacity 1 introduction increasing plant density is a key way to improve maize grain yield feng et al 2010 tokatlidis et al 2011 shi et al 2016a 2016b however the poor grain filling in inferior kernel was a common problem under dense population generally the apical kernels of maize ear was defined as inferior kernel shen et al 2017 wang et al 2017 at low plant population the increase in kernel setting is mainly attributed to the superior kernels however at high plant densities the increase in kernel setting is mainly related to the inferior kernels cárcova et al 2000 a better grain filling of inferior kernels could result in higher maize grain yield shen et al 2017 thus it has become a hot issue to promote the grain filling of the inferior kernels in grain yield improvement of summer maize

appropriate conservation tillage improved soil water content liu et al 2013 shao et al 2016 wang et al 2020 a higher soil water content at grain filling stage is not only conducive to the accumulation of photosynthate but also conducive to the transfer of photosynthate which is benefit to grain filling li et al 2019 however long term of no tillage or reduced tillage also increased soil bulk density in the top 10 20 cm soil layer in the absence of subsoiling or other deep tillage practices václav et al 2013 zhai et al 2016 which is not beneficial to crop growth therefore more attention has been paid to subsoiling or deep tillage in agriculture production in recent years berhe et al 2013 zhai et al 2017 schneider et al 2017 gong et al 2018 it was demonstrated that subsoiling or deep tillage practices could improve soil physical biological and hydraulic properties wang et al 2020 which was beneficial to crop root growth and development cai et al 2014 zhai et al 2017 and further regulating the canopy photosynthetic physiology he et al 2020 lamptey et al 2020 xu et al 2016 reported that the strong photosynthetic capacity is a main reason to promoting the grain filling of inferior kernel of maize however there is a lack of information on whether tillage practices could improve the grain filling of inferior kernel by regulating canopy photosynthetic physiology in the huang huai hai hhh plain of china winter wheat summer maize double cropping system was the major cropping system in this region however most smallholder farmers adopted the winter shallow rotary tillage before the sowing of winter wheat and no tillage before sowing of summer maize for a long time this single annual tillage practice creates a hard plow pan in the 15 30 soil layers which adversely affects crop productivity zhai et al 2016 in the present study we hypothesis that reasonable tillage practice could improve maize canopy photosynthetic capacity by regulating some soil properties and root growth and finally promoting the grain filling of inferior kernel in order to verify this hypothesis the main objectives of this study were to 1 clarify whether tillage practices affect the grain filling of inferior kernel of summer maize 2 investigate the effect of tillage practices on some soil l properties and root growth of summer maize 3 identify the influence of tillage practice on canopy photosynthetic capacity of summer maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description field experiments were conducted during 2016 and 2017 growing seasons at the luancheng experimental station

pollination from each plot the upper middle and basal kernels were separated from these ears and immediately freeze them in liquid nitrogen for 5 min and then the samples were stored in the cryogenic freezer at 70 c which is used for the determination of the activities of adp glucose pyrophosphosphorylase adpg ppase starch synthase stsase and sucrose synthase susase the method for preparation of enzyme extracts was modified from nakamura et al 1989 and yang et al 2003 five kernels were homogenized with a pestle in an ice cold mortar that contained 6 ml tricine naoh extract medium ph 8 0

average grain filling rate were 10 9 and 2 0 higher in t2 than in t1 treatment respectively the difference in superior kernel weight and grain filling rate among tillage practices was not significant as showed in table 2 the grain filling parameter of inferior kernel indicated that a w max and g mean of t2 and t3 were significantly higher than that of t1 and significant difference in t max and d between t1 and t2 were observed in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons for superior kernel the difference in a t max w max and g max among tillage practice was not obvious in 2016 but the d of t2 and t3 was significantly lower than that of t1 in 2017 the a w max and d of superior kernel under t2 and t3 were significantly higher than that of t1 but the g max of t2 and t3 was significantly lower than that of t1 3 2 soil bulk density and soil porosity as showed in table 3 the soil porosity among tillage practices was in the order t1 t2 t3 in 2016 and the soil bulk density showed the opposite trend soil porosity and soil bulk density were significantly different among tillage practice treatments in 2017 growing season the soil porosity of t2 and t3 was significantly higher than that of t1 and the difference between t2 and t3 was not significant conversely the soil bulk density of t2 and t3 was significantly lower than that of t1 and there was no significant difference in soil bulk density between t2 and t3 3 3 soil water content and evapotranspiration fig 3 showed the soil water content under different tillage practices in 2016 growing season t2 and t3 increased the soil water content at anthesis compared to that of t1 however t1 has a higher soil water content at the mid grain filling stage at physiological maturity the soil water content of t2 was significantly greater than t1 and t3 in most soil layers in 2017 growing season t2 has the greater soil water content than t1 and t3 in the 0 60 cm soil layer at pre sowing and anthesis stage at mid grain filling stage and physiological maturity t2 always has a higher soil water content with the order of t2 t1 t3 and the difference was significant in most soil layers the results indicated that t3 has poor soil water retention compared to that of t2 and t1 moreover tillage practice had a significant effect on evapotranspiration fig 4 in 2016 the eta of t1 t2 and t3 was 420 8 426 1 and 439 6 mm respectively and the eta of t3 was significantly higher than that of t1 and t2 treatments the difference in eta between t1 and t2 was not significant in 2017 the eta of t1 t2 and t3 was 295 2 309 7 and 305 1 mm respectively the eta of t2 and t3 was significantly higher than that of t1 but no obvious difference was observed between t2 and t3 3 4 root dry matter accumulation as it showed in fig 5 tillage practices affect the root dma in the 0 40 cm soil layer in 2016 growing season t3 increased considerably the total root dry matter accumulation by 23 68 and 20 2 compared to that of t1 and t2 in 2017 growing season compared with t1 t2 and t3 increased the root dma by 12 6 and 22 5 respectively significant difference was observed among tillage practices in 0 40 cm soil layer 3 5 chlorophyll content spad value fig 6 showed the dynamic change of spad value of ear leaf during the growth period under different tillage practices the spad value increased along with the growth development and reached its maximum value at the r3 stage the spad value was significantly higher under t3 and t2 treatments than under t1 treatment at the same growth stage and it is always ranked with the order of t3 t2 t1 3 6 leaf area duration lad net assimilation rate nar and photosynthesis rate pn fig 7 showed the pre anthesis and post anthesis lad and nar of different tillage practices in 2016 t3 significantly increased the pre anthesis lad but no obvious difference was observed for pre anthesis nar compared with t1 t3 increased the post anthesis lad by 13 t2 significantly increased the nar by 20 4 in 2017 growing season the pre anthesis and post anthesis lad of t3 was significantly higher than t1 and the difference between t3 and t2 was not obvious for the pre anthesis nar t2 was lower than t1 and t3 but no significant difference was observed between tillage practices for post anthesis nar fig 8 showed that tillage practice had a significant effect on photosynthetic rate in 2016 growing season the photosynthetic rate of t2 and t3 was higher than that of t1 at different growth period after pollination and t2 was always significantly higher than that of t1 but the difference in photosynthetic rate between t2 and t3 was not significant at anthesis and late stage of grain filling in 2017 growing season t2 significantly increased the leaf photosynthesis rate at the middle and late stage of grain filling compared to that of t1 however the difference was not significant between t2 and t3 since anthesis 3 7 above ground dry matter accumulation compared with t1 t2 and t3 significantly increased the post anthesis and total dma table 4 the increased percentage varied from 5 to 26 4 however no significant difference was found for pre anthesis dma with the exception of t3 was significantly higher than t2 in 2017 in 2016 growing season the harvest index of t3 was significantly higher than t2 and t1 but no obvious difference was observed between treatments in 2017 3 8 enzyme activities associated with starch synthesis in inferior kernel table 5 showed the effect of tillage practice on susase adpg ppase and stsase activities of inferior and superior kernels at mid grain filling stage compared with t1 t2 and t3 increased the enzyme activities of susase adpg ppase and stsase but the difference between t2 and t3 was not significant the enzyme activities of susase adpg ppase and stsase of t2 were always significantly higher than that of t1 this result indicated that subsoiling and deep horizontal rotary tillage could improve the enzyme activities related to starch synthesis in kernels 3 9 grain yield and yield components table 6 showed the grain yield was significantly affected by different tillage practice in 2016 growing season when compared with t1 and t2 t3 increased the grain yield by 12 7 and 13 1 respectively however the difference between t1 and t2 was not significant in 2017 growing season t2 and t3 increased the grain yield by 6 8 and 8 8 compared to that of t1 the kernel number per ear of t3 was significantly higher than that of t1 but the difference between t2 and t3 was not obvious the thousand kernel weight of t2 and t3 was significantly higher than that of t1 and the difference in kernel weight between t3 and t2 was not significant 4 discussion 4 1 effect of tillage practices on grain filling the poor grain filling of inferior kernel in summer maize is a key limiting factor of grain yield in dense planting and it has become a hot issue to promote the grain filling of inferior kernel in recent years xu et al 2016 shen et al 2017 2018 grain filling is an important physiological process previous studies have reported that some cultural practices affected the grain filling of cereal crops xu et al 2016 shi et al 2013 paponov et al 2001 jia et al 2018 some studies have reported that deep tillage or subsoiling could increase maize grain filling rate boomsmam et al 2010 li et al 2013 tong and jiang 2014 zhai et al 2017 but these studies mainly focused on superior kernels and there is little information on the effect of tillage practices on the grain filling of inferior kernel of summer maize in the present study t2 and t3 significantly increased the kernel weight since the 25th day after pollination not only for the inferior kernel but also for the superior kernel similarly it increased grain filling rate at the middle or late grain filling period moreover t2 increased some grain filling characteristic parameters including a t max w max and d especially for the inferior kernels these results suggested that subsoiling or deep tillage could improve the grain filling of kernels of summer maize especially for inferior kernel which is beneficial to maize grain yield improvement xu et al 2015 found that the poor grain filling of inferior was associated with the low enzyme activity related to starch synthesis this study showed that t2 and t3 increased susase adpg ppase and stsase activities of inferior kernel and superior kernel compared to that of t1 the increase of starch synthase activity may be one of the important reasons for the improved grain filling of different kernel types which is similar to the report by xu et al 2015 4 2 effect of tillage practice on soil water content and root growth appropriate soil water condition is a key guarantee of grain filling and grain yield lamptey et al 2020 kihoi et al 2019 the present study showed that t2 had higher soil water content in middle and late grain filling stage compared to that of t1 and t3 the results indicated that subsoiling was beneficial to soil water retention which agree with previous studies tao et al 2013 he et al 2019 lamptey et al 2020 xie et al 2020 kuang et al 2020 increased soil water content with subsoiling in the present study may be attributed to increased infiltration of precipitation and irrigation water due to the improved soil properties including soil porosity and soil bulk density this assumption agrees with huang et al 2012 and xie et al 2020 who reported increased soil water content as a result of improved infiltrate rate and reduced runoff compared with t1 t3 significantly improved the soil porosity but its soil water content was lower than that of t1 zhang et al 2020 reported that higher soil porosity increased soil evaporation therefore the lowest soil water content in t3 may be closely related to its higher soil porosity which could speed up the evaporation of soil water the further analysis of eta showed that the soil water consumption of t2 and t3 was higher than that of t1 indicating that subsoiling or deep tillage increased soil water consumption which agrees with xue et al 2019 and kuang et al 2020 the more water consumed under t2 and t3 compared to t1 could be from soil evaporation and plant transpiration however further studies are needed to verify it crop roots act as a bridge between soil and above ground canopy and it plays a key role in grain yield formation the present results showed that t2 and t3 significantly improved the root distribution in the 0 40 cm soil layer it suggested that subsoiling or deep tillage improved maize growth this is consistent with previous reports cai et al 2014 zhai et al 2017 kaur and arora 2019 the increased root distribution in 0 40 cm soil profile under t2 and t3 treatment was associated to the improved soil physical properties i e improved soil porosity and reduced soil bulk density zhai et al 2016 reported that long term of conventional tillage practice creates a hard plow pan in the 15 30 cm soil layers in the present study t2 and t3 could break the soil plow pan to effectively alleviate soil compaction which is beneficial to root growth increased root distribution was usually conducive to active water absorption and further regulating the above ground physiological process qi et al 2020 niu et al 2020 4 3 effect of tillage practice on photosynthetic characteristics and dry matter accumulation previous studies have shown that insufficient supply of assimilates is one of the major factors causing the poor grain filling of inferior kernel of summer maize shen et al 2018 the present study showed that t2 and t1 significantly increased the post anthesis and total dry matter accumulation indicating that subsoiling or deep tillage could increase the assimilate accumulation during maize grain filling period which is beneficial to kernel grain filling this agrees with cai et al 2014 and zhai et al 2017 who reported similar results the increased post antheisis dry matter accumulation under t2 and t3 treatment was due mainly to its higher photosynthetic rate leaf area duration chlorophyll content during the grain filling period compared to that of t1 the higher photosynthetic rate of t2 and t3 were associated with the increased water consumption kuang et al 2020 reported that subsoiling increased soil water consumption and grain yield which agrees with our results however inconsistent results was observed from lamptey et al 2020 who reported that the increased photosynthetic parameters were associated with the increased soil water content moreover the increased photosynthetic capacity and dry matter accumulation is related to the improved root growth guan et al 2014 tao et al 2013 niu et al 2020 because strong root system could facilitate the supply of nutrients and water needed for photosynthetic physiology 5 conclusion this study demonstrates that subsoiling and deep horizontal rotary tillage could improve the grain filling of inferior kernel of summer maize compared to that of no tillage the improved grain filling of inferior kernel was associated with the improvement in root system water consumption and photosynthetic capacity which is resulted by improved soil properties under subsoiling and deep horizontal rotary tillage in view of the lower soil water retention under the deep horizontal rotary tillage subsoiling would be an optimal tillage practice in regulating the grain filling of inferior kernel of summer maize declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

representative of rice production in nec fig 1 the 134 counties account for the main temperate japonica rice growing area in nec wang et al 2018b and the rice planting area in each county accounts for more than 5 of the total grain crop planting area in the six consecutive years from 2011 to 2016 the three provinces have flat terrain fertile soil and abundant solar radiation the effective accumulated thermal units 10 in most agricultural areas in this region are 1600 3600 d the frost free period is approximately 140 170 days and the average annual precipitation is 500 800 mm and these are the favorable conditions for rice production however the temperatures in the northernmost region of heilongjiang province are unfavorable for rice production while the water availability in the western region is insufficient for rice production 2 2 data the climate data from 87 meteorological stations for the period from 1961 to 2016 were obtained from the climate data sharing service system

management regime differed for the three enso types in the different regions of the study area under cf the rice yields in neutral years in central jilin and liaoning provinces were significantly higher than those in la niña years while the rice yields in the western region of the study area in la niña years were statistically higher than those in el niño years p 0 05 fig 3 the spatial pattern of rice yields under awd was consistent with that under cf however the yields in rf were significantly lower than those in cf and awd and the rice yields in the eastern region of nec were significantly higher in la niña years than in neutral and el niño years p 0 05 fig 3 in el niño years the yield decreased by an average of 2 5 and 2 4 for cf and awd respectively compared with those in neutral years p 0 05 while the decreases in cf and awd in la niña years were insignificant p 0 05 table s3 the rice yield also decreased in el niño and la niña years under rf conditions however the yield losses were insignificant p 0 05 table s3 the simulated rice yields were 11 1 12 4 and 13 0 t ha 1 while the total rice production was 3457 9 912 9 and 791 0 104 tons in heilongjiang jilin and liaoning provinces respectively across enso types and water management regimes table 5 rice production under rf management was 16 7 lower than that under cf management while there was no significant difference between cf and awd management p 0 05 3 3 irrigation water application and water productivity for different water management regimes and enso types the simulated irrigation water application for cf increased from north to south while the irrigation water application for awd decreased from southwest to northeast fig 4 the irrigation water application was 1005 4 mm for cf and 274 2 mm for awd with cf being the most commonly practiced rice water management regime in nec table 5 the irrigation water application differed in only a few counties in northwest heilongjiang province under cf irrigation when compared with the three enso types however there was a large variation in irrigation water application between neutral and la niña years in central heilongjiang province under awd water management fig 4 the irrigation water application during el niño years decreased by 3 2 and 5 6 for cf and awd respectively compared to that in neutral years while the irrigation water application during la niña years increased by 2 5 4 1 and 6 5 under the three water management regimes p 0 05 table s3 the simulated total water application for the cf awd and rf regimes were 1437 3 706 1 and 523 7 mm respectively p 0 05 table 5 with awd and rf rice using only 49 1 and 36 4 respectively of the water applied by cf furthermore the water application in heilongjiang province was significantly lower than that in liaoning and jilin provinces p 0 05 table 5 the simulated total water application decreased by 1 7 and 1 2 under cf and awd respectively compared with that in neutral years p 0 05 table s3 the simulated water application during el niño years under rf regimes was 3 8 higher than that during la niña years p 0 05 table s3 however the increase was insignificant compared with the value in neutral years there was no significant difference in total water application between la niña and neutral years under the three water management regimes table s3 the spatial distribution of the wp for the enso types under the three different water management regimes differs from those obtained for the irrigation water application fig 5 the areas with lower wp ip were mainly in liaoning and jilin provinces which are in the southwest part of the study area in comparison areas with higher wp ip were mainly located in the northern region fig 5 the wp ip in heilongjiang province was significantly higher than those in jilin and liaoning provinces p 0 05 table 5 the maximum wp ip for rf rice were similar to those of awd while the minimum wp ip in different enso years was very close to that of the cf irrigated rice el niño and la niña events reduced the wp ip especially in central heilongjiang province and in the eastern region of jilin and liaoning provinces under the cf regime compared with that in neutral years the spatial patterns of rf rice wp ip for each enso type were pronounced and similar to those of cf however under awd water management the reduction of wp ip in el niño years mainly appeared in northeast heilongjiang province and central jilin province fig 5 the wp ip for cf awd and rf rice were 0 9 kg m 3 1 8 kg m 3 and 2 1 kg m 3 respectively table 5 there were significant differences in the wp i and wp ip among the three water management regimes and three provinces the values of wp i for awd and rf rice were 4 1 times and 10 5 times that of cf respectively and the values of wp ip for awd and rf rice were both 2 times higher than that of cf management table 5 the maximum wp ip was located in heilongjiang province while the maximum wp i was located in liaoning province the wp i in el niño la niña and neutral years were not significantly different from each other under the awd and rf water management regimes in contrast the wp i in the cf regime decreased by 3 0 during la niña years p 0 05 table s3 the wp ip in el niño years were not significantly different from those in neutral years under the three water management regimes although the wp ip under rf management in la niña years increased by 2 1 compared to that in neutral years p 0 05 additionally under awd management the wp ip decreased by 1 5 in el niño years compared with la niña years p 0 05 table s3 3 4 correlations among sst water management rice yield and wp in nec significant positive correlations p 0 05 were identified between rice yields and water application under different water management regimes and the rf rice yield was mostly affected by water application table 6 in addition significant positive correlations were found between average sst and yield residuals in cf and awd from 1963 to 2014 while in rf the yield residuals showed a weak negative correlation table 6 the yield residual data ran from 1963 to 2014 because 2 years of data were lost at the beginning and end of the data series because of the need to calculate 5 year running means 4 discussion 4 1 potential vs actual yield in nec yield potential is defined as the yield of an adapted crop cultivar grown under favorable environmental conditions and is mainly determined by solar radiation temperature and soil conditions the mean simulated yield potential from 1961 to 2016 was 12 7 t ha 1 in nec with the yield decreasing from the southeast to the north and this pattern followed the distribution pattern of temperature and solar radiation in the rice growing season the mean rice yields for the awd and rf water stressed environments were 12 7 t ha 1 and 10 6 t ha 1 respectively although the values of our simulated rice yield were higher or lower than those from previous studies due to rice variety seed bed management and water and nitrogen management practices the simulated rice yield spatial distribution patterns from this study were consistent with other reported results zhang et al 2008 2014 wang et al 2018a as previous studies have illustrated variety changes and management improvements contributed 34 and 16 respectively to the actual increase in rice in nec zhang et al 2016 and the constraints of nitrogen factors were much higher than those of other agronomic and socioeconomic factors wang et al 2018a the average actual rice yield in nec was 7 5 t ha 1 china statistical yearbook 2011 2016 previous studies suggested that the actual rice yield accounted for only 52 6 of the potential rice yield in nec wang et al 2018a and the actual rice yield reduction compared with the potential yield was 23 57 in the usa and southeast asia laborte et al 2012 espe et al 2016 4 2 effect of irrigation regime on yield and water productivity awd irrigation is now widely used in asia and the awd managed rice yield loss was 24 38 compared to that in cf irrigation yao et al 2012 in a separate study chen et al 2017 reported a yield that was 11 5 higher under awd than under cf with a water input level that was 28 4 lower however the simulated rice yields of cf and awd were not significantly different from each other in this research and no yield reduction was observed in awd relative to cf the simulated water applications for cf and awd were 1437 3 and 706 1 mm respectively for nec indicating that the water application of awd accounted for only 49 1 of the water application of cf previous studies from field experiments reported water application values for cf and awd of 660 1870 mm and 530 1520 mm respectively cheng et al 2006 yang et al 2012 yao et al 2012 chen et al 2017 which are similar to the results of our simulation experiments significant positive correlations p 0 05 were discovered between rice yields and water application under each irrigation regime previous studies suggested similar relationships between rice yields and water application cheng et al 2006 based on the wp values the water productivity in the awd regime was 1 times higher than that in the cf regime indicating that awd irrigation could produce a comparable rice yield with lower water application which has been previously reported bouman and tuong 2001 tabbal et al 2002 lampayan et al 2015 the wp ip of rf rice was 12 5 higher than that of awd rice p 0 05 however the rf yield reduction was 16 7 in nec compared with awd p 0 05 and was not acceptable for food security in china the large variations in yield water application and wp among the three provinces were probably due to differences in the actual rice variety emergence date seedbed duration planting density and soil conditions in each province wang et al 2018a 2018b 4 3 negative effects of enso events on crop yield the precipitation during rice growing season deceased in most regions of the research area in la niña years compared with el niño and neutral years as previous research suggested zheng and yang 2014 in addition it was suggested that el niño and la niña events have negative effects on global crop production and the extent varied depending on the crop and region royce et al 2011 iizumi et al 2014 zheng and yang 2014 yuan and yamagata 2015 mourtzinis et al 2016 yu et al 2018 our study suggested yield reductions of 2 5 and 2 4 for the cf and awd water management practices in el niño years respectively for la niña years the yield reduction was insignificant compared with that in neutral years p 0 05 the estimated rice yield reductions were comparable to those reported in previous studies for instance iizumi 2014 suggested the global rice yield deviations from normal yields in el niño years and la niña years were 1 3 and 0 4 respectively iizumi et al 2014 shuai et al 2013 discovered that the actual rice yield reductions in el niño years and la niña years in heilongjiang province were 3 4 and 3 8 respectively the decreased temperature in la niña years likely contributed to the actual yield reduction in nec the simulated yield reductions in nec from enso events were similar to those reported for india the philippines and indonesia lansigan et al 2000 naylor et al 2001 selvaraju 2003 enso mainly affects temperature and precipitation during the rice growth period in nec and thus enso events affect rice yield and water application our study suggested that significant decreases occurred in the irrigation water application and wp ip in el niño years compared with the values in la niña years p 0 05 and these differences were likely caused by the high precipitation during the rice growing season in nec in el niño years table 4 el niño events decreased the total water application under cf and awd management in nec compared with that in neutral years and the wp ip values for el niño years were significantly different from those in la niña years under the awd and rf regimes p 0 05 the effects of enso on rice water application and wp have not been reported in previous studies xue et al 2008a zheng and yang 2014 wang et al 2018a 2018b the enso had a significant influence on rice yield p 0 05 however its variance contribution to yield was only 0 2 whereas province and irrigation contributed to 14 0 and 17 7 of the total variance respectively as demonstrated before the large variance contribution of province was due to the rice variety emergence dates transplanting dates and planting density differences among heilongjiang jilin and liaoning in addition we explored the correlations between the average sst may to september and the yield residuals under the three water management programs at the provincial level the average sst had significant positive impacts p 0 05 on the cf and awd irrigated rice yield residuals during 1964 2014 while the enso effects on rice yield varied between the rf and the other two water management regimes when there was no restriction in the amount of irrigation water applied under the cf and awd regimes and when the yield showed a positive pattern in nec the variance of sunshine hours caused by precipitation changes resulted in differences in photosynthesis among the three provinces as a result the yield residuals responded to the average sst previous studies suggested that sunshine hours explained yield variability better than other climatic variables zhang et al 2008 4 4 limitations of the research our simulations used only one rice cultivar for each province and changes in varieties were not included in our analysis since we only focused on exploring the effects of enso and water management in nec the el niño and la niña years were not regularly distributed during the 56 years from 1961 to 2016 thus we used only one rice cultivar for each province to avoid the complicated effects of rice cultivar alternation additionally nitrogen stress and agronomic management improvements were not considered and there were no other constraints such as insects and diseases or extreme disaster events however actual fertilizer and agronomic management practices do not adhere to this ideal situation furthermore there were 17 el niño years 14 la niña years and 25 neutral years from 1960 to 2015 the short time series for each enso type may have resulted in the uncertainty of the enso effects on rice yields water application and wp in northeast china 5 conclusions through a simulation study using oryza v3 we identified different levels of yield and water application across 134 rice counties in nec from 1961 to 2016 the regional mean rice yields under the cf awd and rf irrigation regimes were 12 7 12 7 and 10 6 t ha 1 respectively and el niño events reduced the rice yield by 2 5 and 2 4 in the cf and awd irrigation regimes respectively the total water application for the cf awd and rf regimes were 1437 3 706 1 and 523 7 mm respectively and the water application decreased by 1 7 and 1 2 in the cf and awd regimes during el niño years compared with that during neutral years respectively the result could provide a scientific basis for optimizing field water management regimes and rice production improvements in different enso years rice producers and decision makers can use the results to understand the impacts of water conditions and enso events and develop effective strategies for rice production additionally the water application of the awd regime was only 49 1 of that of the cf without yield reduction and awd irrigation management is an effective water saving irrigation technology for local government and producers to address the challenge of increasing water application from non agriculture

10291,northeast china nec has recently become one of the largest commercial rice production regions in china however the increased production combined with increasingly frequent climate oscillations

awd regimes respectively compared with those in neutral years the simulated total water application in the cf awd and rf regimes were 1437 3 706 1 and 523 7 mm respectively the total water application

the sea surface temperature sst impacts on rice yield varied among water management regimes in nec el niño events decreased rice yield under cf and awd implying that el niño may hammer rice production in nec and impact china s food security in the future in addition awd management significantly decrease rice water application during both enso and non enso years and is a water saving technology for

representative of rice production in nec fig 1 the 134 counties account for the main temperate japonica rice growing area in nec wang et al 2018b and the rice planting area in each county accounts for more than 5 of the total grain crop planting area in the six consecutive years from 2011 to 2016 the three provinces have flat terrain fertile soil and abundant solar radiation the effective accumulated thermal units 10 in most agricultural areas in this region are 1600 3600 d the frost free period is approximately 140 170 days and the average annual precipitation is 500 800 mm and these are the favorable conditions for rice production however the temperatures in the northernmost region of heilongjiang province are unfavorable for rice production while the water availability in the western region is insufficient for rice production 2 2 data the climate data from 87 meteorological stations for the period from 1961 to 2016 were obtained from the climate data sharing service system

management a total of 22 512 simulations were produced representing 134 counties of rice production under three water management regimes from 1961 to 2016 water management had the greatest effect on rice yield irrigation water application total water application and wp ip p 0 05 table 4 enso also had a significant influence on rice yield irrigation water application and wp ip p 0 05 however the enso variance contribution to yield was only 0 2 while the province and irrigation variance contributions to yield were 14 0 and 17 7 respectively table 4 the simulated rice yields under cf and awd showed the same general spatial patterns for each enso type fig 3 the highest rice yield was simulated in southwest liaoning province under cf management with the rice yields in most regions of the study area ranging between 10 5 and 14 0 t ha 1 the average rf yield was approximately 10 6 t ha 1 in nec and the rf yields were less than 10 5 t ha 1 in most counties in heilongjiang province pr enso type e and water management wm each significantly affected rice yield and several of their interactions pr e e wm pr wm pr e wm also had a significant effect tables 4 and 5 the yields for each water management regime differed for the three enso types in the different regions of the study area under cf the rice yields in neutral years in central jilin and liaoning provinces were significantly higher than those in la niña years while the rice yields in the western region of the study area in la niña years were statistically higher than those in el niño years p 0 05 fig 3 the spatial pattern of rice yields under awd was consistent with that under cf however the yields in rf were significantly lower than those in cf and awd and the rice yields in the eastern region of nec were significantly higher in la niña years than in neutral and el niño years p 0 05 fig 3 in el niño years the yield decreased by an average of 2 5 and 2 4 for cf and awd respectively compared with those in neutral years p 0 05 while the decreases in cf and awd in la niña years were insignificant p 0 05 table s3 the rice yield also decreased in el niño and la niña years under rf conditions however the yield losses were insignificant p 0 05 table s3 the simulated rice yields were 11 1 12 4 and 13 0 t ha 1 while the total rice production was 3457 9 912 9 and 791 0 104 tons in heilongjiang jilin and liaoning provinces respectively across enso types and water management regimes table 5 rice production under rf management was 16 7 lower than that under cf management while there was no significant difference between cf and awd management p 0 05 3 3 irrigation water application and water productivity for different water management regimes and enso types the simulated irrigation water application for cf increased from north to south while the irrigation water application for awd decreased from southwest to northeast fig 4 the irrigation water application was 1005 4 mm for cf and 274 2 mm for awd with cf being the most commonly practiced rice water management regime in nec table 5 the irrigation water application differed in only a few counties in northwest heilongjiang province under cf irrigation when compared with the three enso types however there was a large variation in irrigation water application between neutral and la niña years in central heilongjiang province under awd water management fig 4 the irrigation water application during el niño years decreased by 3 2 and 5 6 for cf and awd respectively compared to that in neutral years while the irrigation water application during la niña years increased by 2 5 4 1 and 6 5 under the three water management regimes p 0 05 table s3 the simulated total water application for the cf awd and rf regimes were 1437 3 706 1 and 523 7 mm respectively p 0 05 table 5 with awd and rf rice using only 49 1 and 36 4 respectively of the water applied by cf furthermore the water application in heilongjiang province was significantly lower than that in liaoning and jilin provinces p 0 05 table 5 the simulated total water application decreased by 1 7 and 1 2 under cf and awd respectively compared with that in neutral years p 0 05 table s3 the simulated water application during el niño years under rf regimes was 3 8 higher than that during la niña years p 0 05 table s3 however the increase was insignificant compared with the value in neutral years there was no significant difference in total water application between la niña and neutral years under the three water management regimes table s3 the spatial distribution of the wp for the enso types under the three different water management regimes differs from those obtained for the irrigation water application fig 5 the areas with lower wp ip were mainly in liaoning and jilin provinces which are in the southwest part of the study area in comparison areas with higher wp ip were mainly located in the northern region fig 5 the wp ip in heilongjiang province was significantly higher than those in jilin and liaoning provinces p 0 05 table 5 the maximum wp ip for rf rice were similar to those of awd while the minimum wp ip in different enso years was very close to that of the cf irrigated rice el niño and la niña events reduced the wp ip especially in central heilongjiang province and in the eastern region of jilin and liaoning provinces under the cf regime compared with that in neutral years the spatial patterns of rf rice wp ip for each enso type were pronounced and similar to those of cf however under awd water management the reduction of wp ip in el niño years mainly appeared in northeast heilongjiang province and central jilin province fig 5 the wp ip for cf awd and rf rice were 0 9 kg m 3 1 8 kg m 3 and 2 1 kg m 3 respectively table 5 there were significant differences in the wp i and wp ip among the three water management regimes and three provinces the values of wp i for awd and rf rice were 4 1 times and 10 5 times that of cf respectively and the values of wp ip for awd and rf rice were both 2 times higher than that of cf management table 5 the maximum wp ip was located in heilongjiang province while the maximum wp i was located in liaoning province the wp i in el niño la niña and neutral years were not significantly different from each other under the awd and rf water management regimes in contrast the wp i in the cf regime decreased by 3 0 during la niña years p 0 05 table s3 the wp ip in el niño years were not significantly different from those in neutral years under the three water management regimes although the wp ip under rf management in la niña years increased by 2 1 compared to that in neutral years p 0 05 additionally under awd management the wp ip decreased by 1 5 in el niño years compared with la niña years p 0 05 table s3 3 4 correlations among sst water management rice yield and wp in nec significant positive correlations p 0 05 were identified between rice yields and water application under different water management regimes and the rf rice yield was mostly affected by water application table 6 in addition significant positive correlations were found between average sst and yield residuals in cf and awd from 1963 to 2014 while in rf the yield residuals showed a weak negative correlation table 6 the yield residual data ran from 1963 to 2014 because 2 years of data were lost at the beginning and end of the data series because of the need to calculate 5 year running means 4 discussion 4 1 potential vs actual yield in nec yield potential is defined as the yield of an adapted crop cultivar grown under favorable environmental conditions and is mainly determined by solar radiation temperature and soil conditions the mean simulated yield potential from 1961 to 2016 was 12 7 t ha 1 in nec with the yield decreasing from the southeast to the north and this pattern followed the distribution pattern of temperature and solar radiation in the rice growing season the mean rice yields for the awd and rf water stressed environments were 12 7 t ha 1 and 10 6 t ha 1 respectively although the values of our simulated rice yield were higher or lower than those from previous studies due to rice variety seed bed management and water and nitrogen management practices the simulated rice yield spatial distribution patterns from this study were consistent with other reported results zhang et al 2008 2014 wang et al 2018a as previous studies have illustrated variety changes and management improvements contributed 34 and 16 respectively to the actual increase in rice in nec zhang et al 2016 and the constraints of nitrogen factors were much higher than those of other agronomic and socioeconomic factors wang et al 2018a the average actual rice yield in nec was 7 5 t ha 1 china statistical yearbook 2011 2016 previous studies suggested that the actual rice yield accounted for only 52 6 of the potential rice yield in nec wang et al 2018a and the actual rice yield reduction compared with the potential yield was 23 57 in the usa and southeast asia laborte et al 2012 espe et al 2016 4 2 effect of irrigation regime on yield and water productivity awd irrigation is now widely used in asia and the awd managed rice yield loss was 24 38 compared to that in cf irrigation yao et al 2012 in a separate study chen et al 2017 reported a yield that was 11 5 higher under awd than under cf with a water input level that was 28 4 lower however the simulated rice yields of cf and awd were not significantly different from each other in this research and no yield reduction was observed in awd relative to cf the simulated water applications for cf and awd were 1437 3 and 706 1 mm respectively for nec indicating that the water application of awd accounted for only 49 1 of the water application of cf previous studies from field experiments reported water application values for cf and awd of 660 1870 mm and 530 1520 mm respectively cheng et al 2006 yang et al 2012 yao et al 2012 chen et al 2017 which are similar to the results of our simulation experiments significant positive correlations p 0 05 were discovered between rice yields and water application under each irrigation regime previous studies suggested similar relationships between rice yields and water application cheng et al 2006 based on the wp values the water productivity in the awd regime was 1 times higher than that in the cf regime indicating that awd irrigation could produce a comparable rice yield with lower water application which has been previously reported bouman and tuong 2001 tabbal et al 2002 lampayan et al 2015 the wp ip of rf rice was 12 5 higher than that of awd rice p 0 05 however the rf yield reduction was 16 7 in nec compared with awd p 0 05 and was not acceptable for food security in china the large variations in yield water application and wp among the three provinces were probably due to differences in the actual rice variety emergence date seedbed duration planting density and soil conditions in each province wang et al 2018a 2018b 4 3 negative effects of enso events on crop yield the precipitation during rice growing season deceased in most regions of the research area in la niña years compared with el niño and neutral years as previous research suggested zheng and yang 2014 in addition it was suggested that el niño and la niña events have negative effects on global crop production and the extent varied depending on the crop and region royce et al 2011 iizumi et al 2014 zheng and yang 2014 yuan and yamagata 2015 mourtzinis et al 2016 yu et al 2018 our study suggested yield reductions of 2 5 and 2 4 for the cf and awd water management practices in el niño years respectively for la niña years the yield reduction was insignificant compared with that in neutral years p 0 05 the estimated rice yield reductions were comparable to those reported in previous studies for instance iizumi 2014 suggested the global rice yield deviations from normal yields in el niño years and la niña years were 1 3 and 0 4 respectively iizumi et al 2014 shuai et al 2013 discovered that the actual rice yield reductions in el niño years and la niña years in heilongjiang province were 3 4 and 3 8 respectively the decreased temperature in la niña years likely contributed to the actual yield reduction in nec the simulated yield reductions in nec from enso events were similar to those reported for india the philippines and indonesia lansigan et al 2000 naylor et al 2001 selvaraju 2003 enso mainly affects temperature and precipitation during the rice growth period in nec and thus enso events affect rice yield and water application our study suggested that significant decreases occurred in the irrigation water application and wp ip in el niño years compared with the values in la niña years p 0 05 and these differences were likely caused by the high precipitation during the rice growing season in nec in el niño years table 4 el niño events decreased the total water application under cf and awd management in nec compared with that in neutral years and the wp ip values for el niño years were significantly different from those in la niña years under the awd and rf regimes p 0 05 the effects of enso on rice water application and wp have not been reported in previous studies xue et al 2008a zheng and yang 2014 wang et al 2018a 2018b the enso had a significant influence on rice yield p 0 05 however its variance contribution to yield was only 0 2 whereas province and irrigation contributed to 14 0 and 17 7 of the total variance respectively as demonstrated before the large variance contribution of province was due to the rice variety emergence dates transplanting dates and planting density differences among heilongjiang jilin and liaoning in addition we explored the correlations between the average sst may to september and the yield residuals under the three water management programs at the provincial level the average sst had significant positive impacts p 0 05 on the cf and awd irrigated rice yield residuals during 1964 2014 while the enso effects on rice yield varied between the rf and the other two water management regimes when there was no restriction in the amount of irrigation water applied under the cf and awd regimes and when the yield showed a positive pattern in nec the variance of sunshine hours caused by precipitation changes resulted in differences in photosynthesis among the three provinces as a result the yield residuals responded to the average sst previous studies suggested that sunshine hours explained yield variability better than other climatic variables zhang et al 2008 4 4 limitations of the research our simulations used only one rice cultivar for each province and changes in varieties were not included in our analysis since we only focused on exploring the effects of enso and water management in nec the el niño and la niña years were not regularly distributed during the 56 years from 1961 to 2016 thus we used only one rice cultivar for each province to avoid the complicated effects of rice cultivar alternation additionally nitrogen stress and agronomic management improvements were not considered and there were no other constraints such as insects and diseases or extreme disaster events however actual fertilizer and agronomic management practices do not adhere to this ideal situation furthermore there were 17 el niño years 14 la niña years and 25 neutral years from 1960 to 2015 the short time series for each enso type may have resulted in the uncertainty of the enso effects on rice yields water application and wp in northeast china 5 conclusions through a simulation study using oryza v3 we identified different levels of yield and water application across 134 rice counties in nec from 1961 to 2016 the regional mean rice yields under the cf awd and rf irrigation regimes were 12 7 12 7 and 10 6 t ha 1 respectively and el niño events reduced the rice yield by 2 5 and 2 4 in the cf and awd irrigation regimes respectively the total water application for the cf awd and rf regimes were 1437 3 706 1 and 523 7 mm respectively and the water application decreased by 1 7 and 1 2 in the cf and awd regimes during el niño years compared with that during neutral years respectively the result could provide a scientific basis for optimizing field water management regimes and rice production improvements in different enso years rice producers and decision makers can use the results to understand the impacts of water conditions and enso events and develop effective strategies for rice production additionally the water application of the awd regime was only 49 1 of that of the cf without yield reduction and awd irrigation management is an effective water saving irrigation technology for local government and producers to address the challenge of increasing water application from non agriculture

10292,water shortage is the most critical constraint for alfalfa medicago sativa l hay production in the arid areas of northwest china in this study we evaluated the effectiveness of partial root zone drying prd with subsurface drip irrigation sdi for alfalfa and compared it with conventional subsurface drip irrigation ci field plot tests were conducted in 2017 and 2018 with three irrigation treatments under partial root zone drying sdi system conventional sdi systems were used as the control the irrigation quotas were 10 mm 20 mm and 30 mm per week for prd1 prd2 and prd3 respectively and that for ci was 30 mm per week the number of drip irrigations for alfalfa in the whole growing stage were 13 and 19 in 2017 and 2018 respectively there were three harvests in 2017 and four harvests in 2018 the results showed that the plant height of prd was 0 4 11 57 cm higher than that of ci under the same irrigation regime moreover prd decreased the annual hay yield of one year old alfalfa but increased the annual hay yield of two year old alfalfa while in 2018 the annual hay yield increased by 832 27 kg ha 1 as compared to that of ci moreover prd has marked effect on alfalfa quality under insufficient amounts of water applied prd1 with significantly decreased acid detergent fiber by 7 81 27 02 and neutral detergent fiber by 0 25 15 23 and increased crude protein by 0 59 12 68 compared with ci crop water productivity wpc of one year old alfalfa under prd3 in 2017 increased by 4 15 15 33 relative to ci while wpc of two year old alfalfa under prd2 in 2018 increased by 1 66 44 32 relative to ci these results suggest that the proposed prd could be a promising technique for alfalfa production in the arid area of northwest china with improved wpc and positive effect on quality characteristics keywords alfalfa subsurface drip system partial root zone drying water productivity 1 introduction as an excellent forage crop the demand for alfalfa medicago sativa l hay in the domestic market in china has increased steadily in recent years to satisfy this demand more than 1 7 million tons are imported annually http www customs gov cn so far more than four million hectares of alfalfa are grown throughout the northern and northwestern parts of the china guo et al 2019 these regions dominate alfalfa production because they provide suitable climatic and soil conditions for alfalfa cultivation however in these arid and semi arid regions with little rainfall water shortages are a major impediment to the continued development of alfalfa production in this region the hexi corridor is a typical agricultural area located in the western part of gansu province china which has an annual precipitation of less than 200 mm although the quality of the alfalfa hay produced here is excellent cultivation is completely dependent on irrigation xiao et al 2015 to address this challenge it is necessary to develop more efficient water saving irrigation methods that can support alfalfa production in this area since partial root zone drying prd or alternate partial root zone irrigation was first proposed kang et al 1998 many studies and experiments have been conducted to investigate the benefits of this approach on various crops ranging from fruit trees stoll et al 2000 and field crops kang et al 1998 2000 in most cases prd irrigation has a great potential to increase crop water productivity wpc and to maintain yield kang 2004 du et al 2008a 2008b most recently it has been tested in vegetable crops such as tomato wang et al 2010 wei et al 2018 potato shahnazari et al 2007 jovanovic et al 2010 and eggplant zhang et al 2014 çolak et al 2018 the results of these studies demonstrated that the use of prd can not only improve wpc but also improve the quality of fruits jovanovic et al 2010 çolak et al 2018 wei et al 2018 xiao et al 2015 conducted an experiment that applied prd to alfalfa grown using alternating furrow irrigation to realize partial root zone drying in the hexi corridor and found that prd could improve the wpc of the first two harvests of alfalfa by 36 42 while maintaining the yield although the yield declined in the third harvest a common irrigation method is subsurface drip irrigation sdi which saves water resources and does not interfere with ground production of alfalfa many studies have shown that sdi can improve hay yield and wpc ayars et al 1999 palacios díaz et al 2009 heard et al 2012 kandelous et al 2012 a multi year study in the imperial valley of california in the us found that the yield in plots irrigated via sdi was approximately 26 35 higher than that in furrowed plots and the smaller amount of water applied and the increased hay yield resulted in an increased wpc ayars et al 1999 in a four year study of sdi in alfalfa at the us department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars irrigated desert research station yields averaged between 19 and 35 higher in sdi plots from 1993 through 1996 compared with furrowed irrigated plots hutmacher et al 2001 kazumba et al 2010 conducted field experiments for two years at the city of beer sheva israel and found that the yields for alfalfa grown in sdi plots were 11 25 higher than those obtained from sprinkler irrigated plots with the exception of a setup in which the drip laterals were 200 cm apart heard et al 2012 investigated the amount of investment required for sdi equipment for perennial alfalfa and found sdi to be well suited to grow perennial alfalfa in other work kandelous et al 2012 developed an optimization scheme for sdi and conducted a multi way analysis to determine appropriate cultivation and management parameters for alfalfa sdi in terms of alfalfa cultivation using sdi it was found that reducing the amount of irrigation significantly reduced the yield ismail and almarshadi 2013 in contrast harmoney et al 2013 found that reducing the amount of irrigation under sdi could improve the quality of alfalfa but reducing the amount of irrigation by increasing the distance between drip pipes significantly affected the yield for large distances kazumba et al 2010 however despite the above listed studies there have been no experimental studies conducted on partial root drying sdi in the root zone of alfalfa in this study we propose a new prd based sdi design for alfalfa irrigation that involves alternate irrigation in the plant root zone the conventional application of sdi in alfalfa involves drip tubes buried along alfalfa planting rows in contrast prd utilizes alternate irrigation in the plant root zone via drip tubes placed only along every two rows of alfalfa the combination of prd and sdi in alfalfa irrigation has the potential to improve wpc and leverage the advantages of easy to control sdi techniques we carried out field experiments at the west of gansu china in 2017 and 2018 using the proposed technique were then compared to those of conventional sdi ci over the same period and the difference between the two methods in the wpc yield and forage quality characteristics of the grown alfalfa were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site in this study a field experiment was conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station at the china agricultural university 35 52 n and 102 50 e altitude 1581 m in gansu province china the climate in this area is that of a typical continental temperate zone and receives over 3000 h of average annual sunshine duration per year a mean temperature of 8 an annual accumulated temperature higher than 0 of more than 3350 a mean annual evaporation from a free water surface of 2000 mm and a mean annual precipitation of 164 mm the soil at the experimental site is classified as sandy loam with an average field capacity of 0 29 cm3 cm 3 a wilting point of 0 09 cm3 cm 3 and a soil bulk density of 1 50 g cm 3 in the upper 1 6 m of soil during the experiment the net radiation temperature relative humidity and wind speed at a height of 2 0 m and the precipitation were automatically recorded by a meteorological monitoring system hobo campbell scientific inc usa which was located close to the experimental site at a distance of 20 m the average temperature and precipitation in the 2017 fig 1a and 2018 fig 1b growing seasons in the experimental area are shown in fig 1 the precipitation received during the growing seasons was 109 mm in 2017 and 192 mm in 2018 and was primarily concentrated in late july and august in addition the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 in 2017 and 2018 was calculated with the penman monteith equation allen et al 1988 2 2 experimental drip irrigation system to realize the prd irrigation of alfalfa a special sdi system was designed and installed at the experimental site a schematic of this system was shown in fig 2 and a photograph of part of the system was shown in fig 3 inline emitters dayu water saving group co ltd gansu china with a discharge rate of 3 l h 1 were installed at 0 3 m intervals the drip irrigation systems were buried at depth of 0 2 m before alfalfa was sown on the plots two groups of drip irrigation units were nested in a test plot and drip irrigation was realized using a solenoid or manual valves on distribution pipes of the two see fig 3 system a provided water during one irrigation event while system b supplied water during the next irrigation event in contrast only one system a was installed in the ci subplot therefore compared with conventional subsurface drip irrigation ci prd increases the investment cost before the experiment in that case drip laterals were placed along both sides of two alfalfa planting rows a flow meter green gutentop water meter taizhou green valves co ltd china was installed in the plots to measure the flow in the various irrigation regimes 2 3 irrigation treatments in the experiment prd and ci were compared in two irrigation methods in which three irrigation gradients were set in prd and compared with ci each treatment plot has three repeated subplots there are 12 subplots in total and the experimental subplots were arranged in split area each subplot had a length of 6 m a width of 4 m and contained 20 alfalfa planting rows fig 2 figs 2 and 3 show the layout of the prd and sdi systems ci was similar to system a which is a part of prd to install the sdi equipment fig 2 the irrigation frequency was based on the experimental results of alfalfa water consumption under sdi in previous years at this station kou 2014 this irrigation frequency was set as once a week and the irrigation quota of each prd treatment were 10 20 30 mm and ci was 30 mm the specific irrigation regime can be found in table 1 the irrigation experiment started on june 24 2017 and may 8 2018 and ended on september 30 2017 and september 20 2018 respectively if extreme precipitation occurred during the experiment the irrigation schedule was delayed by one week this occurred on july 29 and august 19 in 2017 and august 8 august 19 august 26 and september 2 in 2018 due to excessive precipitation fig 1 the irrigation schedule on a weekly basis over the duration of the experiment is shown in table 1 in 2017 the total annual irrigation volume of each prd treatment was 130 260 390 and 390 mm respectively while that of the ci was 390 mm in 2018 the total annual irrigation volume of each prd treatment was 190 380 and 570 mm respectively while that of the ci treatment was 570 mm 2 4 alfalfa management from 2012 2016 the experimental site was used for alfalfa production cv crown kou et al 2014 li and su 2017 on may 10 2017 the area was ploughed roto crumbled harrowed and rolled after which the taproot constituents and developed crown buds were cleared to ensure the uniformity of the experimental land alfalfa medicago sativa l cv mf4020 was established at rate of 20 kg ha 1 in may 20 2017 using manual drilling with a sowing depth of 0 05 m and a line spacing of 0 2 m micro sprinkler management was adopted for seedling irrigation using an irrigation quota of 10 mm twice a week the sowing and growing season in 2017 was from may to october and from april to october in 2018 the plots were harvested three times during the growing season in 2017 and four times in 2018 table 2 pest control was applied as per best management practices throughout the experiment and weeds were removed manually after each harvest 2 5 measurements 2 5 1 soil water content and soil water storage the water content of the soil in each subplot was monitored every 2 3 d using 0 1 m depth increments of the vertical soil layer to a depth of 1 6 m using a diviner 2000 system sentek pty ltd australia two soil moisture measuring diviner 2000 tubes were placed in each subplot fig 2 in addition the gravimetric soil water content was measured via the oven drying method and calibrated using data from the diviner 2000 system sentek pty ltd australia at each harvest stage the soil water storage was calculated as follows huang et al 2018 1 w h θ v 10 where w is the soil water storage mm h is the soil depth cm θv is the volumetric soil water content 2 5 2 growth of alfalfa ten plants were sampled at random from the interior rows of each plot to measure the height and stem diameter of the alfalfa at each harvest the plant height from the tallest part of each plant to the ground was determined using a tape measure and the diameter of each plant stem was measured toward the bottom of the stem using a micrometer all harvests were cut artificially to leave a 5 cm stubble 2 5 3 hay yield and quality the yield was determined by combining a large plot 1 1 m with a small plot 20 20 cm the moisture content of alfalfa was measured in small plot and the hay yield of 1 m 1 m sample plot was calculated based on fresh weight with large sample plot the yield of fresh grass was determined only after harvest first five samples were randomly selected in the test area the fresh grass was weighed and then the samples from the small plot were placed in an oven for 1 h at 105 for sterilization the temperature was then lowered to 65 where it was maintained until the weight stabilized then the dry grass was removed from the oven the dry samples were crushed into fine powder and then sieved through a 0 5 mm mesh before the quality attributes were assessed including the crude protein cp acid detergent fiber adf and neutral detergent fiber ndf the cp was evaluated using a foss kjeltec 8400 instrument and the adf and ndf were tested with an ankom2000 automated fiber analyzer in a bag suspender warnke and ruhland 2016 2 5 4 crop water productivity the actual crop evapotranspiration of each harvest was estimated using the soil water balance method which involved assessing the changes in the soil moisture in a 0 1 6 m soil layer over a period time as follows 2 e t a i p s w d where et a is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm w is the change in soil water storage mm p is the precipitation mm recorded by the hobo automatic weather station i is the irrigation water volume mm s is the supplement of ground water mm and d is deep percolation mm at the experimental site as groundwater contribution was negligible because the groundwater table was deeper than 25 m s 0 also as the sdi system delivered a controlled irrigation volume in this experiment d 0 each harvest alfalfa water productivity wpc fernández et al 2020 was calculated for each plot as the ratio between the alfalfa hay yield and the eta the alfalfa water productivity wpi was calculated for each plot as the ratio between the alfalfa hay yield and the irrigation water applied iwu at each harvest irrigation 3 w p c h a y y i e l d e t a 4 w p i h a y y i e l d i w u the alfalfa annual actual crop evapotranspiration aeta was also estimated by the soil water balance method alfalfa annual water productivity awpc was calculated as the ratio between the alfalfa annual hay yield and the aeta and the alfalfa annual irrigation water productivity awpi was calculated for each plot as the ratio between the alfalfa annual hay yield and the iwu in the whole year 2 6 statistical analysis an analysis of variance anova was performed using ibm spss version 20 ibm corp armonk ny usa to evaluate the statistical effect of the irrigation treatments on the alfalfa growth hay yield quality wpc and wpi figs 6 12 the different treatment methods were then compared using duncan s test analysis of the correlation of measure factors were used to test for associations between the agronomic indicators which were performed using the ibm spss version 20 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water content and soil water storage dynamics the different irrigation treatments of the soil water content in a 160 cm soil profile during the alfalfa growing season in 2017 is presented in fig 4 where it can be seen that the soil water content in the layer from 10 to 80 cm was less than that in the layer from 80 to 160 cm this is consistent with the findings of other researchers that conducted field experiments on irrigated alfalfa bai and li 2003 mundy et al 2006 pembleton et al 2011 huang et al 2018 before the start of the experiment june 7 2017 we measured the 10 160 cm soil water storage of each plot and found that prd3 and prd2 were significantly higher than prd1 and ci p 0 05 the soil water storage of prd3 was 77 78 mm higher than that of ci fig 5 over time except for prd3 the soil water storage in the 10 160 cm soil layer decreased to different degrees compared with that of the ci treatment during the 3rd harvest fig 5 compared with the ci treatment the soil water storage of prd1 and prd2 decreased by 119 82 mm and 34 26 mm respectively prd3 was the only treatment in which the soil water content increased in this case the water content was 32 43 mm higher than the initial value the results of soil water content in each layer showed there was no significant difference between the treatments except in the 40 cm soil layer p 0 05 as time passed the differences in the soil water content among the prd treatments in the 40 160 cm soil layer of each plot were more and more pronounced fig 4b c d and 6b c d there was no significant difference between prd3 and ci in 10 30 40 110 120 140 and 150 cm soil layers at the 1st harvest in 30 40 110 120 140 and 150 cm soil layers at the 2nd harvest and in 140 and 150 cm soil layers at the 3th harvest p 0 05 fig 4b c and d moreover the soil water content in the other layers of the ci treatment was always lower than that in the prd3 treatment with the same irrigation amount p 0 05 research results on eggplants showed that the soil water storage values in prd plots were below the deficit irrigation di in the experimental years even though these treatments received the same amount of water çolak et al 2018 other studies also show that the soil water storage under prd is lower than that under di hu et al 2011 romero et al 2012 beis and patakas 2015 in another study on alfalfa under prd with furrow and traditional furrow irrigation the soil water storage in the 10 100 cm soil layer of the prd treatment was higher than that of the traditional furrow irrigation under the same irrigation amount xiao et al 2015 before the second year experiment we also calculated the soil water storage of 10 160 cm and found that the order of soil water storage was prd3 prd2 prd1 ci p 0 05 specifically compared with ci prd treatments decreased soil water storage by 81 mm 61 mm and 24 mm respectively as in 2017 with the increase of harvesting times the gap of soil water storage between the lowest irrigation prd1 and the highest irrigation prd3 in the 10 160 cm layer in 2018 was getting larger and larger this caused an increase in the soil water storage gap from 56 mm to 128 mm fig 7 in 2018 there was no significant difference of the soil water content between the treatments in the 30 40 110 and 140 cm layers before the irrigation fig 6a the water content of the remaining soil layers in prd3 was higher than that in the ci treatment p 0 05 the reason for this result may be that the same volume of winter irrigation was carried out after the 3rd harvest in 2017 which still did not make up the soil water storage difference between the treatments in contrast there was no significant difference between the ci and prd1 treatments of the soil water content in the 10 30 50 80 110 and 140 150 cm soil layers this may be due to the fact that at the end of the harvest in 2017 the soil water content in the 10 80 140 and 160 cm layers of prd1 was not significantly different from that of ci fig 4d when the results of the two years prd3 and ci treatments were compared it was found that the upper soil water content 10 100 m of prd3 was higher than that of ci in most cases fig 4c d and fig 6c d however the upper soil water content of the ci treatment was close to that of the prd1 which had the smallest irrigation volume fig 6b c and d in addition during 2017 and 2018 the soil water storage of the ci treatment was lower than that of the prd2 treatment and higher than that of the prd1 treatment figs 5 and 7 this showed that prd can maintain a soil water storage similar to that of ci while only consuming 1 3 2 3 of the water it is worth noting that the soil water storage decreases to varying degrees under reduced irrigation conditions are similar to those of previous studies abrisqueta et al 2008 parvizi et al 2016 mehrabi and sepaskhah 2019 this is because previous studies typically involved a reduced volume of water in the prd relative to that in conventional irrigation which resulted in a lower soil water content abrisqueta et al 2008 parvizi et al 2016 mehrabi and sepaskhah 2019 this is also the reason for the common viewpoint that prd saves water in our work we have observed that some of the water provided by a shallow sdi system rises to the surface of the soil and there is no runoff in comparison a key aspect of the prd with sdi is the alternation of wet and dry in the upper and lower regions which also reduces the amount of wet soil exposed to air du et al 2008a 2008b xiao et al 2015 chai et al 2016 to a certain extent this reduces the soil water content that evaporates moreover the proper layout and management of the sdi system is also worth studying kandelous et al 2012 3 2 actual crop evapotranspiration the eta ranged from 82 to 301 mm between the harvests fig 8 and ranged from 421 to 877 mm between the years fig 9 our results were smaller than those of hanson et al 2007 1249 1381 mm fouli et al 2012 more than 1000 mm and cavero et al 2017 from 511 to 1057 mm on the one hand there were only three hay harvests in our study while hanson et al 2007 and fouli et al 2012 had six regrowth cycles on the other hand the precipitation received during the growing seasons was 109 mm in 2017 and 192 mm in 2018 in our study fig 1 the study areas in fouli et al 2012 received 755 and 431 mm of precipitation during the two year experimental seasons this might explain the differences between the studies the et0 of two years was also calculated in detail it is found that the et0 of each harvest was 152 mm 132 mm and 115 mm in 2017 and that was 207 mm 113 mm 128 mm and 112 mm in 2018 respectively in addition it was found that eta of prd treatment increased with the increase of irrigation amount in two year experimental comparing the eta of prd3 and ci with the same irrigation amount the eta of ci treatment in 2017 was significantly higher than that of prd3 treatment and it was the opposite in 2018 fig 9g and h prd1 at the 2nd harvest in 2018 had the lowest eta because the regrowth duration of the 2nd harvest was 29 days ci at the 1st harvest in 2018 had the highest eta because the regrowth duration of the 1st harvest was 62 days table 2 generally speaking the treatment with the least irrigation should have the least eta but the 2nd harvest in 2017 was an exception in this regrowth cycle the prd3 treatment had the lowest eta which was 10 22 and 44 mm lower than that of prd1 prd2 and ci respectively fig 8b this result was largely due to continuous rain on july 26 2017 and july 27 2017 with a total precipitation of 32 2 mm after that on august 1 2017 and august 3 2017 there was a precipitation of 12 2 mm and 11 mm respectively fig 1 in addition the regrowth duration of the 2nd harvest was shorter than that of the 1st harvest and the 3rd harvest table 2 another important reason may be the timely irrigation after the 1st harvest the water demand of alfalfa is not large at this time and the deep soil water storage increased fig 6b and c under the same irrigation amount the eta of prd3 at the 1st and 2nd harvest in 2017 was lower than that of ci fig 8a and b we speculate that prd reduces the eta in most cases through reducing plant transpiration zhang et al 2009 du et al 2017 prd can obviously reduce sap flow du et al 2017 since prd increases leaf aba with a reduction of stomatal conductance collins et al 2010 in addition we also observed that in 2018 the eta in prd3 at the 3rd harvest was significantly higher than that of ci which was similar to the results of beis and patakas 2015 considering the complex response of plants to different irrigation methods differences between the two results can be expected which are not only affected by irrigation technology environmental factors growth conditions pot or field genotype and drought stress rate wakrim et al 2005 beis and patakas 2015 mehrabi and sepaskhah 2019 but also by stand years 3 3 alfalfa growth and hay yield the plant height and stem diameter are two sensitive indicators of the water applied to a plant saeed and el nadi 1997 xiao et al 2015 in 2017 the plant height and stem diameter were the highest for the prd3 treatment fig 10 and there were significant differences between prd1 and the other treatments at the 0 05 level except for the 1st harvest stem diameter fig 10e and f the plant height in 2018 exhibited the same trend as in 2017 fig 11a c and d and the stem diameter in the three hay harvests 1st harvest 2nd harvest and 3rd harvest were the highest in the ci fig 11e f and g although there was no significant difference between the ci and prd3 with the same irrigation volume fig 11e f g and h on the other hand there was a significant difference between the ci and prd1 in 2018 except for the 3rd harvest fig 11e f and h the effects of different irrigation methods on the alfalfa yield in 2017 fig 12a b and c and 2018 fig 12d e f and g are shown in fig 12 it can be seen in fig 11a b and c that the one year old alfalfa hay yield was the highest under prd3 and the hay yield increased as the amount of water increased under the prd regime compared to the ci prd3 decreased the hay yield by 1 68 11 97 and 10 83 respectively at the 1st harvest 2nd harvest and 3rd harvest in 2017 the two year alfalfa yield fig 12d f and g increased as the irrigation volume increased at the 1st harvest 2nd harvest and 4th harvest compared to the ci prd3 increased the hay yield by 13 6 5 70 and 12 8 respectively at the 1st harvest 2nd harvest and 4th harvest in 2018 ci had the highest hay yield at 5717 47 kg ha 1 at the 1st harvest in 2017 and prd3 had the highest hay yield 4415 33 kg ha 1 at the 1st harvest in 2018 which was almost twice that of prd1 similar to the findings of many studies the 1st harvest yield accounted for a large part of the one year old yield lamm et al 2012 klocke et al 2013 xiao et al 2015 fan et al 2016 in the analysis of annual hay yield prd significantly reduced the annual yield of one year old alfalfa and prd3 increased the annual hay yield of two year old alfalfa while the difference was not significant p 0 05 fig 9c and d usually the growth index of alfalfa is closely related to its yield in this study we found that the correlation coefficient between the plant height stem diameter and yield of alfalfa was 0 and 0 46 respectively table 3 many studies have found that the plant height and stem diameter contribute to above ground alfalfa biomass brown and tanner 1983 saeed and el nadi 1997 xiao et al 2015 our results further showed that the plant height and hay yield of the prd3 and ci treatments were opposite although the irrigation amount was the same this result is reasonable and largely caused by the way of irrigation figs 7 and 8 in research on apple trees prd reduced stem sap flow du et al 2017 which means that prd can reduce stomatal opening and affect the transportation of photosynthetic products collins et al 2010 romero et al 2012 it was also found that prd can reduce alfalfa plant height under alternative furrow irrigation xiao et al 2015 but our results do not support this conclusion our result showed that prd with sufficient water supply increased the plant height of alfalfa while a decrease in the irrigation amount decreased the plant height figs 10 and 11 3 4 alfalfa quality characteristics the quality characteristics at the different hay harvests under different irrigation conditions are shown in figs 12 and 13 in 2017 and 2018 respectively with the same water irrigation the adf content of prd3 at the 2nd and the 3rd harvest was 4 17 and 13 67 lower in 2017 as compared to the ci treatment fig 13b and c in 2017 the cp content of prd3 of the 1st harvest was lower than that of ci while that for the 3rd harvest was opposite fig 13g and i p 0 05 different from 2017 the adf content of prd3 at the 2nd harvest was higher than that of ci in 2018 fig 14b and f a prd study on table grapes by du et al 2008a 2008b reported that prd increased the percentage of edible grapes by 3 88 5 78 the vitamin c content in the fruit by 15 3 42 2 and the ratio of total soluble solid concentration titratable acidity as compared to conventional drip irrigation results from a study on tomatoes also showed that prd increased the accumulation of soluble solids vitamin c and titratable acidity bogale et al 2016 mattar et al 2020 as shown the adf and ndf content at the 1st harvest and 2nd harvest in 2017 and the 1st harvest 3rd harvest and 4th harvest in 2018 increased as the irrigation volume increased among the prd treatments prd1 had the lowest adf and ndf content figs 13f 14b and 14f which indicated that a water deficit could increase the accumulation of alfalfa fiber kou et al 2014 holman et al 2016 staniak and harasim 2018 our results also show that prd1 treatment can significantly increase the quality of alfalfa not only by reducing adf figs 13c 14a and 14c and ndf content figs 13d and 14h but also by increasing the crude protein content of alfalfa figs 13i and 14k compared with ci water deficit can somewhat improve the quality of alfalfa kou et al 2014 holman et al 2016 staniak and harasim 2018 by reducing the ndf and adf content staniak and harasim 2018 and increasing the cp content kou et al 2014 holman et al 2016 according to staniak and harasim 2018 lower levels of ndf and adf content under drought conditions are associated with delayed plant maturity based on these findings reducing the water delivered may be a way to improve the quality of alfalfa kou et al 2014 found that the proportion of leaves in an entire alfalfa plant was the main factor affecting the protein content because the stem leaf ratio of alfalfa decreases as the irrigation amount decreases xiao et al 2015 the proportion of leaves in the plant increases which leads to an increase in the crude protein content holman et al 2016 on the other hand this is contrary to the results of previous studies testa et al 2011 liu et al 2018 for example liu et al 2018 interpreted the decrease in cp fractions in drought stressed alfalfa to be caused by a combined stress response to water limitation and a decrease in n fixation at the same time he also found that the content of ndf and adf in alfalfa increased when there was a severe water deficit finally testa et al 2011 found that dry plots resulted in a cp content only one or two percentage points lower than that of irrigated plots and suggested that drought stress did not reduce the ndf and adf content our results also showed that there was a significant negative correlation between ndf and cp with correlation coefficients of 0 42 and 0 81 respectively table 3 it was also confirmed that plant height can be used to evaluate the quality characteristics of alfalfa sulc et al 1997 santillano cázares et al 2014 sulc et al 1997 concluded that predictive equations peaq for alfalfa quality based on a combination of plant height and maturity were robust across a wide range of environments santillano cázares et al 2014 studied that peaq can predict with reasonable accuracy adf and ndf in alfalfa grown in desert regions of the southwestern united states and northern mexico 3 5 alfalfa water productivity in 2017 the highest wpc of alfalfa was in prd3 which was significantly higher at the 1st and 2nd harvest than that of ci p 0 05 fig 15a b in 2018 the alfalfa wpc of prd3 was significantly lower than that of ci at the 3rd harvest p 0 05 fig 16a this is because the eta of prd3 in 2017 was much smaller than that of ci fig 8a b in 2018 the eta of prd3 was significantly higher than that of ci fig 8f but there was no significant difference in hay yields fig 11f xiao et al 2015 reported that prd with furrow irrigation increased the wpc based on the above ground biomass of alfalfa by 36 42 in this study we found that prd with moderate water deficit prd2 could significantly improve wpc especially for two year old alfalfa fields we did not find any difference in hay yield between prd3 and prd2 at the 1st 2nd and 3rd harvest in 2018 fig 12d e and f however in 2018 eta of prd3 was significantly higher than that of prd2 fig 8d e and f compared with ci prd3 increased the wpc by 4 15 15 33 at the 1st and 2nd harvest in 2017 and prd2 increased the wpc by 1 66 44 32 in 2018 the wpc of the prd approach has been studied in detail in many crops gençoğlan et al 2006 found that prd treatment achieved irrigation water savings of 50 when considering the irrigation water applied after treatment programs began in a bean field in another study approximately 31 33 less total irrigation water was applied under the prd method compared to ci with a similar seed cotton yield du et al 2008a 2008b liu et al 2006 found that compared with full irrigation the prd treatment saved 30 water and increased the crop wpc by 59 in a potato field sezen et al 2011 found that prd received about 36 less irrigation water as compared to full irrigation and achieved the highest wpc and irrigation water productivity wpi in two sunflower growing seasons in our experiment the alfalfa wpi decreased as the irrigation volume increased figs 13 and 14 and prd1 was found to have the highest wpi the wpi of ci at the 1st harvest and 2nd harvest in 2017 and 2nd harvest in 2018 was higher than that of prd3 p 0 05 fig 14d e and f the two year data showed that compared with ci the wpi of the prd1 prd2 and prd3 treatments increased by 29 23 118 43 0 45 57 37 and 11 97 13 60 respectively our results support their conclusions that reducing irrigation of prd prd1 and prd2 can increase the perennial alfalfa wpi du et al 2006 shahnazari et al 2007 jovanovic et al 2010 while the prd response under high water supply is complex 4 conclusions the experimental results for both seasons showed that prd maintained a soil water content similar to that of ci but only consumed 1 3 2 3 of the water prd reduced the one year old alfalfa hay yield relative to ci especially at the 3rd harvest however in the second year the annual hay yield of prd3 increased by 832 27 kg ha 1 and the 4th harvest yield increased significantly the results also indicated that alfalfa in prd1 had the highest quality in the experimental years this suggests that less water can improve the alfalfa quality by decreasing the neutral detergent fiber ndf and acid detergent fiber adf content and increasing the crude protein cp content prd3 in 2017 and prd2 in 2018 always had a higher wpc compared with the ci treatment the results show that the proposed partial root zone drying approach is a promising irrigation method for increasing the wpc and quality characteristics of alfalfa declaration of competing interest

10292,water shortage is the most critical constraint for alfalfa medicago sativa l hay production in the arid areas of northwest china in this study we evaluated the effectiveness of partial root zone drying prd with subsurface drip irrigation sdi for alfalfa and compared it with conventional subsurface drip irrigation ci field plot tests were conducted in 2017 and 2018 with three irrigation treatments under partial root zone drying sdi system conventional sdi systems were used as the control the irrigation quotas were 10 mm 20 mm and 30 mm per week for prd1 prd2 and prd3 respectively and that for ci was 30 mm per week the number of drip irrigations for alfalfa in the whole growing stage were 13 and 19 in 2017 and 2018 respectively there were three harvests in 2017 and four harvests in 2018 the results showed that the plant height of prd was 0 4 11 57 cm higher than that of ci under the same irrigation regime moreover prd decreased the annual hay yield of one year old alfalfa but increased the annual hay yield of two year old alfalfa while in 2018 the annual hay yield increased by 832 27 kg ha 1 as compared to that of ci moreover prd has marked effect on alfalfa quality under insufficient amounts of water applied prd1 with significantly decreased acid detergent fiber by 7 81 27 02 and neutral detergent fiber by 0 25 15 23 and increased crude protein by 0 59 12 68 compared with ci crop water productivity wpc of one year old alfalfa under prd3 in 2017 increased by 4 15 15 33 relative to ci while wpc of two year old alfalfa under prd2 in 2018 increased by 1 66 44 32 relative to ci these results suggest that the proposed prd could be a promising technique for alfalfa production in the arid area of northwest china with improved wpc and positive effect on quality characteristics keywords alfalfa subsurface drip system partial root zone drying water productivity 1 introduction as an excellent forage crop the demand for alfalfa medicago sativa l hay in the domestic market in china has increased steadily in recent years to satisfy this demand more than 1 7 million tons are imported annually http www customs gov cn so far more than four million hectares of alfalfa are grown throughout the northern and northwestern parts of the china guo et al 2019 these regions dominate alfalfa production because they provide suitable climatic and soil conditions for alfalfa cultivation however in these arid and semi arid regions with little rainfall water shortages are a major impediment to the continued development of alfalfa production in this region the hexi corridor is a typical agricultural area located in the western part of gansu province china which has an annual precipitation of less than 200 mm although the quality of the alfalfa hay produced here is excellent cultivation is completely dependent on irrigation xiao et al 2015 to address this challenge it is necessary to develop more efficient water saving irrigation methods that can support alfalfa production in this area since partial root zone drying prd or alternate partial root zone irrigation was first proposed kang et al 1998 many studies and experiments have been conducted to investigate the benefits of this approach on various crops ranging from fruit trees stoll et al 2000 and field crops kang et al 1998 2000 in most cases prd irrigation has a great potential to increase crop water productivity wpc and to maintain yield kang 2004 du et al 2008a 2008b most recently it has been tested in vegetable crops such as tomato wang et al 2010 wei et al 2018 potato shahnazari et al 2007 jovanovic et al 2010 and eggplant zhang et al 2014 çolak et al 2018 the results of these studies demonstrated that the use of prd can not only improve wpc but also improve the quality of fruits jovanovic et al 2010 çolak et al 2018 wei et al 2018 xiao et al 2015 conducted an experiment that applied prd to alfalfa grown using alternating furrow irrigation to realize partial root zone drying in the hexi corridor and found that prd could improve the wpc of the first two harvests of alfalfa by 36 42 while maintaining the yield although the yield declined in the third harvest a common irrigation method is subsurface drip irrigation sdi which saves water resources and does not interfere with ground production of alfalfa many studies have shown that sdi can improve hay yield and wpc ayars et al 1999 palacios díaz et al 2009 heard et al 2012 kandelous et al 2012 a multi year study in the imperial valley of california in the us found that the yield in plots irrigated via sdi was approximately 26 35 higher than that in furrowed plots and the smaller amount of water applied and the increased hay yield resulted in an increased wpc ayars et al 1999 in a four year study of sdi in alfalfa at the us department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars irrigated desert research station yields averaged between 19 and 35 higher in sdi plots from 1993 through 1996 compared with furrowed irrigated plots hutmacher et al 2001 kazumba et al 2010 conducted field experiments for two years at the city of beer sheva israel and found that the yields for alfalfa grown in sdi plots were 11 25 higher than those obtained from sprinkler irrigated plots with the exception of a setup in which the drip laterals were 200 cm apart heard et al 2012 investigated the amount of investment required for sdi equipment for perennial alfalfa and found sdi to be well suited to grow perennial alfalfa in other work kandelous et al 2012 developed an optimization scheme for sdi and conducted a multi way analysis to determine appropriate cultivation and management parameters for alfalfa sdi in terms of alfalfa cultivation using sdi it was found that reducing the amount of irrigation significantly reduced the yield ismail and almarshadi 2013 in contrast harmoney et al 2013 found that reducing the amount of irrigation under sdi could improve the quality of alfalfa but reducing the amount of irrigation by increasing the distance between drip pipes significantly affected the yield for large distances kazumba et al 2010 however despite the above listed studies there have been no experimental studies conducted on partial root drying sdi in the root zone of alfalfa in this study we propose a new prd based sdi design for alfalfa irrigation that involves alternate irrigation in the plant root zone the conventional application of sdi in alfalfa involves drip tubes buried along alfalfa planting rows in contrast prd utilizes alternate irrigation in the plant root zone via drip tubes placed only along every two rows of alfalfa the combination of prd and sdi in alfalfa irrigation has the potential to improve wpc and leverage the advantages of easy to control sdi techniques we carried out field experiments at the west of gansu china in 2017 and 2018 using the proposed technique were then compared to those of conventional sdi ci over the same period and the difference between the two methods in the wpc yield and forage quality characteristics of the grown alfalfa were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site in this study a field experiment was conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station at the china agricultural university 35 52 n and 102 50 e altitude 1581 m in gansu province china the climate in this area is that of a typical continental temperate zone and receives over 3000 h of average annual sunshine duration per year a mean temperature of 8 an annual accumulated temperature higher than 0 of more than 3350 a mean annual evaporation from a free water surface of 2000 mm and a mean annual precipitation of 164 mm the soil at the experimental site is classified as sandy loam with an average field capacity of 0 29 cm3 cm 3 a wilting point of 0 09 cm3 cm 3 and a soil bulk density of 1 50 g cm 3 in the upper 1 6 m of soil during the experiment the net radiation temperature relative humidity and wind speed at a height of 2 0 m and the precipitation were automatically recorded by a meteorological monitoring system hobo campbell scientific inc usa which was located close to the experimental site at a distance of 20 m the average temperature and precipitation in the 2017 fig 1a and 2018 fig 1b growing seasons in the experimental area are shown in fig 1 the precipitation received during the growing seasons was 109 mm in 2017 and 192 mm in 2018 and was primarily concentrated in late july and august in addition the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 in 2017 and 2018 was calculated with the penman monteith equation allen et al 1988 2 2 experimental drip irrigation system to realize the prd irrigation of alfalfa a special sdi system was designed and installed at the experimental site a schematic of this system was shown in fig 2 and a photograph of part of the system was shown in fig 3 inline emitters dayu water saving group co ltd gansu china with a discharge rate of 3 l h 1 were installed at 0 3 m intervals the drip irrigation systems were buried at depth of 0 2 m before alfalfa was sown on the plots two groups of drip irrigation units were nested in a test plot and drip irrigation was realized using a solenoid or manual valves on distribution pipes of the two see fig 3 system a provided water during one irrigation event while system b supplied water during the next irrigation event in contrast only one system a was installed in the ci subplot therefore compared with conventional subsurface drip irrigation ci prd increases the investment cost before the experiment in that case drip laterals were placed along both sides of two alfalfa planting rows a flow meter green gutentop water meter taizhou green valves co ltd china was installed in the plots to measure the flow in the various irrigation regimes 2 3 irrigation treatments in the experiment prd and ci were compared in two irrigation methods in which three irrigation gradients were set in prd and compared with ci each treatment plot has three repeated subplots there are 12 subplots in total and the experimental subplots were arranged in split area each subplot had a length of 6 m a width of 4 m and contained 20 alfalfa planting rows fig 2 figs 2 and 3 show the layout of the prd and sdi systems ci was similar to system a which is a part of prd to install the sdi equipment fig 2 the irrigation frequency was based on the experimental results of alfalfa water consumption under sdi in previous years at this station kou 2014 this irrigation frequency was set as once a week and the irrigation quota of each prd treatment were 10 20 30 mm and ci was 30 mm the specific irrigation regime can be found in table 1 the irrigation experiment started on june 24 2017 and may 8 2018 and ended on september 30 2017 and september 20 2018 respectively if extreme precipitation occurred during the experiment the irrigation schedule was delayed by one week this occurred on july 29 and august 19 in 2017 and august 8 august 19 august 26 and september 2 in 2018 due to excessive precipitation fig 1 the irrigation schedule on a weekly basis over the duration of the experiment is shown in table 1 in 2017 the total annual irrigation volume of each prd treatment was 130 260 390 and 390 mm respectively while that of the ci was 390 mm in 2018 the total annual irrigation volume of each prd treatment was 190 380 and 570 mm respectively while that of the ci treatment was 570 mm 2 4 alfalfa management from 2012 2016 the experimental site was used for alfalfa production cv crown kou et al 2014 li and su 2017 on may 10 2017 the area was ploughed roto crumbled harrowed and rolled after which the taproot constituents and developed crown buds were cleared to ensure the uniformity of the experimental land alfalfa medicago sativa l cv mf4020 was established at rate of 20 kg ha 1 in may 20 2017 using manual drilling with a sowing depth of 0 05 m and a line spacing of 0 2 m micro sprinkler management was adopted for seedling irrigation using an irrigation quota of 10 mm twice a week the sowing and growing season in 2017 was from may to october and from april to october in 2018 the plots were harvested three times during the growing season in 2017 and four times in 2018 table 2 pest control was applied as per best management practices throughout the experiment and weeds were removed manually after each harvest 2 5 measurements 2 5 1 soil water content and soil water storage the water content of the soil in each subplot was monitored every 2 3 d using 0 1 m depth increments of the vertical soil layer to a depth of 1 6 m using a diviner 2000 system sentek pty ltd australia two soil moisture measuring diviner 2000 tubes were placed in each subplot fig 2 in addition the gravimetric soil water content was measured via the oven drying method and calibrated using data from the diviner 2000 system sentek pty ltd australia at each harvest stage the soil water storage was calculated as follows huang et al 2018 1 w h θ v 10 where w is the soil water storage mm h is the soil depth cm θv is the volumetric soil water content 2 5 2 growth of alfalfa ten plants were sampled at random from the interior rows of each plot to measure the height and stem diameter of the alfalfa at each harvest the plant height from the tallest part of each plant to the ground was determined using a tape measure and the diameter of each plant stem was measured toward the bottom of the stem using a micrometer all harvests were cut artificially to leave a 5 cm stubble 2 5 3 hay yield and quality the yield was determined by combining a large plot 1 1 m with a small plot 20 20 cm the moisture content of alfalfa was measured in small plot and the hay yield of 1 m 1 m sample plot was calculated based on fresh weight with large sample plot the yield of fresh grass was determined only after harvest first five samples were randomly selected in the test area the fresh grass was weighed and then the samples from the small plot were placed in an oven for 1 h at 105 for sterilization the temperature was then lowered to 65 where it was maintained until the weight stabilized then the dry grass was removed from the oven the dry samples were crushed into fine powder and then sieved through a 0 5 mm mesh before the quality attributes were assessed including the crude protein cp acid detergent fiber adf and neutral detergent fiber ndf the cp was evaluated using a foss kjeltec 8400 instrument and the adf and ndf were tested with an ankom2000 automated fiber analyzer in a bag suspender warnke and ruhland 2016 2 5 4 crop water productivity the actual crop evapotranspiration of each harvest was estimated using the soil water balance method which involved assessing the changes in the soil moisture in a 0 1 6 m soil layer over a period time as follows 2 e t a i p s w d where et a is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm w is the change in soil water storage mm p is the precipitation mm recorded by the hobo automatic weather station i is the irrigation water volume mm s is the supplement of ground water mm and d is deep percolation mm at the experimental site as groundwater contribution was negligible because the groundwater table was deeper than 25 m s 0 also as the sdi system delivered a controlled irrigation volume in this experiment d 0 each harvest alfalfa water productivity wpc fernández et al 2020 was calculated for each plot as the ratio between the alfalfa hay yield and the eta the alfalfa water productivity wpi was calculated for each plot as the ratio between the alfalfa hay yield and the irrigation water applied iwu at each harvest irrigation 3 w p c h a y y i e l d e t a 4 w p i h a y y i e l d i w u the alfalfa annual actual crop evapotranspiration aeta was also estimated by the soil water balance method alfalfa annual water productivity awpc was calculated as the ratio between the alfalfa annual hay yield and the aeta and the alfalfa annual irrigation water productivity awpi was calculated for each plot as the ratio between the alfalfa annual hay yield and the iwu in the whole year 2 6 statistical analysis an analysis of variance anova was performed using ibm spss version 20 ibm corp armonk ny usa to evaluate the statistical effect of the irrigation treatments on the alfalfa growth hay yield quality wpc and wpi figs 6 12 the different treatment methods were then compared using duncan s test analysis of the correlation of measure factors were used to test for associations between the agronomic indicators which were performed using the ibm spss version 20 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water content and soil water storage dynamics the different irrigation treatments of the soil water content in a 160 cm soil profile during the alfalfa growing season in 2017 is presented in fig 4 where it can be seen that the soil water content in the layer from 10 to 80 cm was less than that in the layer from 80 to 160 cm this is consistent with the findings of other researchers that conducted field experiments on irrigated alfalfa bai and li 2003 mundy et al 2006 pembleton et al 2011 huang et al 2018 before the start of the experiment june 7 2017 we measured the 10 160 cm soil water storage of each plot and found that prd3 and prd2 were significantly higher than prd1 and ci p 0 05 the soil water storage of prd3 was 77 78 mm higher than that of ci fig 5 over time except for prd3 the soil water storage in the 10 160 cm soil layer decreased to different degrees compared with that of the ci treatment during the 3rd harvest fig 5 compared with the ci treatment the soil water storage of prd1 and prd2 decreased by 119 82 mm and 34 26 mm respectively prd3 was the only treatment in which the soil water content increased in this case the water content was 32 43 mm higher than the initial value the results of soil water content in each layer showed there was no significant difference between the treatments except in the 40 cm soil layer p 0 05 as time passed the differences in the soil water content among the prd treatments in the 40 160 cm soil layer of each plot were more and more pronounced fig 4b c d and 6b c d there was no significant difference between prd3 and ci in 10 30 40 110 120 140 and 150 cm soil layers at the 1st harvest in 30 40 110 120 140 and 150 cm soil layers at the 2nd harvest and in 140 and 150 cm soil layers at the 3th harvest p 0 05 fig 4b c and d moreover the soil water content in the other layers of the ci treatment was always lower than that in the prd3 treatment with the same irrigation amount p 0 05 research results on eggplants showed that the soil water storage values in prd plots were below the deficit irrigation di in the experimental years even though these treatments received the same amount of water çolak et al 2018 other studies also show that the soil water storage under prd is lower than that under di hu et al 2011 romero et al 2012 beis and patakas 2015 in another study on alfalfa under prd with furrow and traditional furrow irrigation the soil water storage in the 10 100 cm soil layer of the prd treatment was higher than that of the traditional furrow irrigation under the same irrigation amount xiao et al 2015 before the second year experiment we also calculated the soil water storage of 10 160 cm and found that the order of soil water storage was prd3 prd2 prd1 ci p 0 05 specifically compared with ci prd treatments decreased soil water storage by 81 mm 61 mm and 24 mm respectively as in 2017 with the increase of harvesting times the gap of soil water storage between the lowest irrigation prd1 and the highest irrigation prd3 in the 10 160 cm layer in 2018 was getting larger and larger this caused an increase in the soil water storage gap from 56 mm to 128 mm fig 7 in 2018 there was no significant difference of the soil water content between the treatments in the 30 40 110 and 140 cm layers before the irrigation fig 6a the water content of the remaining soil layers in prd3 was higher than that in the ci treatment p 0 05 the reason for this result may be that the same volume of winter irrigation was carried out after the 3rd harvest in 2017 which still did not make up the soil water storage difference between the treatments in contrast there was no significant difference between the ci and prd1 treatments of the soil water content in the 10 30 50 80 110 and 140 150 cm soil layers this may be due to the fact that at the end of the harvest in 2017 the soil water content in the 10 80 140 and 160 cm layers of prd1 was not significantly different from that of ci fig 4d when the results of the two years prd3 and ci treatments were compared it was found that the upper soil water content 10 100 m of prd3 was higher than that of ci in most cases fig 4c d and fig 6c d however the upper soil water content of the ci treatment was close to that of the prd1 which had the smallest irrigation volume fig 6b c and d in addition during 2017 and 2018 the soil water storage of the ci treatment was lower than that of the prd2 treatment and higher than that of the prd1 treatment figs 5 and 7 this showed that prd can maintain a soil water storage similar to that of ci while only consuming 1 3 2 3 of the water it is worth noting that the soil water storage decreases to varying degrees under reduced irrigation conditions are similar to those of previous studies abrisqueta et al 2008 parvizi et al 2016 mehrabi and sepaskhah 2019 this is because previous studies typically involved a reduced volume of water in the prd relative to that in conventional irrigation which resulted in a lower soil water content abrisqueta et al 2008 parvizi et al 2016 mehrabi and sepaskhah 2019 this is also the reason for the common viewpoint that prd saves water in our work we have observed that some of the water provided by a shallow sdi system rises to the surface of the soil and there is no runoff in comparison a key aspect of the prd with sdi is the alternation of wet and dry in the upper and lower regions which also reduces the amount of wet soil exposed to air du et al 2008a 2008b xiao et al 2015 chai et al 2016 to a certain extent this reduces the soil water content that evaporates moreover the proper layout and management of the sdi system is also worth studying kandelous et al 2012 3 2 actual crop evapotranspiration the eta ranged from 82 to 301 mm between the harvests fig 8 and ranged from 421 to 877 mm between the years fig 9 our results were smaller than those of hanson et al 2007 1249 1381 mm fouli et al 2012 more than 1000 mm and cavero et al 2017 from 511 to 1057 mm on the one hand there were only three hay harvests in our study while hanson et al 2007 and fouli et al 2012 had six regrowth cycles on the other hand the precipitation received during the growing seasons was 109 mm in 2017 and 192 mm in 2018 in our study fig 1 the study areas in fouli et al 2012 received 755 and 431 mm of precipitation during the two year experimental seasons this might explain the differences between the studies the et0 of two years was also calculated in detail it is found that the et0 of each harvest was 152 mm 132 mm and 115 mm in 2017 and that was 207 mm 113 mm 128 mm and 112 mm in 2018 respectively in addition it was found that eta of prd treatment increased with the increase of irrigation amount in two year experimental comparing the eta of prd3 and ci with the same irrigation amount the eta of ci treatment in 2017 was significantly higher than that of prd3 treatment and it was the opposite in 2018 fig 9g and h prd1 at the 2nd harvest in 2018 had the lowest eta because the regrowth duration of the 2nd harvest was 29 days ci at the 1st harvest in 2018 had the highest eta because the regrowth duration of the 1st harvest was 62 days table 2 generally speaking the treatment with the least irrigation should have the least eta but the 2nd harvest in 2017 was an exception in this regrowth cycle the prd3 treatment had the lowest eta which was 10 22 and 44 mm lower than that of prd1 prd2 and ci respectively fig 8b this result was largely due to continuous rain on july 26 2017 and july 27 2017 with a total precipitation of 32 2 mm after that on august 1 2017 and august 3 2017 there was a precipitation of 12 2 mm and 11 mm respectively fig 1 in addition the regrowth duration of the 2nd harvest was shorter than that of the 1st harvest and the 3rd harvest table 2 another important reason may be the timely irrigation after the 1st harvest the water demand of alfalfa is not large at this time and the deep soil water storage increased fig 6b and c under the same irrigation amount the eta of prd3 at the 1st and 2nd harvest in 2017 was lower than that of ci fig 8a and b we speculate that prd reduces the eta in most cases through reducing plant transpiration zhang et al 2009 du et al 2017 prd can obviously reduce sap flow du et al 2017 since prd increases leaf aba with a reduction of stomatal conductance collins et al 2010 in addition we also observed that in 2018 the eta in prd3 at the 3rd harvest was significantly higher than that of ci which was similar to the results of beis and patakas 2015 considering the complex response of plants to different irrigation methods differences between the two results can be expected which are not only affected by irrigation technology environmental factors growth conditions pot or field genotype and drought stress rate wakrim et al 2005 beis and patakas 2015 mehrabi and sepaskhah 2019 but also by stand years 3 3 alfalfa growth and hay yield the plant height and stem diameter are two sensitive indicators of the water applied to a plant saeed and el nadi 1997 xiao et al 2015 in 2017 the plant height and stem diameter were the highest for the prd3 treatment fig 10 and there were significant differences between prd1 and the other treatments at the 0 05 level except for the 1st harvest stem diameter fig 10e and f the plant height in 2018 exhibited the same trend as in 2017 fig 11a c and d and the stem diameter in the three hay harvests 1st harvest 2nd harvest and 3rd harvest were the highest in the ci fig 11e f and g although there was no significant difference between the ci and prd3 with the same irrigation volume fig 11e f g and h on the other hand there was a significant difference between the ci and prd1 in 2018 except for the 3rd harvest fig 11e f and h the effects of different irrigation methods on the alfalfa yield in 2017 fig 12a b and c and 2018 fig 12d e f and g are shown in fig 12 it can be seen in fig 11a b and c that the one year old alfalfa hay yield was the highest under prd3 and the hay yield increased as the amount of water increased under the prd regime compared to the ci prd3 decreased the hay yield by 1 68 11 97 and 10 83 respectively at the 1st harvest 2nd harvest and 3rd harvest in 2017 the two year alfalfa yield fig 12d f and g increased as the irrigation volume increased at the 1st harvest 2nd harvest and 4th harvest compared to the ci prd3 increased the hay yield by 13 6 5 70 and 12 8 respectively at the 1st harvest 2nd harvest and 4th harvest in 2018 ci had the highest hay yield at 5717 47 kg ha 1 at the 1st harvest in 2017 and prd3 had the highest hay yield 4415 33 kg ha 1 at the 1st harvest in 2018 which was almost twice that of prd1 similar to the findings of many studies the 1st harvest yield accounted for a large part of the one year old yield lamm et al 2012 klocke et al 2013 xiao et al 2015 fan et al 2016 in the analysis of annual hay yield prd significantly reduced the annual yield of one year old alfalfa and prd3 increased the annual hay yield of two year old alfalfa while the difference was not significant p 0 05 fig 9c and d usually the growth index of alfalfa is closely related to its yield in this study we found that the correlation coefficient between the plant height stem diameter and yield of alfalfa was 0 and 0 46 respectively table 3 many studies have found that the plant height and stem diameter contribute to above ground alfalfa biomass brown and tanner 1983 saeed and el nadi 1997 xiao et al 2015 our results further showed that the plant height and hay yield of the prd3 and ci treatments were opposite although the irrigation amount was the same this result is reasonable and largely caused by the way of irrigation figs 7 and 8 in research on apple trees prd reduced stem sap flow du et al 2017 which means that prd can reduce stomatal opening and affect the transportation of photosynthetic products collins et al 2010 romero et al 2012 it was also found that prd can reduce alfalfa plant height under alternative furrow irrigation xiao et al 2015 but our results do not support this conclusion our result showed that prd with sufficient water supply increased the plant height of alfalfa while a decrease in the irrigation amount decreased the plant height figs 10 and 11 3 4 alfalfa quality characteristics the quality characteristics at the different hay harvests under different irrigation conditions are shown in figs 12 and 13 in 2017 and 2018 respectively with the same water irrigation the adf content of prd3 at the 2nd and the 3rd harvest was 4 17 and 13 67 lower in 2017 as compared to the ci treatment fig 13b and c in 2017 the cp content of prd3 of the 1st harvest was lower than that of ci while that for the 3rd harvest was opposite fig 13g and i p 0 05 different from 2017 the adf content of prd3 at the 2nd harvest was higher than that of ci in 2018 fig 14b and f a prd study on table grapes by du et al 2008a 2008b reported that prd increased the percentage of edible grapes by 3 88 5 78 the vitamin c content in the fruit by 15 3 42 2 and the ratio of total soluble solid concentration titratable acidity as compared to conventional drip irrigation results from a study on tomatoes also showed that prd increased the accumulation of soluble solids vitamin c and titratable acidity bogale et al 2016 mattar et al 2020 as shown the adf and ndf content at the 1st harvest and 2nd harvest in 2017 and the 1st harvest 3rd harvest and 4th harvest in 2018 increased as the irrigation volume increased among the prd treatments prd1 had the lowest adf and ndf content figs 13f 14b and 14f which indicated that a water deficit could increase the accumulation of alfalfa fiber kou et al 2014 holman et al 2016 staniak and harasim 2018 our results also show that prd1 treatment can significantly increase the quality of alfalfa not only by reducing adf figs 13c 14a and 14c and ndf content figs 13d and 14h but also by increasing the crude protein content of alfalfa figs 13i and 14k compared with ci water deficit can somewhat improve the quality of alfalfa kou et al 2014 holman et al 2016 staniak and harasim 2018 by reducing the ndf and adf content staniak and harasim 2018 and increasing the cp content kou et al 2014 holman et al 2016 according to staniak and harasim 2018 lower levels of ndf and adf content under drought conditions are associated with delayed plant maturity based on these findings reducing the water delivered may be a way to improve the quality of alfalfa kou et al 2014 found that the proportion of leaves in an entire alfalfa plant was the main factor affecting the protein content because the stem leaf ratio of alfalfa decreases as the irrigation amount decreases xiao et al 2015 the proportion of leaves in the plant increases which leads to an increase in the crude protein content holman et al 2016 on the other hand this is contrary to the results of previous studies testa et al 2011 liu et al 2018 for example liu et al 2018 interpreted the decrease in cp fractions in drought stressed alfalfa to be caused by a combined stress response to water limitation and a decrease in n fixation at the same time he also found that the content of ndf and adf in alfalfa increased when there was a severe water deficit finally testa et al 2011 found that dry plots resulted in a cp content only one or two percentage points lower than that of irrigated plots and suggested that drought stress did not reduce the ndf and adf content our results also showed that there was a significant negative correlation between ndf and cp with correlation coefficients of 0 42 and 0 81 respectively table 3 it was also confirmed that plant height can be used to evaluate the quality characteristics of alfalfa sulc et al 1997 santillano cázares et al 2014 sulc et al 1997 concluded that predictive equations peaq for alfalfa quality based on a combination of plant height and maturity were robust across a wide range of environments santillano cázares et al 2014 studied that peaq can predict with reasonable accuracy adf and ndf in alfalfa grown in desert regions of the southwestern united states and northern mexico 3 5 alfalfa water productivity in 2017 the highest wpc of alfalfa was in prd3 which was significantly higher at the 1st and 2nd harvest than that of ci p 0 05 fig 15a b in 2018 the alfalfa wpc of prd3 was significantly lower than that of ci at the 3rd harvest p 0 05 fig 16a this is because the eta of prd3 in 2017 was much smaller than that of ci fig 8a b in 2018 the eta of prd3 was significantly higher than that of ci fig 8f but there was no significant difference in hay yields fig 11f xiao et al 2015 reported that prd with furrow irrigation increased the wpc based on the above ground biomass of alfalfa by 36 42 in this study we found that prd with moderate water deficit prd2 could significantly improve wpc especially for two year old alfalfa fields we did not find any difference in hay yield between prd3 and prd2 at the 1st 2nd and 3rd harvest in 2018 fig 12d e and f however in 2018 eta of prd3 was significantly higher than that of prd2 fig 8d e and f compared with ci prd3 increased the wpc by 4 15 15 33 at the 1st and 2nd harvest in 2017 and prd2 increased the wpc by 1 66 44 32 in 2018 the wpc of the prd approach has been studied in detail in many crops gençoğlan et al 2006 found that prd treatment achieved irrigation water savings of 50 when considering the irrigation water applied after treatment programs began in a bean field in another study approximately 31 33 less total irrigation water was applied under the prd method compared to ci with a similar seed cotton yield du et al 2008a 2008b liu et al 2006 found that compared with full irrigation the prd treatment saved 30 water and increased the crop wpc by 59 in a potato field sezen et al 2011 found that prd received about 36 less irrigation water as compared to full irrigation and achieved the highest wpc and irrigation water productivity wpi in two sunflower growing seasons in our experiment the alfalfa wpi decreased as the irrigation volume increased figs 13 and 14 and prd1 was found to have the highest wpi the wpi of ci at the 1st harvest and 2nd harvest in 2017 and 2nd harvest in 2018 was higher than that of prd3 p 0 05 fig 14d e and f the two year data showed that compared with ci the wpi of the prd1 prd2 and prd3 treatments increased by 29 23 118 43 0 45 57 37 and 11 97 13 60 respectively our results support their conclusions that reducing irrigation of prd prd1 and prd2 can increase the perennial alfalfa wpi du et al 2006 shahnazari et al 2007 jovanovic et al 2010 while the prd response under high water supply is complex 4 conclusions the experimental results for both seasons showed that prd maintained a soil water content similar to that of ci but only consumed 1 3 2 3 of the water prd reduced the one year old alfalfa hay yield relative to ci especially at the 3rd harvest however in the second year the annual hay yield of prd3 increased by 832 27 kg ha 1 and the 4th harvest yield increased significantly the results also indicated that alfalfa in prd1 had the highest quality in the experimental years this suggests that less water can improve the alfalfa quality by decreasing the neutral detergent fiber ndf and acid detergent fiber adf content and increasing the crude protein cp content prd3 in 2017 and prd2 in 2018 always had a higher wpc compared with the ci treatment the results show that the proposed partial root zone drying approach is a promising irrigation method for increasing the wpc and quality characteristics of alfalfa declaration of competing interest

relative potential yield salinity reduced the yield earliness index of biquinho pepper keywords capsicum chinense soilless culture salinity salt tolerance 1 introduction the use of brackish and saline waters in agriculture is very characteristic of arid and semiarid regions cova et al 2017 yasuor et al 2017 currently these resources and also wastewaters of different origins delaide et al 2019 jin et al 2020 are increasingly used in agriculture due to water scarcity in humid regions and in places where only good quality waters were employed the problem of using this type of low quality water is that the environmental risks in agriculture are substantially high mainly due to the problem of salinization an alternative to supply water required in agriculture is desalination which can be carried out by different methods according to bales et al 2019 capacitive deionization is an economically viable technique for irrigated agriculture in australia however any water desalination technique incorporates production cost bales et al 2019 nayar and lienhard 2020 on the other hand the use of brackish water in agriculture increases the risk of soil salinization reduces the expected crop yields and also depreciates the cultivated areas as a specific technological alternative for the issue of low water availability and or water quality soilless cultivation techniques have been pointed out among them hydroponic cultivation mitigates the risk of using brackish water cova et al 2017 santos et al 2018 studies such as that of silva et al 2018 clearly point to this possibility without affecting the visual quality of the coriandrum sativum nonetheless if on the one hand hydroponics technique is widely used as a means for studies on the morphophysiological aspects of crops under saline conditions such studies often pay little attention to the use of technique as a means of commercial production under saline conditions in this context the crops to be investigated must have market potential and high profitability compatible with the relatively higher investment in hydroponics compared to conventional soil cultivation among them the cultivation of biquinho pepper capsicum chinense jacq adds these characteristics of commercial attractiveness and for this reason the interest in its exploitation in soilless cultivation has increased rufino and penteado 2006 the species capsicum chinense belongs to the solanaceae family with more than 30 species in the genus capsicum six of which are better known and cultivated c annuum linn c baccatum linn c chinense jacq c frutescens linn c pubescens ruiz pav and c praetermissum heiser pgsm zamljen et al 2020 capsicum spp fruits have several bioactive compounds including capsaicinoids carotenoids phenolic compounds vitamin c and a and minerals such as iron and calcium baenas et al 2019 however it is worth mentioning that cultivars and crop management influence the chemical composition of peppers zamljen et al 2020 in addition it is important to note that within the c chinense species there are several varietal groups including the biquinho pepper bode vermelha naga morich and habanero which differ when exposed to different abiotic stresses gonçalves et al 2015 sá et al 2019 zamljen et al 2020 pepper is an important crop in many countries such as mexico urrea lópez et al 2014 united states niu et al 2010 and spain penella et al 2013 regions where its cultivation is affected by salt stress the brazilian northeast region has this characteristic scenario of a climate favorable for pepper cultivation but with susceptibility to salinity thus an important strategy of management under semi arid conditions is hydroponic cultivation in which the plants besides requiring less water tolerate greater salinity when compared to soil cultivation because it minimizes the effects of salts lima et al 2018 studies on the salt tolerance of capsicum spp in a hydroponic system using water of marginal quality in the preparation of the nutrient solution have been carried out in an nft nutrient film technique hydroponic system using ecw electrical conductivity of water from 1 5 to 1 8 ds m 1 in the preparation of the nutrient solution does not interfere in the production of c annuum santos et al 2018 biomass production and fruit yield of c annuum decreased when salinity of water was higher than 1 0 1 5 ds m 1 in the preparation of the drip fertigated nutrient solution in soilless cultivation using substrate yasuor et al 2017 however the effects of salinity on capsicum spp differ widely within the varietal group lima et al 2018 observed that the increase in salinity decreased fruit production contents of k p and s and increased the levels of na and cl in the leaf tissue of the cultivars c annuum cv bruno and c annuum cv rúbia using coconut fiber as substrate however according to these authors the cv rúbia when grown with ecsol of up to 3 5 ds m 1 yielded 39 9 mg ha 1 higher than that of the cv bruno and similar to that of traditional field cultivation due to the accumulation of ca2 and k levels and lower levels of na and cl baath et al 2017 observed that five cultivars of c annuum can be irrigated with water of up to 3 ds m 1 when cultivated in a substrate composed of the mixture of soil sand and peat in 8 1 1 volume basis proportion minhas et al 2020 in a comprehensive revision of published data on the salt tolerance of agricultural crops classified pepper as moderately sensitive to salinity with threshold electrical conductivity of 1 5 1 7 ds m 1 saturation extract and per unit decrease of 12 14 above the threshold the salt tolerance of the species c chinense biquinho in the initial stage of development was up to 1 5 ds m 1 when grown in a substrate composed of soil entisol and commercial substrate top plant in a 1 1 v v ratio sá et al 2019 the c chinense habanero under saline conditions showed lower leaf concentrations of cl and higher na which indicates that the variety is less tolerant to na niu et al 2010 according to these authors the sensitive varieties accumulate na and cl in the leaves but there were differences between the five cultivars studied bojórquez quintal et al 2014 when working with two c chinense varieties rex and chichen itza identified a more tolerant physiological response of rex which showed a lower concentration of na in the aerial parts of the plant in relation to the root however there is a lack of scientific data on the salt tolerance of c chinense biquinho grown in hydroponic system the aim of this study was to determine the earliness index of yield fruit yield and threshold salinity by different mathematical models of biquinho pepper cultivated in an nft nutrient film technique hydroponic system with brackish water the salinity tolerance was evaluated by the classical threshold slope linear response function mass and hoffman 1977 by the sigmoidal shape nonlinear response

greenhouse set up in the east west direction with ceiling height of 4 m width of 7 m and length of 33 m located in the soil and water engineering nucleus neas at the federal university of recôncavo da bahia ufrb cruz das almas bahia brazil the experiment started at 43 days after sowing das and ended at 163 das i e 120 days after transplanting dat during the experiment august to december 2016 according to data provided by embrapa mandioca e fruticultura which has a meteorological station in the network of the national institute of meteorology inmet 2017 the minimum maximum and average values were respectively 17 20 35 70 and 23 88 c for air temperature 66 46 93 29 and 78 79 for relative humidity and 1 31 5 97 and 4 05 mm day 1 for reference evapotranspiration the studied crop was capsicum chinense jacq pepper of the varietal group biquinho which has red colored triangular shaped fruits seeds from the horticeres sementes company were sown in cubic cells made of phenolic foam 0 02 m3 previously washed in fresh running water biquinho pepper plants were subjected to seven levels of electrical conductivity of water ecw used to prepare the nutrient solution ns the water was salinized by dissolving nacl in the local supply water ecw 0 34 ds m 1 the levels of ecw used were 0 34 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 5 5 and 6 5 ds m 1 corresponding to the weighted averages during the experiment of the electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution ecsol of 2 70 3 64 4 58 5 28 6 09 6 90 and 7 77 ds m 1 respectively these seven treatments ecsol levels were randomized in six blocks longitudinally distributed in the greenhouse and occupying 42 experimental plots an nft nutrient film technique hydroponic system in pvc tubes 0 075 m diameter with five plants was used the spacing was 0 83 m between plants of the same plot and 0 70 m between plots which is within the limits proposed by andrade júnior et al 2018 for cultivation of biquinho pepper the experimental plots were arranged two by two on pvc frames spaced apart by 0 80 m and positioned at 1 00 m height from the soil this spacing resulted in an area of 0 62 m2 per plant each plot was represented by an independent hydroponic channel composed of a 55 l plastic tank of the nutrient solution and a 32 w electric pump to recirculate the solution in the cultivation channel the recirculation frequency was every 0 25 h and the duration of ns recirculation was 0 25 h a cylindrical tank 10 l containing ecw 0 34 ds m 1 was used to refill the ns reservoir in each plot for all treatments the replenishment of water consumed was performed with local supply water ecw 0 34 ds m 1 as the absorption of nutrients and toxic ions by the crop may modify the composition of the ns therefore it was necessary to periodically replace the entire ns of all plots in order to maintain the ecsol of each treatment this protective caution for treatments was adopted at 28 61 and 90 dat in the experimental phase the ns recommended by sonneveld and straver 1994 was used with modifications and the concentrations of n nh4 n no3 p k ca mg s b cu fe mn mo and zn respectively in g m 3 were 18 2 188 3 40 3 244 1 144 3 31 6 41 7 0 39 0

yield accumulated until 120 dat was also evaluated biquinho pepper yield was evaluated in two central plants of the experimental plots based on the number of fruits individual fresh mass per fruit yield of ripe fruits and the relative yield in comparison to the control at the last harvest 120 dat fully formed unripe fruits were also quantified 2 3 number of fruits per plant nfr fruits were harvested and at each harvest were counted to quantify the number of fruits per plant in two central plants of each plot subsequently the mean nfr of the two plants per plot was obtained and the total accumulated from 65 to 120 dat was calculated 2 4 yield of fresh mass per fruit yf the fresh mass per fruit was estimated by the ratio between yield yp and nfr in each harvest and accumulated at 120 dat according to eq 1 then the mean of the two plants per plot was calculated 1 yf yp nfr where yf is the yield of fresh mass per fruit kg per fruit and yp is the fruit yield kg per plant to investigate possible effect of plant aging on the individual mass of biquinho pepper fruits a means comparison test was carried out with two data sets i grouping of yf data obtained at 86 91 and 96 dat and ii grouping of yf data obtained at 106 111 and 120 dat 2 5 yield of fruit yp the yp per plant was estimated by weighted average of harvested fruits during the period this value was used to calculate the yield per harvest and the accumulated yield from 65 to 120 dat from the yield of biquinho pepper subjected to each ecsol level the relative yield yr was established based on the potential yield obtained in the control treatment ecsol 2 70 ds m 1 according to eq 2 2 y r yp i yp c where y r is the relative fruit yield for a given treatment i decimal yp i is the absolute fruit yield for a given treatment i kg per plant and yp c is the absolute fruit yield for control treatment kg per plant 2 6 fruit production earliness index based on the partial yields of biquinho pepper an earliness index ei was calculated for each plot and ecsol level according to eq 3 fioravanço 2015 assuming that increase in nutrient solution salinity would delay the production of this species 3 ei n yp 1 n 1 yp 2 2 yp w 1 1 yp w n yp where yp w is the biquinho pepper production at the w th partial harvest kg per plant n is the total number of partial harvests yp is the production of biquinho pepper accumulated in all partial harvests kg per plant due to the mathematical nature of this index eq 3 a maximum value is attributed to the weighting factor of the first harvest 10 which refers to the 10 partial harvests in the present study thus the higher the contribution of the first harvests to the total yield the closer to 1 0 the index will be and the more delayed the production the closer to 0 1 the index will be 2 7 tolerance to salinity the tolerance of biquinho pepper to salinity was determined using the values of relative yields accumulated from 65 to 120 dat for the total yield of fruits ripe and immature different response models were used namely a model of maas and hoffman 1977 according to eq 4 4 ye r 1 0 ecsol ecsol l 1 b ecsol ecsol l ecsol l ecsol ecsol 0 0 ecsol

mean value dye r decsol model parameters were analyzed using the solver tool of microsoft excel aiming to minimize the sum of squared deviations the method chosen for solution with this tool was the nonlinear grg generalized reduced gradient with convergence of 0 0001 selecting the option to make all unrestricted variables non negative the confirmation of the statistical sensitivity of the fits was complemented in the programs lab fit silva et al 2004 and graphpad prism 7 subsequently the salt tolerance of biquinho pepper was classified by comparison with values indicated in the literature for other species maas and hoffman 1977 based on the threshold salinity and steppuhn et al 2005 based on the predicted salinity tolerance index sti calculated according to the ecsol50 and s eq 7 7 sti

s relative yield slope parameter for unit increase in the electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution the previously cited models assume as independent variable the salinity of the cultivation medium which can be expressed as ec this salinity must be in equilibrium with the inputs and outputs of ions in the cultivation medium in the present study the replenishment of losses by evapotranspiration with freshwater partially ensured such equilibrium condition which was reinforced by periodically changing and renewing the entire nutrient solutions 2 8 data analysis the data were tabulated and initially processed in electronic spreadsheets which were also used to construct the graphs subsequently the data were evaluated in the statistical program sas accessed by sas university edition the significance of treatments ecsol levels was evaluated using the f test of the analysis of variance the scott knott s test at a significance level of p 0 05 was used to compare mean values of each variable studied the tukey test was used only in the evaluation of plant aging on individual fruit mass yf as previously described for variables whose relation of dependence with ecsol was better described by second degree polynomial models the points of maximum or minimum response were obtained by the first derivative of the equations the model of upper plateau y l followed by exponential decay tending to a lower plateau eq 5 but subject to the restriction of ecsol 0 and yi 0 was also tested 3 results and discussion 3 1 fruit production table 1 shows the mean values of the yield of ripe fruits harvested in 10 harvests from 65 to 120 dat for each partial harvest the increase in ecsol 4 58 ds m 1 clearly reduced the yield of biquinho pepper for two reasons reduction in the number of fruits per plant especially at the beginning of the production and reduction in the individual mass of each fruit recorded practically along the entire production cycle it is interesting to note in table 1 that for harvests at 106 and 111 dat the number of ripe fruits was reduced in the control treatment ecsol 2 70 ds m 1 and under ecsol of 3 64 ds m 1 whereas for the other treatments ecsol 4 58 5 28 6 09 6 90 and 7 70 ds m 1 the number of ripe fruits was always increasing this result corroborates the phenological change of plants under the control and ecsol of 3 64 ds m 1 treatments which had shorter phenological cycle compared to the other treatments data not shown the same indication is found in the analysis of the number of immature unripe fruits at 120 dat when these treatments of lower salinity ecsol 2 70 and 3 64 ds m 1 showed partial loss of the capacity to produce new fruits compared to the other treatments of intermediate salinity ecsol 4 58 5 28 6 09 and 6 90 ds m 1 it can be observed that individual fresh matter mass per fruit yf was variable over time because the highest values were obtained at the beginning of the production therefore it can be inferred that as each plant increased the nfr the accumulation of mass per fruit decreased this tendency of reduction in yf over time was observed in treatments ecsol 2 70 and 3 64 ds m 1 for the purpose to demonstrate the change in the yf over time in relation to age of plant an evaluation was carried out contrasting the average yf of three consecutive harvests grouped into two data sets over time i 86 91 and 96 dat and ii 106 111 and 120 dat table 2 comparing the sets it can be observed that the individual fruit mass obtained in the control treatment ecsol 2 7 ds m 1 at the end of the harvest in set ii was significantly lower 1 37 g per fruit with a loss of 0 57 g in relation to the average obtained in set i 1 94 g per fruit the treatment of ecsol 3 64 ds m 1 also reduced the individual mass with a loss of 0 35 g for ecsol 4 58 5 28 and 6 09 ds m 1 the individual mass per fruit at the end of the harvest remained statistically similar table 2 navarro et al 2010 obtained similar results in the cultivation of sweet pepper cv orlando with brackish waters in which they concluded that the reduction in total fruit production with the increase in salinity was more influenced by the lower individual weight per fruit azuma et al 2010 explain that salinity has a greater impact on the pepper fruit compared to the other aerial parts of the plant and suggest that the accumulation of sodium in a greater proportion in the fruits causes water deficit and ionic imbalance in the tissues impairing their growth it was also observed that the plants produced early from the first harvests in the treatments ecsol 2 7 control and 3 64 ds m 1 however from 96 dat the fruit yield per plant yp in other treatments became comparable to that of the control treatment table 1 when a minimum relative yield of 75 was established based on the yield of ripe fruits of the control treatment at each harvest the brackish waters only reached such level later between 91 and 96 dat for ecsol of 3 64 ds m 1 between 101 and 106 dat for ecsol of 4 58 ds m 1 and between 106 and 111 dat for ecsol of 5 28 ds m 1 the other brackish waters did not reach this minimum level of relative yield per harvest table 3 the treatment with ecsol of 6 09 ds m 1 only reached this level of relative yield in terms of immature fruits rameshwaran et al 2015 observed relative pepper yield of two varieties capsicum annuum under ideal soil moisture conditions above 75 when the plants were irrigated with salinity below 3 5 ds m 1 in the spring season and for the autumn season when irrigated with water below 6 0 ds m 1 ünlükara et al 2015 in case of green long pepper capsicum annuum l demre at 103 dat obtained fruit yield above 75 when water salinity was less than ecw 4 75 ds m 1 in pots under greenhouse conditions while alharbi et al 2014 reported that the salinity of 3 4 ds m 1 reduced the total yield of pepper capsicum annuum l taranto production by 35 compared to irrigation with water of ecw 0 9 ds m 1 in the present study biquinho pepper plants in hydroponic conditions tolerate level of salinity ecsol 5 28 ds m 1 maintaining a relative pepper production above 75 these results are possible because in hydroponic systems the plants are grown under excellent conditions of water and nutrients even in saline sodium conditions leal et al 2020 also for the mean values of relative yield per harvest it was observed that at 106 dat plants under ecsol of 3 64 ds m 1 became significantly more productive than those in the control treatment this increase was equal to 26 and at 111 dat the gain was nearly 50 nutrient solution with ecsol of 4 58 ds m 1 led to even more substantial increases of 88 and 124 at 111 and 120 dat respectively plants under ecsol 5 28 ds m 1 produced 96 more than those in the control at 120 dat for the yield in terms of immature fruits harvested at 120 dat there was a tendency of increased production in plants subjected to moderate levels of salinity therefore plants could maintain or intensify the accumulated production after 120 dat this explains why more unripe fruits were produced under ecsol of 4 58 5 28 and 6 09 ds m 1 compared to the control treatment the accumulated yield of ripe fruits and total yield of fruits ripe and unripe until 120 dat were mathematically described by a plateau followed by exponential decay model as a function of ecsol however as the relative reduction was greater than 50 in many treatments the maas and hoffman 1977 model plateau model followed by linear reduction was not compared to the plateau followed by exponential decay response model according to ayers and westcot 1999 the reduction in relative yield is no longer linear when the salinity effect results in yields well below 50 the maas and hoffman 1977 model for estimating the crop threshold salinity was not adopted in the study of time accumulated harvests in such cases the plateau followed by exponential decay model was used to explain the results fig 1a and b the effect of ecsol on the accumulated total yield of fruits also considering the unripe ones was described by plateau followed by exponential decay model from the threshold ecsol of 5 21 ds m 1 fig 1b the yield of biquinho pepper was estimated at 2 87 kg per plant fig 1b considering the spacing adopted area of 0 6225 m2 per plant this is equivalent to 46 1 mg ha 1 at 120 dat in only 55 days of harvest lópez lópez et al 2015 observed yield of 27 44 mg ha 1 for habanero c chinense in mexico under drip irrigation in the open field and in a clayey soil these authors report that the potential of habanero can be up to 31 mg ha 1 in the semiarid region of venezuela jaimez et al 2000 studied a genotype of c chinense sweet pepper subjected to different irrigation frequencies 3 6 and 9 days and reported that the water deficit caused by the increase in irrigation interval led to a reduction in flowering and a delay in the occurrence of maximum flowering which caused a decrease in pepper yield the highest yields reached over three years were around 22 5 mg ha 1 the yield of biquinho pepper in the present study is comparable to that indicated by barroca et al 2015 who studied c chinense de cheiro variety of low pungency in the municipality of são mateus es brazil under field condition with plant spacing of 1 1 0 62 m and irrigated with drippers that applied different irrigation depths based on reference evapotranspiration the maximum yield reached was 43 6 mg ha 1 accumulated until 173 dat in 91 days of harvest for biquinho pepper variety iav 1643 grown in soil under plastic mulch and drip irrigation the average production was approximately 0 53 kg per plant in terms of fresh mass of fruits domenico et al 2012 considering the spacing adopted by the author 0 5 0 85 m its yield would be estimated at 12 471 mg ha 1 accumulated in five months in different autogamous progenies of salmon colored biquinho pepper yields of up to 1 73 kg per plant were obtained heinrich et al 2015 the yield obtained in the present experiment is higher compared to the values of these studies although it should be considered that there were differences between the cultivation techniques as well as between the varieties used 3 2 fruit production earliness index the earliness index for biquinho pepper yield was reduced by the increase of ecsol fig 2 considering all treatments earliness indices always lower than 0 5 represented a production that was more intense in the second half of the harvesting period including for the control treatment ecsol 2 70 ds m 1 however as the salinity increased above the threshold ecsol estimated at 3 14 ds m 1 for this variable the earliness indices decreased with a sharper slope between the ecsol levels of 3 14 and 4 58 ds m 1 the fitted model was plateau followed by exponential decay this result demonstrates the effect of salinity on the delay in biquinho pepper yield differing from other studies which have shown that salinity can stimulate earliness index in some species according to romdhane et al 2016 in the maize crop the period from sowing to ear formation and to physiological maturity is shortened under salt and drought stresses rameeh and gerami 2015 observed that salinity decreased the yield of brassica napus l seeds but that flowering and seed maturity occurred earlier in their review shannon and grieve 1998 reported that salt stress makes onion plants bloom earlier but slows down the flowering of tomato the last mentioned authors while citing a study with early potato cultivars argue that there is evidence that part of the tolerance to salinity can be attributed to earlier maturity a type of escape from salinity in the case of biquinho pepper investigated within a single genotype in the present study the loss of yield due to increased ecsol was considered a salinity sensitive indicator due to the lower smaller earliness index and the low initial yield of biquinho pepper under the increasing levels of ecsol this crop was expected to be very sensitive to salinity for commercial purposes however despite the delay in the yield caused by the increase of ecsol the crop gradually exhibited a recovery of production under saline conditions in this context a hypothetical benefit of the earliness of yield in the less saline treatments including the control treatment would be receiving the gross revenue earlier therefore there could be two impacts one more obvious would be a faster economic return and the other would be more related to cash flow in financial transactions of applying these revenues in addition it should be considered that earlier harvests are a guarantee of earlier income in hydroponic systems which in brazil are still vulnerable to electricity failures as is the case with nft poor technical training of the producer serious phytosanitary and nutritional management problems among others this consideration can be validated in an abrupt interruption of production if such interruption occurred in the middle of the production cycle that is soon after the fifth harvest at 91 dat based on data from table 1 relating the yield obtained until 91 dat and the total yield ripe immature at 120 dat there would be a guarantee of 23 and 16 5 for the control and ecsol 3 64 ds m 1 treatments while the other treatments would have production below 5 3 3 tolerance to salinity in the present study the nutrient solution electrical conductivity only due to the fertilizer was approximately 2 4 ds m 1 when prepared with ecw 0 34 ds m 1 sonneveld 2004 discuss the need for considering the minimum salinity resulting from fertilizers while studying the adaptation of the maas and hoffman 1977 model for soilless cultivation because of these considerations the importance of adopting the time weighted ecsol and not the ecw as an independent variable is reiterated from the visual analysis of the relative yields described by the graphs of the tested models fig 3 it can be inferred that the model of maas and hoffman 1977 led to zero production more abruptly thus for the present experiment the nonlinear models explained better the reduction of relative yield when it tended to zero due to increase in salinity of nutrient solution the maas and hoffman 1977 model was fitted for a threshold salinity of 4 60 ds m 1 and relative reduction b of 33 4 per unit increase in the ecsol fig 3a under conventional cultivation in soil rameshwaran et al 2016 observed a salinity threshold of 1 43 ds m 1 and a reduction of 11 1 per unit increase in ecse in two varieties of c annuum the threshold salinity found by ünlükara et al 2015 for c annuum in a greenhouse was ecse 1 2 ds m 1 and slope decrease of 7 03 for each unit addition of salinity in the soil after the threshold value rameshwaran et al 2016 comparing their results with different studies attributed the differences observed in the parameters of the linear response function of the slope due to the pepper variety growing environmental conditions method and amount of irrigation and application of fertilizers however divergences between these studies and the present one may be related to moisture regimes that varies in conventional irrigation systems reduction of osmotic and matric potentials of soil between irrigation intervals dias et al 2019 and the nft hydroponic cultivation where the plants grow without such restrictions according to relative salt tolerance of crops proposed by maas 1984 pepper is considered as moderately sensitive threshold saturation extract salinity between 3 0 and 6 0 ds m 1 but highlighting the difficulty of comparing the hydroponic and conventional system the problem of this comparison lies in the fact that the above mentioned classification is proposed for conventional cultivation in soil and based on the electrical conductivity measured in the soil saturation extract ecse and not on the actual moisture during cultivation therefore there is a great technical difficulty in comparing or extrapolating values of salt tolerance between the hydroponic and traditional systems in soil to perform this analysis it is necessary to install cultivation conditions similar to those used by leal et al 2020 in the traditional cultivation in soil due to depletion of soil moisture there is increase in electrical conductivity of soil solution with consequent decrease in osmotic and matric potential between two irrigations or rain events in contrast in hydroponic cultivation the oscillation of salt concentration is much smaller thus plants grown in soil undergo significant fluctuations in the rhizosphere ec which is unparalleled by the value of the ecse while in hydroponics cultivation the plant is grown under saturation in the soil this is not possible despite the concept of ecse refer to this condition the concept of ecse also fails to include effects such as temperature which alters ionic activity and therefore ec in the rhizosphere ecse is the standard measure of salinity shahid et al 2018 a good parameter for soil classification purposes but it should be used with caution in the analysis of salt tolerance to crop on the other hand considering the popularity of this parameter and assuming that the ecsol in hydroponics is approximately equal to the ecse of the soil in terms of medium saturation and that the soil moisture at the point of the saturation is approximately 1 5 fold higher than the moisture at the field capacity of local ultisol the threshold salinity found in the present study ecsol 5 22 ds m 1 plateau followed by exponential decay would correspond to a soil ecse equal to approximately 7 83 ds m 1 this finding is valid for high frequency irrigated cultivation with soil moisture always tending to field capacity this exercise is important to reveal the importance of studies conducted in hydroponics and the potential of this technique for new opportunities for the rational use of brackish waters in hydroponic cultivation the plant is grown in nutrient solution without soil but in the soil the irrigated crop is usually cultivated with moisture varying between field capacity and critical moisture therefore the actual ec tolerated in the soil rhizosphere should be higher than the ecse because of the effect of concentration of solutes thus comparison by extrapolation is not correct another interesting aspect observed from the model is the high value of relative reduction in yield 33 4 per unit increase in the ecsol beyond 4 60 ds m 1 in the tables based on the study of maas and hoffman 1977 as found in ayers and westcot 1999 values with this magnitude are rare the use of the plateau followed by exponential decay model fig 3b established a threshold salinity of 5 22 ds m 1 hence higher than the estimated threshold of the model of maas and hoffman 1977 the advantage of the fit of this exponential model was only 5 5 approximately in terms of increase in the coefficient of determination similar results were found in plants of abelmoschus esculentus cultivated in hydroponic system which had threshold salinity of 5 43 ds m 1 using the plateau model modesto et al 2019 the model of steppuhn et al 2005 does not assume a threshold salinity but delimits a plateau of potential response yr 100 it employs the concept of ecsol50 which is the electrical conductivity of the growth medium corresponding to a 50 reduction in the yield obtained in the non saline condition in the present study this ecsol50 was estimated at approximately 5 90 ds m 1 fig 3c in the model of maas and hoffman 1977 the value of ecsol corresponding to a relative yield of 50 would be approximately 6 10 ds m 1 for the plateau followed by exponential decay model it would be approximately 5 62 ds m 1 therefore for this specific yr the model of steppuhn et al 2005 seems to be more central and convergent rameshwaran et al 2016 using the model of maas and hoffman 1977 and steppuhn et al 2005 for a relative yield reported ec50 of 5 92 and 5 60 ds m 1 respectively for two c annuum var onur f1 and ada f1 irrigated with water of electrical conductivity in the range between 1 0 and 6 0 ds m 1 according to these authors both mathematical models adjusted reasonably well to the data with single representation and good correlation classifying the peppers as moderately sensitive to salinity in both model another important aspect is that the steepness parameter s of the steppuhn et al 2005 model was 0 502 ds m 1 1 comparing it with the tabulated values presented by the authors for different crops the s value adjusted for biquinho pepper is among the highest ones nonetheless it is indeed consistent with the abrupt reduction in the relative yield after the segment of relative yields close to the potential fig 3c therefore it is consistent with the high value of the coefficient b of the maas and hoffman 1977 model based on the model of steppuhn et al 2005 the salinity tolerance index of biquinho pepper was 8 86 in their study steppuhn et al 2005 found an index of 5 77 for bell pepper grown in soil produced with ecsol50 of 4 76 ds m 1 and an s steepness of 0 213 ds m 1 1 while rameshwaran et al 2016 for two c annuum varieties in conventional cultivation system and under mediterranean climate observed s value of 0 16 with a salinity tolerance index of 6 5 the high value of the tolerance index in the present study can be attributed to the pepper variety and cultivation environment hydroponics bell pepper is more closely related to biquinho pepper but the direct comparison of their values of ecsol50 and salinity tolerance index becomes inappropriate due to the differences in the production systems when compared to the steppuhn et al 2005 study on the other hand considering only the s parameter it can be inferred that the relative reduction in the yield of biquinho pepper was higher in terms of value per unit increase in the ecsol the parameters b and s represent the slope of the reduction in crop yield as a function of salinity but unlike the b parameter of the mass and hoffman 1977 model the s parameter of steppuhn et al 2005 is dependent on the magnitude of salinity a fact that reinforces the difficulty of directly comparing data of soil bell pepper and nft hydroponics biquinho pepper if on the one hand the categorical comparison of indicators seems unviable as discussed previously the values of the parameter of steppuhn et al 2005 and of the parameters obtained in the present study for biquinho pepper will be useful for the exploitation of the crop under hydroponic conditions moreover despite its greater use the model of maas and hoffman 1977 has more limitations than that of steppuhn et al 2005 which seems to have become more and more recognized by the researchers thapa et al 2017 butcher et al 2018 the plateau followed by exponential decay model despite not having parameters of biophysical significance as simple as that of parameters of the model of steppuhn et al 2005 has the advantage of maintaining a threshold indicator of potential salinity like the model presented by maas and hoffman 1977 but without the inconvenience of losing fit when the relative yield decreases to less than 50 4 conclusions the yield of biquinho pepper grown in nft nutrient film technique hydroponic system without restriction of salinity was 2 87 kg per plant with estimated yield of 46 1 mg ha 1 considering the adopted area per plant of 0 6225 m2 from the salinity threshold the reduction in production is marked for nutrient solution electrical conductivity of up to 5 22 ds m 1 there is a potential relative yield of hydroponic biquinho pepper based on a plateau followed by exponential decay model salinity reduces the earliness index of yield of biquinho pepper declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10293,in order to generate information about the potential of biquinho pepper as an alternative crop for regions with limited supply of freshwater but with availability of brackish water such as the semiarid region a study was carried out with this crop grown in nft nutrient film technique hydroponic system for 120 days after transplanting dat the experiment used nutrient solution prepared in water from the local municipal supply system electrical conductivity of water ecw 0 34 ds m 1 and six other brackish waters prepared artificially by the addition of nacl with electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution ecsol 2 70 control 3 64 4 58 5 28 6 09 6 90 and 7 77 ds m 1 composing seven treatments repeated six times in randomized blocks fruit yield salt tolerance and yield earliness index were evaluated the yield of biquinho pepper cultivated in nft hydroponic system without restriction of salinity was 2 87 kg per plant corresponding to 46 1 mg ha 1 considering an estimated area

relative potential yield salinity reduced the yield earliness index of biquinho pepper keywords capsicum chinense soilless culture salinity salt tolerance 1 introduction the use of brackish and saline waters in agriculture is very characteristic of arid and semiarid regions cova et al 2017 yasuor et al 2017 currently these resources and also wastewaters of different origins delaide et al 2019 jin et al 2020 are increasingly used in agriculture due to water scarcity in humid regions and in places where only good quality waters were employed the problem of using this type of low quality water is that the environmental risks in agriculture are substantially high mainly due to the problem of salinization an alternative to supply water required in agriculture is desalination which can be carried out by different methods according to bales et al 2019 capacitive deionization is an economically viable technique for irrigated agriculture in australia however any water desalination technique incorporates production cost bales et al 2019 nayar and lienhard 2020 on the other hand the use of brackish water in agriculture increases the risk of soil salinization reduces the expected crop yields and also depreciates the cultivated areas as a specific technological alternative for the issue of low water availability and or water quality soilless cultivation techniques have been pointed out among them hydroponic cultivation mitigates the risk of using brackish water cova et al 2017 santos et al 2018 studies such as that of silva et al 2018 clearly point to this possibility without affecting the visual quality of the coriandrum sativum nonetheless if on the one hand hydroponics technique is widely used as a means for studies on the morphophysiological aspects of crops under saline conditions such studies often pay little attention to the use of technique as a means of commercial production under saline conditions in this context the crops to be investigated must have market potential and high profitability compatible with the relatively higher investment in hydroponics compared to conventional soil cultivation among them the cultivation of biquinho pepper capsicum chinense jacq adds these characteristics of commercial attractiveness and for this reason the interest in its exploitation in soilless cultivation has increased rufino and penteado 2006 the species capsicum chinense belongs to the solanaceae family with more than 30 species in the genus capsicum six of which are better known and cultivated c annuum linn c baccatum linn c chinense jacq c frutescens linn c pubescens ruiz pav and c praetermissum heiser pgsm zamljen et al 2020 capsicum spp fruits have several bioactive compounds including capsaicinoids carotenoids phenolic compounds vitamin c and a and minerals such as iron and calcium baenas et al 2019 however it is worth mentioning that cultivars and crop management influence the chemical composition of peppers zamljen et al 2020 in addition it is important to note that within the c chinense species there are several varietal groups including the biquinho pepper bode vermelha naga morich and habanero which differ when exposed to different abiotic stresses gonçalves et al 2015 sá et al 2019 zamljen et al 2020 pepper is an important crop in many countries such as mexico urrea lópez et al 2014 united states niu et al 2010 and spain penella et al 2013 regions where its cultivation is affected by salt stress the brazilian northeast region has this characteristic scenario of a climate favorable for pepper cultivation but with susceptibility to salinity thus an important strategy of management under semi arid conditions is hydroponic cultivation in which the plants besides requiring less water tolerate greater salinity when compared to soil cultivation because it minimizes the effects of salts lima et al 2018 studies on the salt tolerance of capsicum spp in a hydroponic system using water of marginal quality in the preparation of the nutrient solution have been carried out in an nft nutrient film technique hydroponic system using ecw electrical conductivity of water from 1 5 to 1 8 ds m 1 in the preparation of the nutrient solution does not interfere in the production of c annuum santos et al 2018 biomass production and fruit yield of c annuum decreased when salinity of water was higher than 1 0 1 5 ds m 1 in the preparation of the drip fertigated nutrient solution in soilless cultivation using substrate yasuor et al 2017 however the effects of salinity on capsicum spp differ widely within the varietal group lima et al 2018 observed that the increase in salinity decreased fruit production contents of k p and s and increased the levels of na and cl in the leaf tissue of the cultivars c annuum cv bruno and c annuum cv rúbia using coconut fiber as substrate however according to these authors the cv rúbia when grown with ecsol of up to 3 5 ds m 1 yielded 39 9 mg ha 1 higher than that of the cv bruno and similar to that of traditional field cultivation due to the accumulation of ca2 and k levels and lower levels of na and cl baath et al 2017 observed that five cultivars of c annuum can be irrigated with water of up to 3 ds m 1 when cultivated in a substrate composed of the mixture of soil sand and peat in 8 1 1 volume basis proportion minhas et al 2020 in a comprehensive revision of published data on the salt tolerance of agricultural crops classified pepper as moderately sensitive to salinity with threshold electrical conductivity of 1 5 1 7 ds m 1 saturation extract and per unit decrease of 12 14 above the threshold the salt tolerance of the species c chinense biquinho in the initial stage of development was up to 1 5 ds m 1 when grown in a substrate composed of soil entisol and commercial substrate top plant in a 1 1 v v ratio sá et al 2019 the c chinense habanero under saline conditions showed lower leaf concentrations of cl and higher na which indicates that the variety is less tolerant to na niu et al 2010 according to these authors the sensitive varieties accumulate na and cl in the leaves but there were differences between the five cultivars studied bojórquez quintal et al 2014 when working with two c chinense varieties rex and chichen itza identified a more tolerant physiological response of rex which showed a lower concentration of na in the aerial parts of the plant in relation to the root however there is a lack of scientific data on the salt tolerance of c chinense biquinho grown in hydroponic system the aim of this study was to determine the earliness index of yield fruit yield and threshold salinity by different mathematical models of biquinho pepper cultivated in an nft nutrient film technique hydroponic system with brackish water the salinity tolerance was evaluated by the classical threshold slope linear response function mass and hoffman 1977 by the sigmoidal shape nonlinear response function steppuhn et al 2005 and by the plateau model followed by exponential fall 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental conditions and treatments the experimental environment was an arched greenhouse set up in the east west direction with ceiling height of 4 m width of 7 m and length of 33 m located in the soil and water engineering nucleus neas at the federal university of recôncavo da bahia ufrb cruz das almas bahia brazil the experiment started at 43 days after sowing das and ended at 163 das i e 120 days after transplanting dat during the experiment august to december 2016 according to data provided by embrapa mandioca e fruticultura which has a meteorological station in the network of the national institute of meteorology inmet 2017 the minimum maximum and average values were respectively 17 20 35 70 and 23 88 c for air temperature 66 46 93 29 and 78 79 for relative humidity and 1 31 5 97 and 4 05 mm day 1 for reference evapotranspiration the studied crop was capsicum chinense jacq pepper of the varietal group biquinho which has red colored triangular shaped fruits seeds from the horticeres sementes company were sown in cubic cells made of phenolic foam 0 02 m3 previously washed in fresh running water biquinho pepper plants were subjected to seven levels of electrical conductivity of water ecw used to prepare the nutrient solution ns the water was salinized by dissolving nacl in the local supply water ecw 0 34 ds m 1 the levels of ecw used were 0 34 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 5 5 and 6 5 ds m 1 corresponding to the weighted averages during the experiment of the electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution ecsol of 2 70 3 64 4 58 5 28 6 09 6 90 and 7 77 ds m 1 respectively these seven treatments ecsol levels were randomized in six blocks longitudinally distributed in the greenhouse and occupying 42 experimental plots an nft nutrient film technique hydroponic system in pvc tubes 0 075 m diameter with five plants was used the spacing was 0 83 m between plants of the same plot and 0 70 m between plots which is within the limits proposed by andrade júnior et al 2018 for cultivation of biquinho pepper the experimental plots were arranged two by two on pvc frames spaced apart by 0 80 m and positioned at 1 00 m height from the soil this spacing resulted in an area of 0 62 m2 per plant each plot was represented by an independent hydroponic channel composed of a 55 l plastic tank of the nutrient solution and a 32 w electric pump to recirculate the solution in the cultivation channel the recirculation frequency was every 0 25 h and the duration of ns recirculation was 0 25 h a cylindrical tank 10 l containing ecw 0 34 ds m 1 was used to refill the ns reservoir in each plot for all treatments the replenishment of water consumed was performed with local supply water ecw 0 34 ds m 1 as the absorption of nutrients and toxic ions by the crop may modify the composition of the ns therefore it was necessary to periodically replace the entire ns of all plots in order to maintain the ecsol of each treatment this protective caution for treatments was adopted at 28 61 and 90 dat in the experimental phase the ns recommended by sonneveld and straver 1994 was used with modifications and the concentrations of n nh4 n no3 p k ca mg s b cu fe mn mo and zn respectively in g m 3 were 18 2 188 3 40 3 244 1 144 3 31 6 41 7 0 39 0 05 2 00 0 40 0 05 and 0 06 2 2 production of fruit ripe fruits were manually harvested at 65 72 79 86 91 96 101 106 111 and 120 dat considering as criterion the red color typical of ripe fruits the yield accumulated until 120 dat was also evaluated biquinho pepper yield was evaluated in two central plants of the experimental plots based on the number of fruits individual fresh mass per fruit yield of ripe fruits and the relative yield in comparison to the control at the last harvest 120 dat fully formed unripe fruits were also quantified 2 3 number of fruits per plant nfr fruits were harvested and at each harvest were counted to quantify the number of fruits per plant in two central plants of each plot subsequently the mean nfr of the two plants per plot was obtained and the total accumulated from 65 to 120 dat was calculated 2 4 yield of fresh mass per fruit yf the fresh mass per fruit was estimated by the ratio between yield yp and nfr in each harvest and accumulated at 120 dat according to eq 1 then the mean of the two plants per plot was calculated 1 yf yp nfr where yf is the yield of fresh mass per fruit kg per fruit and yp is the fruit yield kg per plant to investigate possible effect of plant aging on the individual mass of biquinho pepper fruits a means comparison test was carried out with two data sets i grouping of yf data obtained at 86 91 and 96 dat and ii grouping of yf data obtained at 106 111 and 120 dat 2 5 yield of fruit yp the yp per plant was estimated by weighted average of harvested fruits during the period this value was used to calculate the yield per harvest and the accumulated yield from 65 to 120 dat from the yield of biquinho pepper subjected to each ecsol level the relative yield yr was established based on the potential yield obtained in the control treatment ecsol 2 70 ds m 1 according to eq 2 2 y r yp i yp c where y r is the relative fruit yield for a given treatment i decimal yp i is the absolute fruit yield for a given treatment i kg per plant and yp c is the absolute fruit yield for control treatment kg per plant 2 6 fruit production earliness index based on the partial yields of biquinho pepper an earliness index ei was calculated for each plot and ecsol level according to eq 3 fioravanço 2015 assuming that increase in nutrient solution salinity would delay the production of this species 3 ei n yp 1 n 1 yp 2 2 yp w 1 1 yp w n yp where yp w is the biquinho pepper production at the w th partial harvest kg per plant n is the total number of partial harvests yp is the production of biquinho pepper accumulated in all partial harvests kg per plant due to the mathematical nature of this index eq 3 a maximum value is attributed to the weighting factor of the first harvest 10 which refers to the 10 partial harvests in the present study thus the higher the contribution of the first harvests to the total yield the closer to 1 0 the index will be and the more delayed the production the closer to 0 1 the index will be 2 7 tolerance to salinity the tolerance of biquinho pepper to salinity was determined using the values of relative yields accumulated from 65 to 120 dat for the total yield of fruits ripe and immature different response models were used namely a model of maas and hoffman 1977 according to eq 4 4 ye r 1 0 ecsol ecsol l 1 b ecsol ecsol l ecsol l ecsol ecsol 0 0 ecsol ecsol 0 where ye r is the estimated value of relative production for a given level of ecsol decimal ecsol is the value of the electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution ds m 1 ecsoll is the value of the threshold electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution ds m 1 from which the linear reduction of the potential relative productivity is observed ecsol0 ds m 1 is the lowest value of the electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution for which production is zero and b is the value of the linear function slope in relative yield for unit increase in the electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution decimal b model of plateau followed by exponential decay according to eq 5 5 ye r 1 ecsol ecsol l 1 y i exp k ecsol ecsol l y i ecsol 0 where ecsoll ds m 1 is the value of the

conductivity tending to infinity lower plateau expressed in the same unit of relative output and k is the constant expressed in unit inverse to the electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution ds m 1 1 c model of steppuhn et al 2005 according to eq 6 6 ye r 1 1 ecsol ecsol 50 e s ecsol 50 where ecsol50 ds m 1 is the value of the electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution corresponding to the relative production of 50 and s is the relative production slope parameter for unit increase in the electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution identified as a rough estimate of the absolute mean value dye r decsol model parameters were analyzed using the solver tool of microsoft excel aiming to minimize the sum of squared deviations the method chosen for solution with this tool was the nonlinear grg generalized reduced gradient with convergence of 0 0001 selecting the option to make all unrestricted variables non negative the confirmation of the statistical sensitivity of the fits was complemented in the programs lab fit silva et al 2004 and graphpad prism 7 subsequently the salt tolerance of biquinho pepper was classified by comparison with values indicated in the literature for other species maas and hoffman 1977 based on the threshold salinity and steppuhn et al 2005 based on the predicted salinity tolerance index sti calculated according to the ecsol50 and s eq 7 7 sti ecsol 50 s ecsol 50 where sti is the predicted salinity tolerance index ecsol50 ds m 1 is the value of the electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution related to the relative production of 50 and s relative yield slope parameter for unit increase in the electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution the previously cited models assume as independent variable the salinity of the cultivation medium which can be expressed as ec this salinity must be in equilibrium with the inputs and outputs of ions in the cultivation medium in the present study the replenishment of losses by evapotranspiration with freshwater partially ensured such equilibrium condition which was reinforced by periodically changing and renewing the entire nutrient solutions 2 8 data analysis the data were tabulated and initially processed in electronic spreadsheets which were also used to construct the graphs subsequently the data were evaluated in the statistical program sas accessed by sas university edition the significance of treatments ecsol levels was evaluated using the f test of the analysis of variance the scott knott s test at a significance level of p 0 05 was used to compare mean values of each variable studied the tukey test was used only in the evaluation of plant aging on individual fruit mass yf as previously described for variables whose relation of dependence with ecsol was better described by second degree polynomial models the points of maximum or minimum response were obtained by the first derivative of the equations the model of upper plateau y l followed by exponential decay tending to a lower plateau eq 5 but subject to the restriction of ecsol 0 and yi 0 was also tested 3 results and discussion 3 1 fruit production table 1 shows the mean values of the yield of ripe fruits harvested in 10 harvests from 65 to 120 dat for each partial harvest the increase in ecsol 4 58 ds m 1 clearly reduced the yield of biquinho pepper for two reasons reduction in the number of fruits per plant especially at the beginning of the production and reduction in the individual mass of each fruit recorded practically along the entire production cycle it is interesting to note in table 1 that for harvests at 106 and 111 dat the number of ripe fruits was reduced in the control treatment ecsol 2 70 ds m 1 and under ecsol of 3 64 ds m 1 whereas for the other treatments ecsol 4 58 5 28 6 09 6 90 and 7 70 ds m 1 the number of ripe fruits was always increasing this result corroborates the phenological change of plants under the control and ecsol of 3 64 ds m 1 treatments which had shorter phenological cycle compared to the other treatments data not shown the same indication is found in the analysis of the number of immature unripe fruits at 120 dat when these treatments of lower salinity ecsol 2 70 and 3 64 ds m 1 showed partial loss of the capacity to produce new fruits compared to the other treatments of intermediate salinity ecsol 4 58 5 28 6 09 and 6 90 ds m 1 it can be observed that individual fresh matter mass per fruit yf was variable over time because the highest values were obtained at the beginning of the production therefore it can be inferred that as each plant increased the nfr the accumulation of mass per fruit decreased this tendency of reduction in yf over time was observed in treatments ecsol 2 70 and 3 64 ds m 1 for the purpose to demonstrate the change in the yf over time in relation to age of plant an evaluation was carried out contrasting the average yf of three consecutive harvests grouped into two data sets over time i 86 91 and 96 dat and ii 106 111 and 120 dat table 2 comparing the sets it can be observed that the individual fruit mass obtained in the control treatment ecsol 2 7 ds m 1 at the end of the harvest in set ii was significantly lower 1 37 g per fruit with a loss of 0 57 g in relation to the average obtained in set i 1 94 g per fruit the treatment of ecsol 3 64 ds m 1 also reduced the individual mass with a loss of 0 35 g for ecsol 4 58 5 28 and 6 09 ds m 1 the individual mass per fruit at the end of the harvest remained statistically similar table 2 navarro et al 2010 obtained similar results in the cultivation of sweet pepper cv orlando with brackish waters in which they concluded that the reduction in total fruit production with the increase in salinity was more influenced by the lower individual weight per fruit azuma et al 2010 explain that salinity has a greater impact on the pepper fruit compared to the other aerial parts of the plant and suggest that the accumulation of sodium in a greater proportion in the fruits causes water deficit and ionic imbalance in the tissues impairing their growth it was also observed that the plants produced early from the first harvests in the treatments ecsol 2 7 control and 3 64 ds m 1 however from 96 dat the fruit yield per plant yp in other treatments became comparable to that of the control treatment table 1 when a minimum relative yield of 75 was established based on the yield of ripe fruits of the control treatment at each harvest the brackish waters only reached such level later between 91 and 96 dat for ecsol of 3 64 ds m 1 between 101 and 106 dat for ecsol of 4 58 ds m 1 and between 106 and 111 dat for ecsol of 5 28 ds m 1 the other brackish waters did not reach this minimum level of relative yield per harvest table 3 the treatment with ecsol of 6 09 ds m 1 only reached this level of relative yield in terms of immature fruits rameshwaran et al 2015 observed relative pepper yield of two varieties capsicum annuum under ideal soil moisture conditions above 75 when the plants were irrigated with salinity below 3 5 ds m 1 in the spring season and for the autumn season when irrigated with water below 6 0 ds m 1 ünlükara et al 2015 in case of green long pepper capsicum annuum l demre at 103 dat obtained fruit yield above 75 when water salinity was less than ecw 4 75 ds m 1 in pots under greenhouse conditions while alharbi et al 2014 reported that the salinity of 3 4 ds m 1 reduced the total yield of pepper capsicum annuum l taranto production by 35 compared to irrigation with water of ecw 0 9 ds m 1 in the present study biquinho pepper plants in hydroponic conditions tolerate level of salinity ecsol 5 28 ds m 1 maintaining a relative pepper production above 75 these results are possible because in hydroponic systems the plants are grown under excellent conditions of water and nutrients even in saline sodium conditions leal et al 2020 also for the mean values of relative yield per harvest it was observed that at 106 dat plants under ecsol of 3 64 ds m 1 became significantly more productive than those in the control treatment this increase was equal to 26 and at 111 dat the gain was nearly 50 nutrient solution with ecsol of 4 58 ds m 1 led to even more substantial increases of 88 and 124 at 111 and 120 dat respectively plants under ecsol 5 28 ds m 1 produced 96 more than those in the control at 120 dat for the yield in terms of immature fruits harvested at 120 dat there was a tendency of increased production in plants subjected to moderate levels of salinity therefore plants could maintain or intensify the accumulated production after 120 dat this explains why more unripe fruits were produced under ecsol of 4 58 5 28 and 6 09 ds m 1 compared to the control treatment the accumulated yield of ripe fruits and total yield of fruits ripe and unripe until 120 dat were mathematically described by a plateau followed by exponential decay model as a function of ecsol however as the relative reduction was greater than 50 in many treatments the maas and hoffman 1977 model plateau model followed by linear reduction was not compared to the plateau followed by exponential decay response model according to ayers and westcot 1999 the reduction in relative yield is no longer linear when the salinity effect results in yields well below 50 the maas and hoffman 1977 model for estimating the crop threshold salinity was not adopted in the study of time accumulated harvests in such cases the plateau followed by exponential decay model was used to explain the results fig 1a and b the effect of ecsol on the accumulated total yield of fruits also considering the unripe ones was described by plateau followed by exponential decay model from the threshold ecsol of 5 21 ds m 1 fig 1b the yield of biquinho pepper was estimated at 2 87 kg per plant fig 1b considering the spacing adopted area of 0 6225 m2 per plant this is equivalent to 46 1 mg ha 1 at 120 dat in only 55 days of harvest lópez lópez et al 2015 observed yield of 27 44 mg ha 1 for habanero c chinense in mexico under drip irrigation in the open field and in a clayey soil these authors report that the potential of habanero can be up to 31 mg ha 1 in the semiarid region of venezuela jaimez et al 2000 studied a genotype of c chinense sweet pepper subjected to different irrigation frequencies 3 6 and 9 days and reported that the water deficit caused by the increase in irrigation interval led to a reduction in flowering and a delay in the occurrence of maximum flowering which caused a decrease in pepper yield the highest yields reached over three years were around 22 5 mg ha 1 the yield of biquinho pepper in the present study is comparable to that indicated by barroca et al 2015 who studied c chinense de cheiro variety of low pungency in the municipality of são mateus es brazil under field condition with plant spacing of 1 1 0 62 m and irrigated with drippers that applied different irrigation depths based on reference evapotranspiration the maximum yield reached was 43 6 mg ha 1 accumulated until 173 dat in 91 days of harvest for biquinho pepper variety iav 1643 grown in soil under plastic mulch and drip irrigation the average production was approximately 0 53 kg per plant in terms of fresh mass of fruits domenico et al 2012 considering the spacing adopted by the author 0 5 0 85 m its yield would be estimated at 12 471 mg ha 1 accumulated in five months in different autogamous progenies of salmon colored biquinho pepper yields of up to 1 73 kg per plant were obtained heinrich et al 2015 the yield obtained in the present experiment is higher compared to the values of these studies although it should be considered that there were differences between the cultivation techniques as well as between the varieties used 3 2 fruit production earliness index the earliness index for biquinho pepper yield was reduced by the increase of ecsol fig 2 considering all treatments earliness indices always lower than 0 5 represented a production that was more intense in the second half of the harvesting period including for the control treatment ecsol 2 70 ds m 1 however as the salinity increased above the threshold ecsol estimated at 3 14 ds m 1 for this variable the earliness indices decreased with a sharper slope between the ecsol levels of 3 14 and 4 58 ds m 1 the fitted model was plateau followed by exponential decay this result demonstrates the effect of salinity on the delay in biquinho pepper yield differing from other studies which have shown that salinity can stimulate earliness index in some species according to romdhane et al 2016 in the maize crop the period from sowing to ear formation and to physiological maturity is shortened under salt and drought stresses rameeh and gerami 2015 observed that salinity decreased the yield of brassica napus l seeds but that flowering and seed maturity occurred earlier in their review shannon and grieve 1998 reported that salt stress makes onion plants bloom earlier but slows down the flowering of tomato the last mentioned authors while citing a study with early potato cultivars argue that there is evidence that part of the tolerance to salinity can be attributed to earlier maturity a type of escape from salinity in the case of biquinho pepper investigated within a single genotype in the present study the loss of yield due to increased ecsol was considered a salinity sensitive indicator due to the lower smaller earliness index and the low initial yield of biquinho pepper under the increasing levels of ecsol this crop was expected to be very sensitive to salinity for commercial purposes however despite the delay in the yield caused by the increase of ecsol the crop gradually exhibited a recovery of production under saline conditions in this context a hypothetical benefit of the earliness of yield in the less saline treatments including the control treatment would be receiving the gross revenue earlier therefore there could be two impacts one more obvious would be a faster economic return and the other would be more related to cash flow in financial transactions of applying these revenues in addition it should be considered that earlier harvests are a guarantee of earlier income in hydroponic systems which in brazil are still vulnerable to electricity failures as is the case with nft poor technical training of the producer serious phytosanitary and nutritional management problems among others this consideration can be validated in an abrupt interruption of production if such interruption occurred in the middle of the production cycle that is soon after the fifth harvest at 91 dat based on data from table 1 relating the yield obtained until 91 dat and the total yield ripe immature at 120 dat there would be a guarantee of 23 and 16 5 for the control and ecsol 3 64 ds m 1 treatments while the other treatments would have production below 5 3 3 tolerance to salinity in the present study the nutrient solution electrical conductivity only due to the fertilizer was approximately 2 4 ds m 1 when prepared with ecw 0 34 ds m 1 sonneveld 2004 discuss the need for considering the minimum salinity resulting from fertilizers while studying the adaptation of the maas and hoffman 1977 model for soilless cultivation because of these considerations the importance of adopting the time weighted ecsol and not the ecw as an independent variable is reiterated from the visual analysis of the relative yields described by the graphs of the tested models fig 3 it can be inferred that the model of maas and hoffman 1977 led to zero production more abruptly thus for the present experiment the nonlinear models explained better the reduction of relative yield when it tended to zero due to increase in salinity of nutrient solution the maas and hoffman 1977 model was fitted for a threshold salinity of 4 60 ds m 1 and relative reduction b of 33 4 per unit increase in the ecsol fig 3a under conventional cultivation in soil rameshwaran et al 2016 observed a salinity threshold of 1 43 ds m 1 and a reduction of 11 1 per unit increase in ecse in two varieties of c annuum the threshold salinity found by ünlükara et al 2015 for c annuum in a greenhouse was ecse 1 2 ds m 1 and slope decrease of 7 03 for each unit addition of salinity in the soil after the threshold value rameshwaran et al 2016 comparing their results with different studies attributed the differences observed in the parameters of the linear response function of the slope due to the pepper variety growing environmental conditions method and amount of irrigation and application of fertilizers however divergences between these studies and the present one may be related to moisture regimes that varies in conventional irrigation systems reduction of osmotic and matric potentials of soil between irrigation intervals dias et al 2019 and the nft hydroponic cultivation where the plants grow without such restrictions according to relative salt tolerance of crops proposed by maas 1984 pepper is considered as moderately sensitive threshold saturation extract salinity between 3 0 and 6 0 ds m 1 but highlighting the difficulty of comparing the hydroponic and conventional system the problem of this comparison lies in the fact that the above mentioned classification is proposed for conventional cultivation in soil and based on the electrical conductivity measured in the soil saturation extract ecse and not on the actual moisture during cultivation therefore there is a great technical difficulty in comparing or extrapolating values of salt tolerance between the hydroponic and traditional systems in soil to perform this analysis it is necessary to install cultivation conditions similar to those used by leal et al 2020 in the traditional cultivation in soil due to depletion of soil moisture there is increase in electrical conductivity of soil solution with consequent decrease in osmotic and matric potential between two irrigations or rain events in contrast in hydroponic cultivation the oscillation of salt concentration is much smaller thus plants grown in soil undergo significant fluctuations in the rhizosphere ec which is unparalleled by the value of the ecse while in hydroponics cultivation the plant is grown under saturation in the soil this is not possible despite the concept of ecse refer to this condition the concept of ecse also fails to include effects such as temperature which alters ionic activity and therefore ec in the rhizosphere ecse is the standard measure of salinity shahid et al 2018 a good parameter for soil classification purposes but it should be used with caution in the analysis of salt tolerance to crop on the other hand considering the popularity of this parameter and assuming that the ecsol in hydroponics is approximately equal to the ecse of the soil in terms of medium saturation and that the soil moisture at the point of the saturation is approximately 1 5 fold higher than the moisture at the field capacity of local ultisol the threshold salinity found in the present study ecsol 5 22 ds m 1 plateau followed by exponential decay would correspond to a soil ecse equal to approximately 7 83 ds m 1 this finding is valid for high frequency irrigated cultivation with soil moisture always tending to field capacity this exercise is important to reveal the importance of studies conducted in hydroponics and the potential of this technique for new opportunities for the rational use of brackish waters in hydroponic cultivation the plant is grown in nutrient solution without soil but in the soil the irrigated crop is usually cultivated with moisture varying between field capacity and critical moisture therefore the actual ec tolerated in the soil rhizosphere should be higher than the ecse because of the effect of concentration of solutes thus comparison by extrapolation is not correct another interesting aspect observed from the model is the high value of relative reduction in yield 33 4 per unit increase in the ecsol beyond 4 60 ds m 1 in the tables based on the study of maas and hoffman 1977 as found in ayers and westcot 1999 values with this magnitude are rare the use of the plateau followed by exponential decay model fig 3b established a threshold salinity of 5 22 ds m 1 hence higher than the estimated threshold of the model of maas and hoffman 1977 the advantage of the fit of this exponential model was only 5 5 approximately in terms of increase in the coefficient of determination similar results were found in plants of abelmoschus esculentus cultivated in hydroponic system which had threshold salinity of 5 43 ds m 1 using the plateau model modesto et al 2019 the model of steppuhn et al 2005 does not assume a threshold salinity but delimits a plateau of potential response yr 100 it employs the concept of ecsol50 which is the electrical conductivity of the growth medium corresponding to a 50 reduction in the yield obtained in the non saline condition in the present study this ecsol50 was estimated at approximately 5 90 ds m 1 fig 3c in the model of maas and hoffman 1977 the value of ecsol corresponding to a relative yield of 50 would be approximately 6 10 ds m 1 for the plateau followed by exponential decay model it would be approximately 5 62 ds m 1 therefore for this specific yr the model of steppuhn et al 2005 seems to be more central and convergent rameshwaran et al 2016 using the model of maas and hoffman 1977 and steppuhn et al 2005 for a relative yield reported ec50 of 5 92 and 5 60 ds m 1 respectively for two c annuum var onur f1 and ada f1 irrigated with water of electrical conductivity in the range between 1 0 and 6 0 ds m 1 according to these authors both mathematical models adjusted reasonably well to the data with single representation and good correlation classifying the peppers as moderately sensitive to salinity in both model another important aspect is that the steepness parameter s of the steppuhn et al 2005 model was 0 502 ds m 1 1 comparing it with the tabulated values presented by the authors for different crops the s value adjusted for biquinho pepper is among the highest ones nonetheless it is indeed consistent with the abrupt reduction in the relative yield after the segment of relative yields close to the potential fig 3c therefore it is consistent with the high value of the coefficient b of the maas and hoffman 1977 model based on the model of steppuhn et al 2005 the salinity tolerance index of biquinho pepper was 8 86 in their study steppuhn et al 2005 found an index of 5 77 for bell pepper grown in soil produced with ecsol50 of 4 76 ds m 1 and an s steepness of 0 213 ds m 1 1 while rameshwaran et al 2016 for two c annuum varieties in conventional cultivation system and under mediterranean climate observed s value of 0 16 with a salinity tolerance index of 6 5 the high value of the tolerance index in the present study can be attributed to the pepper variety and cultivation environment hydroponics bell pepper is more closely related to biquinho pepper but the direct comparison of their values of ecsol50 and salinity tolerance index becomes inappropriate due to the differences in the production systems when compared to the steppuhn et al 2005 study on the other hand considering only the s parameter it can be inferred that the relative reduction in the yield of biquinho pepper was higher in terms of value per unit increase in the ecsol the parameters b and s represent the slope of the reduction in crop yield as a function of salinity but unlike the b parameter of the mass and hoffman 1977 model the s parameter of steppuhn et al 2005 is dependent on the magnitude of salinity a fact that reinforces the difficulty of directly comparing data of soil bell pepper and nft hydroponics biquinho pepper if on the one hand the categorical comparison of indicators seems unviable as discussed previously the values of the parameter of steppuhn et al 2005 and of the parameters obtained in the present study for biquinho pepper will be useful for the exploitation of the crop under hydroponic conditions moreover despite its greater use the model of maas and hoffman 1977 has more limitations than that of steppuhn et al 2005 which seems to have become more and more recognized by the researchers thapa et al 2017 butcher et al 2018 the plateau followed by exponential decay model despite not having parameters of biophysical significance as simple as that of parameters of the model of steppuhn et al 2005 has the advantage of maintaining a threshold indicator of potential salinity like the model presented by maas and hoffman 1977 but without the inconvenience of losing fit when the relative yield decreases to less than 50 4 conclusions the yield of biquinho pepper grown in nft nutrient film technique hydroponic system without restriction of salinity was 2 87 kg per plant with estimated yield of 46 1 mg ha 1 considering the adopted area per plant of 0 6225 m2 from the salinity threshold the reduction in production is marked for nutrient solution electrical conductivity of up to 5 22 ds m 1 there is a potential relative yield of hydroponic biquinho pepper based on a plateau followed by exponential decay model salinity reduces the earliness index of yield of biquinho pepper declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10294,an algorithm was proposed to classify wheat fields into high productive and low productive classes using satellite images according to a threshold value for rain fed wheat et a in the anthesis stage since the classification process was based on the et a values in the rain fed wheat pixels an algorithm was proposed to map wheat fields using the combination of modis and landsat 8 images the wheat area mapping method included two major processes in which the first one used a step by step elimination process of non wheat pixels which did not follow the standard wheat vegetation index time series the second one used supervised classification methods for detecting the rain fed wheat pixels the assessment of the wheat area map was performed statistically using surveyed wheat plots after detecting the wheat parcels the threshold value was determined using a frequency analysis on actual evapotranspiration values in the parcels the rain fed wheat et a values estimated from the sebal algorithm and were compared to the results from the eagleman affholder method and mod16a2 products to assess if the wheat fields in productivity classes have been categorized correctly yield values in the two classes were compared with each other the rain fed wheat yield was estimated using the light use efficiency model and compared to provincial census data for accuracy assessment results showed that the overall accuracy kappa coefficient and f1 score values for the 250 m resolution map from the modis images were 82 0 61 and 0 71 respectively in the same order these statistics for the 30 m resolution map from the landsat 8 images were 92 0 62 and 0 77 respectively both the sebal and the eagleman affholder methods closely estimated the average wheat et a value in the anthesis stage equal to 2 4 mm day the mean of the rain fed wheat yield value from the lue model in 2015 was 10 lower than the census data relying on the low amount of the absolute error between the lue model and the census data the mean of the yield values in both high productive and low productive classes were compared with together results showed that the mean amount of yield in high productive class was 33 271 kg ha more than that of in low productive class keywords evapotranspiration productivity rain fed wheat remote sensing sebal 1 introduction rain fed agriculture accounts for more than 75 of the cropped areas in the world reddy and syme 2014 studies on the rain fed wheat agricultural potential are important due to the increasing concern about future food security some of these studies have been focused on locally gathered weather soil agronomic and water resource data to investigate the rainfed wheat productivity and to seek ways to close the gap between actual and potential yields edreira et al 2018 anderson 2010 merlos et al 2015 rao et al 2015 local studies have helped to expand the scope of knowledge in rain fed agriculture but these methods usually are limited in terms of providing spatiotemporal data in terms of detecting the crop areas estimating the crop evapotranspiration and estimating crop yield remote sensing is an alternative to on field measurements and on field data collection operations mhawej et al 2020 mosleh et al 2015 zwart et al 2010 in order to map the crop fields using remote sensing different methods based on optical chen et al 2012 guan et al 2016 pan et al 2012 son et al 2014 microwave song and wang 2019 sonobe et al 2014 tan et al 2007 and the combination of both optical and microwave forkuor et al 2014 inglada et al 2016 nasirzadehdizaji et al 2019 villa et al 2015a 2015b images have been developed application of the optic remote sensing in crop area mapping is usually based on the production of the time series for vegetation indexes such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi leaf area index lai and enhanced vegetation index evi mosleh et al 2015 unlike the optical remote sensing that monitors the ability of surfaces to reflect the light and heat spectrum the content of information from the microwave sensors indicates the ability of surfaces in scattering the long wavelength electromagnetic waves nasirzadehdizaji et al 2019 therefore the use of synthetic aperture radar sar images in crop area mapping is based on the characteristics of the crop fields in terms of the coefficient of scattering in different polarizations using machine learning algorithms onojeghuo et al 2018 in terms of using optic images for cloudy days the impact of clouds on the images needs to be reduced or eliminated zhang et al 2010 a cloudy sky which is common in humid climates cause sudden drops in the vegetation index time series for which different de noising filters such as s g algorithm filtering logistic algorithm filtering and gaussian algorithm filtering have been developed guan et al 2016 some of the existing crop area mapping methods that have been applied to optical images have multi stage procedures such as empirical mode decomposition edm process chen et al 2012 or dynamic time warping dtw process guan et al 2016 in case a heterogeneous modis pixel contains more than one class the signal received by the sensor from that pixel in each spectrum will contain the combined effect of those classes ozdogan 2010 the independent component analysis ica algorithm comon 1994 on modis images has been used to visualize the effect of each of these classes on the value of each modis pixel in each spectrum in terms of wheat area mapping methods using optical images support vector machine svm has applied to classify the wheat areas on special dates when the wheat has different values in the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi time series that can be distinguished from the other crops jin et al 2016 nasrallah et al 2018 proposed a tree like approach relying on the ndvi values of a four month period that coincides with several phenological stages of wheat a regression model fitted on the wheat ndvi values in winter was also able to detect the wheat pixels using the fact that the wheat fields are green in winter while on other fields there is no vegetation cover only bare soil tao et al 2017 taking advantage of the wheat phenological features in the mapping process is not only accomplished by applying statistical methods but also by introducing phenological indexes pan et al 2012 introduced a crop phenology index dividing the fluctuations of the enhanced vegetation index evi time series of wheat into four main stages the first stage was related to the establishment and the last one was related to harvest periods while the two middle stages were related to the first and second peaks in the wheat evi curve when the fluctuation of the wheat evi time series were significantly different from other crops after identifying the four stages the phenological index was defined as a function of specific evi values these values were the evi values at the peak points the difference evi values in peaks with values in the first and final stages and the length of the first stage to the fourth stage results showed that the difference between the wheat areas obtained using the phenological index from the modis images and the wheat areas from the landsat and alos satellite images was only 15 20 in order to estimate the crop actual evapotranspiration et a using remote sensing different algorithms have been developed to solve the surface energy balance seb equation allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 kongo et al 2011 roerink et al 2000 wang et al 2014 in a single source seb model no distinction is made between vegetation and soil and hence uses a bulk h formulation unlike a two source model in which the components of h are partitioned between the soil and vegetation xia et al 2016 among the seb models the simplified surface energy balance index s sebi roerink et al 2000 has shown better results for humid climates while for dry and semi arid climates the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and the method of mapping et at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 javadian et al 2019 kilic et al 2016 are more accurate bhattarai et al 2016 sebal has also been applied for et estimations under various agro climatic conditions in several countries and has been validated with existing eddy covariance ec flux tower data bastiaanssen et al 1998 2002 2005 bastiaanssen and bos 1999 hemakumara et al 2003 kamali and nazari 2018 rahimzadegan and janani 2019 recent improvements on sebal are based on automating the processes of hot cold pixel selection and the model calibration the calibration process starts by calculating the sensible heat and the evaporation rate over water bodies since pan coefficient k changes with varying wind speed and relative humidity conditions an additional coefficient c needs to be calibrated comparing the calculated sensible heat and evaporation rates to the generated values from the improved version of the sebal sebali the highest sensible heat and the lowest evaporation rates are selected to adjust the et a values mhawej et al 2020 the sebali algorithm has recently been applied on sentinel 2 images allam et al 2021 and migrated to google earth engine gee platform for a more global crop water consumption assessment mhawej and faour 2020 measured data using eddy covariance ec equipment bowen ratio equipment scintillometer and lysimeter are used for evaluation of models that estimate et a using the surface energy balance models bhattarai et al 2016 bastiaanssen 2000 bastiaanssen et al 2005 maltese et al 2018a 2018b while in the case of the absence of those equipment the remotely sensed et a values may be compared to the et a values obtained from the other methods such as soil water atmosphere plant swap model bastiaanssen et al 2002 water balance equation hamid et al 2011 jassas et al 2015 and fao penman monteith equation costa et al 2019 fao penman monteith allen et al 1998 is a reference method to estimate the crop et c for any station with existing climatic input data and is the base for eagleman affholder method affholder 1997 eagleman 1971 which is specifically developed for calculating the rain fed wheat et a in order to monitor wheat yield using remote sensing the monteith theory monteith 1972 in a light use efficiency lue model has been used zwart et al 2010 while in other studies some regression models have been developed to estimate crop yield values from the vegetation index values behrens et al 2006 ren et al 2008 sharma et al 1993 shen et al 2009 by comparing the yield and productivity values in different pixels it is possible to investigate the scope of improvement among the wheat fields zwart et al 2010 the scope of improvement in crop growth potential is different from evaluating the lands for agricultural purposes where the parameters such as soil texture organic matter content soil depth slope and land use land cover are assessed using the geographical information system bandyopadhyay et al 2009 determination of the scope of improvement after harvest can provides useful information about agricultural fields but it is not a process for gaining information about the probability of yield reduction before the end of the growing season the desired aim of the present study is to classify the rain fed wheat fields into high productive and low productive classes prior to the end of growth season using the et a values in the anthesis stage of wheat it was expected that using the classified map it can be possible to distinguish the rain fed wheat fields with higher amount of final yield from those with lower amount of final yield in before harvest this classification was done by the et a threshold value obtained from the frequency analysis of the et a values in wheat pixels during the wheat anthesis stage the rain fed wheat et a values in during the wheat anthesis stage were estimated by applying the sebal algorithm on the modis images to assess the reliability of the estimated et a values they were compared to the results from eagleman affholder method and mod16a2 products the amount of yield in high and low productive classes were estimated using the lue model and were compared to provincial census data for accuracy assessment it was tested to determine if the yield values in the high productive classes are higher than in low productive classes since the classification process required the amounts of et a values in the rain fed wheat pixels we proposed an algorithm to map wheat fields using the combination of modis and landsat 8 images the wheat area mapping method included two major processes that could produce the rain fed wheat area maps in 250 m and 30 m resolutions the first major process used a step by step elimination method of non wheat pixels which did not follow the standard wheat vegetation index time series during the growing season this process used modis optical images to produce a standard wheat ndvi time series and was suitable for arid and semi arid climates with a low probability of long term cloudy weather the output map from the first major process was assessed statistically using surveyed wheat plots by taking the output map from the first process as the supervised samples in the second one we mapped the wheat fields on the landsat 8 images in the second major process we used the supervised classification methods including artificial neural network ann maximum likelihood ml and support vector machine svm on a landsat 8 image to map the rain fed wheat fields the final version of the map was produced by checking the trend of ndvi values in three different stages for each of the detected wheat pixels 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is shown in fig 1 it is called ahar county located in the north west of iran the rgb image composite of the study area obtained from the infrared red and blue bands of landsat 8 satellite shows that the area is enclosed by mountainous terrains while the agricultural fields are mainly located in the central areas the dominant climate of the study area is arid and semi arid according to the results from the latest agricultural censuses conducted in the study area by the iranian ministry of agriculture wheat is the dominant agricultural crop in the area the total rain fed wheat area was equal to 31 431 ha zoghi 2015 and 30 003 ha provincial government of east azarbaijan 2010 in 2015 and 2010 respectively 2 2 wheat cultivation calendar in the study area according to fig 2 which is inferred from research in china huang et al 2015 winter wheat has different growth stages fig 2 also indicates the schematic of the remotely sensed vegetation index curve during the wheat growth period following the same stages in the pre mentioned research wheat completes its growth from its establishment around the 280th day of each year to harvest around the 165th day of the next year in ahar county the wheat jointing stage in the study area starts in late winter or early spring around the 80th day of the year after which a significant increase in the vegetation index curve happens the increase brings the curve to its peak point at a time around the 120th day of the year between the booting and heading stages the curve experiences a slight decrease after the pack point until the end of the anthesis stage around the 137th day of the year as a highly effective stage on wheat productivity huang et al 2015 after the anthesis stage wheat changes its color from green to yellow coinciding with a higher rate of decrease in the curve in the maturity stage wheat has a golden color and is ready to be harvested after which the curve indicates the value for bare soil in this study the wheat ndvi curve was monitored from the jointing stage until the time that the bare soil appears after harvest to map the wheat fields we set the start time on the wheat jointing stage since it was difficult to monitor the ndvi curve using optical remote sensing in the cloudy conditions in autumn and winter t1 2 3 evaluation of the rain fed wheat fields in this study we proposed an algorithm to classify the wheat fields into high productive and low productive classes before harvest using optical remote sensing the fundamental criterion for the classification was whether the wheat actual evapotranspiration et a could pass the threshold value for et a in the anthesis stage the sensitivity of the final yield to the amount of vegetation index huang et al 2015 and water stress singh and malik 1983 in the wheat anthesis stage was the reason for choosing this stage for further analysis in the study fig 3 shows the process through which the estimated et a values by the sebal algorithm for the mapped wheat fields were analyzed to achieve a threshold value for et a the process started with an algorithm proposed for the wheat area mapping using modis images the sebal algorithm was used to estimate the wheat et a values in the mapped fields during the anthesis stage and then the et a threshold value was determined from the frequency analysis of the values the wheat area map obtained using the modis images was improved by landsat 8 images from 250 m resolution to 30 m resolution after which the sebal model was applied once again to obtain a high resolution wheat et a map in the anthesis stage the high resolution wheat et a map was classified into high productive and low productive classes using the determined threshold value to assess the accuracy of the process based on the available methods and measured data in the study area different assessment steps were embedded in the flowchart to increase the reliability of the results the wheat area mapping algorithm using modis and its improved version using landsat images were assessed statistically using supervised wheat fields accuracy of the et a values obtained by sebal from the modis images were evaluated by the eagleman affholder method eagleman 1971 affholder 1997 mousavi baygi et al 2016 based on the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 frere and popov 1979 although eddy covariance ec equipment is the best known and widely accepted methodology for validating surface energy balance models maltese et al 2018a 2018b due to lack of such equipment in the study area the results from the method were used to assess the remotely sensed wheat et a values assessment of the remotely sensed et a values has also been previously done in other research using the fao penman monteith equation or water balance equation bashir et al 2008 costa et al 2019 jaafar and ahmad 2020 jassas et al 2015 in addition to the eagleman affholder methods the wheat et a values obtained by the sebal algorithm were also compared with the values from the mod16a2 product the mod16a2 product is an 8 day composite modis evapotranspiration product of a 500 m pixel resolution modis terra net evapotranspiration 8 day l4 global 500 m sin grid v006 the algorithm used for the mod16a2 is based on the logic of the penman monteith equation which includes inputs of daily meteorological reanalysis data along with modis remotely sensed data running et al 2017 reliability of the remotely sensed threshold value for et a was tested by wheat et a values recorded in iranian national water document inwd finally to investigate whether the high productive and low productive classes had been differentiated properly enough to provide useful information about yield before harvest the remotely sensed wheat yield values were analyzed after evaluating them with provincial agricultural census yield data 2 4 wheat area mapping algorithm due to the applicability of the crop area mapping methods based on the characteristics of the ndvi time series obtained from each crop we proposed an algorithm in this category that takes advantage of the spatiotemporal resolution of optical images in a novel combination process as it is shown in fig 4 the algorithm has two major processes that in the first one the wheat pixels with the 250 m resolution are detected from the modis images based on the wheat standard ndvi time series the wheat standard ndvi time series was obtained by averaging the ndvi values in the supervised wheat areas that was surveyed using a handy gps device in 2010 in 11 plots with an average area of 20 ha the wheat standard ndvi time series as shown in appendix 1 fig a1 was obtained by averaging the ndvi values in the supervised wheat areas surveyed by a gps device in the study in 11 plots with an average area of 20 ha in 2012 as it is shown in appendix 1 fig a1 the first major process applied with a step by step elimination manner in which the pixels that did not confirm the wheat standard ndvi time series were eliminated from the wheat area map the confirmation criterion was defined with a value that we called it c value to create the two upper and lower bands appendix 1 fig a1 on the wheat standard ndvi time series as follow 1 ndvi ul doy ndvi doy c ndvi doy 100 2 ndvi ll doy ndvi doy c ndvi doy 100 where ndvi ul doy and ndvi ll doy are the values for upper and lower bands on each doy ndvi doy is the average ndvi value of the wheat pixels on each doy and c is the percentage of allowable variation of the ndvi for the wheat pixels on each doy if the ndvi time series of a pixel was found between the two bands the relevant location is accepted as a wheat field otherwise the pixel is eliminated through the algorithm described in fig 4 in the first major process the ndvi images obtained by modis from the 81st day of year doy until the 265th doy in 8 days intervals are taken as input data during a step by step manner at first after choosing an arbitrary c value to calculate ndvi upper and lower limits for each doy pixels from the ndvi image on 81st doy are eliminated if their ndvi values are not between ndvi ul 81 and ndvi ll 81 values in the second step for the 89th doy which is the next 8 days interval pixels from the ndvi image on 89th doy are eliminated if their ndvi values are not between ndvi ul 89 and ndvi ll 89 values in this step those pixels which had been deleted from the ndvi image on 81st doy in the previous step must be eliminated from the ndvi image on 89th doy as well the elimination steps are continued for the next intervals until the 256th doy after which the accuracy assessment is done on the final map the final wheat area map is accepted if the statistics are in a reliable range otherwise it is required to change the c value and to repeat the steps until the statistics satisfy the acceptable range the statistics used for the accuracy assessment in this study were the overall accuracy the kappa coefficient and the f1 score among which the f1 score is more meaningful zhou et al 2017 these statistics were calculated based on the number of correctly and incorrectly classified pixels in both wheat and non wheat classes congalton 1991 the assessment samples were taken from the rain fed wheat fields using gps device fig a1 and from non wheat areas combination of different land uses including water body mountainous terrains gardens urban area bare lands and etc using google earth the highest spatial resolution that can be achieved by the first major process was 250 m resolution according to the spatial resolution of the modis surface reflectance product mod09q1 modis terra surface reflectance 8 day l3 global 250 m sin grid v006 the output map from the first major process is used in determining the et a threshold value which will be explained in section 2 5 since a map with higher resolution is more informative for evaluating the second major process was designed to utilize the advantage of the high spatial resolution landsat 8 images the first major process is not applicable to landsat 8 images since they are unable to produce the wheat ndvi time series including all the required details increasing and decreasing arms and the peak point due to their low temporal resolution instead of producing the wheat ndvi time series in the second major process the wheat areas are mapped on a landsat 8 image using three supervised classification methods artificial neural network ann maximum likelihood ml and support vector machine svm all the landsat 8 bands in a non cloudy day except band 8 are used in the classification process in the coupled algorithm the output of the first major process is inserted as the input to the second major process to train the classification methods instead of training them by the surveyed gps points see appendix 2 to increase the performance of the training process pastures were removed from the modis wheat pixels using the google earth platform combining the three maps obtained using supervised classification methods all the pixels that can be assumed to be wheat pixels are collected since in the combined map includes those error pixels that are mistakenly detected as the wheat pixels the ndvi values for each pixel in the combined map must be checked to detect and remove errors by checking the ndvi values in three consecutive dates for each pixel those pixels that did not obey the wheat ndvi trend are deleted from the combined map we chose a clear landsat 8 image on 165th doy in 2015 to start the sound major process after producing the combined map we checked ndvi values on 133th doy 145th doy and 165th doy in terms of the days that were in the decreasing arm of the wheat ndvi time series we checked if a decreasing trend in ndvi values from the 133th doy until 165st doy existed in each of the classified pixels in the second major process the overall accuracy the kappa coefficient and the f1 score were used to assess the accuracy of the final wheat area map knowing that the land use has not changed in these areas in 2010 and 2015 statistics in this step were calculated using the wheat and non wheat samples 2 5 the threshold value for the wheat et a the threshold value by which the wheat fields were classified into high productive and low productive classes was obtained by frequency analyses of the et a values the wheat et a values were calculated using the sebal algorithm for the wheat parcels detected on the modis images during the wheat anthesis stage on 137th doy mod09a1 modis terra surface reflectance 8 day l3 global 500 m sin grid v006 mod09q1 modis terra surface reflectance 8 day l3 global 250 m sin grid v006 and mod11a2 modis terra land surface temperature emissivity 8 day l3 global 1 km sin grid v006 products were used to run different steps of the sebal model after calculating the et a values the frequency analysis of et a and ndvi values was done to obtain the threshold value during the frequency analysis different range of et a values were sliced to find the range that contains most of the et a values the lower limit of the wheat et a range with the highest frequency in the wheat anthesis stage was taken as the threshold value the calculated threshold value by remote sensing was checked by the reported wheat et a values in the study area in the iranian national water documents inwd alizadeh and kamali 2007 to assess if the sebal algorithm had been applied accurately on the modis images we compared the remotely sensed wheat et a values to the values obtained by the eagleman affholder method during the time from the wheat jointing stage until the wheat harvest time the process during which we applied the eagleman affholder method to calculate the wheat et a values has been described in appendix 3 2 6 classification of fields using the threshold value based on the threshold value if the rate of et a in a wheat pixel in the anthesis stage is less than the threshold value that pixel is classified as being in the low productive class otherwise it is assigned to the high productive class we applied the sebal algorithm for the wheat pixels on a clear landsat image on 133th doy of 2015 that is almost around the wheat anthesis stage to obtain the wheat et a map with 30 m resolution using the threshold value the classified map was produced for 2015 before which the lowest limit of the wheat et a range with the highest frequency was determined for wheat et a values in 2015 to check if the threshold value needed to be modified for assessing the yield values in both classes it was required to monitor the amounts of the wheat yield values in the wheat pixels the spatial distribution of the wheat dry material values in three clear landsat images during the wheat growth period on 133th doy on 149th doy and on 165th doy were obtained using the light use efficiency model which is described in appendix 4 the wheat final yield values in each of the wheat pixels were estimated using the summation of the daily dry material values the wheat final yields were compared to the provincial agricultural census data to evaluate the reliability of the remotely sensed yield values having the wheat final yield map it was investigated to see if the yield values in the high productive class were considerably higher than the low productive class in 2015 achieving the expected result from comparing the two classes it can be proved that the et a values before harvest can be used to distinguish the two classes 3 results 3 1 the wheat area map fig 5 shows output maps from the two major processes of the mapping flowchart initially by implementing the first major process 32 177 ha of the rain fed wheat fields were detected on a 250 m resolution map using the modis images in 2010 this map showed 2174 ha of incompatibility 7 24 compared to the total area reported in the agricultural censuses data in 2010 provincial government of east azarbaijan 2010 the 250 m resolution map was produced by taking the c value equal to 15 for the wheat ndvi peak period and equal to 10 for the days after harvest the output maps from the supervised classification ann ml and svm methods and the map obtained from the combination of the methods are also shown in fig 5 which are the raw products of the second major process these raw products were produced by importing the cleaned version of the 250 resolution map after removing the pastures using the google earth platform and indicate the rain fed wheat pixels on 256th doy in 2015 the ndvi values from the landsat 8 bands for the mentioned pixels are shown in fig 5 on 133th doy 145th doy and 256th doy in 2015 the final product of the second major which is a 30 m resolution map for the rain fed wheat fields is shown in fig 5 the total area detected for the rain fed wheat fields in the study area in 2015 were 37 745 ha in the 30 m resolution map which was a product of checking the ndvi values on the combined raw map the total rain fed wheat area in the 30 m resolution map showed 6314 ha of incompatibility 20 09 in comparison with the total area reported in agricultural censuses data for 2015 zoghi 2015 despite that the 250 m resolution map showed lower difference with census data comparing to the 30 m resolution map pixels in the 250 m resolution map contained pastures due to their coarseness the first major process was unable to remove the pastures from the heterogeneous pixels while the total area of the detected pixels may be deceptive at first glance reliability in the 30 m resolution map with fine and homogeneous pixels increases knowing the fact that the rain fed wheat fields in the study area are usually smaller than covering a full modis pixel especially in the northern part acceptable values were obtained for the assessment statistics as shown in table 1 in which the overall accuracy kappa coefficient and f1 score values for the 30 m resolution map from the landsat 8 images were 92 0 62 and 0 77 respectively in the same order the values for the aforementioned statistics were 82 0 61 and 0 71 for the 250 m resolution map obtained from the modis images as shown in the final map most of the rain fed wheat fields were in the central part of the study area in a higher integrity while in the northern and marginal areas the farmlands were distributed in low integrity since the marginal and northern parts in the study area have mountainous and forest land use the integrity of the rain fed wheat fields in the central parts as detected by the proposed method would seem to be rational according to the latest provincial agricultural censuses data the difference in the total rain fed wheat area in ahar county was less than 4 7 comparing the two 2010 and 2015 years provincial government of east azarbaijan 2010 zoghi 2015 such a negligible change is due to the impossibility of an easy conversion from rain fed agriculture to irrigated one in the study area the development of irrigated farmlands requires huge investments in water conveying systems through which farmers can be able to change the crop pattern on their farmlands hence the combination of the two mentioned years based on the census data to produce a reliable map that presents rain fed wheat pixels in the study area was logical authors recommend the use of the same year data for both two majors in areas with significant yearly changes in crop patterns 3 2 assessment of estimated et a values fig 6 compares the time series of the rain fed wheat et a mm day obtained by eagleman affholder method the sebal algorithm and mod16a2 product in 2010 and the linear fits between the aforementioned methods the comparison helped to evaluate the rain fed wheat et a values obtained by applying the sebal algorithm on the modis images the et a time series obtained from the sebal algorithm and the eagleman affholder method shows that the highest amount of the wheat et a value occurs in the anthesis stage on 137th doy while the et a time series obtained from the mod16a2 product indicates that it occurs in the peak period of the ndvi curve between 113th doy and 121th doy the r square values between the sebal algorithm and the eagleman affholder method was almost equal with 0 6 the r square values between the mod16a2 product and the eagleman affholder method and between the mod16a2 product and the sebal algorithm were lower than 0 3 since the previous research has confirmed that the wheat crop reaches its potential evapotranspiration having the highest crop coefficient values almost around its anthesis stage kang et al 2003 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 it is expected that the wheat et a value in the anthesis stage also reaches the peak if water is available for the crop evapotranspiration the rain fed wheat cultivation in the study area confirms the availability of water but does not confirm the adequacy of it regarding that the wheat potential water consumption through the evapotranspiration process is the highest in the anthesis stage the availability of water ensure that the wheat actual water consumption is also the highest in this stage this fact confirms the agreement between the sebal algorithm and the eagleman affholder method as both of them estimated the highest amount of the wheat et a value in the anthesis stage the re increase in the rain fed wheat et a value after harvest on 161th doy was observed by all three methods which is due to the increase in evaporation from the bare soil surface after the removal of the golden wheat cover from its surface it was concluded that all the methods used for estimating the rain fed wheat et a could successfully estimate the harvest time some further details on assessing the et a values are presented in appendix 5 table 2 shows the results from the frequency analysis of the rain fed wheat et a values in the anthesis stage results indicate that the most frequent amount of et a values 68 of the et a values for the rain fed wheat occurs in a range between 2 and 3 mm day having an average ndvi value around 0 4 in its anthesis stage the lowest value in the range was 2 mm day considered as the threshold value for the rain fed wheat et a this threshold value for et a should occur in the peak period of wheat water consumption so that the rain fed wheat is supposed to pass the period between the heading and anthesis stages without losing a considerable amount of its productivity the chosen threshold value obtained by the remote sensing is almost equal to the minimum amount of et for wheat proposed in the iranian national water document inwd for the wheat anthesis stage in the study area alizadeh and kamali 2007 3 3 yield in the rain fed wheat fields fig 7 shows the rain fed wheat et a and dry matter maps obtained by applying the sebal algorithm and lue model on the landsat 8 images on 133th 145th and 165th doy in 2015 the figure also indicates the rain fed wheat yield map at the end of the growth season in 2015 used to evaluate the classification of rain fed wheat fields in terms of productivity the classified map was obtained from the classification of the rain fed wheat et a map on 133th doy almost around the rain fed wheat anthesis stage in 2015 using the threshold value for the rain fed wheat et a the threshold value for 2015 was determined using the rain fed wheat et a values on 133th doy that is close to wheat anthesis stage the lowest limit of the wheat et a range with the 60 of frequency was 2 mm day indicating the same threshold value in 2015 the rain fed wheat et a maps show that in most of the pixels the amount of et a values on 133th doy was higher than the two other doys in all three et a maps the et a values in most of the pixels located in central parts were lower than the pixels located in marginal parts lower amounts of the rain fed wheat dry matter values in the central areas were also observed in agreement with the lower et a values the rain fed wheat dry matter maps show that the dry matter values had a decreasing trend from around the anthesis stage on 133th doy until around harvest time on 165th doy the classification maps of the rain fed wheat fields in fig 7 indicate that the both of the classes contain a considerable number of fields due to a non uniform spatial distribution of the et a values table 3 compares the remotely sensed yield values to provincial agricultural census data and the yield values in both high productive and low productive classes to evaluate the classified map it also indicates the mean and standard deviation values for the rain fed wheat et a and dry matter the values in table 3 show that the average values of et a in the rain fed wheat fields fluctuated during the anthesis stage to harvest time while the average amount of dry matter decreased by about 74 in the same period the fluctuation in the et a average values refers to the increase of evaporation from the bare soil in the harvested fields also the standard deviation of the dry matter values during the aforementioned period decreased by almost 13 which shows that in order to differentiate fields in terms of productivity investigations on the wheat et a map in the anthesis stage can be more informative the mean amount of rain fed wheat obtained from the lue model in 2015 was estimated equal to 704 kg ha that was almost 10 79 kg ha lower than the reported mean value in the provincial agricultural census data relying on the low amount of the absolute error between the lue model and the census data the mean of the yield value in both high productive and low productive classes was calculated from the remotely sensed yield map which indicated that in high productive class wheat had 33 271 kg ha higher productivity in comparison to low productive class considerable difference in the amounts of yield between the two classes confirmed the accuracy of the fields classification based on the et a values in the wheat anthesis stage along with the published results by kamali et al 2007 the top west part of the map has a higher potential for rain fed wheat cultivation comparing to the bottom west and some central parts of the map 4 conclusion in this study the proposed procedure for recognizing yield potentials among wheat fields before harvest using the remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration in the wheat anthesis stage could successfully differentiate the high productive and low productive classes in agreement with research by kamali et al 2007 in which the investigation of yield potential was done by analyzing the meteorological parameters the rain fed wheat fields located in the north west of the county was recognized as high productive class the disadvantageous of the meteorological method kamali et al 2007 is that it was unable to find that the concentration of the rain fed wheat fields in the study area is not in the north of it despite the high potential the proposed method in this study could spatially detect the rain fed wheat fields and differentiate them based on their yield potential conformity between the rain fed wheat growth potentials map and the rain fed wheat yield map indicated that in the high productive class wheat had a higher yield in comparison to the low productive class among the crop area mapping methods that take advantage of optical and radar sensors busetto et al 2008 chen et al 2012 forkuor et al 2014 guan et al 2016 inglada et al 2016 ozdogan 2010 villa et al 2015a 2015b optical remote sensing methods based on the crop phenological characteristics which are based on the vegetation index time series can be applied easily with acceptable accuracy therefore in this study an algorithm was proposed to map the rain fed wheat area using the modis high temporal resolution and landsat 8 high spatial resolution images the proposed method in this study similar to the research by pan et al 2012 was based on the use of unique characteristics of the wheat vegetation index time series pan et al 2012 after identifying the four distinct stages in the wheat evi time series defined a relative phenology index as a function of the evi values in different growth stages and extracted the wheat area map using modis images the main difference between the methodology presented in this study and that of pan et al 2012 is the use of a step by step algorithm to eliminate non wheat pixels instead of using a relative phenology index since the proposed mapping method requires monitoring the trend of the wheat ndvi time series like other optical methods a non cloudy set of optical images should be available which is not usually easy to find for humid climates the 30 m resolution map from the second major process was used for calculating yield values while the statistics showed that the 250 m resolution map from the first major process had an acceptable accuracy authors recommend the application of the first major process for providing an overall overview of the location of the wheat fields and not to calculating yield values in the rain fed wheat fields in the study area since the detected wheat pixels by this major process contained pastures especially in northern parts along with other research that has reported a satisfactory performance for the sebal algorithm on noaa landsat and modis images ahmad et al 2006 bastiaanssen et al 2005 2002 bastiaanssen and bos 1999 hamid et al 2011 mhawej et al 2020 in this study the sebal algorithm produced a reliable et time series and rational yield values corresponding with the eagleman method and census data respectively using both the sebal algorithm applied on the modis images and the eagleman affholder method applied on the soil map of the study area it was found that the peak of the rain fed wheat et a time series occurs in the anthesis stage in this period which coincided with the anthesis stage of wheat the difference between the two methods in estimating the average et a was almost zero although the most common way to validate an energy balance model is to use measured values from the eddy covariance ec equipment maltese et al 2018a 2018b the study area was not equipped with et measuring facilities to solve the problem we evaluated the obtained et a values from the sebal algorithm by the et a values from an empirical equation the eagleman affholder method and by the et values from the mod16a2 product the mod16a2 product did not confirm that the peak of wheat et a occurs in the anthesis stage while ramoelo et al 2014 in south africa have also announced some inconsistencies in mod16a2 products since the et a maps were the basis for estimating the yield values the agreement between the estimated yield values and the yield values from the census data strengthened the reliability of the estimated et a maps comparing the yield values in high and low productive classes the produced map for the rain fed wheat growth potential was confirmed since in the low productive class the amount of the rain fed wheat yield was lower than the amount of yield in the high productive class the remotely sensed et a threshold value for the wheat anthesis stage could detect the fields with comparatively high or low amounts of yield fields that had an average yield of 33 less than the average yield in other fields it also could match with the minimum amount of the et a recorded in inwd for wheat anthesis stage in ahar county the necessity of determining this threshold value is due to the considerable yield reduction which accrues when the amount of et a is lower than the threshold value in the anthesis stage based on the specific conditions the threshold value probably changes in different years using the determined threshold value obtained from the presented methodology it can comparatively be possible to differentiate the wheat fields a considerable difference in their yield values in the case of the uniform distribution of the wheat et a values the threshold value puts all of the fields into the same class without differentiating them declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a supporting information supplementary data

10294,an algorithm was proposed to classify wheat fields into high productive and low productive classes using satellite images according to a threshold value for rain fed wheat et a in the anthesis stage since the classification process was based on the et a values in the rain fed wheat pixels an algorithm was proposed to map wheat fields using the combination of modis and landsat 8 images the wheat area mapping method included two major processes in which the first one used a step by step elimination process of non wheat pixels which did not follow the standard wheat vegetation index time series the second one used supervised classification methods for detecting the rain fed wheat pixels the assessment of the wheat area map was performed statistically using surveyed wheat plots after detecting the wheat parcels the threshold value was determined using a frequency analysis on actual evapotranspiration values in the parcels the rain fed wheat et a values estimated from the sebal algorithm and were compared to the results from the eagleman affholder method and mod16a2 products to assess if the wheat fields in productivity classes have been categorized correctly yield values in the two classes were compared with each other the rain fed wheat yield was estimated using the light use efficiency model and compared to provincial census data for accuracy assessment results showed that the overall accuracy kappa coefficient and f1 score values for the 250 m resolution map from the modis images were 82 0 61 and 0 71 respectively in the same order these statistics for the 30 m resolution map from the landsat 8 images were 92 0 62 and 0 77 respectively both the sebal and the eagleman affholder methods closely estimated the average wheat et a value in the anthesis stage equal to 2 4 mm day the mean of the rain fed wheat yield value from the lue model in 2015 was 10 lower than the census data relying on the low amount of the absolute error between the lue model and the census data the mean of the yield values in both high productive and low productive classes were compared with together results showed that the mean amount of yield in high productive class was 33 271 kg ha more than that of in low productive class keywords evapotranspiration productivity rain fed wheat remote sensing sebal 1 introduction rain fed agriculture accounts for more than 75 of the cropped areas in the world reddy and syme 2014 studies on the rain fed wheat agricultural potential are important due to the increasing concern about future food security some of these studies have been focused on locally gathered weather soil agronomic and water resource data to investigate the rainfed wheat productivity and to seek ways to close the gap between actual and potential yields edreira et al 2018 anderson 2010 merlos et al 2015 rao et al 2015 local studies have helped to expand the scope of knowledge in rain fed agriculture but these methods usually are limited in terms of providing spatiotemporal data in terms of detecting the crop areas estimating the crop evapotranspiration and estimating crop yield remote sensing is an alternative to on field measurements and on field data collection operations mhawej et al 2020 mosleh et al 2015 zwart et al 2010 in order to map the crop fields using remote sensing different methods based on optical chen et al 2012 guan et al 2016 pan et al 2012 son et al 2014 microwave song and wang 2019 sonobe et al 2014 tan et al 2007 and the combination of both optical and microwave forkuor et al 2014 inglada et al 2016 nasirzadehdizaji et al 2019 villa et al 2015a 2015b images have been developed application of the optic remote sensing in crop area mapping is usually based on the production of the time series for vegetation indexes such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi leaf area index lai and enhanced vegetation index evi mosleh et al 2015 unlike the optical remote sensing that monitors the ability of surfaces to reflect the light and heat spectrum the content of information from the microwave sensors indicates the ability of surfaces in scattering the long wavelength electromagnetic waves nasirzadehdizaji et al 2019 therefore the use of synthetic aperture radar sar images in crop area mapping is based on the characteristics of the crop fields in terms of the coefficient of scattering in different polarizations using machine learning algorithms onojeghuo et al 2018 in terms of using optic images for cloudy days the impact of clouds on the images needs to be reduced or eliminated zhang et al 2010 a cloudy sky which is common in humid climates cause sudden drops in the vegetation index time series for which different de noising filters such as s g algorithm filtering logistic algorithm filtering and gaussian algorithm filtering have been developed guan et al 2016 some of the existing crop area mapping methods that have been applied to optical images have multi stage procedures such as empirical mode decomposition edm process chen et al 2012 or dynamic time warping dtw process guan et al 2016 in case a heterogeneous modis pixel contains more than one class the signal received by the sensor from that pixel in each spectrum will contain the combined effect of those classes ozdogan 2010 the independent component analysis ica algorithm comon 1994 on modis images has been used to visualize the effect of each of these classes on the value of each modis pixel in each spectrum in terms of wheat area mapping methods using optical images support vector machine svm has applied to classify the wheat areas on special dates when the wheat has different values in the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi time series that can be distinguished from the other crops jin et al 2016 nasrallah et al 2018 proposed a tree like approach relying on the ndvi values of a four month period that coincides with several phenological stages of wheat a regression model fitted on the wheat ndvi values in winter was also able to detect the wheat pixels using the fact that the wheat fields are green in winter while on other fields there is no vegetation cover only bare soil tao et al 2017 taking advantage of the wheat phenological features in the mapping process is not only accomplished by applying statistical methods but also by introducing phenological indexes pan et al 2012 introduced a crop phenology index dividing the fluctuations of the enhanced vegetation index evi time series of wheat into four main stages the first stage was related to the establishment and the last one was related to harvest periods while the two middle stages were related to the first and second peaks in the wheat evi curve when the fluctuation of the wheat evi time series were significantly different from other crops after identifying the four stages the phenological index was defined as a function of specific evi values these values were the evi values at the peak points the difference evi values in peaks with values in the first and final stages and the length of the first stage to the fourth stage results showed that the difference between the wheat areas obtained using the phenological index from the modis images and the wheat areas from the landsat and alos satellite images was only 15 20 in order to estimate the crop actual evapotranspiration et a using remote sensing different algorithms have been developed to solve the surface energy balance seb equation allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 kongo et al 2011 roerink et al 2000 wang et al 2014 in a single source seb model no distinction is made between vegetation and soil and hence uses a bulk h formulation unlike a two source model in which the components of h are partitioned between the soil and vegetation xia et al 2016 among the seb models the simplified surface energy balance index s sebi roerink et al 2000 has shown better results for humid climates while for dry and semi arid climates the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and the method of mapping et at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 javadian et al 2019 kilic et al 2016 are more accurate bhattarai et al 2016 sebal has also been applied for et estimations under various agro climatic conditions in several countries and has been validated with existing eddy covariance ec flux tower data bastiaanssen et al 1998 2002 2005 bastiaanssen and bos 1999 hemakumara et al 2003 kamali and nazari 2018 rahimzadegan and janani 2019 recent improvements on sebal are based on automating the processes of hot cold pixel selection and the model calibration the calibration process starts by calculating the sensible heat and the evaporation rate over water bodies since pan coefficient k changes with varying wind speed and relative humidity conditions an additional coefficient c needs to be calibrated comparing the calculated sensible heat and evaporation rates to the generated values from the improved version of the sebal sebali the highest sensible heat and the lowest evaporation rates are selected to adjust the et a values mhawej et al 2020 the sebali algorithm has recently been applied on sentinel 2 images allam et al 2021 and migrated to google earth engine gee platform for a more global crop water consumption assessment mhawej and faour 2020 measured data using eddy covariance ec equipment bowen ratio equipment scintillometer and lysimeter are used for evaluation of models that estimate et a using the surface energy balance models bhattarai et al 2016 bastiaanssen 2000 bastiaanssen et al 2005 maltese et al 2018a 2018b while in the case of the absence of those equipment the remotely sensed et a values may be compared to the et a values obtained from the other methods such as soil water atmosphere plant swap model bastiaanssen et al 2002 water balance equation hamid et al 2011 jassas et al 2015 and fao penman monteith equation costa et al 2019 fao penman monteith allen et al 1998 is a reference method to estimate the crop et c for any station with existing climatic input data and is the base for eagleman affholder method affholder 1997 eagleman 1971 which is specifically developed for calculating the rain fed wheat et a in order to monitor wheat yield using remote sensing the monteith theory monteith 1972 in a light use efficiency lue model has been used zwart et al 2010 while in other studies some regression models have been developed to estimate crop yield values from the vegetation index values behrens et al 2006 ren et al 2008 sharma et al 1993 shen et al 2009 by comparing the yield and productivity values in different pixels it is possible to investigate the scope of improvement among the wheat fields zwart et al 2010 the scope of improvement in crop growth potential is different from evaluating the lands for agricultural purposes where the parameters such as soil texture organic matter content soil depth slope and land use land cover are assessed using the geographical information system bandyopadhyay et al 2009 determination of the scope of improvement after harvest can provides useful information about agricultural fields but it is not a process for gaining information about the probability of yield reduction before the end of the growing season the desired aim of the present study is to classify the rain fed wheat fields into high productive and low productive classes prior to the end of growth season using the et a values in the anthesis stage of wheat it was expected that using the classified map it can be possible to distinguish the rain fed wheat fields with higher amount of final yield from those with lower amount of final yield in before harvest this classification was done by the et a threshold value obtained from the frequency analysis of the et a values in wheat pixels during the wheat anthesis stage the rain fed wheat et a values in during the wheat anthesis stage were estimated by applying the sebal algorithm on the modis images to assess the reliability of the estimated et a values they were compared to the results from eagleman affholder method and mod16a2 products the amount of yield in high and low productive classes were estimated using the lue model and were compared to provincial census data for accuracy assessment it was tested to determine if the yield values in the high productive classes are higher than in low productive classes since the classification process required the amounts of et a values in the rain fed wheat pixels we proposed an algorithm to map wheat fields using the combination of modis and landsat 8 images the wheat area mapping method included two major processes that could produce the rain fed wheat area maps in 250 m and 30 m resolutions the first major process used a step by step elimination method of non wheat pixels which did not follow the standard wheat vegetation index time series during the growing season this process used modis optical images to produce a standard wheat ndvi time series and was suitable for arid and semi arid climates with a low probability of long term cloudy weather the output map from the first major process was assessed statistically using surveyed wheat plots by taking the output map from the first process as the supervised samples in the second one we mapped the wheat fields on the landsat 8 images in the second major process we used the supervised classification methods including artificial neural network ann maximum likelihood ml and support vector machine svm on a landsat 8 image to map the rain fed wheat fields the final version of the map was produced by checking the trend of ndvi values in three different stages for each of the detected wheat pixels 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is shown in fig 1 it is called ahar county located in the north west of iran the rgb image composite of the study area obtained from the infrared red and blue bands of landsat 8 satellite shows that the area is enclosed by mountainous terrains while the agricultural fields are mainly located in the central areas the dominant climate of the study area is arid and semi arid according to the results from the latest agricultural censuses conducted in the study area by the iranian ministry of agriculture wheat is the dominant agricultural crop in the area the total rain fed wheat area was equal to 31 431 ha zoghi 2015 and 30 003 ha provincial government of east azarbaijan 2010 in 2015 and 2010 respectively 2 2 wheat cultivation calendar in the study area according to fig 2 which is inferred from research in china huang et al 2015 winter wheat has different growth stages fig 2 also indicates the schematic of the remotely sensed vegetation index curve during the wheat growth period following the same stages in the pre mentioned research wheat completes its growth from its establishment around the 280th day of each year to harvest around the 165th day of the next year in ahar county the wheat jointing stage in the study area starts in late winter or early spring around the 80th day of the year after which a significant increase in the vegetation index curve happens the increase brings the curve to its peak point at a time around the 120th day of the year between the booting and heading stages the curve experiences a slight decrease after the pack point until the end of the anthesis stage around the 137th day of the year as a highly effective stage on wheat productivity huang et al 2015 after the anthesis stage wheat changes its color from green to yellow coinciding with a higher rate of decrease in the curve in the maturity stage wheat has a golden color and is ready to be harvested after which the curve indicates the value for bare soil in this study the wheat ndvi curve was monitored from the jointing stage until the time that the bare soil appears after harvest to map the wheat fields we set the start time on the wheat jointing stage since it was difficult to monitor the ndvi curve using optical remote sensing in the cloudy conditions in autumn and winter t1 2 3 evaluation of the rain fed wheat fields in this study we proposed an algorithm to classify the wheat fields into high productive and low productive classes before harvest using optical remote sensing the fundamental criterion for the classification was whether the wheat actual evapotranspiration et a could pass the threshold value for et a in the anthesis stage the sensitivity of the final yield to the amount of vegetation index huang et al 2015 and water stress singh and malik 1983 in the wheat anthesis stage was the reason for choosing this stage for further analysis in the study fig 3 shows the process through which the estimated et a values by the sebal algorithm for the mapped wheat fields were analyzed to achieve a threshold value for et a the process started with an algorithm proposed for the wheat area mapping using modis images the sebal algorithm was used to estimate the wheat et a values in the mapped fields during the anthesis stage and then the et a threshold value was determined from the frequency analysis of the values the wheat area map obtained using the modis images was improved by landsat 8 images from 250 m resolution to 30 m resolution after which the sebal model was applied once again to obtain a high resolution wheat et a map in the anthesis stage the high resolution wheat et a map was classified into high productive and low productive classes using the determined threshold value to assess the accuracy of the process based on the available methods and measured data in the study area different assessment steps were embedded in the flowchart to increase the reliability of the results the wheat area mapping algorithm using modis and its improved version using landsat images were assessed statistically using supervised wheat fields accuracy of the et a values obtained by sebal from the modis images were evaluated by the eagleman affholder method eagleman 1971 affholder 1997 mousavi baygi et al 2016 based on the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 frere and popov 1979 although eddy covariance ec equipment is the best known and widely accepted methodology for validating surface energy balance models maltese et al 2018a 2018b due to lack of such equipment in the study area the results from the method were used to assess the remotely sensed wheat et a values assessment of the remotely sensed et a values has also been previously done in other research using the fao penman monteith equation or water balance equation bashir et al 2008 costa et al 2019 jaafar and ahmad 2020 jassas et al 2015 in addition to the eagleman affholder methods the wheat et a values obtained by the sebal algorithm were also compared with the values from the mod16a2 product the mod16a2 product is an 8 day composite modis evapotranspiration product of a 500 m pixel resolution modis terra net evapotranspiration 8 day l4 global 500 m sin grid v006 the algorithm used for the mod16a2 is based on the logic of the penman monteith equation which includes inputs of daily meteorological reanalysis data along with modis remotely sensed data running et al 2017 reliability of the remotely sensed threshold value for et a was tested by wheat et a values recorded in iranian national water document inwd finally to investigate whether the high productive and low productive classes had been differentiated properly enough to provide useful information about yield before harvest the remotely sensed wheat yield values were analyzed after evaluating them with provincial agricultural census yield data 2 4 wheat area mapping algorithm due to the applicability of the crop area mapping methods based on the characteristics of the ndvi time series obtained from each crop we proposed an algorithm in this category that takes advantage of the spatiotemporal resolution of optical images in a novel combination process as it is shown in fig 4 the algorithm has two major processes that in the first one the wheat pixels with the 250 m resolution are detected from the modis images based on the wheat standard ndvi time series the wheat standard ndvi time series was obtained by averaging the ndvi values in the supervised wheat areas that was surveyed using a handy gps device in 2010 in 11 plots with an average area of 20 ha the wheat standard ndvi time series as shown in appendix 1 fig a1 was obtained by averaging the ndvi values in the supervised wheat areas surveyed by a gps device in the study in 11 plots with an average area of 20 ha in 2012 as it is shown in appendix 1 fig a1 the first major process applied with a step by step elimination manner in which the pixels that did not confirm the wheat standard ndvi time series were eliminated from the wheat area map the confirmation criterion was defined with a value that we called it c value to create the two upper and lower bands appendix 1 fig a1 on the wheat standard ndvi time series as follow 1 ndvi ul doy ndvi doy c ndvi doy 100 2 ndvi ll doy ndvi doy c ndvi doy 100 where ndvi ul doy and ndvi ll doy are the values for upper and lower bands on each doy ndvi doy is the average ndvi value of the wheat pixels on each doy and c is the percentage of allowable variation of the ndvi for the wheat pixels on each doy if the ndvi time series of a pixel was found between the two bands the relevant location is accepted as a wheat field otherwise the pixel is eliminated through the algorithm described in fig 4 in the first major process the ndvi images obtained by modis from the 81st day of year doy until the 265th doy in 8 days intervals are taken as input data during a step by step manner at first after choosing an arbitrary c value to calculate ndvi upper and lower limits for each doy pixels from the ndvi image on 81st doy are eliminated if their ndvi values are not between ndvi ul 81 and ndvi ll 81 values in the second step for the 89th doy which is the next 8 days interval pixels from the ndvi image on 89th doy are eliminated if their ndvi values are not between ndvi ul 89 and ndvi ll 89 values in this step those pixels which had been deleted from the ndvi image on 81st doy in the previous step must be eliminated from the ndvi image on 89th doy as well the elimination steps are continued for the next intervals until the 256th doy after which the accuracy assessment is done on the final map the final wheat area map is accepted if the statistics are in a reliable range otherwise it is required to change the c value and to repeat the steps until the statistics satisfy the acceptable range the statistics used for the accuracy assessment in this study were the overall accuracy the kappa coefficient and the f1 score among which the f1 score is more meaningful zhou et al 2017 these statistics were calculated based on the number of correctly and incorrectly classified pixels in both wheat and non wheat classes congalton 1991 the assessment samples were taken from the rain fed wheat fields using gps device fig a1 and from non wheat areas combination of different land uses including water body mountainous terrains gardens urban area bare lands and etc using google earth the highest spatial resolution that can be achieved by the first major process was 250 m resolution according to the spatial resolution of the modis surface reflectance product mod09q1 modis terra surface reflectance 8 day l3 global 250 m sin grid v006 the output map from the first major process is used in determining the et a threshold value which will be explained in section 2 5 since a map with higher resolution is more informative for evaluating the second major process was designed to utilize the advantage of the high spatial resolution landsat 8 images the first major process is not applicable to landsat 8 images since they are unable to produce the wheat ndvi time series including all the required details increasing and decreasing arms and the peak point due to their low temporal resolution instead of producing the wheat ndvi time series in the second major process the wheat areas are mapped on a landsat 8 image using three supervised classification methods artificial neural network ann maximum likelihood ml and support vector machine svm all the landsat 8 bands in a non cloudy day except band 8 are used in the classification process in the coupled algorithm the output of the first major process is inserted as the input to the second major process to train the classification methods instead of training them by the surveyed gps points see appendix 2 to increase the performance of the training process pastures were removed from the modis wheat pixels using the google earth platform combining the three maps obtained using supervised classification methods all the pixels that can be assumed to be wheat pixels are collected since in the combined map includes those error pixels that are mistakenly detected as the wheat pixels the ndvi values for each pixel in the combined map must be checked to detect and remove errors by checking the ndvi values in three consecutive dates for each pixel those pixels that did not obey the wheat ndvi trend are deleted from the combined map we chose a clear landsat 8 image on 165th doy in 2015 to start the sound major process after producing the combined map we checked ndvi values on 133th doy 145th doy and 165th doy in terms of the days that were in the decreasing arm of the wheat ndvi time series we checked if a decreasing trend in ndvi values from the 133th doy until 165st doy existed in each of the classified pixels in the second major process the overall accuracy the kappa coefficient and the f1 score were used to assess the accuracy of the final wheat area map knowing that the land use has not changed in these areas in 2010 and 2015 statistics in this step were calculated using the wheat and non wheat samples 2 5 the threshold value for the wheat et a the threshold value by which the wheat fields were classified into high productive and low productive classes was obtained by frequency analyses of the et a values the wheat et a values were calculated using the sebal algorithm for the wheat parcels detected on the modis images during the wheat anthesis stage on 137th doy mod09a1 modis terra surface reflectance 8 day l3 global 500 m sin grid v006 mod09q1 modis terra surface reflectance 8 day l3 global 250 m sin grid v006 and mod11a2 modis terra land surface temperature emissivity 8 day l3 global 1 km sin grid v006 products were used to run different steps of the sebal model after calculating the et a values the frequency analysis of et a and ndvi values was done to obtain the threshold value during the frequency analysis different range of et a values were sliced to find the range that contains most of the et a values the lower limit of the wheat et a range with the highest frequency in the wheat anthesis stage was taken as the threshold value the calculated threshold value by remote sensing was checked by the reported wheat et a values in the study area in the iranian national water documents inwd alizadeh and kamali 2007 to assess if the sebal algorithm had been applied accurately on the modis images we compared the remotely sensed wheat et a values to the values obtained by the eagleman affholder method during the time from the wheat jointing stage until the wheat harvest time the process during which we applied the eagleman affholder method to calculate the wheat et a values has been described in appendix 3 2 6 classification of fields using the threshold value based on the threshold value if the rate of et a in a wheat pixel in the anthesis stage is less than the threshold value that pixel is classified as being in the low productive class otherwise it is assigned to the high productive class we applied the sebal algorithm for the wheat pixels on a clear landsat image on 133th doy of 2015 that is almost around the wheat anthesis stage to obtain the wheat et a map with 30 m resolution using the threshold value the classified map was produced for 2015 before which the lowest limit of the wheat et a range with the highest frequency was determined for wheat et a values in 2015 to check if the threshold value needed to be modified for assessing the yield values in both classes it was required to monitor the amounts of the wheat yield values in the wheat pixels the spatial distribution of the wheat dry material values in three clear landsat images during the wheat growth period on 133th doy on 149th doy and on 165th doy were obtained using the light use efficiency model which is described in appendix 4 the wheat final yield values in each of the wheat pixels were estimated using the summation of the daily dry material values the wheat final yields were compared to the provincial agricultural census data to evaluate the reliability of the remotely sensed yield values having the wheat final yield map it was investigated to see if the yield values in the high productive class were considerably higher than the low productive class in 2015 achieving the expected result from comparing the two classes it can be proved that the et a values before harvest can be used to distinguish the two classes 3 results 3 1 the wheat area map fig 5 shows output maps from the two major processes of the mapping flowchart initially by implementing the first major process 32 177 ha of the rain fed wheat fields were detected on a 250 m resolution map using the modis images in 2010 this map showed 2174 ha of incompatibility 7 24 compared to the total area reported in the agricultural censuses data in 2010 provincial government of east azarbaijan 2010 the 250 m resolution map was produced by taking the c value equal to 15 for the wheat ndvi peak period and equal to 10 for the days after harvest the output maps from the supervised classification ann ml and svm methods and the map obtained from the combination of the methods are also shown in fig 5 which are the raw products of the second major process these raw products were produced by importing the cleaned version of the 250 resolution map after removing the pastures using the google earth platform and indicate the rain fed wheat pixels on 256th doy in 2015 the ndvi values from the landsat 8 bands for the mentioned pixels are shown in fig 5 on 133th doy 145th doy and 256th doy in 2015 the final product of the second major which is a 30 m resolution map for the rain fed wheat fields is shown in fig 5 the total area detected for the rain fed wheat fields in the study area in 2015 were 37 745 ha in the 30 m resolution map which was a product of checking the ndvi values on the combined raw map the total rain fed wheat area in the 30 m resolution map showed 6314 ha of incompatibility 20 09 in comparison with the total area reported in agricultural censuses data for 2015 zoghi 2015 despite that the 250 m resolution map showed lower difference with census data comparing to the 30 m resolution map pixels in the 250 m resolution map contained pastures due to their coarseness the first major process was unable to remove the pastures from the heterogeneous pixels while the total area of the detected pixels may be deceptive at first glance reliability in the 30 m resolution map with fine and homogeneous pixels increases knowing the fact that the rain fed wheat fields in the study area are usually smaller than covering a full modis pixel especially in the northern part acceptable values were obtained for the assessment statistics as shown in table 1 in which the overall accuracy kappa coefficient and f1 score values for the 30 m resolution map from the landsat 8 images were 92 0 62 and 0 77 respectively in the same order the values for the aforementioned statistics were 82 0 61 and 0 71 for the 250 m resolution map obtained from the modis images as shown in the final map most of the rain fed wheat fields were in the central part of the study area in a higher integrity while in the northern and marginal areas the farmlands were distributed in low integrity since the marginal and northern parts in the study area have mountainous and forest land use the integrity of the rain fed wheat fields in the central parts as detected by the proposed method would seem to be rational according to the latest provincial agricultural censuses data the difference in the total rain fed wheat area in ahar county was less than 4 7 comparing the two 2010 and 2015 years provincial government of east azarbaijan 2010 zoghi 2015 such a negligible change is due to the impossibility of an easy conversion from rain fed agriculture to irrigated one in the study area the development of irrigated farmlands requires huge investments in water conveying systems through which farmers can be able to change the crop pattern on their farmlands hence the combination of the two mentioned years based on the census data to produce a reliable map that presents rain fed wheat pixels in the study area was logical authors recommend the use of the same year data for both two majors in areas with significant yearly changes in crop patterns 3 2 assessment of estimated et a values fig 6 compares the time series of the rain fed wheat et a mm day obtained by eagleman affholder method the sebal algorithm and mod16a2 product in 2010 and the linear fits between the aforementioned methods the comparison helped to evaluate the rain fed wheat et a values obtained by applying the sebal algorithm on the modis images the et a time series obtained from the sebal algorithm and the eagleman affholder method shows that the highest amount of the wheat et a value occurs in the anthesis stage on 137th doy while the et a time series obtained from the mod16a2 product indicates that it occurs in the peak period of the ndvi curve between 113th doy and 121th doy the r square values between the sebal algorithm and the eagleman affholder method was almost equal with 0 6 the r square values between the mod16a2 product and the eagleman affholder method and between the mod16a2 product and the sebal algorithm were lower than 0 3 since the previous research has confirmed that the wheat crop reaches its potential evapotranspiration having the highest crop coefficient values almost around its anthesis stage kang et al 2003 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 it is expected that the wheat et a value in the anthesis stage also reaches the peak if water is available for the crop evapotranspiration the rain fed wheat cultivation in the study area confirms the availability of water but does not confirm the adequacy of it regarding that the wheat potential water consumption through the evapotranspiration process is the highest in the anthesis stage the availability of water ensure that the wheat actual water consumption is also the highest in this stage this fact confirms the agreement between the sebal algorithm and the eagleman affholder method as both of them estimated the highest amount of the wheat et a value in the anthesis stage the re increase in the rain fed wheat et a value after harvest on 161th doy was observed by all three methods which is due to the increase in evaporation from the bare soil surface after the removal of the golden wheat cover from its surface it was concluded that all the methods used for estimating the rain fed wheat et a could successfully estimate the harvest time some further details on assessing the et a values are presented in appendix 5 table 2 shows the results from the frequency analysis of the rain fed wheat et a values in the anthesis stage results indicate that the most frequent amount of et a values 68 of the et a values for the rain fed wheat occurs in a range between 2 and 3 mm day having an average ndvi value around 0 4 in its anthesis stage the lowest value in the range was 2 mm day considered as the threshold value for the rain fed wheat et a this threshold value for et a should occur in the peak period of wheat water consumption so that the rain fed wheat is supposed to pass the period between the heading and anthesis stages without losing a considerable amount of its productivity the chosen threshold value obtained by the remote sensing is almost equal to the minimum amount of et for wheat proposed in the iranian national water document inwd for the wheat anthesis stage in the study area alizadeh and kamali 2007 3 3 yield in the rain fed wheat fields fig 7 shows the rain fed wheat et a and dry matter maps obtained by applying the sebal algorithm and lue model on the landsat 8 images on 133th 145th and 165th doy in 2015 the figure also indicates the rain fed wheat yield map at the end of the growth season in 2015 used to evaluate the classification of rain fed wheat fields in terms of productivity the classified map was obtained from the classification of the rain fed wheat et a map on 133th doy almost around the rain fed wheat anthesis stage in 2015 using the threshold value for the rain fed wheat et a the threshold value for 2015 was determined using the rain fed wheat et a values on 133th doy that is close to wheat anthesis stage the lowest limit of the wheat et a range with the 60 of frequency was 2 mm day indicating the same threshold value in 2015 the rain fed wheat et a maps show that in most of the pixels the amount of et a values on 133th doy was higher than the two other doys in all three et a maps the et a values in most of the pixels located in central parts were lower than the pixels located in marginal parts lower amounts of the rain fed wheat dry matter values in the central areas were also observed in agreement with the lower et a values the rain fed wheat dry matter maps show that the dry matter values had a decreasing trend from around the anthesis stage on 133th doy until around harvest time on 165th doy the classification maps of the rain fed wheat fields in fig 7 indicate that the both of the classes contain a considerable number of fields due to a non uniform spatial distribution of the et a values table 3 compares the remotely sensed yield values to provincial agricultural census data and the yield values in both high productive and low productive classes to evaluate the classified map it also indicates the mean and standard deviation values for the rain fed wheat et a and dry matter the values in table 3 show that the average values of et a in the rain fed wheat fields fluctuated during the anthesis stage to harvest time while the average amount of dry matter decreased by about 74 in the same period the fluctuation in the et a average values refers to the increase of evaporation from the bare soil in the harvested fields also the standard deviation of the dry matter values during the aforementioned period decreased by almost 13 which shows that in order to differentiate fields in terms of productivity investigations on the wheat et a map in the anthesis stage can be more informative the mean amount of rain fed wheat obtained from the lue model in 2015 was estimated equal to 704 kg ha that was almost 10 79 kg ha lower than the reported mean value in the provincial agricultural census data relying on the low amount of the absolute error between the lue model and the census data the mean of the yield value in both high productive and low productive classes was calculated from the remotely sensed yield map which indicated that in high productive class wheat had 33 271 kg ha higher productivity in comparison to low productive class considerable difference in the amounts of yield between the two classes confirmed the accuracy of the fields classification based on the et a values in the wheat anthesis stage along with the published results by kamali et al 2007 the top west part of the map has a higher potential for rain fed wheat cultivation comparing to the bottom west and some central parts of the map 4 conclusion in this study the proposed procedure for recognizing yield potentials among wheat fields before harvest using the remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration in the wheat anthesis stage could successfully differentiate the high productive and low productive classes in agreement with research by kamali et al 2007 in which the investigation of yield potential was done by analyzing the meteorological parameters the rain fed wheat fields located in the north west of the county was recognized as high productive class the disadvantageous of the meteorological method kamali et al 2007 is that it was unable to find that the concentration of the rain fed wheat fields in the study area is not in the north of it despite the high potential the proposed method in this study could spatially detect the rain fed wheat fields and differentiate them based on their yield potential conformity between the rain fed wheat growth potentials map and the rain fed wheat yield map indicated that in the high productive class wheat had a higher yield in comparison to the low productive class among the crop area mapping methods that take advantage of optical and radar sensors busetto et al 2008 chen et al 2012 forkuor et al 2014 guan et al 2016 inglada et al 2016 ozdogan 2010 villa et al 2015a 2015b optical remote sensing methods based on the crop phenological characteristics which are based on the vegetation index time series can be applied easily with acceptable accuracy therefore in this study an algorithm was proposed to map the rain fed wheat area using the modis high temporal resolution and landsat 8 high spatial resolution images the proposed method in this study similar to the research by pan et al 2012 was based on the use of unique characteristics of the wheat vegetation index time series pan et al 2012 after identifying the four distinct stages in the wheat evi time series defined a relative phenology index as a function of the evi values in different growth stages and extracted the wheat area map using modis images the main difference between the methodology presented in this study and that of pan et al 2012 is the use of a step by step algorithm to eliminate non wheat pixels instead of using a relative phenology index since the proposed mapping method requires monitoring the trend of the wheat ndvi time series like other optical methods a non cloudy set of optical images should be available which is not usually easy to find for humid climates the 30 m resolution map from the second major process was used for calculating yield values while the statistics showed that the 250 m resolution map from the first major process had an acceptable accuracy authors recommend the application of the first major process for providing an overall overview of the location of the wheat fields and not to calculating yield values in the rain fed wheat fields in the study area since the detected wheat pixels by this major process contained pastures especially in northern parts along with other research that has reported a satisfactory performance for the sebal algorithm on noaa landsat and modis images ahmad et al 2006 bastiaanssen et al 2005 2002 bastiaanssen and bos 1999 hamid et al 2011 mhawej et al 2020 in this study the sebal algorithm produced a reliable et time series and rational yield values corresponding with the eagleman method and census data respectively using both the sebal algorithm applied on the modis images and the eagleman affholder method applied on the soil map of the study area it was found that the peak of the rain fed wheat et a time series occurs in the anthesis stage in this period which coincided with the anthesis stage of wheat the difference between the two methods in estimating the average et a was almost zero although the most common way to validate an energy balance model is to use measured values from the eddy covariance ec equipment maltese et al 2018a 2018b the study area was not equipped with et measuring facilities to solve the problem we evaluated the obtained et a values from the sebal algorithm by the et a values from an empirical equation the eagleman affholder method and by the et values from the mod16a2 product the mod16a2 product did not confirm that the peak of wheat et a occurs in the anthesis stage while ramoelo et al 2014 in south africa have also announced some inconsistencies in mod16a2 products since the et a maps were the basis for estimating the yield values the agreement between the estimated yield values and the yield values from the census data strengthened the reliability of the estimated et a maps comparing the yield values in high and low productive classes the produced map for the rain fed wheat growth potential was confirmed since in the low productive class the amount of the rain fed wheat yield was lower than the amount of yield in the high productive class the remotely sensed et a threshold value for the wheat anthesis stage could detect the fields with comparatively high or low amounts of yield fields that had an average yield of 33 less than the average yield in other fields it also could match with the minimum amount of the et a recorded in inwd for wheat anthesis stage in ahar county the necessity of determining this threshold value is due to the considerable yield reduction which accrues when the amount of et a is lower than the threshold value in the anthesis stage based on the specific conditions the threshold value probably changes in different years using the determined threshold value obtained from the presented methodology it can comparatively be possible to differentiate the wheat fields a considerable difference in their yield values in the case of the uniform distribution of the wheat et a values the threshold value puts all of the fields into the same class without differentiating them declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a supporting information supplementary data
