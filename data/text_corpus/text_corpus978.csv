4890,changing precipitation patterns are projected to reduce snowpack storage and late summer stream flows in mountain headwaters of the western united states ecosystems agriculture and municipalities depend on late summer flow in streams supplying water to the mountain front therefore improved understanding of groundwater storage contributions to mountain streams is increasingly important in this work we use 87sr 86sr ratios and 234u 238u activity ratios 234u 238u as indicators of water rock interaction contributing to runoff groundwater and surface subsurface hydrologic exchanges along hyalite creek a mountain headwater tributary within the upper missouri river basin main stem and tributary flow was sampled longitudinally from 2016 to 2018 focusing on presumed baseflow conditions in february and august changing stream chemistry of the main stem is associated with groundwater inflows from local springs discharging from madison group limestones and inputs of water from the archean gneiss exposed along the mountain front we use mixing models to estimate that locally in the stream reach traversing a spring outlet distinct inflows from the madison aquifer contribute 4 of streamflow during baseflow conditions contributions to streamflow by local inflows from archean gneiss varied seasonally with increases in 87sr 86sr values in hyalite creek that suggest contributions of 2 in august to 8 in february at the same time decreasing 234u 238u values indicate an otherwise undetected additional endmember and 222rn assays show that total inflows are likely more extensive our results reveal distinct groundwater contributions to streamflow from specific rock units within this mountain headwater system and elucidate pathways of mountain stream flow generation in lithologically diverse watersheds keywords mountain catchment groundwater uranium strontium geochemical tracer 1 introduction mountainous regions of the western united states face impending water management challenges given the combination of urban growth and water scarcity driven by projected changes in precipitation and snowpack dynamics knowles et al 2005 silverman et al 2013 the region supports both urban and rural communities that rely heavily on mountain headwaters for municipal and agricultural water supplies silverman and maneta 2016 hoylman et al 2018 these headwater catchments supply a majority of the water found in the rivers and aquifers of intermountain basins wilson and guan 2004 where more intensive human land and water use tends to occur however the nature and extent of groundwater storage influence on these mountain headwater contributions is generally poorly quantified leading to uncertainty in estimates of mountain headwater contributions to water resource availability during low flow conditions this study uses geochemical tracers to explore the longitudinal and temporal distribution of groundwater contributions to baseflow conditions in a mountain headwater stream focusing on a canyon within the upper missouri and gallatin river watersheds fig 1 we demonstrate that chemical and isotopic analyses of weathering products found in stream solute loads provide a useful tool for inferring groundwater contributions from different parts of the watershed this case study of a mountain headwaters process domain montgomery 1999 holds general insight for understanding the contribution of mountain headwater groundwater storage to intermountain basin communities and ecosystems and its likely relevance under low flow conditions and over time mountain headwaters are often characterized by steep mountain streams with fundamental control of geomorphologic development by lithology structural features tectonic regime fluvial erosion or deposition and glaciation amundson et al 2015 dixon et al 2016 weathering in higher elevation mountain headwater process domains is generally limited by relatively low temperatures and rapid mechanical erosion compared to lower elevation intermountain basin process domains as a result soils in mountain headwater catchments are generally thin and less developed in terms of mineral transformation and mass loss to chemical weathering furthermore high relief results in strong influence of hillslope aspect on the extent of substrate weathering hinckley et al 2014 and topography strongly influences seasonal precipitation and runoff mcguire et al 2005 jencso et al 2009 jencso and mcglynn 2011 emanuel et al 2014 along a mountain headwater valley stream water solutes reflect the exchanges between surface water and groundwater throughout the mountain headwaters payn et al 2009 these concomitant gains and losses of water along a stream result in longitudinal patterns of solute composition reflecting dilution and solute load inputs characteristic of transport of weathering products or lack thereof to the stream covino and mcglynn 2007 capell et al 2011 jasechko 2016 jasechko and kirchner 2016 yang et al 2017 thus mountain headwaters are key in controlling both streamflow and water quality water emerging at the mountain front provides a fingerprint of lithologies within the mountain catchment delivering it and patterns in water quality along the stream provide information about the spatial distribution of groundwater sources contributing to stream flow generation most work in mountain headwater watersheds has been focused on topographic controls on event flow contributions to streamflow mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 mcguire et al 2005 jencso and mcglynn 2011 the study of baseflow generation in mountain headwaters has received less attention particularly in snowmelt dominated systems soulsby and tetzlaff 2008 payn et al 2012 however changes in climate and the distribution of precipitation demand a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling variation in groundwater contributions to baseflow particularly in semi arid systems where water resource availability during dry seasons is a major concern soulsby and tetzlaff 2008 a first step to understanding the longer term storage that serves as a reservoir for baseflow is to identify the location and relative contribution from aquifers that contribute to lower stream flows across a catchment geochemical tracers of baseflow sourced by aquifers of varying size materials and residence times offer an opportunity to investigate a distinctive signal of groundwater contribution to streamflow often these tracers record a signal of both weathering and aquifer flowpath or transit time chabaux et al 2003 hogan and blum 2003 dosseto et al 2014 therefore the geochemical signal imparted on groundwater contributing to baseflow varies with the chemical composition age and weathering susceptibility of the aquifer rock or geomorphic units as lithology changes throughout the reach of a mountain stream and across the mountain front so does the cumulative geochemical fingerprint imparted on the water these fingerprints can allow baseflow at the outlet to be traced back to its host rock or sediment and allow longitudinal surveys of water quality at baseflow to reveal the location and relative contribution of discharge from specific aquifers to the stream this study uses 87sr 86sr and 234u 238u values square brackets denote activity ratio as natural geochemical tracers to investigate the sources and pathways of water contributing to streamflow during baseflow conditions over the past two decades many studies have used sr isotope ratios primarily 87sr 86sr but also 88sr 86sr to examine weathering sequences dust inputs and carbonate accumulation in rocks and soils bullen et al 1997 capo et al 1998 capo and chadwick 1999 hart et al 2004 chadwick et al 2009 white et al 2009 in surface water and groundwater systems 87sr 86sr data have been used to trace sources of soil and rock weathering inputs to stream geochemistry horton et al 1999 jacobson et al 2002 2003 frost and toner 2004 more recently u series isotopes notably 234u 238u have been used to examine processes of water rock interaction that rely on the balance between recoil effects that increase 234u 238u and bulk u dissolution that decreases 234u 238u bourdon et al 2003 chabaux et al 2003 dosseto et al 2008 depaolo et al 2006 water rock interactions with the different lithologies or flow paths present in the watershed have the potential to result in unique 87sr 86sr and 234u 238u isotopic signatures which may allow determination of multiple sources pathways and mixing relations among end members drexler et al 2014 paces and wurster 2014 both u and sr are readily soluble in oxidizing aqueous systems and their radiogenic isotopes are not affected substantially by mass dependent fractionation in near surface environments paces and wurster 2014 thus sr and u isotopes can potentially provide a precise and accurate fingerprint of water sources and hydrologic evolution roback et al 2001 faure and mensing 2005 ryu et al 2009 pierret et al 2014 paces et al 2015 together u and sr isotopic ratios provide a useful means of examining the influence of weathering processes water sources and the degree of water rock interaction on stream geochemistry using reactive transport modeling and end member mixing analysis approaches depaolo et al 2006 maher et al 2006 paces and wurster 2014 here we explore how aquifer contributions of spatiotemporally variable geochemical weathering products influence baseflow generation in a mountain headwater catchment using hyalite creek in southwestern montana as a case study hyalite creek is a steep glaciated mountain headwater stream with a watershed area of approximately 126 km2 draining into the intermountain basin and associated alluvial aquifer of the gallatin valley we use 234u 238u and 87sr 86sr values along with complementary 222rn activities to examine water flow and storage dynamics along the main stem of this mountain stream with a goal of characterizing a spatially explicit map of the influence of aquifers hosted in four lithologic units with distinct u and sr isotopic character and the resulting effects on water quality and supply at the watershed outlet this work reveals how baseflow and storage dynamics can vary across a catchment that includes lithologic units with variable chemical compositions ages and degrees of weatherability 2 methods 2 1 study area hyalite creek in southwestern montana traverses a number of bedrock lithologies providing a case study for assessing cumulative contributions of multiple geochemically diverse aquifers to baseflow along the canyon the study watershed is located in the north central gallatin mountain range and is a headwater catchment of the gallatin river fig 1 hyalite creek is dammed midway up hyalite canyon creating a reservoir that supplies one third of bozeman s municipal water supply along with water for irrigated agriculture in the gallatin valley dnrc 2014 flow out of hyalite creek has been diverted at the mountain front as a water source for irrigation since 1871 kramer 2013 in addition hyalite canyon has an extensive logging history beginning in the 1870s through 1911 kramer 2013 currently hyalite canyon is heavily used for recreation with about 80 000 visitors per month during the peak summer season gedeon 2015 soils in hyalite canyon reflect limited chemical weathering and strong influence of parent lithologies united states department of agriculture 1996 in meadows and open slopes soils classified as mollisols have developed with relatively thick dark a horizons in forested areas soils classified as alfisols and inceptisols have developed with thin a horizons occasional e horizons indicating strong leaching and subsurface horizons with enhanced clay content hyalite canyon receives an average of 82 cm of precipitation annually 30 year average 1981 2010 usda nrcs prism climate group with 40 of that falling as snow at an elevation of 2469 m the maximum mean monthly temperature is 14 c in july and the minimum monthly mean temperature is 7 7 c in december shower falls snotel usda nrcs vegetation in hyalite canyon is

sites table 1 were selected to represent potential contributions from rock units with distinct geochemical character fig 1 table 2 sampling sites included surface waters in hyalite creek and five tributaries hy1 through hy15 a spring and associated spring channel in the bank of hyalite creek hy16 and hy17 a well and associated cistern in neighboring hodgman canyon gw2 and gw3 and a well in the uppermost alluvial fan formed by hyalite creek at the mountain front gw4 fig 1 surface waters were sampled in february and august 2016 2018 when baseflow conditions were presumed to dominate stream flow generation based on hydrograph levels we started with six primary surface water sites along hyalite creek in 2016 targeting delineation of waters influenced by the major lithologic units hy1 through hy6 labeled sequentially with decreasing elevation we expanded the number of sites between 2016 and 2018 based on identification of reaches with notable longitudinal changes in chemistry and their potential end member contributors ultimately sample sites included ten main stem locations in order of decreasing elevation hy1 hy7 hy9 hy10 hy11 hy4 hy14 hy15 hy5 hy6 five tributaries hy2 hy3 hy12 hy13 hy8 two springs hy16 hy17 three wells gw2 gw3 gw4 and one neighboring stream sourdough creek also known as bozeman creek in the next major valley to the east sd1 table 1 fig 1 two sampling locations were co located at sites with continuous stream gauges along hyalite creek site hy7 is co located with a montana department of natural resources and conservation gauge dnrc number 41h 2000 downstream of hyalite reservoir and hy6 is co located with a u s geological survey gauge usgs number 06050000 located at the mouth of hyalite canyon table 1 fig 1 hydrographs from these two gauges depict a snowmelt dominated hydrologic regime fig 2 with flows ranging from 0 18 to 5 34 m3 s 1 at the dnrc gauge hy7 and from 0 48 to 7 51 m3 s 1 at the usgs gauge hy6 during the sampling period from 2016 to 2018 hydrographs show how our sampling events align with lower flow conditions fig 2 note log scale where august sampling dates reflect low summer flows and february sampling dates reflect low winter flows on a given sampling date flow in the main stem of hyalite creek increased between the two gauges at sites hy7 and hy6 on 2 19 2016 from 0 34 to 0 55 m3 s 1 net gain of 0 21 m3 s 1 or a 62 increase on 8 24 2016 from 1 40 to 1 65 m3 s 1 net gain of 0 25 m3 s 1 or a 18 increase and on 8 23 2017 from 1 14 to 1 57 m3 s 1 net gain of 0 43 m3 s 1 or a 38 increase gauge data were not available for hy7 during the 2 4 2017 sampling due to interference from freezing thus net gains in discharge between hy7 and hy6 were similar in absolute volume between february and august but those gains represent a proportionally larger fraction of stream flow during february due to lower flow conditions in general hyalite creek traverses a range of lithologic units known to have distinct geochemical character table 2 from the highest sample site at 3140 m above sea level to the lowest site near the mountain front at an elevation of 1690 m above sea level fig 1 berg et al 1999 2000 vuke et al 2002 2007 kellogg and williams 2006 specific contributions of rock weathering products to hyalite creek water will depend on differential mineral weatherability however the general range of 87sr 86sr values observed for these lithologies is substantial enough to use 87sr 86sr data to fingerprint water rock interactions uppermost hyalite creek 3140 2100 m elevation is underlain by eocene aged andesitic to basaltic rocks of the washburn group within the absaroka volcanic supergroup sample sites located in the steep glaciated terrain cutting volcanic rocks include upper hyalite creek hy1 and emerald creek tributary hy2 both located above hyalite reservoir fig 1 these eocene volcanic rocks cap a sequence of cretaceous to cambrian aged sedimentary rocks exposed in the middle elevations of hyalite canyon 2010 to 1875 m lithologies include a succession of shales limestones siltstones and sandstones that are progressively older with decreasing elevation fig 1 main stem sites hy7 and hy9

and baseflow in the neighboring sourdough canyon kirk 2002 as well as to baseflow in neighboring gallatin canyon and hyalite canyon the main stem of hyalite creek crosses mississippian to cambrian aged sedimentary rock units at elevations of 1910 to 1860 m and includes sites hy10 hy11 and hy4 tributaries buckskin creek hy12 meadow creek hy13 and moser creek hy8 drain areas underlain by those same paleozoic sedimentary rock units although the moser creek subwatershed includes archean gneisses and both the moser and meadow creek subwatersheds include eocene volcanics fig 1 at its lowest elevations 1875 to 1690 m hyalite creek cuts a narrow unglaciated canyon through archean quartzofeldspathic gneiss main stem sites hy14 and hy15 are located near the transition between sedimentary bedrock and gneiss near an elevation of 1875 m main stem site hy5 is located at an elevation of 1730 m and site hy6 is located near the mountain front at an elevation of 1690 m just downstream of a shear zone within the archean gneiss may 1985 groundwater present in fractured archean gneiss was sampled at a spring fed cistern and nearby well in the neighboring hodgman canyon gw2 gw3 at 1690 m

erosion of absaroka volcanic rocks in the upper reaches of hyalite creek through jurassic aged sedimentary rocks in the middle elevations of the stream fig 1 moraines interpreted as resulting from the older bull lake glaciation 180 to 130 ka extend further down canyon from the headwaters of hyalite and emerald creeks hy1 hy2 to just above langohr campground hy4 at an elevation of about 1860 m weber 1965 these moraines pass through devonian to cambrian aged sedimentary rock units between elevations of 1975 and 1850 m the canyon narrows abruptly downstream from the terminus of moraines associated with bull lake glaciation and remains relatively steep and narrow through the archean gneiss 2 3 water sampling procedures and solute analysis surface water samples were collected using a peristaltic

established sampling sites hoehn et al 1992 schubert et al 2006 gardner et al 2011 samples were collected as described in gardner et al 2011 and analyzed at the university of montana using scintillation counting u and sr isotopic analysis followed procedures described in ewing et al 2015 and paces wurster 2014 water samples field blanks procedural blanks and standards of known

include within run uncertainties and external error based on replicate analyses of standards results for 87sr 86sr measured in srst 221 processed at msu and swirl are identical within reported analytical uncertainty 2 4 isotope ratio and elemental ratio interpretation we interpret the sr isotope ratio as reflecting the isotopic character of weathered materials in contact with surface and groundwater providing information about the mineralogical content and age of that weathered material differences in 87sr 86sr in rocks and minerals depend on the isotopic composition of sr at the time the rock formed as well as its rb sr and age water interacting with solid materials during recharge and flow dissolves some of that sr and incorporates the 87sr 86sr ratio present in the lithologic source without significant isotopic fractionation however differences in weatherability of individual mineral components with variable rb sr may result in a range of 87sr 86sr values that reflect preferential dissolution of particular phases white et al 2005 négrel et al 2004 pierret et al 2014 barbieri et al 2005 along with 87sr 86sr values ca sr mass ratios provide additional context for examining weathering and interaction of substrate and water hogan and blum 2003 both sr and ca are divalent group 2 alkaline earth metals of similar size therefore they react similarly allowing sr to substitute readily for ca in mineral lattices during precipitation of carbonate minerals ca is preferentially incorporated into the crystal lattice increasing the ca sr in the solid and decreasing the ca sr in remaining water white et al 2005 we interpret the u activity ratios as reflecting the balance between preferential dissolution of 234u derived from alpha decay of the parent isotope 238u and bulk dissolution of u with from rock matrix that has a 234u 238u near unity this balance in turn is a function of the water rock interaction and integrates residence time flow path length chemical aggressiveness of weathering processes and the ratio of exposed rock surface area to ambient volume of water in rocks and minerals older than about 1 ma 234u abundances reach a state of radioactive secular equilibrium with 238u meaning that the growth and decay of 234u become balanced with decay of 238u half life of 4 47 109 years such that levels of radioactivity rates of decay for both isotopes are equal and the ratio of their activities equals unity that is 234u 238u 1 00 bourdon et al 2003 radioactive disequilibrium is a consequence of water rock interaction where alpha recoil occurring in the solid phase increases the susceptibility of 234u to leaching relative to 238u resulting in 234u 238u values greater than one in the aqueous phase the degree of 234u 238u disequilibrium is a function of u concentration particle surface area water rock ratios chemical reactivity and time depaolo et al 2006 maher et al 2006 higher 234u 238u values reflect low water rock ratios longer flow paths allowing more exposure to recoil 234u or greater mineral surface areas interacting with a given volume of water bourdon et al 2003 chabaux et al 2003 suksi et al 2006 dosseto et al 2008 depaolo et al 2012 however increases in 234u 238u values are limited by rates of weathering and bulk rock dissolution which drive 234u 238u values back towards unity maher et al 2006 isotopes of sr and u allow identification of end members because their ratios are usually not affected by dilution or near surface physical or chemical processes other than those of interest here paces and wurster 2014 one exception to this could be contexts where reducing conditions favor loss of dissolved u6 to precipitation with reduction to u4 such as in a wet meadow environment rich in organic matter where water flow is slowed this loss of u could lead to erroneously low estimation of contribution from an endmember characterized upgradient of such an environment and might be evident in skewed concentration relationships thus care must be taken to appropriately characterize end members acknowledge geomorphic context and recognize effects of u loss through chemical reduction in hyalite canyon these wet meadow environments occur in the glaciated middle and upper reaches of the canyon above hy4 one spring fed wet meadow was sampled at site hy13 as a complement to these primary geochemical measures we used 222rn activities to qualitatively establish the broader range of subsurface inflows to hyalite creek hoehn et al 1992 concentrations of 222rn reflect the 238u decay series in the form of this short lived intermediate with a half life of 3 8 days this short half life allows quantification of residence times from days to weeks in groundwater schubert et al 2006 whereas older groundwater will simply be equilibrated with 222rn efflux in the aquifer because rn is a noble gas air water exchange rapidly depletes concentrations in surface water making detection of elevated 222rn a useful tracer of all groundwater inflows older than days gardner et al 2011 2 5 data interpretation we interpreted patterns in stream flow generation from groundwater aquifers along hyalite creek first by examining the longitudinal patterns in chemical and isotope characterizations with decreasing elevation and distance downstream longitudinal analysis allowed consideration of how geologic structures geomorphology and lithology influence the character of stream flow generation and surface subsurface water interaction gardner et al 2011 this sampling strategy allowed us to construct mixing models that quantify fractional inputs of groundwater to reaches of hyalite creek where geochemical data indicated notable influence of a given aquifer two mixing analyses were performed to estimate the fraction of stream flow that could be attributed to chemically distinguishable aquifers along hyalite canyon a binary mixture m can be calculated from concentrations c isotopic ratios r and fractional contributions f from each of two end members in this case the two end members are the water at the upstream end of a reach a and the water contributed from a given groundwater source along the reach b that together constitute the mixture m at the downstream end of the reach faure and mensing 2005 arendt et al 2015 1 c m c a f a c b f b 2 r m r a f a c a c m r b f b c b c m where f a f b 1 here we identify hydrologic end members and evaluate mixtures of end members defined by sr concentration 87sr 86sr u concentration and 234u 238u so eqs 1 and 2 were repeated for sr and u and solved simultaneously rather than evaluate the entire stream system we used the binary mixing model and monte carlo analysis to estimate groundwater inputs to hyalite creek over two reaches where groundwater inputs from two distinctive aquifers karst flow in madison group limestones and fracture flow in archean gneiss are particularly likely to influence stream compositions while there are numerous tributaries and other small inputs of water to hyalite creek we refined our sampling to capture the two distinct reaches of hyalite creek where groundwater inputs from these sources can be quantified without the potentially confounding effects of surface inflow the upper to middle elevations of hyalite creek were characterized as a two end member mixture between surface water discharging from hyalite creek below hyalite reservoir site hy7 1962 m representing water having interacted with clastic sedimentary rock and volcanics in the upper part of the catchment and groundwater input from the madison aquifer sites hy16 and hy17 1931 1936 m the resulting mixture below the presumed influence of the madison inflows was sampled at site hy10 1909 m during august 2017 baseflow conditions a second two component end member mixing model uses surface waters of middle hyalite creek below the influence of the madison sites hy14 and hy15 1854 m and groundwater from the archean gneiss sampled in hodgeman s canyon sites gw2 and gw3 the resulting mixture below the presumed influence of archean gneiss inflows was sampled at site hy5 1807 m during both august and february baseflow conditions for a given mixing reach and end member definition we solved eqs 1 and 2 simultaneously for u and sr using a numerical iterative optimization scheme the optimization goal was to find the combination of f a upstream end member and f b groundwater end member for the mixing model that would have the maximum likelihood of matching the observed concentrations and isotope ratios for both sr and u at the downstream end of the reach we used r statistical software and the optim function from the base r stats package to find the maximum likelihood estimate i e mle analysis based on the quasi newton l bfgs b algorithm ewing et al 2020 likelihood for the mle was calculated based on the assumption that the residual errors between the modeled mixture values and the observed mixture values were independent and normally distributed ewing et al 2020 the assumed standard deviations of the residual errors necessary for calculating the likelihood in this fashion were based on estimates of analytical uncertainty of each end member in the overall sample analysis we estimated the effect of uncertainty in end member concentrations and isotope ratios on the mle inferred composition of a given observed mixture using a monte carlo analysis we characterized uncertainty for each end member using a random variable with a normal distribution estimated from multiple samples characterizing that end member over time and similar sites sampled on the same date we then generated an ensemble of 5 000 realizations of the inferred composition for a given observation where each realization was generated by randomly sampling from the normal distributions defining the uncertainty in the end members and repeating the mle normal distributions truncated at zero were used to characterize uncertainty in end members such that nonsensical results were excluded from the ensemble results the 95 confidence intervals of the ensemble results are reported based on the 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles of the 5 000 realizations equation 2 describes two end member mixing using an isotopic system with distinct compositions for each end member however many hydrologic situations are more complex and involve mixtures of more than two end members in these situations the use of a single isotope system may not be sufficient to discriminate between multiple end members recent studies evaluated simple three end member mixing using the two independent u and sr isotope systems to determine contributions of different hydrologic sources with distinct radiogenic isotope signatures drexler et al 2014 paces and wurster 2014 we follow this general approach in lower hyalite canyon where we consider whether inmixing of archean gneiss derived water can explain the observed isotopic values 3 results 3 1 u and sr concentrations concentrations of dissolved sr and u in the main stem of hyalite creek tend to increase downstream as elevation decreases table 3 fig 3 a concentrations of sr increase from 0 02 to 0 03 mg l 1 in the upper elevations of hyalite creek sites hy1 and hy2 to 0 04 0 05 mg l 1 at lower elevations sites hy5 and hy6 much of this increase occurs over the reach where the stream valley intersects mesozoic sedimentary rocks particularly from sites hy7 to hy10 further downstream hyalite creek intersects older geologic units including paleozoic carbonate rocks between sites hy10 and hy4 sr concentrations in the main stem remain more or less constant between 0 04 and 0 06 mg l 1 over this middle reach and into the lower reach which cuts through archean gneiss at sites hy14 hy15 hy5 and hy6 samples from tributary watersheds draining mesozoic and paleozoic sedimentary rocks tend to have higher and more variable sr concentrations 0 08 to 0 16 mg l 1 groundwater sampled from wells or springs hosted in the archean gneiss from hodgman s canyon gw2 and gw3 has sr concentrations similar to those of the lower reaches of hyalite creek 0 05 to 0 06 mg l the alluvial aquifer well sample at the mouth of hyalite canyon has a higher sr concentration 0 11 mg l 1 than samples of hyalite creek at the mountain front overall sr concentrations did not vary systematically among sampling dates at any given site concentrations of u followed trends similar to sr concentrations and generally increased with distance downstream in the main stem of hyalite creek table 3 fig 3b u concentrations varied between 0 005 and 0 015 μg l 1 at higher elevations sites hy1 and hy2 where hyalite creek drains tertiary volcanic rock again much of the longitudinal increase in concentration occurred in the middle elevations of hyalite creek sites hy7 to hy4 coinciding with the inflow of springs and tributaries that tend to have higher and more variable u concentrations 0 017 to 0 713 μg l 1 than the main stem 0 023 to 0 242 μg l 1 samples from a given site collected in february and august had similar u concentrations for most sites hy1 hy4 hy7 hy17 however concentrations of u in main stem samples from the lower elevations of hyalite creek hy5 hy6 were substantially higher in february 0 544 to 0 791 μg l 1 than in august 0 121 to 0 170 μg l 1 the groundwater from hodgman canyon wells sites gw2 and gw3 is presumed to reflect the influence of gneiss and had u concentrations in the range of 0 353 to 0 364 μg l 1 which was near the middle of the range observed in samples from sites hy5 and hy6 the upper alluvial fan well gw4 had a u concentration of 0 233 μg l 1 intermediate between those of february and august samples from hyalite creek at the mountain front 3 2 ca sr ratios ratios of ca sr along hyalite creek follow patterns similar to those observed for sr and u concentrations table 3 values in the main stem tend to gradually increase with distance downstream from values between 170 and 200 in upper hyalite creek sites hy1 and hy2 to values between 250 and 290 in the lower canyon hy5 and hy6 much of this shift occurs over the transition from areas underlain by tertiary volcanic rock to mesozoic sediments sites hy7 and hy9 values continue to increase in the middle elevations of the main stem between sites hy10 and hy14 reflecting inputs from paleozoic carbonate units in this reach ca sr values remain constant as the main stem cuts through archean gneiss sites hy15 hy5 and hy6 although some seasonal variation between february and august sampling events is notable in lower canyon samples tributary samples at middle elevations show greater variability both higher and lower values in contrast to main stem water archean gneiss wells sites gw2 and gw3 have high ca sr ratios of 321 and 467 the well in the alluvial fan aquifer at the mouth of hyalite canyon also has a much higher ca sr value 383 than samples of hyalite creek water at the mountain front 249 297 trends in alkalinity are similar to those in ca sr table 3 with higher values in tributaries draining mesozoic and paleozoic sedimentary rock units and gradually increasing values in main stem samples downstream of confluences with tributaries draining sedimentary rock units none of the sites demonstrated systematic variations in ca sr among sampling dates 3 3 sr isotope ratios 87sr 86sr inflections in 87sr 86sr values along the main stem of hyalite creek also align with transitions in parent bedrock along the valley tables 2 and 3 fig 4 values for 87sr 86sr range from 0 70883 to 0 70921 in the upper reaches draining tertiary volcanic bedrock sites hy1 and hy2 87sr 86sr ratios in main stem samples decrease to values of 0 70853 to 0 70871 below hyalite reservoir site hy7 through areas draining mesozoic and paleozoic marine mudstones shales and limestones at intermediate elevations sites hy9 through hy11 tributaries and springs along this reach sites hy3 hy16 and hy17 contribute somewhat lower 87sr 86sr values ranging from 0 70835 to 0 70859 tributaries draining sub basins containing mixtures of paleozoic sediments sites hy13 and hy12 and archean gneiss site hy8 have elevated 87sr 86sr values ranging from 0 70893 to 0 71181 main stem samples have 87sr 86sr values that increase marginally through this reach where bedrock transitions from paleozoic sedimentary rock to archean gneiss to values of 0 70866 to 0 70885 unlike sr concentrations 87sr 86sr values for sites at higher or middle elevations showed minimal differences among sample dates main stem samples in the lower reach of hyalite creek have higher 87sr 86sr values ranging from 0 70973 to 0 71202 coinciding with the intersection of the valley with archean gneiss bedrock sites hy5 and hy6 fig 4 groundwater samples from wells in the archean gneiss sites gw2 and gw3 have substantially higher 87sr 86sr compositions of 0 73687 and 0 74497 table 3 in addition 87sr 86sr in main stem samples from sites in lower hyalite canyon hy5 and hy6 show substantial variation among sample dates with the highest values observed in february during the lowest flows and the lowest values observed in august during somewhat higher flows overall range of 0 70973 to 0 71202 furthermore 87sr 86sr values in samples of main stem water at the canyon mouth site hy6 were consistently higher than water sampled upstream site hy5 during each sampling campaign values of 87sr 86sr in august streamflow at hy6 were much lower than those measured in the june 2017 sample of well water from the alluvial fan near the mouth of the canyon site gw4 values of 0 71007 to 0 70998 versus 0 71221 respectively however the elevated 87sr 86sr value for hy6 streamflow sampled in february 2016 0 71202 was similar to gw4 groundwater 3 4 uranium activity ratios 234u 238u samples of hyalite creek headwaters sites hy1 and hy2 as well as water from immediately below hyalite reservoir hy7 have relatively low and uniform 234u 238u values ranging from 1 59 to 1 72 table 3 fig 5 in contrast water discharging from the madison aquifer at sites hy16 and hy17 has much higher 234u 238u values of 5 23 and 5 29 values for 234u 238u in stream water increase to between 2 94 and 3 20 over the intermediate elevations where the hyalite creek valley intersects madison aquifer bedrock sites hy10 and hy11 and the reach immediately downstream sites hy4 hy14 hy15 water from tributary watersheds draining sedimentary rocks along the same reach sites hy3 hy12 hy13 and hy8 shows a wide range of 234u 238u values from 1 50 to 2 69 main stem samples of lower hyalite creek sites hy5 and hy6 have distinctly lower 234u 238u values 1 69 to 2 13 relative to those at intermediate elevations reflecting a progressive decrease as hyalite creek cuts through archean gneiss values of 234u 238u in lower hyalite creek are similar to those in groundwater sampled from wells drilled in archean gneiss gw2 and gw3 1 85 and 1 49 differences in 234u 238u at a given site are only apparent at sites hy4 hy5 and hy6 february samples from site hy4 displayed higher 234u 238u values than august samples while february samples from sites hy5 and hy6 displayed lower 234u 238u values compared to august samples values of 234u 238u in lower hyalite creek are also comparable to those in groundwater sampled from alluvium along the mountain front near the mouth of hyalite canyon gw4 1 78 3 5 estimates of fractional groundwater contributions variations in isotopic ratios across the full sample set were evaluated in 87sr 86sr vs 234u 238u space as a mixture of three end members defined by compositions derived from water rock interactions with archean gneiss madison group limestones and absaroka volcanics fig 6 progression of hyalite creek sr and u isotopic ratios within the curved space defined by mixing models between the three end members provides a graphic perspective on the cumulative influence of aquifers with distance downstream concentrations of binary mixtures equation 1 will result in fractional contributions f that are distributed equally along a straight line between end member compositions however isotopic compositions of binary mixtures depend on both concentrations and isotope ratios of both end members equation 2 as a result the end member with the higher concentration more strongly influences the isotopic ratio of the mixture if concentrations of the end members are not equal this nonlinearity results in a hyperbolic mixing curve with non equal spacings of fractional contributions when isotopic ratios are plotted faure and mensing 2004 mixing end members are represented by 1 average values for samples from upper hyalite creek that have interacted mainly with absaroka volcanics and cretaceous siliciclastic sediments sites hy1 hy2 hy3 hy7 and hy9 characterized by low 87sr 86sr and 234u 238u values 2 madison aquifer spring water hy16 hy17 characterized by low 87sr 86sr and high 234u 238u values and 3 well water drawn from archean gneiss gw2 gw3 characterized by high 87sr 86sr and low 234u 238u values we used these end member values to define a mixing web where we then plotted sample isotopic compositions fig 6 loads of sr and u in the upper reaches of hyalite creek are presumed to be derived primarily from interactions with eocene absaroka volcanic rocks hence the use of their average 87sr 86sr and 234u 238u compositions to define the volcanic end member the isotopic composition of main stem stream waters at intermediate elevations differs from the eocene volcanic end member primarily in 234u 238u and diverges from the volcanic end member along a binary mixing curve defined by eocene volcanic and madison aquifer end members the lower boundary of the ternary mixing web in fig 6 mixing relations between these two end members suggest that groundwater from the madison aquifer contributes about 4 of stream flow at intermediate elevations along hyalite creek where the hyalite creek valley intersects archean gneiss bedrock 87sr 86sr values in main stem samples increase and 234u 238u values decrease groundwater in archean gneiss has low 234u 238u values similar to water associated with eocene volcanic rock but much higher 87sr 86sr values than water associated with eocene volcanic rock i e from a more radiogenic source compositions of main stem water at lower elevations progressively diverge from the volcanic madison limb of the mixing web fig 6 this divergence trends towards the gneiss end member and away from the madison end member in three end member space when stream flows were lowest in february main stem samples closest to the mouth of the canyon hy5 and hy6 approach the binary mixing curve defined by eocene volcanics and archean gneiss left boundary of mixing web based on models of mixing between the three end members streamflow at the mouth of hyalite canyon hy6 during february sampling was composed of up to 6 water influenced by archean bedrock with very little signature left from water influenced by madison limestones i e less than 1 contribution two component mixing relations were also evaluated using a monte carlo uncertainty analysis of optimized mixing models providing perspective on the degree to which groundwater aquifers are likely contributing to hyalite creek at two locations along the canyon and during two seasons fig 7 ewing et al 2020 groundwater contributions from the madison aquifer hy16 hy17 with elevated 234u 238u values 5 21 5 29 and low 87sr 86sr values 0 70835 0 70836 cause a shift of compositions in main stem samples between upstream hy7 and downstream hy10 sites from 1 62 to 2 96 for 234u 238u and from 0 70870 to 0 70860 for 87sr 86sr based on the ensemble of mixing optimizations for net gains over this reach fig 7a ewing et al 2020 we estimate that the madison group limestone aquifers contributed approximately 3 7 of the streamflow at site hy10 during baseflow conditions in august 2017 reported as the median of the ensemble with a 95 confidence interval of 0 3 to 8 7 a two end member mixing model was also used to access contributions from the archean gneiss aquifer during baseflow conditions in august 2017 and february 2017 fig 7b and c ewing et al 2020 for the august 2017 model average values from sites hy14 and hy15 are assumed to represent the end member at the upstream end of the mixing reach with higher 234u 238u values 2 94 to 3 05 and lower 87sr 86sr values 0 70874 to 0 70885 relative to the downstream end of the mixing reach at site hy5 isotopic ratios for the archean aquifer end member estimated from wells gw2 and gw3 have 234u 238u values of 1 49 to 1 85 and 87sr 86sr values of 0 73687 to 0 74497 mixing of main stem flow with groundwater or runoff inputs over the reach resulted in downstream isotopic ratios at hy5 of 2 13 for 234u 238u and 0 70973 for 87sr 86sr the ensemble of mixing optimizations for these reaches suggests that the archean aquifers contributed approximately 10 9 of the streamflow at site hy5 during baseflow conditions in august 2017 reported as the median of ensemble with 95 confidence interval of 7 4 to 16 2 fig 7b ewing et al 2020 however the isotopic compositions of the downstream site fall outside the ensemble of the mixing models hy5 indicating that sr and u isotopes are providing conflicting information about the contribution of the two purported end members for the february 2017 model the sample from middle hyalite creek at site hy4 located below the main influx of water from the madison aquifer and above the exposed gneiss was used as the upstream end member because sites hy14 and hy15 were not sampled on that date for the mixture site hy6 was used instead of hy5 as site hy5 was not sampled in february of 2017 compared to hy14 and hy15 on other dates hy4 in february 2017 has a higher 234u 238u value 3 01 and lower 87sr 86sr value 0 70868 consistent with madison influence the same gneiss end member gw2 and gw3 was used in the february 2017 model as simulated in august the influence of gneiss groundwater would decrease the 234u 238u value and increase the 87sr 86sr value of hyalite creek which is consistent with the decreased 234u 238u value of 1 75 and increased 87sr 86sr value of 0 71112 observed at site hy6 we therefore model hy6 as a mixture between 1 waters of middle hyalite creek hy4 and 2 water derived from the archean gneiss as represented by gw2 and gw3 fig 7c using these values in our mixing optimization we estimate that fracture flow from the archean gneiss contributes a median of 24 2 95 confidence interval 14 3 to 37 5 fig 7c and ewing et al 2020 of streamflow to lower hyalite creek hy6 during february baseflow conditions however the sr and u isotope ratios again provide conflicting information about end member contributions using the same monte carlo realization and optimization model we also evaluated the sr data alone as an indicator of archean gneiss influence without including u data this approach is based on the sensitive response of this tracer to the archean endmember using only sr isotopic composition and concentration data we estimate that a median of 2 4 95 confidence interval 1 6 to 4 1 of water in lower hyalite creek can be attributed to inflows from the archean gneiss over the targeted reach during baseflow conditions in august and a median of 8 4 95 confidence interval of 4 9 to 14 6 of water can be attributed to archean gneiss inflows in february see ewing et al 2020 absolute fluxes of water relative to measured discharge at the downstream gauge sites can also be estimated from mixing model results given the percentage estimates calculated in the preceding paragraphs additions to main stem streamflow from archean sources are estimated at 0 17 m3 s 1 or 11 of the total 1 57 m3 s 1 measured at site hy6 in august 2017 a similar influx of 0 14 m3 s 1 is estimated for february 2017 data 24 of 0 60 m3 s 1 if the sr results alone are used estimated inflows are 0 038 m3 s 1 2 4 in august and 0 050 m3 s 1 8 4 in february 2017 additions to streamflow from madison sources in the middle reaches of hyalite creek are estimated at 0 04 m3 s 1 or 3 7 of the total 1 14 m3 s 1 measured at site hy7 in august 2017 the longitudinal assay of 222rn activities indicates more widespread groundwater influence than our geochemical indicators specific to the madison and archean waters fig 8 positive nonzero values indicate subsurface inflows older than days to weeks which are evident at all sites other than hy7 the location of hy7 just below hyalite reservoir provides a measure of water that is completely degassed as expected groundwater inflows hy16 and hy17 mid elevation tributaries hy3 and hy8 and the high elevation main stem site hy1 all have comparable 222rn levels 20 40 pci l 1 suggesting that our quantitative point measures provide snapshots of host specific older groundwater influence that is only a portion of the groundwater spectrum influencing streamflow 4 discussion longitudinal evaluation of ca sr u and rn dissolved in stream and ground waters provide a multifaceted means of assessing the nature of baseflow generation along hyalite canyon data in this study track the compositional evolution of streamflow caused by contributions from groundwater or tributary flow that reflect weathering of soils and rocks of varying lithology allowing useful hydrologic inferences for local streamflow generation throughout the hyalite creek watershed 4 1 values for 87sr 86sr in regional rocks and waters previous studies have determined 87sr 86sr values for a number of rock units and streams in the region table 2 these values provide constraints on how variations in lithology across the hyalite creek watershed are likely to influence 87sr 86sr values observed in stream flow the range of 87sr 86sr values that we observed in hyalite canyon waters 0 7089 0 7450 is consistent with the variety of host rock units present though mixing processes likely restrict these values relative to primary source waters tertiary eocene absaroka volcanic rocks similar to those present in hyalite canyon smedes and prostka 1972 are dominated by mafic to intermediate compositions with relatively low rb sr and measured 87sr 86sr values ranging from 0 70433 to 0 70826 hiza 1999 feeley and cosca 2003 lindsay and feeley 2003 values for 87sr 86sr ranging from 0 7072 to 0 7078 were reported for eocene absaroka volcanics east of the hyalite area hiza 1999 waters draining eocean aged absaroka volcanics in the nearby clark s fork of the yellowstone drainage have 87sr 86sr values in the range of 0 704 to 0 705 horton et al 1999 more precise values not provided older paleozoic aged carbonate sedimentary rocks in the greater yellowstone national park region have a higher average 87sr 86sr value of 0 71062 kharaka et al 1991 moore nall 2016 reported an average 87sr 86sr value of 0 708834 for madison group limestones in the pryor mountains 300 km east of the gallatin range and frost and toner 2004 reported a range of 0 70873 to 0 70926 for 87sr 86sr values in madison rocks and waters in the big horn basin of wyoming in contrast much older archean granites and gneisses including those in the neighboring beartooth mountains exhibit variable and substantially higher present day 87sr 86sr values reflecting highly variable rb sr ratios within mineral phases comprising the rock and long time periods of 87sr ingrowth measured 87sr 86sr values for a variety of archean age rock types n 84 from the eastern and southern beartooth mountains had a median value of 0 76177 montgomery and lytwyn 1984 wooden and mueller 1988 water draining precambrian granitic gneiss in the clark s fork basin yielded approximate 87sr 86sr values of 0 721 to 0 732 horton et al 1999 although rock analysis was not undertaken as part of this study published data corroborate assumptions made about the 87sr 86sr compositions in primary rock types present in hyalite canyon table 2 acknowledging that differential mineral weatherability may explain some differences in waters as compared to source rocks for expected 234u 238u values there are less published data however unaltered eocene to archean age rocks are all assumed to have 234u 238u values close to secular equilibrium equal to 1 00 regardless of lithology although readily soluble secondary phases within soils in the region may have somewhat higher values typically less than about 1 6 sharp et al 2003 groundwaters will have more elevated 234u 238u values depending on aquifer character and substrate weatherability bourdon et al 2003 thus the range of 234u 238u values observed 1 506 5 285 can be interpreted as a range of transport conditions and substrate interactions 4 2 origins of headwater compositions streamflow generated from groundwater in the headwaters of hyalite and emerald creeks is derived primarily through water rock interaction with eocene volcanic rocks accordingly sr and u concentrations ca sr ratio and alkalinity were low in higher elevation waters draining the absaroka volcanics likely due to igneous rocks that are less calcareous and more resistant to weathering as well as lower temperatures that are less conducive to chemical alteration values of 87sr 86sr in water draining tertiary volcanic rocks in the upper reaches of hyalite creek sites hy1 and hy2 are somewhat higher than values reported for whole rock digestions in the literature this is likely a consequence of volcanic rocks in the gallatin range being part of the older washburn group smedes and prostka 1972 which tend to have higher 87sr 86sr values median of 0 70725 lindsay and feely 2003 0 7072 0 7078 hiza 1999 than younger rocks in the absaroka supergroup moreover magmas associated with early eruptions in the volcanic field may have assimilated crustal components with elevated 87sr 86sr values before chambers and conduits become well established in addition leaching of rock and soil by water will preferentially extract sr from the most weatherable minerals which are not likely to have remained in equilibrium with the bulk rock over the 50 million years since formation water may preferentially leach phases with elevated rb sr resulting in groundwater or runoff with higher 87sr 86sr values regardless of cause the similarity of 87sr 86sr values for streamflow samples draining two separate volcanic rock headwater basins upper hyalite creek hy1 and emerald creek hy2 fig 1 suggest that stream flow draining subwatersheds dominated by absaroka bedrock is well characterized with a mean value of 0 70889 in the hyalite creek watershed 0 00008 2 standard deviation sd for n 7 excluding 1 outlier lower 234u 238u values in the steeper subwatersheds in upper hyalite creek hy1 and in the emerald creek tributary hy2 suggest more aggressive weathering of u from soils during recharge or relatively rapid communication of meteoric water to the stream fig 5 4 3 baseflow contributions from tributaries and aquifers draining sedimentary rocks concentrations of sr and u ca sr ratio and alkalinity generally increased in the middle elevations of hyalite creek above 1800 m consistent with baseflow contributions from relatively solute rich groundwater in sedimentary bedrock units that drain to hyalite creek via tributaries or subsurface flow fig 3 relative to baseflow derived from absaroka volcanics tributaries draining aquifers in more weatherable limestones and shales are likely to contribute ion loads to the main stem that are disproportionate to their contribution to flow horton et al 1999 jacobson et al 2002 2003 more specifically tributaries draining aquifers in sedimentary bedrock are more likely to contain secondary carbonates or other ca rich secondary phases with elevated ca sr values consequently inputs to streamflow along the intermediate elevations of the valley appear to be relatively minor compared to upstream flow generation but likely contribute substantial ion loading to hyalite creek the middle reaches of hyalite creek drain an area dominated by mesozoic and paleozoic sedimentary rocks main stem samples sites hy7 hy9 hy10 and hy11 show a distinct decrease in 87sr 86sr values mean value of 0 70862 0 00013 2 sd for n 7 interpreted to reflect addition of sr from marine sources streamflow from lick creek draining mostly mesozoic clastic sediments hy3 and groundwater discharging from the madison aquifer sites hy16 and hy17 have lower 87sr 86sr values mean 87sr 86sr values of 0 70849 and 0 70835 respectively than those in main stem flow at the same elevation fig 4 this relation is consistent with addition of sr from marine sources which had primary 87sr 86sr between 0 7068 and 0 7082 through most of the mesozoic and paleozoic eras mcarthur et al 2001 in contrast tributary streamflow draining a small subwatershed of volcanic rock in this reach meadow creek site hy13 has a higher 87sr 86sr value of 0 70893 similar to values draining volcanic rocks in headwater areas contributions to hyalite creek from aquifers in madison group limestones are evident from the notable increases in 234u 238u values at intermediate elevations fig 5 springs issuing from the madison group limestones hy16 and hy17 have elevated 234u 238u values consistent with water that has had more extensive contact time with matrix materials thus allowing greater incorporation of recoil 234u from aquifer rock surfaces the large changes in 234u 238u values observed in main stem samples from sites hy10 and hy11 are coupled with only small changes in u concentration and discharge consistent with inflows having similar u concentrations but substantial enrichment in 234u elevated 234u 238u values are present in main stem samples well downstream from the contact with the madison group limestones suggesting the possibility of continued influx from related karst aquifers or reflecting the conservative nature of uranyl complexes in the dissolved load decreasing values of 87sr 86sr in main stem samples below hyalite reservoir through this reach may be derived as a consequence of either tributary additions or gains from aquifer discharge however the large increase in 234u 238u values is interpreted to be diagnostic of groundwater influxes from laterally continuous aquifers such as those developed in madison group limestones equally elevated 234u 238u values are not observed in surface flow from tributaries in the same reach sites hy13 hy12 and hy8 although values are higher than those in tributary flow above the madison outcrop hy3 and may indicate a contribution from madison group limestone aquifers or other geochemically mature groundwater as well in support of the influence of diverse groundwaters in both upper and middle elevation inflows 222rn concentrations were consistently elevated in upper hyalite hy1 as well as lick and moser tributaries hy3 hy8 below the madison inflows fig 8 indicating influence of geochemically distinct and possibly younger inflows that were not discernable with u and sr tracers based on u and sr isotope results mixing models suggest that approximately 4 of water in hyalite creek at hy10 95 confidence of 0 3 to 8 7 can be attributed to groundwater from the madison group limestones entering via the subsurface somewhere below site hy7 between elevations of 1962 m and 1909 m fig 7a ewing et al 2020 while the generation of baseflow from aquifers in the madison group limestones is modest in hyalite creek relative to upstream contributions values of 234u 238u provide a sensitive indicator of the influence of storage in this important regional limestone aquifer although snowpack was particularly low in february 2017 71 of average based on the lick creek snotel broader evaluation of the inflow rate requires knowing how prior years influenced recharge of this aquifer 4 4 contribution from archean gneiss fracture flow baseflow generation from groundwater influenced by archean gneiss is evident from progressive increases in 87sr 86sr values and decreases in 234u 238u values with distance downstream in the lower elevations of hyalite canyon these isotopic changes are consistent with downstream evolution of main stem water towards an endmember defined by wells completed in the archean gneiss bedrock gw2 and gw3 isotopic compositions near the canyon outlet hy5 and hy6 show differences between august and february that can be explained by seasonal differences in flow whereby the same volume of inflow has a greater influence during lower flow in february substantially higher 87sr 86sr values in february relative to august fig 4 table 3 suggest that contributions from gneiss were proportionally greater during winter than during summer to a degree that is consistent with changes in flow values of 234u 238u also show systematic differences between february and august samples fig 5 that are consistent with greater contributions from sources with shorter flow paths or more intensive weathering of source rock in winter this could reflect changes in the gneiss derived inflow or influence of inflows from a distinct lithologic source based on longitudinal patterns in isotopic composition the largest influxes of water from gneiss sources appear to occur downstream from site hy15 at elevations between 1729 and 1707 fig 4 a shear zone traversing the valley just below 1729 m may 1985 may represent a region of preferential groundwater flow if baseflow gains are derived from groundwater discharging from fractured gneiss 234u 238u values suggest a very different type of water rock interaction compared to flow in aquifers hosted by madison group limestones low 234u 238u values imply relatively short range connectivity such that preferential incorporation of recoil 234u generated along fracture surfaces is not sufficient to increase 234u 238u values beyond those expected after infiltration through soils despite assuming a large uncertainty for the gneiss end member in mixing models of the lower end of the canyon the monte carlo realizations of the mixing models and inferred mixing fractions failed to capture the compositions measured in lower hyalite creek mixtures hy5 hy6 fig 7 b and c the conflicting information from sr and u data has two possible explanations first compositions in well water samples may not accurately reflect the gneiss end member which might have lower 234u 238u values and u concentrations that are seasonally variable second inflows from an end member not included in the model may be affecting hyalite creek following the first possible explanation the shifting character of apparent inflows in lower hyalite canyon in february relative to august could reflect changing flow regimes through the fractured gneiss fig 6 periods of winter snowmelt on hillslopes above the lower elevations of hyalite creek may enhance translatory flow that alters pathways of stream flow generation from archean gneiss bedrock at lower elevations similar seasonal differences in local streamflow gains were not observed at other sampling sites suggesting this process may be limited to lower elevations with greater relative inputs of water during winter melt periods alternatively if seasonal variation reflects inflows from a distinct end member this end member would need to have a lower 87sr 86sr and 234u 238u composition somewhat similar to volcanic rocks found in the upper reaches of hyalite creek return of water derived from such rock units could be delivered by water movement through glacial till throughout the middle reaches of hyalite canyon but this explanation appears physically unlikely given that return flow from the glacial till would likely be contributing to hyalite creek well upstream fig 1 alternately runoff over volcanic colluvium originating from ridge tops in the lower canyon may influence geochemical composition and this contribution would likely be small we also note that higher u concentrations and intermediate 87sr 86sr composition in lower canyon samples collected in february are reasonably consistent with contributions from sedimentary tributaries in the middle canyon figs 3 4 6 and these sedimentary units are exposed at lower elevations in the next major canyon to the west south cottonwood thus we conclude that an additional contribution from water influenced by contact with distinct rock units likely associated with transient runoff dynamics cannot be ruled out as a plausible additional endmember in lower hyalite canyon despite the intriguing uncertainty about the specific character of archean waters directly contributing to lower hyalite our data as a whole support the notion that is this setting 87sr 86sr values offer the more sensitive indicator of archean gneiss influence accordingly our data document persistent and steady inflows from the archean gneiss during baseflow conditions in august and february 2017 regardless of mixing model uncertainties 234u 238u and 87sr 86sr data were critical to detection of baseflow contributions from different weathering components present in lower elevations of the watershed because solute concentrations and ca sr ratios were unable to identify inflow from a unique end member measures of 222rn in the lower canyon hy5 hy6 support interpretations of groundwater inflows though measured concentrations 10 pci l 1 are somewhat lower than in the middle elevation tributaries 5 conclusions this study shows that longitudinal surveys of natural geochemical tracers and their isotopic composition can provide valuable information about groundwater sources storage potential and baseflow generation along stream valleys we used 87sr 86sr and 234u 238u values as sensitive indicators of distinct groundwater inflows in a lithologically diverse catchment longitudinal 222rn assays corroborate more extensive and likely younger groundwater inflows radiogenic sr and u isotopic ratios were critical to identifying and quantifying contributions from older baseflow generation that would otherwise have been invisible based on elemental concentrations alone moreover longitudinal sampling allows a spatially explicit perspective on where groundwater sources occur in the catchment that would likely have been overlooked if assessed at coarser scales or only at the watershed outlet longitudinal sampling also allowed application of both general and localized mixing models that used combinations of tracer concentrations and isotope ratios to quantify the fractional contributions from groundwater sources using these models we estimate that groundwater contribution from the madison aquifers represents about 4 of streamflow in the middle reaches of hyalite creek and that groundwater discharging from fractured archean gneiss supplies 2 of local streamflow during the august baseflow period and 8 of local streamflow during the february baseflow period these inflows are a subset of total groundwater contributions that are evident in 222rn measures reflecting likely diversity of apparent age this research elucidates groundwater contributions to streamflow along hyalite canyon an important water resource for agricultural and metropolitan uses in the gallatin valley and analogously in intermountain basins of the region urban areas in intermountain basins are expanding at the same time that snowpack storage is predicated to decrease due to changes in climate patterns our results provide a perspective on baseflow generation along hyalite creek that likely represents the delayed contribution of higher elevation snowpack over interannual to decadal time scales this work sheds light on the nature of aquifer specific contributions to baseflow in a mountain headwater stream that provides municipal agricultural and ecological water supply similar to many mountain water supplies across the intermountain west this observation

4890,changing precipitation patterns are projected to reduce snowpack storage and late summer stream flows in mountain headwaters of the western united states ecosystems agriculture and municipalities depend on late summer flow in streams supplying water to the mountain front therefore improved understanding of groundwater storage contributions to mountain streams is increasingly important in this work we use 87sr 86sr ratios and 234u 238u activity ratios 234u 238u as indicators of water rock interaction contributing to runoff groundwater and surface subsurface hydrologic exchanges along hyalite creek a mountain headwater tributary within the upper missouri river basin main stem and tributary flow was sampled longitudinally from 2016 to 2018 focusing on presumed baseflow conditions in february and august changing stream chemistry of the main stem is associated with groundwater inflows from local springs discharging from madison group limestones and inputs of water from the archean gneiss exposed along the mountain front we use mixing models to estimate that locally in the stream reach traversing a spring outlet distinct inflows from the madison aquifer contribute 4 of streamflow during baseflow conditions contributions to streamflow by local inflows from archean gneiss varied seasonally with increases in 87sr 86sr values in hyalite creek that suggest contributions of 2 in august to 8 in february at the same time decreasing 234u 238u values indicate an otherwise undetected additional endmember and 222rn assays show that total inflows are likely more extensive our results reveal distinct groundwater contributions to streamflow from specific rock units within this mountain headwater system and elucidate pathways of mountain stream flow generation in lithologically diverse watersheds keywords mountain catchment groundwater uranium strontium geochemical tracer 1 introduction mountainous regions of the western united states face impending water management challenges given the combination of urban growth and water scarcity driven by projected changes in precipitation and snowpack dynamics knowles et al 2005 silverman et al 2013 the region supports both urban and rural communities that rely heavily on mountain headwaters for municipal and agricultural water supplies silverman and maneta 2016 hoylman et al 2018 these headwater catchments supply a majority of the water found in the rivers and aquifers of intermountain basins wilson and guan 2004 where more intensive human land and water use tends to occur however the nature and extent of groundwater storage influence on these mountain headwater contributions is generally poorly quantified leading to uncertainty in estimates of mountain headwater contributions to water resource availability during low flow conditions this study uses geochemical tracers to explore the longitudinal and temporal distribution of groundwater contributions to baseflow conditions in a mountain headwater stream focusing on a canyon within the upper missouri and gallatin river watersheds fig 1 we demonstrate that chemical and isotopic analyses of weathering products found in stream solute loads provide a useful tool for inferring groundwater contributions from different parts of the watershed this case study of a mountain headwaters process domain montgomery 1999 holds general insight for understanding the contribution of mountain headwater groundwater storage to intermountain basin communities and ecosystems and its likely relevance under low flow conditions and over time mountain headwaters are often characterized by steep mountain streams with fundamental control of geomorphologic development by lithology structural features tectonic regime fluvial erosion or deposition and glaciation amundson et al 2015 dixon et al 2016 weathering in higher elevation mountain headwater process domains is generally limited by relatively low temperatures and rapid mechanical erosion compared to lower elevation intermountain basin process domains as a result soils in mountain headwater catchments are generally thin and less developed in terms of mineral transformation and mass loss to chemical weathering furthermore high relief results in strong influence of hillslope aspect on the extent of substrate weathering hinckley et al 2014 and topography strongly influences seasonal precipitation and runoff mcguire et al 2005 jencso et al 2009 jencso and mcglynn 2011 emanuel et al 2014 along a mountain headwater valley stream water solutes reflect the exchanges between surface water and groundwater throughout the mountain headwaters payn et al 2009 these concomitant gains and losses of water along a stream result in longitudinal patterns of solute composition reflecting dilution and solute load inputs characteristic of transport of weathering products or lack thereof to the stream covino and mcglynn 2007 capell et al 2011 jasechko 2016 jasechko and kirchner 2016 yang et al 2017 thus mountain headwaters are key in controlling both streamflow and water quality water emerging at the mountain front provides a fingerprint of lithologies within the mountain catchment delivering it and patterns in water quality along the stream provide information about the spatial distribution of groundwater sources contributing to stream flow generation most work in mountain headwater watersheds has been focused on topographic controls on event flow contributions to streamflow mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 mcguire et al 2005 jencso and mcglynn 2011 the study of baseflow generation in mountain headwaters has received less attention particularly in snowmelt dominated systems soulsby and tetzlaff 2008 payn et al 2012 however changes in climate and the distribution of precipitation demand a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling variation in groundwater contributions to baseflow particularly in semi arid systems where water resource availability during dry seasons is a major concern soulsby and tetzlaff 2008 a first step to understanding the longer term storage that serves as a reservoir for baseflow is to identify the location and relative contribution from aquifers that contribute to lower stream flows across a catchment geochemical tracers of baseflow sourced by aquifers of varying size materials and residence times offer an opportunity to investigate a distinctive signal of groundwater contribution to streamflow often these tracers record a signal of both weathering and aquifer flowpath or transit time chabaux et al 2003 hogan and blum 2003 dosseto et al 2014 therefore the geochemical signal imparted on groundwater contributing to baseflow varies with the chemical composition age and weathering susceptibility of the aquifer rock or geomorphic units as lithology changes throughout the reach of a mountain stream and across the mountain front so does the cumulative geochemical fingerprint imparted on the water these fingerprints can allow baseflow at the outlet to be traced back to its host rock or sediment and allow longitudinal surveys of water quality at baseflow to reveal the location and relative contribution of discharge from specific aquifers to the stream this study uses 87sr 86sr and 234u 238u values square brackets denote activity ratio as natural geochemical tracers to investigate the sources and pathways of water contributing to streamflow during baseflow conditions over the past two decades many studies have used sr isotope ratios primarily 87sr 86sr but also 88sr 86sr to examine weathering sequences dust inputs and carbonate accumulation in rocks and soils bullen et al 1997 capo et al 1998 capo and chadwick 1999 hart et al 2004 chadwick et al 2009 white et al 2009 in surface water and groundwater systems 87sr 86sr data have been used to trace sources of soil and rock weathering inputs to stream geochemistry horton et al 1999 jacobson et al 2002 2003 frost and toner 2004 more recently u series isotopes notably 234u 238u have been used to examine processes of water rock interaction that rely on the balance between recoil effects that increase 234u 238u and bulk u dissolution that decreases 234u 238u bourdon et al 2003 chabaux et al 2003 dosseto et al 2008 depaolo et al 2006 water rock interactions with the different lithologies or flow paths present in the watershed have the potential to result in unique 87sr 86sr and 234u 238u isotopic signatures which may allow determination of multiple sources pathways and mixing relations among end members drexler et al 2014 paces and wurster 2014 both u and sr are readily soluble in oxidizing aqueous systems and their radiogenic isotopes are not affected substantially by mass dependent fractionation in near surface environments paces and wurster 2014 thus sr and u isotopes can potentially provide a precise and accurate fingerprint of water sources and hydrologic evolution roback et al 2001 faure and mensing 2005 ryu et al 2009 pierret et al 2014 paces et al 2015 together u and sr isotopic ratios provide a useful means of examining the influence of weathering processes water sources and the degree of water rock interaction on stream geochemistry using reactive transport modeling and end member mixing analysis approaches depaolo et al 2006 maher et al 2006 paces and wurster 2014 here we explore how aquifer contributions of spatiotemporally variable geochemical weathering products influence baseflow generation in a mountain headwater catchment using hyalite creek in southwestern montana as a case study hyalite creek is a steep glaciated mountain headwater stream with a watershed area of approximately 126 km2 draining into the intermountain basin and associated alluvial aquifer of the gallatin valley we use 234u 238u and 87sr 86sr values along with complementary 222rn activities to examine water flow and storage dynamics along the main stem of this mountain stream with a goal of characterizing a spatially explicit map of the influence of aquifers hosted in four lithologic units with distinct u and sr isotopic character and the resulting effects on water quality and supply at the watershed outlet this work reveals how baseflow and storage dynamics can vary across a catchment that includes lithologic units with variable chemical compositions ages and degrees of weatherability 2 methods 2 1 study area hyalite creek in southwestern montana traverses a number of bedrock lithologies providing a case study for assessing cumulative contributions of multiple geochemically diverse aquifers to baseflow along the canyon the study watershed is located in the north central gallatin mountain range and is a headwater catchment of the gallatin river fig 1 hyalite

sites table 1 were selected to represent potential contributions from rock units with distinct geochemical character fig 1 table 2 sampling sites included surface waters in hyalite creek and five tributaries hy1 through hy15 a spring and associated spring channel in the bank of hyalite creek hy16 and hy17 a well and associated cistern in neighboring hodgman canyon gw2 and gw3 and a well in the uppermost alluvial fan formed by hyalite creek at the mountain front gw4 fig 1 surface waters were sampled in february and august 2016 2018 when baseflow conditions were presumed to dominate stream flow generation based on hydrograph levels we started with six primary surface water sites along hyalite creek in 2016 targeting delineation of waters influenced by the major lithologic units hy1 through hy6 labeled sequentially with decreasing elevation we expanded the number of sites between 2016 and 2018 based on identification of reaches with notable longitudinal changes in chemistry and their potential end member contributors ultimately sample sites included ten main stem locations in order of decreasing elevation hy1 hy7 hy9 hy10 hy11 hy4 hy14 hy15 hy5 hy6 five tributaries hy2 hy3 hy12 hy13 hy8 two springs hy16 hy17 three wells gw2 gw3 gw4 and one neighboring stream sourdough creek also known as bozeman creek in the next major valley to the east sd1 table 1 fig 1 two sampling locations were co located at sites with continuous stream gauges along hyalite creek site hy7 is co located with a montana department of natural resources and conservation gauge dnrc number 41h 2000 downstream of hyalite reservoir and hy6 is co located with a u s geological survey gauge usgs number 06050000 located at the mouth of hyalite canyon table 1 fig 1 hydrographs from these two gauges depict a snowmelt dominated hydrologic regime fig 2 with flows ranging from 0 18 to 5 34 m3 s 1 at the dnrc gauge hy7 and from 0 48 to 7 51 m3 s 1 at the usgs gauge hy6 during the sampling period from 2016 to 2018 hydrographs show how our sampling events align with lower flow conditions fig 2 note log scale where august sampling dates reflect low summer flows and february sampling dates reflect low winter flows on a given sampling date flow in the main stem of hyalite creek increased between the two gauges at sites hy7 and hy6 on 2 19 2016 from 0 34 to 0 55 m3 s 1 net gain of 0 21 m3 s 1 or a 62 increase on 8 24 2016 from 1 40 to 1 65 m3 s 1 net gain of 0 25 m3 s 1 or a 18 increase and on 8 23 2017 from 1 14 to 1 57 m3 s 1 net gain of 0 43 m3 s 1 or a 38 increase gauge data were not available for hy7 during the 2 4 2017 sampling due to interference from freezing thus net gains in discharge between hy7 and hy6 were similar in absolute volume between february and august but those gains represent a proportionally larger fraction of stream flow during february due to lower flow conditions in general hyalite creek traverses a range of lithologic units known to have distinct geochemical character table 2 from the highest sample site at 3140 m above sea level to the lowest site near the mountain front at an elevation of 1690 m above sea level fig 1 berg et al 1999 2000 vuke et al 2002 2007 kellogg and williams 2006 specific contributions of rock weathering products to hyalite creek water will depend on differential mineral weatherability however the general range of 87sr 86sr values observed for these lithologies is substantial enough to use 87sr 86sr data to fingerprint water rock interactions uppermost hyalite creek 3140 2100 m elevation is underlain by eocene aged

include within run uncertainties and external error based on replicate analyses of standards results for 87sr 86sr measured in srst 221 processed at msu and swirl are identical within reported analytical uncertainty 2 4 isotope ratio and elemental ratio interpretation we interpret the sr isotope ratio as reflecting the isotopic character of weathered materials in contact with surface and groundwater providing information about the mineralogical content and age of that weathered material differences in 87sr 86sr in rocks and minerals depend on the isotopic composition of sr at the time the rock formed as well as its rb sr and age water interacting with solid materials during recharge and flow dissolves some of that sr and incorporates the 87sr 86sr ratio present in the lithologic source without significant isotopic fractionation however differences in weatherability of individual mineral components with variable rb sr may result in a range of 87sr 86sr values that reflect preferential dissolution of particular phases white et al 2005 négrel et al 2004 pierret et al 2014 barbieri et al 2005 along with 87sr 86sr values ca sr mass ratios provide additional context for examining weathering and interaction of substrate and water hogan and blum 2003 both sr and ca are divalent group 2 alkaline earth metals of similar size therefore they react similarly allowing sr to substitute readily for ca in mineral lattices during precipitation of carbonate minerals ca is preferentially incorporated into the crystal lattice increasing the ca sr in the solid and decreasing the ca sr in remaining water white et al 2005 we interpret the u activity ratios as reflecting the balance between preferential dissolution of 234u derived from alpha decay of the parent isotope 238u and bulk dissolution of u with from rock matrix that has a 234u 238u near unity this balance in turn is a function of the water rock interaction and integrates residence time flow path length chemical aggressiveness of weathering processes and the ratio of exposed rock surface area to ambient volume of water in rocks and minerals older than about 1 ma 234u abundances reach a state of radioactive secular equilibrium with 238u meaning that the growth and decay of 234u become balanced with decay of 238u half life of 4 47 109 years such that levels of radioactivity rates of decay for both isotopes are equal and the ratio of their activities equals unity that is 234u 238u 1 00 bourdon et al 2003 radioactive disequilibrium is a consequence of water rock interaction where alpha recoil occurring in the solid phase increases the susceptibility of 234u to leaching relative to 238u resulting in 234u 238u values greater than one in the aqueous phase the degree of 234u 238u disequilibrium is a function of u concentration particle surface area water rock ratios chemical reactivity and time depaolo et al 2006 maher et al 2006 higher 234u 238u values reflect low water rock ratios longer flow paths allowing more exposure to recoil 234u or greater mineral surface areas interacting with a given volume of water bourdon et al 2003 chabaux et al 2003 suksi et al 2006 dosseto et al 2008 depaolo et al 2012 however increases in 234u 238u values are limited by rates of weathering and bulk rock dissolution which drive 234u 238u values back towards unity maher et al 2006 isotopes of sr and u allow identification of end members because their ratios are usually not affected by dilution or near surface physical or chemical processes other than those of interest here paces and wurster 2014 one exception to this could be contexts where reducing conditions favor loss of dissolved u6 to precipitation with reduction to u4 such as in a wet meadow environment rich in organic matter where water flow is slowed this loss of u could lead to erroneously low estimation of contribution from an endmember characterized upgradient of such an environment and might be evident in skewed concentration relationships thus care must be taken to appropriately characterize end members acknowledge geomorphic context and recognize effects of u loss through chemical reduction in hyalite canyon these wet meadow environments occur in the glaciated middle and upper reaches of the canyon above hy4 one spring fed wet meadow was sampled at site hy13 as a complement to these primary geochemical measures we used 222rn activities to qualitatively establish the broader range of subsurface inflows to hyalite creek hoehn et al 1992 concentrations of 222rn reflect the 238u decay series in the form of this short lived intermediate with a half life of 3 8 days this short half life allows quantification of residence times from days to weeks in groundwater schubert et al 2006 whereas older groundwater will simply be equilibrated with 222rn efflux in the aquifer because rn is a noble gas air water exchange rapidly depletes concentrations in surface water making detection of elevated 222rn a useful tracer of all groundwater inflows older than days gardner et al 2011 2 5 data interpretation we interpreted patterns in stream flow generation from groundwater aquifers along hyalite creek first by examining the longitudinal patterns in chemical and isotope characterizations with decreasing elevation and distance downstream longitudinal analysis allowed consideration of how geologic structures geomorphology and lithology influence the character of stream flow generation and surface subsurface water interaction gardner et al 2011 this sampling strategy allowed us to construct mixing models that quantify fractional inputs of groundwater to reaches of hyalite creek where geochemical data indicated notable influence of a given aquifer two mixing analyses were performed to estimate the fraction of stream flow that could be attributed to chemically distinguishable aquifers along hyalite canyon a binary mixture m can be calculated from concentrations c isotopic ratios r and fractional contributions f from each of two end members in this case the two end members are the water at the upstream end of a reach a and the water contributed from a given groundwater source along the reach b that together constitute the mixture m at the downstream end of the reach faure and mensing 2005 arendt et al 2015 1 c m c a f a c b f b 2 r m r a f a c a c m r b f b c b c m where f a f b 1 here we identify hydrologic end members and evaluate mixtures of end members defined by sr concentration 87sr 86sr u concentration and 234u 238u so eqs 1 and 2 were repeated for sr and u and solved simultaneously rather than evaluate the entire stream system we used the binary mixing model and monte carlo analysis to estimate groundwater inputs to hyalite creek over two reaches where groundwater inputs from two distinctive aquifers karst flow in madison group limestones and fracture flow in archean gneiss are particularly likely to influence stream compositions while there are numerous tributaries and other small inputs of water to hyalite creek we refined our sampling to capture the two distinct reaches of hyalite creek where groundwater inputs from these sources can be quantified without the potentially confounding effects of surface inflow the upper to middle elevations of hyalite creek were characterized as a two end member mixture between surface water discharging from hyalite creek below hyalite reservoir site hy7 1962 m representing water having interacted with clastic sedimentary rock and volcanics in the upper part of the catchment and groundwater input from the madison aquifer sites hy16 and hy17 1931 1936 m the resulting mixture below the presumed influence of the madison inflows was sampled at site hy10 1909 m during august 2017 baseflow conditions a second two component end member mixing model uses surface waters of middle hyalite creek below the influence of the madison sites hy14 and hy15 1854 m and groundwater from the archean gneiss sampled in hodgeman s canyon sites gw2 and gw3 the resulting mixture below the presumed influence of archean gneiss inflows was sampled at site hy5 1807 m during both august and february baseflow conditions for a given mixing reach and end member definition we solved eqs 1 and 2 simultaneously for u and sr using a numerical iterative optimization scheme the optimization goal was to find the combination of f a upstream end member and f b groundwater end member for the mixing model that would have the maximum likelihood of matching the observed concentrations and isotope ratios for both sr and u at the downstream end of the reach we used r statistical software and the optim function from the base r stats package to find the maximum likelihood estimate i e mle analysis based on the quasi newton l bfgs b algorithm ewing et al 2020 likelihood for the mle was calculated based on the assumption that the residual errors between the modeled mixture values and the observed mixture values were independent and normally distributed ewing et al 2020 the assumed standard deviations of the residual errors necessary for calculating the likelihood in this fashion were based on estimates of analytical uncertainty of each end member in the overall sample analysis we estimated the effect of uncertainty in end member concentrations and isotope ratios on the mle inferred composition of a given observed mixture using a monte carlo analysis we characterized uncertainty for each end member using a random variable with a normal distribution estimated from multiple samples characterizing that end member over time and similar sites sampled on the same date we then generated an ensemble of 5 000 realizations of the inferred composition for a given observation where each realization was generated by randomly sampling from the normal distributions defining the uncertainty in the end members and repeating the mle normal distributions truncated at zero were used to characterize uncertainty in end members such that nonsensical results were excluded from the ensemble results the 95 confidence intervals of the ensemble results are reported based on the 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles of the 5 000 realizations equation 2 describes two end member mixing using an isotopic system with distinct compositions for each end member however many hydrologic situations are more complex and involve mixtures of more than two end members in these situations the use of a single isotope system may not be sufficient to discriminate between multiple end members recent studies evaluated simple three end member mixing using the two independent u and sr isotope systems to determine contributions of different hydrologic sources with distinct radiogenic isotope signatures drexler et al 2014 paces and wurster 2014 we follow this general approach in lower hyalite canyon where we consider whether inmixing of archean gneiss derived water can explain the observed isotopic values 3 results 3 1 u and sr concentrations concentrations of dissolved sr and u in the main stem of hyalite creek tend to increase downstream as elevation decreases table 3 fig 3 a concentrations of sr increase from 0 02 to 0 03 mg l 1 in the upper elevations of hyalite creek sites hy1 and hy2 to 0 04 0 05 mg l 1 at lower elevations sites hy5 and hy6 much of this increase occurs over the reach where the stream valley intersects mesozoic sedimentary rocks particularly from sites hy7 to hy10 further downstream hyalite creek intersects older geologic units including paleozoic carbonate rocks between sites hy10 and hy4 sr concentrations in the main stem remain more or less constant between 0 04 and 0 06 mg l 1 over this middle reach and into the lower reach which cuts through archean gneiss at sites hy14 hy15 hy5 and hy6 samples from tributary watersheds draining mesozoic and paleozoic sedimentary rocks tend to have higher and more variable sr concentrations 0 08 to 0 16 mg l 1 groundwater sampled from wells or springs hosted in the archean gneiss from hodgman s canyon gw2 and gw3 has sr concentrations similar to those of the lower reaches of hyalite creek 0 05 to 0 06 mg l the alluvial aquifer well sample at the mouth of hyalite canyon has a higher sr concentration 0 11 mg l 1 than samples of hyalite creek at the mountain front overall sr concentrations did not vary systematically among sampling dates at any given site concentrations of u followed trends similar to sr concentrations and generally increased with distance downstream in the main stem of hyalite creek table 3 fig 3b u concentrations varied between 0 005 and 0 015 μg l 1 at higher elevations sites hy1 and hy2 where hyalite creek drains tertiary volcanic rock again much of the longitudinal increase in concentration occurred in the middle elevations of hyalite creek sites hy7 to hy4 coinciding with the inflow of springs and tributaries that tend to have higher and more variable u concentrations 0 017 to 0 713 μg l 1 than the main stem 0 023 to 0 242 μg l 1 samples from a given site collected in february and august had similar u concentrations for most sites hy1 hy4 hy7 hy17 however concentrations of u in main stem samples from the lower elevations of hyalite creek hy5 hy6 were substantially higher in february 0 544 to 0 791 μg l 1 than in august 0 121 to 0 170 μg l 1 the groundwater from hodgman canyon wells sites gw2 and gw3 is presumed to reflect the influence of gneiss and had u concentrations in the range of 0 353 to 0 364 μg l 1 which was near the middle of the range observed in samples from sites hy5 and hy6 the upper alluvial fan well gw4 had a u concentration of 0 233 μg l 1 intermediate between those of february and august samples from hyalite creek at the mountain front 3 2 ca sr ratios ratios of ca sr along hyalite creek follow patterns similar to those observed for sr and u concentrations table 3 values in the main stem tend to gradually increase with distance downstream from values between 170 and 200 in upper hyalite creek sites hy1 and hy2 to values between 250 and 290 in the lower canyon hy5 and hy6 much of this shift occurs over the transition from areas underlain by tertiary volcanic rock to mesozoic sediments sites hy7 and hy9 values continue to increase in the middle elevations of the main stem between sites hy10 and hy14 reflecting inputs from paleozoic carbonate units in this reach ca sr values remain constant as the main stem cuts through archean gneiss sites hy15 hy5 and hy6 although some seasonal variation between february and august sampling events is notable in lower canyon samples tributary samples at middle elevations show greater variability both higher and lower values in contrast to main stem water archean gneiss wells sites gw2 and gw3 have high ca sr ratios of 321 and 467 the well in the alluvial fan aquifer at the mouth of hyalite canyon also has a much higher ca sr value 383 than samples of hyalite creek water at the mountain front 249 297 trends in alkalinity are similar to those in ca sr table 3 with higher values in tributaries draining mesozoic and paleozoic sedimentary rock units and gradually increasing values in main stem samples downstream of confluences with tributaries draining sedimentary rock units none of the sites demonstrated systematic variations in ca sr among sampling dates 3 3 sr isotope ratios 87sr 86sr inflections in 87sr 86sr values along the main stem of hyalite creek also align with transitions in parent bedrock along the valley tables 2 and 3 fig 4 values for 87sr 86sr range from 0 70883 to 0 70921 in the upper reaches draining tertiary volcanic bedrock sites hy1 and hy2 87sr 86sr ratios in main stem samples decrease to values of 0 70853 to 0 70871 below hyalite reservoir site hy7 through areas draining mesozoic and paleozoic marine mudstones shales and limestones at intermediate elevations sites hy9 through hy11 tributaries and springs along this reach sites hy3 hy16 and hy17 contribute somewhat lower 87sr 86sr values ranging from 0 70835 to 0 70859 tributaries draining sub basins containing mixtures of paleozoic sediments sites hy13 and hy12 and archean gneiss site hy8 have elevated 87sr 86sr values ranging from 0 70893 to 0 71181 main stem samples have 87sr 86sr values that increase marginally through this reach where bedrock transitions from paleozoic sedimentary rock to archean gneiss to values of 0 70866 to 0 70885 unlike sr concentrations 87sr 86sr values for sites at higher or middle elevations showed minimal differences among sample dates main stem samples in the lower reach of hyalite creek have higher 87sr 86sr values ranging from 0 70973 to 0 71202 coinciding with the intersection of the valley with archean gneiss bedrock sites hy5 and hy6 fig 4 groundwater samples from wells in the archean gneiss sites gw2 and gw3 have substantially higher 87sr 86sr compositions of 0 73687 and 0 74497 table 3 in addition 87sr 86sr in main stem samples from sites in lower hyalite canyon hy5 and hy6 show substantial variation among sample dates with the highest values observed in february during the lowest flows and the lowest values observed in august during somewhat higher flows overall range of 0 70973 to 0 71202 furthermore 87sr 86sr values in samples of main stem water at the canyon mouth site hy6 were consistently higher than water sampled upstream site hy5 during each sampling campaign values of 87sr 86sr in august streamflow at hy6 were much lower than those measured in the june 2017 sample of well water from the alluvial fan near the mouth of the canyon site gw4 values of 0 71007 to 0 70998 versus 0 71221 respectively however the elevated 87sr 86sr value for hy6 streamflow sampled in february 2016 0 71202 was similar to gw4 groundwater 3 4 uranium activity ratios 234u 238u samples of hyalite creek headwaters sites hy1 and hy2 as well as water from immediately below hyalite reservoir hy7 have relatively low and uniform 234u 238u values ranging from 1 59 to 1 72 table 3 fig 5 in contrast water discharging from the madison aquifer at sites hy16 and hy17 has much higher 234u 238u values of 5 23 and 5 29 values for 234u 238u in stream water increase to between 2 94 and 3 20 over the intermediate elevations where the hyalite creek valley intersects madison aquifer bedrock sites hy10 and hy11 and the reach immediately downstream sites hy4 hy14 hy15 water from tributary watersheds draining sedimentary rocks along the same reach sites hy3 hy12 hy13 and hy8 shows a wide range of 234u 238u values from 1 50 to 2 69 main stem samples of lower hyalite creek sites hy5 and hy6 have distinctly lower 234u 238u values 1 69 to 2 13 relative to those at intermediate elevations reflecting a progressive decrease as hyalite creek cuts through archean gneiss values of 234u 238u in lower hyalite creek are similar to those in groundwater sampled from wells drilled in archean gneiss gw2 and gw3 1 85 and 1 49 differences in 234u 238u at a given site are only apparent at sites hy4 hy5 and hy6 february samples from site hy4 displayed higher 234u 238u values than august samples while february samples from sites hy5 and hy6 displayed lower 234u 238u values compared to august samples values of 234u 238u in lower hyalite creek are also comparable to those in groundwater sampled from alluvium along the mountain front near the mouth of hyalite canyon gw4 1 78 3 5 estimates of fractional groundwater contributions variations in isotopic ratios across the full sample set were evaluated in 87sr 86sr vs 234u 238u space as a mixture of three end members defined by compositions derived from water rock interactions with archean gneiss madison group limestones and absaroka volcanics fig 6 progression of hyalite creek sr and u isotopic ratios within the curved space defined by mixing models between the three end members provides a graphic perspective on the cumulative influence of aquifers with distance downstream concentrations of binary mixtures equation 1 will result in fractional contributions f that are distributed equally along a straight line between end member compositions however isotopic compositions of binary mixtures depend on both concentrations and isotope ratios of both end members equation 2 as a result the end member with the higher concentration more strongly influences the isotopic ratio of the mixture if concentrations of the end members are not equal this nonlinearity results in a hyperbolic mixing curve with non equal spacings of fractional contributions when isotopic ratios are plotted faure and mensing 2004 mixing end members are represented by 1 average values for samples from upper hyalite creek that have interacted mainly with absaroka volcanics and cretaceous siliciclastic sediments sites hy1 hy2 hy3 hy7 and hy9 characterized by low 87sr 86sr and 234u 238u values 2 madison aquifer spring water hy16 hy17 characterized by low 87sr 86sr and high 234u 238u values and 3 well water drawn from archean gneiss gw2 gw3 characterized by high 87sr 86sr and low 234u 238u values we used these end member values to define a mixing web where we then plotted sample isotopic compositions fig 6 loads of sr and u in the upper reaches of hyalite creek are presumed to be derived primarily from interactions with eocene absaroka volcanic rocks hence the use of their average 87sr 86sr and 234u 238u compositions to define the volcanic end member the isotopic composition of main stem stream waters at intermediate elevations differs from the eocene volcanic end member primarily in 234u 238u and diverges from the volcanic end member along a binary mixing curve defined by eocene volcanic and madison aquifer end members the lower boundary of the ternary mixing web in fig 6 mixing relations between these two end members suggest that groundwater from the madison aquifer contributes about 4 of stream flow at intermediate elevations along hyalite creek where the hyalite creek valley intersects archean gneiss bedrock 87sr 86sr values in main stem samples increase and 234u 238u values decrease groundwater in archean gneiss has low 234u 238u values similar to water associated with eocene volcanic rock but much higher 87sr 86sr values than water associated with eocene volcanic rock i e from a more radiogenic source compositions of main stem water at lower elevations progressively diverge from the volcanic madison limb of the mixing web fig 6 this divergence trends towards the gneiss end member and away from the madison end member in three end member space when stream flows were lowest in february main stem samples closest to the mouth of the canyon hy5 and hy6 approach the binary mixing curve defined by eocene volcanics and archean gneiss left boundary of mixing web based on models of mixing between the three end members streamflow at the mouth of hyalite canyon hy6 during february sampling was composed of up to 6 water influenced by archean bedrock with very little signature left from water influenced by madison limestones i e less than 1 contribution two component mixing relations were also evaluated using a monte carlo uncertainty analysis of optimized mixing models providing perspective on the degree to which groundwater aquifers are likely contributing to hyalite creek at two locations along the canyon and during two seasons fig 7 ewing et al 2020 groundwater contributions from the madison aquifer hy16 hy17 with elevated 234u 238u values 5 21 5 29 and low 87sr 86sr values 0 70835 0 70836 cause a shift of compositions in main stem samples between upstream hy7 and downstream hy10 sites from 1 62 to 2 96 for 234u 238u and from 0 70870 to 0 70860 for 87sr 86sr based on the ensemble of mixing optimizations for net gains over this reach fig 7a ewing et al 2020 we estimate that the madison group limestone aquifers contributed approximately 3 7 of the streamflow at site hy10 during baseflow conditions in august 2017 reported as the median of the ensemble with a 95 confidence interval of 0 3 to 8 7 a two end member mixing model was also used to access contributions from the archean gneiss aquifer during baseflow conditions in august 2017 and february 2017 fig 7b and c ewing et al 2020 for the august 2017 model average values from sites hy14 and hy15 are assumed to represent the end member at the upstream end of the mixing reach with higher 234u 238u values 2 94 to 3 05 and lower 87sr 86sr values 0 70874 to 0 70885 relative to the downstream end of the mixing reach at site hy5 isotopic ratios for the archean aquifer end member estimated from wells gw2 and gw3 have 234u 238u values of 1 49 to 1 85 and 87sr 86sr values of 0 73687 to 0 74497 mixing of main stem flow with groundwater or runoff inputs over the reach resulted in downstream isotopic ratios at hy5 of 2 13 for 234u 238u and 0 70973 for 87sr 86sr the ensemble of mixing optimizations for these reaches suggests that the archean aquifers contributed approximately 10 9 of the streamflow at site hy5 during baseflow conditions in august 2017 reported as the median of ensemble with 95 confidence interval of 7 4 to 16 2 fig 7b ewing et al 2020 however the isotopic compositions of the downstream site fall outside the ensemble of the mixing models hy5 indicating that sr and u isotopes are providing conflicting information about the contribution of the two purported end members for the february 2017 model the sample from middle hyalite creek at site hy4 located below the main influx of water from the madison aquifer and above the exposed gneiss was used as the upstream end member because sites hy14 and hy15 were not sampled on that date for the mixture site hy6 was used instead of hy5 as site hy5 was not sampled in february of 2017 compared to hy14 and hy15 on other dates hy4 in february 2017 has a higher 234u 238u value 3 01 and lower 87sr 86sr value 0 70868 consistent with madison influence the same gneiss end member gw2 and gw3 was used in the february 2017 model as simulated in august the influence of gneiss groundwater would decrease the 234u 238u value and increase the 87sr 86sr value of hyalite creek which is consistent with the decreased 234u 238u value of 1 75 and increased 87sr 86sr value of 0 71112 observed at site hy6 we therefore model hy6 as a mixture between 1 waters of middle hyalite creek hy4 and 2 water derived from the archean gneiss as represented by gw2 and gw3 fig 7c using these values in our mixing optimization we estimate that fracture flow from the archean gneiss contributes a median of 24 2 95 confidence interval 14 3 to 37 5 fig 7c and ewing et al 2020 of streamflow to lower hyalite creek hy6 during february baseflow conditions however the sr and u isotope ratios again provide conflicting information about end member contributions using the same monte carlo realization and optimization model we also evaluated the sr data alone as an indicator of archean gneiss influence without including u data this approach is based on the sensitive response of this tracer to the archean endmember using only sr isotopic composition and concentration data we estimate that a median of 2 4 95 confidence interval 1 6 to 4 1 of water in lower hyalite creek can be attributed to inflows from the archean gneiss over the targeted reach during baseflow conditions in august and a median of 8 4 95 confidence interval of 4 9 to 14 6 of water can be attributed to archean gneiss inflows in february see ewing et al 2020 absolute fluxes of water relative to measured discharge at the downstream gauge sites can also be estimated from mixing model results given the percentage estimates calculated in the preceding paragraphs additions to main stem streamflow from archean sources are estimated at 0 17 m3 s 1 or 11 of the total 1 57 m3 s 1 measured at site hy6 in august 2017 a similar influx of 0 14 m3 s 1 is estimated for february 2017 data 24 of 0 60 m3 s 1 if the sr results alone are used estimated inflows are 0 038 m3 s 1 2 4 in august and 0 050 m3 s 1 8 4 in february 2017 additions to streamflow from madison sources in the middle reaches of hyalite creek are estimated at 0 04 m3 s 1 or 3 7 of the total 1 14 m3 s 1 measured at site hy7 in august 2017 the longitudinal assay of 222rn activities indicates more widespread groundwater influence than our geochemical indicators specific to the madison and archean waters fig 8 positive nonzero values indicate subsurface inflows older than days to weeks which are evident at all sites other than hy7 the location of hy7 just below hyalite reservoir provides a measure of water that is completely degassed as expected groundwater inflows hy16 and hy17 mid elevation tributaries hy3 and hy8 and the high elevation main stem site hy1 all have comparable 222rn levels 20 40 pci l 1 suggesting that our quantitative point measures provide snapshots of host specific older groundwater influence that is only a portion of the groundwater spectrum influencing streamflow 4 discussion longitudinal evaluation of ca sr u and rn dissolved in stream and ground waters provide a multifaceted means of assessing the nature of baseflow generation along hyalite canyon data in this study track the compositional evolution of streamflow caused by contributions from groundwater or tributary flow that reflect weathering of soils and rocks of varying lithology allowing useful hydrologic inferences for local streamflow generation throughout the hyalite creek watershed 4 1 values for 87sr 86sr in regional rocks and waters previous studies have determined 87sr 86sr values for a number of rock units and streams in the region table 2 these values provide constraints on how variations in lithology across the hyalite creek watershed are likely to influence 87sr 86sr values observed in stream flow the range of 87sr 86sr values that we observed in hyalite canyon waters 0 7089 0 7450 is consistent with the variety of host rock units present though mixing processes likely restrict these values relative to primary source waters tertiary eocene absaroka volcanic rocks similar to those present in hyalite canyon smedes and prostka 1972 are dominated by mafic to intermediate compositions with relatively low rb sr and measured 87sr 86sr values ranging from 0 70433 to 0 70826 hiza 1999 feeley and cosca 2003 lindsay and feeley 2003 values for 87sr 86sr ranging from 0 7072 to 0 7078 were reported for eocene absaroka volcanics east of the hyalite area hiza 1999 waters draining eocean aged absaroka volcanics in the nearby clark s fork of the yellowstone drainage have 87sr 86sr values in the range of 0 704 to 0 705 horton et al 1999 more precise values not provided older paleozoic aged carbonate sedimentary rocks in the greater yellowstone national park region have a higher average 87sr 86sr value of 0 71062 kharaka et al 1991 moore nall 2016 reported an average 87sr 86sr value of 0 708834 for madison group limestones in the pryor mountains 300 km east of the gallatin range and frost and toner 2004 reported a range of 0 70873 to 0 70926 for 87sr 86sr values in madison rocks and waters in the big horn basin of wyoming in contrast much older archean granites and gneisses including those in the neighboring beartooth mountains exhibit variable and substantially higher present day 87sr 86sr values reflecting highly variable rb sr ratios within mineral phases comprising the rock and long time periods of 87sr ingrowth measured 87sr 86sr values for a variety of archean age rock types n 84 from the eastern and southern beartooth mountains had a median value of 0 76177 montgomery and lytwyn 1984 wooden and mueller 1988 water draining precambrian granitic gneiss in the clark s fork basin yielded approximate 87sr 86sr values of 0 721 to 0 732 horton et al 1999 although rock analysis was not undertaken as part of this study published data corroborate assumptions made about the 87sr 86sr compositions in primary rock types present in hyalite canyon table 2 acknowledging that differential mineral weatherability may explain some differences in waters as compared to source rocks for expected 234u 238u values there are less published data however unaltered eocene to archean age rocks are all assumed to have 234u 238u values close to secular equilibrium equal to 1 00 regardless of lithology although readily soluble secondary phases within soils in the region may have somewhat higher values typically less than about 1 6 sharp et al 2003 groundwaters will have more elevated 234u 238u values depending on aquifer character and substrate weatherability bourdon et al 2003 thus the range of 234u 238u values observed 1 506 5 285 can be interpreted as a range of transport conditions and substrate interactions 4 2 origins of headwater compositions streamflow generated from groundwater in the headwaters of hyalite and emerald creeks is derived primarily through water rock interaction with eocene volcanic rocks accordingly sr and u concentrations ca sr ratio and alkalinity were low in higher elevation waters draining the absaroka volcanics likely due to igneous rocks that are less calcareous and more resistant to weathering as well as lower temperatures that are less conducive to chemical alteration values of 87sr 86sr in water draining tertiary volcanic rocks in the upper reaches of hyalite creek sites hy1 and hy2 are somewhat higher than values reported for whole rock digestions in the literature this is likely a consequence of volcanic rocks in the gallatin range being part of the older washburn group smedes and prostka 1972 which tend to have higher 87sr 86sr values median of 0 70725 lindsay and feely 2003 0 7072 0 7078 hiza 1999 than younger rocks in the absaroka supergroup moreover magmas associated with early eruptions in the volcanic field may have assimilated crustal components with elevated 87sr 86sr values before chambers and conduits become well established in addition leaching of rock and soil by water will preferentially extract sr from the most weatherable minerals which are not likely to have remained in equilibrium with the bulk rock over the 50 million years since formation water may preferentially leach phases with elevated rb sr resulting in groundwater or runoff with higher 87sr 86sr values regardless of cause the similarity of 87sr 86sr values for streamflow samples draining two separate volcanic rock headwater basins upper hyalite creek hy1 and emerald creek hy2 fig 1 suggest that stream flow draining subwatersheds dominated by absaroka bedrock is well characterized with a mean value of 0 70889 in the hyalite creek watershed 0 00008 2 standard deviation sd for n 7 excluding 1 outlier lower 234u 238u values in the steeper subwatersheds in upper hyalite creek hy1 and in the emerald creek tributary hy2 suggest more aggressive weathering of u from soils during recharge or relatively rapid communication of meteoric water to the stream fig 5 4 3 baseflow contributions from tributaries and aquifers draining sedimentary rocks concentrations of sr and u ca sr ratio and alkalinity generally increased in the middle elevations of hyalite creek above 1800 m consistent with baseflow contributions from relatively solute rich groundwater in sedimentary bedrock units that drain to hyalite creek via tributaries or subsurface flow fig 3 relative to baseflow derived from absaroka volcanics tributaries draining aquifers in more weatherable limestones and shales are likely to contribute ion loads to the main stem that are disproportionate to their contribution to flow horton et al 1999 jacobson et al 2002 2003 more specifically tributaries draining aquifers in sedimentary bedrock are more likely to contain secondary carbonates or other ca rich secondary phases with elevated ca sr values consequently inputs to streamflow along the intermediate elevations of the valley appear to be relatively minor compared to upstream flow generation but likely contribute substantial ion loading to hyalite creek the middle reaches of hyalite creek drain an area dominated by mesozoic and paleozoic sedimentary rocks main stem samples sites hy7 hy9 hy10 and hy11 show a distinct decrease in 87sr 86sr values mean value of 0 70862 0 00013 2 sd for n 7 interpreted to reflect addition of sr from marine sources streamflow from lick creek draining mostly mesozoic clastic sediments hy3 and groundwater discharging from the madison aquifer sites hy16 and hy17 have lower 87sr 86sr values mean 87sr 86sr values of 0 70849 and 0 70835 respectively than those in main stem flow at the same elevation fig 4 this relation is consistent with addition of sr from marine sources which had primary 87sr 86sr between 0 7068 and 0 7082 through most of the mesozoic and paleozoic eras mcarthur et al 2001 in contrast tributary streamflow draining a small subwatershed of volcanic rock in this reach meadow creek site hy13 has a higher 87sr 86sr value of 0 70893 similar to values draining volcanic rocks in headwater areas contributions to hyalite creek from aquifers in madison group limestones are evident from the notable increases in 234u 238u values at intermediate elevations fig 5 springs issuing from the madison group limestones hy16 and hy17 have elevated 234u 238u values consistent with water that has had more extensive contact time with matrix materials thus allowing greater incorporation of recoil 234u from aquifer rock surfaces the large changes in 234u 238u values observed in main stem samples from sites hy10 and hy11 are coupled with only small changes in u concentration and discharge consistent with inflows having similar u concentrations but substantial enrichment in 234u elevated 234u 238u values are present in main stem samples well downstream from the contact with the madison group limestones suggesting the possibility of continued influx from related karst aquifers or reflecting the conservative nature of uranyl complexes in the dissolved load decreasing values of 87sr 86sr in main stem samples below hyalite reservoir through this reach may be derived as a consequence of either tributary additions or gains from aquifer discharge however the large increase in 234u 238u values is interpreted to be diagnostic of groundwater influxes from laterally continuous aquifers such as those developed in madison group limestones equally elevated 234u 238u values are not observed in surface flow from tributaries in the same reach sites hy13 hy12 and hy8 although values are higher than those in tributary flow above the madison outcrop hy3 and may indicate a contribution from madison group limestone aquifers or other geochemically mature groundwater as well in support of the influence of diverse groundwaters in both upper and middle elevation inflows 222rn concentrations were consistently elevated in upper hyalite hy1 as well as lick and moser tributaries hy3 hy8 below the madison inflows fig 8 indicating influence of geochemically distinct and possibly younger inflows that were not discernable with u and sr tracers based on u and sr isotope results mixing models suggest that approximately 4 of water in hyalite creek at hy10 95 confidence of 0 3 to 8 7 can be attributed to groundwater from the madison group limestones entering via the subsurface somewhere below site hy7 between elevations of 1962 m and 1909 m fig 7a ewing et al 2020 while the generation of baseflow from aquifers in the madison group limestones is modest in hyalite creek relative to upstream contributions values of 234u 238u provide a sensitive indicator of the influence of storage in this important regional limestone aquifer although snowpack was particularly low in february 2017 71 of average based on the lick creek snotel broader evaluation of the inflow rate requires knowing how prior years influenced recharge of this aquifer 4 4 contribution from archean gneiss fracture flow baseflow generation from groundwater influenced by archean gneiss is evident from progressive increases in 87sr 86sr values and decreases in 234u 238u values with distance downstream in the lower elevations of hyalite canyon these isotopic changes are consistent with downstream evolution of main stem water towards an endmember defined by wells completed in the archean gneiss bedrock gw2 and gw3 isotopic compositions near the canyon outlet hy5 and hy6 show differences between august and february that can be explained by seasonal differences in flow whereby the same volume of inflow has a greater influence during lower flow in february substantially higher 87sr 86sr values in february relative to august fig 4 table 3 suggest that contributions from gneiss were proportionally greater during winter than during summer to a degree that is consistent with changes in flow values of 234u 238u also show systematic differences between february and august samples fig 5 that are consistent with greater contributions from sources with shorter flow paths or more intensive weathering of source rock in winter this could reflect changes in the gneiss derived inflow or influence of inflows from a distinct lithologic source based on longitudinal patterns in isotopic composition the largest influxes of water from gneiss sources appear to occur downstream from site hy15 at elevations between 1729 and 1707 fig 4 a shear zone traversing the valley just below 1729 m may 1985 may represent a region of preferential groundwater flow if baseflow gains are derived from groundwater discharging from fractured gneiss 234u 238u values suggest a very different type of water rock interaction compared to flow in aquifers hosted by madison group limestones low 234u 238u values imply relatively short range connectivity such that preferential incorporation of recoil 234u generated along fracture surfaces is not sufficient to increase 234u 238u values beyond those expected after infiltration through soils despite assuming a large uncertainty for the gneiss end member in mixing models of the lower end of the canyon the monte carlo realizations of the mixing models and inferred mixing fractions failed to capture the compositions measured in lower hyalite creek mixtures hy5 hy6 fig 7 b and c the conflicting information from sr and u data has two possible explanations first compositions in well water samples may not accurately reflect the gneiss end member which might have lower 234u 238u values and u concentrations that are seasonally variable second inflows from an end member not included in the model may be affecting hyalite creek following the first possible explanation the shifting character of apparent inflows in lower hyalite canyon in february relative to august could reflect changing flow regimes through the fractured gneiss fig 6 periods of winter snowmelt on hillslopes above the lower elevations of hyalite creek may enhance translatory flow that alters pathways of stream flow generation from archean gneiss bedrock at lower elevations similar seasonal differences in local streamflow gains were not observed at other sampling sites suggesting this process may be limited to lower elevations with greater relative inputs of water during winter melt periods alternatively if seasonal variation reflects inflows from a distinct end member this end member would need to have a lower 87sr 86sr and 234u 238u composition somewhat similar to volcanic rocks found in the upper reaches of hyalite creek return of water derived from such rock units could be delivered by water movement through glacial till throughout the middle reaches of hyalite canyon but this explanation appears physically unlikely given that return flow from the glacial till would likely be contributing to hyalite creek well upstream fig 1 alternately runoff over volcanic colluvium originating from ridge tops in the lower canyon may influence geochemical composition and this contribution would likely be small we also note that higher u concentrations and intermediate 87sr 86sr composition in lower canyon samples collected in february are reasonably consistent with contributions from sedimentary tributaries in the middle canyon figs 3 4 6 and these sedimentary units are exposed at lower elevations in the next major canyon to the west south cottonwood thus we conclude that an additional contribution from water influenced by contact with distinct rock units likely associated with transient runoff dynamics cannot be ruled out as a plausible additional endmember in lower hyalite canyon despite the intriguing uncertainty about the specific character of archean waters directly contributing to lower hyalite our data as a whole support the notion that is this setting 87sr 86sr values offer the more sensitive indicator of archean gneiss influence accordingly our data document persistent and steady inflows from the archean gneiss during baseflow conditions in august and february 2017 regardless of mixing model uncertainties 234u 238u and 87sr 86sr data were critical to detection of baseflow contributions from different weathering components present in lower elevations of the watershed because solute concentrations and ca sr ratios were unable to identify inflow from a unique end member measures of 222rn in the lower canyon hy5 hy6 support interpretations of groundwater inflows though measured concentrations 10 pci l 1 are somewhat lower than in the middle elevation tributaries 5 conclusions this study shows that longitudinal surveys of natural geochemical tracers and their isotopic composition can provide valuable information about groundwater sources storage potential and baseflow generation along stream valleys we used 87sr 86sr and 234u 238u values as sensitive indicators of distinct groundwater inflows in a lithologically diverse catchment longitudinal 222rn assays corroborate more extensive and likely younger groundwater inflows radiogenic sr and u isotopic ratios were critical to identifying and quantifying contributions from older baseflow generation that would otherwise have been invisible based on elemental concentrations alone moreover longitudinal sampling allows a spatially explicit perspective on where groundwater sources occur in the catchment that would likely have been overlooked if assessed at coarser scales or only at the watershed outlet longitudinal sampling also allowed application of both general and localized mixing models that used combinations of tracer concentrations and isotope ratios to quantify the fractional contributions from groundwater sources using these models we estimate that groundwater contribution from the madison aquifers represents about 4 of streamflow in the middle reaches of hyalite creek and that groundwater discharging from fractured archean gneiss supplies 2 of local streamflow during the august baseflow period and 8 of local streamflow during the february baseflow period these inflows are a subset of total groundwater contributions that are evident in 222rn measures reflecting likely diversity of apparent age this research elucidates groundwater contributions to streamflow along hyalite canyon an important water resource for agricultural and metropolitan uses in the gallatin valley and analogously in intermountain basins of the region urban areas in intermountain basins are expanding at the same time that snowpack storage is predicated to decrease due to changes in climate patterns our results provide a perspective on baseflow generation along hyalite creek that likely represents the delayed contribution of higher elevation snowpack over interannual to decadal time scales this work sheds light on the nature of aquifer specific contributions to baseflow in a mountain headwater stream that provides municipal agricultural and ecological water supply similar to many mountain water supplies across the intermountain west this observation

4891,drywells dws and infiltration basins ibs are widely used as managed aquifer recharge mar devices to capture stormwater runoff and recharge groundwater however no published research has compared the performance of these two engineered systems under shared conditions numerical experiments were conducted on an idealized 2d axisymmetric domain using the hydrus 2d 3d software to systematically study the performance of a circular ib design diameter and area and partially penetrating dw 38 m length with water table 60 m the effects of subsurface heterogeneity on infiltration recharge and storage from the dw and ib under constant head conditions were investigated the mean cumulative infiltration μi and recharge μr volumes increased and the arrival time of recharge decreased with the ib area values of μi were higher for a 70 m diameter ib than an dw whereas the value of μr was higher for a dw after 1 year of a constant head simulation under selected subsurface heterogeneity conditions a comparison between mean μi μr and mean vadose zone storage μs values for all dw and ib stochastic simulations 70 for each mar scenario under steady state conditions demonstrated that five dws can replace a 70 m diameter ib to achieve significantly higher infiltration and recharge over 20 years of operation additional numerical experiments were conducted to study the influence of a shallow clay layer by considering an ib dw and a dw integrated into an ib the presence of such a low permeable layer delayed groundwater recharge from an ib in contrast a dw can penetrate tight clay layers and release water below them and facilitate rapid infiltration and recharge the potential benefits of a dw compared to an ib include a smaller footprint the potential for pre treatments to remove contaminants less evaporation less mobilization of in situ contaminants and potentially lower maintenance costs besides this study demonstrates that combining both ib and dw helps to get the

development of urban areas increases the impermeable surface area and the amount of runoff stormwater runoff threatens urban infrastructures bridges roads and buildings and wastewater treatment facilities while contaminants associated with impervious surfaces including fossil fuels nutrients and heavy metals can impair surface water and groundwater quality welker et al 2006 the elevated

sediments and contaminants braga et al 2007 to tackle this problem engineers are investing time money and research to develop best management practices bmps welker et al 2006 infiltration structures such as infiltration basins and trenches coupled with retention compartments are widely used for urban stormwater management across the world dechesne et al 2004 2005 infiltration basins contribute valuable technical and environmental benefits by capturing stormwater runoff and letting it infiltrate into the underlying soil ferguson 1994 they are an especially attractive and feasible option when the surface soil has adequate permeability and the site has a shallow water table akan 2002 often ibs drain runoff from mixed watersheds that have residential commercial and industrial zones major roads and reclaimed water dechesne et al 2004 drewes and fox 1999 the use of ibs enhances groundwater recharge reduces the peak flow and volume of water in downstream networks limits pollution discharges to surface waters and decreases stormwater flows in sewer systems dechesne et al 2004 2005 infiltration basins are also attractive to the public because they can improve urban landscapes when designed as parks or playgrounds they have a lower cost than buried systems and act as drainage outlets from highways and parking lots dechesne et al 2004 2005 although there are many potential benefits associated with the use of ibs for stormwater capture their more extensive application has certain limitations for example even though ibs are used as a stormwater management system in the urban area it may not significantly decrease the total volume of runoff all the time traver and chadderton 1983 therefore they may not control potential flash flooding erosion and pollutants dechesne et al 2005 even though the topsoil layer of ibs can act as a barrier for pollutants mikkelsen et al 1994 nightingale 1987 contamination of the underlying soil and groundwater still remains an issue barraud et al 2002 dechesne et al 2004 in addition clogging of ib surfaces barraud et al 1999 gonzalez merchan et al 2012 hutchinson et al 2017 may occur through a combination of mechanical biological and chemical processes that depend on the sediment load and organic composition of the inflow water gonzalez merchan et al 2012 clogging reduces the infiltration capacity of ibs and causes frequent ponding or overflows reduces the treatment capacity and decreases groundwater recharge dechesne et al 2005 gonzalez merchan et al 2012 the annual cost associated with ibs maintenance such as scrapping of clogged surfaces and pre treatment of source water can be expensive erickson et al 2010 ibs can be operated for 20 30 years however the long term performance of ibs is neither well understood nor controlled during operation dechesne et al 2005 knowledge about the long term environmental impacts of ibs is limited since there is no information on how to restore functionality if adequate infiltration capacity is lost welker et al 2006 also there is a quantifiable decrease in the available area to operate ibs with increasing urbanization braga et al 2007 there is therefore a critical need for alternative mar practices that can resolve challenges associated with ibs in growing urban environments in the past decade dws have gained a lot of attention in the united states and across the world dws capture stormwater and infiltrate it in the vadose zone up to 10 40 m below the soil surface and at least 1 3 m above the water table lacdpw 2014 sasidharan et al 2018 2019 2020 dws are often used as a low impact development bmp engineering system to capture seasonal stormwater to maintain the urban green infrastructure this study investigates the use of dws for mar as an alternative and or in combination with ibs dws can be implemented as a mar technique in semi arid and arid regions where the groundwater table is deep e g 60 300 m or more when high permeable soils and or sufficiently large land areas for surface infiltration systems are not available or when the installation of deep boreholes in saturated zones are expensive bouwer 2002 liang et al 2018 there are several additional advantages of using dws over ibs for example dws have minimal water loss by evaporation a small installation area a large ponding depth hydraulic driving head a shorter recharge time and an opportunity for pre treatment of sediments and contaminants in source water edwards et al 2016 sasidharan et al 2018 2019 2020 a few major cities in california arizona and washington achieve nearly 70 100 percent of their groundwater recharge through dw infiltration and many other cities are planning to build dws cadmus 1999 epa 1999 graf 2010 marsh et al 1995 snyder et al 1994 dws are therefore an attractive option for mar in areas where an ib is not ideal or can be used as an integrated infrastructure to enhance the recharge of existing ibs several investigations have determined infiltration rates from infiltration basins bouwer 2002 bouwer and rice 1989 masetti et al 2016 in addition several researchers have compared the performance of an ib with other mar techniques for example lab scale experiments coupled with numerical modeling have demonstrated that clogging is likely to influence the infiltration capacity of certain mar systems e g infiltration basins more than others e g recharge wells glass et al 2020 a small diameter 2 5 5 cm diameter and 10 12 m depth well was reported to improve the infiltration in comparison to a spreading basin händel et al 2016a 2014 2016b however these studies used a small well that was not comparable to the drywell size of this investigation 1 2 m diameter and 38 m depth jokela and kallio 2015 compared the performance of deep injection wells 40 cm diameter and 32 45 m depth to a sprinkler infiltration system comparison between infiltration trenches and spreading basins demonstrated that trenches are promising to enhance infiltration when compared to spreading basins heilweil et al 2015 heilweil and watt 2011 in all of these studies the well geometry was not identical to a drywell and water was injected directly into the water table furthermore differences in vadose zone storage and stochastic subsurface heterogeneity were not considered in these works mar techniques are highly dependent on soil textural properties and the subsurface heterogeneity that controls both the permeability and flow fields for example the infiltration capacity will vary with the vadose zone thickness and the presence and distribution of high and low permeable soil layers and their connectivity to the underlying aquifer mantoglou and gelhar 1987 o geen et al 2015 schilling et al 2017 xie et al 2014 yeh et al 1985a 1985b many parts of the us have soil horizons layers that are cemented or consist of claypans or layers with strongly contrasting particle size distributions these layers can have exceptionally low saturated hydraulic conductivity ks values that severely limit the vertical movement of infiltrated water o geen et al 2015 this restricts the site suitability and operation of ibs and does not guarantee that aquifer recharge from ibs will occur over short time frames in some cases it may be several years the objective of this study is to compare groundwater recharge from dws and ibs under various homogeneous and heterogeneous subsurface conditions the hydrus 2d 3d software was used to directly simulate cumulative infiltration and recharge volumes from dws and ibs constant head conditions were considered in dws and ibs to determine the comparable upper limit for recharge subsurface heterogeneity was described in this model by generating stochastic realizations of soil hydraulic properties the performance of dws and ibs were assessed based on simulated values of cumulative infiltration and recharge the number of dws required to achieve similar or improved behavior to an ib and the long term operational benefits and costs the approach and numerical model tool in this research can be used to screen mar designs for a specific site applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 mathematical model the hydrus 2d 3d software package version 3 šejna et al 2018 šimůnek et al 2018 2016 was used to simulate infiltration redistribution in the vadose zone and groundwater recharge from dws and ibs hydrus 2d 3d numerically solves the 2 dimensional axisymmetric form of the richards equation using the van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 unsaturated soil hydraulic functions input parameters initial conditions and boundary conditions that were employed in these simulations were generally based on the results from dws located in fort irwin ca sasidharan et al 2020 table 1

the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog carsel and parrish 1988 the data for axisymmetric dw simulations presented in this work one year constant head simulation was adapted from our previously published work sasidharan et al 2020 this manuscript provides details about the expanded simulation domain model parameters and the dynamics of water infiltration redistribution and recharge these results are compared with similar simulations for ibs in this work fig 1 shows a schematic of an example model domain geometry initial conditions and boundary conditions that were employed in the ib simulations the axisymmetric flow domain was 60 m h height 50 m w radius the ib had a height of 2 m and a diameter of 10 20 30 40 50 60 or 70 m and was continuously ponded with a water height of 0 6 m the model domain was discretized using a two dimensional triangular finite element mesh with the meshgen tool available within hydrus 2d 3d the mesh was refined at the top boundary of the domain where infiltration from the ib was simulated to reduce the mass balance error the finite element mesh was adjusted such that the size of elements was smaller 0 05 0 1 m near the ib surface and the grid size was gradually increased with the radial distance from the ib with a maximum element size of 0 5 0 75 m the quality of the finite element mesh was assessed by checking the mass balance error reported by hydrus 2d 3d at the end of the simulation mass balance errors were always below 1 and these values are generally considered acceptable brunetti et al 2017 a no flux boundary condition was assigned to nodes between the ib surface and the upper right corner and the whole right and left sides of the flow domain fig 1a nodes at the bottom boundary z 60 m were assigned a free drainage boundary condition i e the water table was assumed to be far below this point note that numerical experiments in this study do not account for the effect of the water table and future site specific analyses and modeling studies are therefore warranted a constant pressure head condition was considered in this study to evaluate the continuous long term performance of an ib and potential application of a dw as an independent or integrated infrastructure with an ib to represent a continuously filled ib 0 6 m the total head h h z at the upper boundary at z 1 4 to 2 m was constant i e the pressure head decreased linearly with depth from 0 6 m at the bottom of the ib z 2 m to 0 at the water level z 1 4 m fig 1 the initial condition in the flow domain was specified in terms of the soil water pressure head h x z and was set equal to a constant pressure head of 0 5 m fig 1 sasidharan et al 2020 2 2 numerical experiment 2 2 1 homogeneous domain numerical experiments i table 1 were conducted to determine the values of cumulative infiltration i and cumulative recharge r after 730 days 2 years as a function of the area of ib when considering a homogeneous fort irwin soil the hydraulic parameters for the fort irwin soil table 1 were taken from sasidharan et al 2020 the value of i was collected over simulated time as the total volume of water infiltrated from the ib similarly the value of r was calculated as the total volume of water drained through the bottom free drainage boundary note that all this information was available in output files of the hydrus 2d 3d software 2 2 2 heterogeneous domain numerical experiments i considered idealized homogeneous soil systems however most field scale soil profiles are highly heterogeneous with hydraulic parameters changing over short distances in this study highly permeable horizontal and vertical soil layers lenses were represented using the miller miller similitude geostatistical approach which has been widely used in previous research feyen et al 1998 roth 1995 roth and hammel 1996 sasidharan et al 2019 2020 vereecken et al 2007 the hydrus 2d 3d computer software has an option to generate stochastic distributions of hydraulic conductivity αk and pressure head αh scaling factors using the miller miller similitude approximation miller and miller 1956 which links these two scaling factors as follows αk αh 2 a lognormal distribution of scaling factors was employed and the stochastic field was generated using the standard deviation σ of log10 αk and its correlation length in the lateral the x correlation length x and vertical the z correlation length z directions procedures for generating autocorrelated or uncorrelated scaling factor fields and the original algorithm used in hydrus have been described in detail in the literature el kadi 1986 freeze 1975 mejía and rodríguez iturbe 1974 constant head ib simulations that employed stochastic realizations were conducted to accurately capture and compare the infiltration and recharge behavior of ibs with published constant head stochastic dw simulations sasidharan et al 2020 soil hydraulic parameters for the fort irwin soil table 1 were employed in conjunction with stochastic scaling factors in these simulations constant head simulations were used to determine i and r after two years in experiment ii table 1 multiple realizations of the stochastic parameters were employed and the mean values of i μi and r μr and associated standard deviations were calculated the following hypothetical combinations of scaling factors with variable σ σ 0 25 0 5 and 1 for x 1 m and z 0 1 m x x 0 1 1 and 10 m for σ 1 and z 0 1 m and z z 0 1 1 and 2 m for σ 1 and x 1 were used similar parameter ranges have been measured in the field freeze 1975 sudicky and macquarrie 1989 and employed in previous modeling studies sasidharan et al 2019 2020 only ten realizations were considered for these stochastic heterogeneity parameter combinations to minimize the computational time and cost our previous research demonstrated that ten realizations were sufficient to accurately capture the mean and variance of the infiltration behavior of dws in the heterogeneous realizations of the numerical experiments sasidharan et al 2019 2020 mean parameter values and 95 confidence intervals ci were calculated for all parameters from the ten simulation realizations of the ib after two years the calculated values of μi and μr for ibs were compared with those for dws sasidharan et al 2020 with the same heterogeneous domain after 1 year we also compare the steady state performance of a combined system with a 70 m diameter ib and a dw over two years in order to develop recommendations on how a dw can replace or complement an ib figure s1 demonstrates that the steady state infiltration i and recharge r rates were reached in constant head dw sasidharan et al 2020 and ib simulations after one and two years respectively these values of i and r were multiplied by a selected duration to determine the total steady state volume of i and r respectively after two years the corresponding steady state volume change of water in storage s in the vadose zone was determined as i r steady state values of μi μr and μs and their associated 95 confidence intervals over a two year duration were determined and compared for all dw and ib simulations 70 simulations for each mar approach steady state ib results were also compared with multiple dws up to 5 over 20 years of operation in this case values of μi μr and μs for two years were divided by two to obtain yearly results and then multiplied by the number of years of operation and the number of dws parameters μi μr and μs denote mean cumulative infiltration recharge and storage respectively under steady state conditions using the 70 simulations as discussed in the introduction fine textured soil layers can lead to reductions in soil permeability and recharge additional simulations were therefore conducted to investigate the use of various mar strategies to overcome these challenges in a profile with sand loamy sand sandy loam sandy clay loam and clay layers experiment iii table 1 soil hydraulic parameters for various soil textures were taken from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog table 1 mar simulations considered a single dw and ib separately as well as a dw integrated into an ib fig 1b and s2 2 2 3 cost analysis fordw and ib a brief economic analysis of the installation and operational costs of ibs and dws was also conducted literature values and data collected from various commercial operators were used for this purpose 3 result and discussions 3 1 performance of an ib in different soil profiles the infiltration recharge and vadose zone storage volume for an ib with a diameter of 10 70 m were investigated as a function of time 1 2 years and depth 7 60 m using hydrus 2d 3d numerical modeling experiments selected numerical experiments were conducted for homogeneous and stochastic fort irwin soil profiles to understand the effect of subsurface soil heterogeneity on ib performance 3 1 1 homogeneous soil profiles numerical experiment i was conducted to better understand the relationship between the size and the infiltration and recharge behavior of an ib in a homogeneous soil domain ibs with a diameter of 10 20 30 40 50 60 and 70 m were considered in this study it should be mentioned that some existing ibs are much larger 1000 acre 4 million m2 and can infiltrate up to 308 million m3 of water hutchinson et al 2017 however this work only considers a small ib with a maximum diameter of 70 m in order to minimize the computational time and cost associated with simulations on larger flow domains and to stay within the empirical experience catchment basin size at the fort irwin study site fig 2 shows the simulated water content θ profiles for ibs of different sizes after a 2 year constant head numerical simulation figs 3 and 4 present corresponding information about i and r in these same simulations fig 3a shows a plot of i versus time for two years 730 days of numerical simulation fig 3b shows a plot of i versus the ib area after one and two years the value of i increases in nearly a linear fashion over time fig 3a and with the ib area fig 3b the design and operation standards for ibs are set by various states and counties for example in virginia the maximum drainage area of an ib is restricted to 50 acres and the basin should be emptied within 48 h yu and kaighn 1992 in contrast los angeles county in california requires that the 85th percentile of a 24 hr runoff event be infiltrated within 96 h lacdpw 2014 however acquiring the needed land area for an ib can be expensive and challenging especially in an urban area engineers therefore often seek ways to minimize the surface area of an ib but this can be challenging because it may require a ponding depth that is either impractical or violates design parameters besides the actual configuration of an ib is largely dependent on the site specific topography and other constraints yu and kaighn 1992 ibs may therefore not be an ideal bmp or mar technique when suitable locations are not readily available such as in highly urbanized landscapes with utilities in karst areas and when surface slopes are higher than 20 percent yu and kaighn 1992 fig 4a 4b 4c and 4d show plots of cumulative recharge r as a function of time over one year and depth when the ib diameter was equal to 10 30 50 and 70 m respectively the value of r was negligible for all ibs with a 60 m deep soil profile during the first year this happens because most of the infiltrating water below the ib contributes to the change in the vadose zone storage until the pore space is filled the size of the ib influences the arrival time of the infiltrating water at a specified depth in particular a decrease in the ib diameter produced a later arrival time for example the arrival time at a depth of 22 m for an ib with a 10 m diameter was 164 8 days whereas it was 126 8 days when the ib diameter was 70 m this occurs because lateral spreading plays a relatively more significant role for smaller diameter ibs fig 2 fig 4e shows a plot of r as a function of the ib area at depths of 7 22 and 60 m after one and two years the value of r was very small or negligible after one year when the depth was 60 m but then rapidly increased when the vadose zone storage filled and the simulation approached a steady state condition at the end of the second year for example the value of r at a depth of 60 m after 2 years was slightly less than r at a depth of 7 m after 1 year fig 4e this reflects the difference in the vadose zone storage and the time needed to reach steady state conditions at these depths it also indicates that ibs may not be the ideal mar strategy when rapid groundwater recharge is needed for example the central valley in california is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world which heavily relies on surface water diversions and groundwater pumping for crop irrigation faunt et al 2016 greater reliance on groundwater during droughts has caused large scale land subsidence harter 2015 and the loss of up to 10 m of aquifer storage in some parts of the central valley scanlon et al 2016 rapid recharge within a short period is therefore essential for mitigating land subsidence and irreversible loss in aquifer storage in shallow aquifers 60 70 m however our experiment i simulation results demonstrate that the ib design will determine the arrival time for groundwater recharge in some cases this may take several years even for a homogeneous soil profile with high permeability 3 1 2 heterogeneous soil profiles in reality the natural subsurface is inherently heterogeneous and the layering of soil structures is very common hencher et al 2011 phillips and lorz 2008 sasidharan et al 2019 sidle et al 2000 smith et al 2008 uchida et al 2003 usda 2016 fig 5 shows representative θ distributions in stochastic domains under a 70 m diameter ib that had constant head conditions for two years the fort irwin soil hydraulic parameters and stochastic parameters x 0 1 1 and 10 z 0 1 1 and 2 and σ 0 25 0 5 and 1 were employed in these experiment ii simulations table 1 heterogeneous domains with x 10 1 and 0 1 lateral layering fig 5a 5b and 5c display wider θ distributions in the saturated area under the ibs compared to other heterogeneous domains however constant head simulation results indicate that a dw sasidharan et al 2020 with a 1 8 m diameter can create a similar sized cone of infiltration as a 70 m diameter ib fig s3 the operation of ibs is mainly controlled by gravity driven vertical water flow but the pressure head for an ib is very small 0 6 m in contrast a dw can have a pressure head of up to 38 m that pushes water initially laterally through high permeable zones and then water flows vertically by gravity therefore a dw with a very small surface footprint can create a recharge zone as big as a 70 m diameter ib in particular the surface area of a 70 m ib is 3857 m2 whereas it is only 2 54 m2 for a dw fig 6 shows values of μi and μr and their 95 confidence intervals after 365 days as a function of σ fig 6a x fig 6b and z fig 6c for the dw sasidharan et al 2020 and ib sasidharan et al 2020 previously demonstrated in dw simulations that the infiltration volume the distribution and volume of trapped water in the flow domain and the subsequent recharge are highly dependent on the subsurface heterogeneity similarly fig 6a shows that μi and μr tended to increase with σ fig 6a for both ib and dw an increase in σ leads to the formation of more permeable regions which enhance infiltration sasidharan et al 2020 the μi was higher for the ib than for the dw but μr for the ib was smaller than for the dw the value of μi and μr for the ib and dw overlapped for x fig 6b and in some cases μi and μr were higher for the dw than for the ib in contrast the value of μi was higher and μr smaller for the ib in comparison with the dw for various z fig 6c an increase in x and z creates larger horizontal and vertical lenses that can enhance the rapid movement of the wetting front in horizontal and vertical directions respectively sasidharan et al 2019 2020 the above numerical modeling observations can be explained by differences in the vadose zone storage and the time to reach steady state flow conditions in general the dw has less vadose zone storage and therefore reaches steady state flow conditions faster than the ib fig s3 recharge from the ib is therefore smaller than from the dw in the short term researchers have previously reported extensive lateral water movement but limited vertical water movement in different subsurface soil profiles mantoglou and gelhar 1987 routson et al 1979 sinai et al 1974 yeh et al 1985a 1985b it is important to understand the infiltration recharge and arrival time behavior during short term dw and ib operations to identify the best technique to infiltrate or recharge water rapidly fig s4 shows a plot of μi and μr as a function of time 365 days for ib simulations when σ 0 25 0 5 and 1 and when x 1 m and z 0 1 m the value of μi and μr tended to increase with σ but μr was orders of magnitude smaller than μi due to vadose zone storage the value of μr was equal to zero after one year for the ib when σ 0 25 whereas the recharge arrival time for a dw was approximately 100 days when σ 0 25 sasidharan et al 2020 fig s5 shows a plot of μi and μr for the ib when x 0 1 1 10 m z 0 1 m and σ 1 the values of μi and μr decreased with increasing x these trends reflect increasing water spreading with x due to larger lenses in the lateral direction with high permeability sasidharan et al 2020 the value of μr was again orders of magnitude smaller than μi due to the vadose zone storage the arrival time for the worst case recharge scenario x 10 z 0 1 m and σ 1 was approximately 250 days for the ib fig s5b compared to about 68 days for the dw sasidharan et al 2020 fig s6 shows a plot of μi and μr as a function of time 365 days for ib simulations when z 0 1 1 and 2 x 1 m and σ 1 the presence of highly permeable vertical lenses facilitates the faster downward movement of water and thus an early arrival time sasidharan et al 2020 however even for the best case recharge scenario x 1 z 2 and σ 1 the arrival time for the ib was approximately 135 days fig s6b whereas it was only about 34 days from the dw sasidharan et al 2020 the above results clearly demonstrate that dws have a much faster recharge arrival time than ibs 3 2 performance comparison between ib and dw an ib has several benefits when used as a mar technique however the biggest constrain on the installation of an ib often is land availability both in urban and rural areas direct injection wells such as aquifer storage and recovery has gained attention as a solution to this problem however injection water needs to meet strict water quality standards before being injected which are achieved using energy intensive treatments which makes this technique very expensive drywells usually are considered as a low impact development lid bmp for capturing episodic stormwater mostly in urban areas however this study proposes its potential use as a mar under constant head conditions where the installation and continuous operation of an ib are not feasible therefore additional numerical experiments were conducted to compare the infiltration and recharge performance between a dw and an ib under various scenarios the purpose of these specific simulations was to demonstrate the potential application of a drywell as an independent mar technique in place of an ib or its use in conjunction with existing ib infrastructure such a combination of a dw with an ib has never been systematically investigated before section 3 1 demonstrated that a single dw could infiltrate and recharge less equivalent or more water than a 70 m diameter ib depending on specific subsurface heterogeneity conditions additional calculations were conducted in this section to compare the overall performance of multiple dws and an ib fig 7 shows plots of mean steady state values of μi μr and μs for simulations with an ib and a dw 70 for each mar scenario in heterogeneous domains as a function of the number of dws the value of μi and μr for a 70 m diameter ib and a single dw were very close to each other fig 7a and 7b however increasing the number of dws at a location increases values of μi and μr over the ib correspondingly to their numbers interestingly the value of μs for a single dw was smaller than that for an ib but the 95 ci for the vadose zone storage volume for five dws overlapped that of a single ib these results demonstrate that five dws can easily replace a 70 m diameter a surface area of 3847 m2 ib to achieve significantly higher infiltration and recharge additional calculations were conducted to compare the performance of five dws with a 70 m diameter ib that was operated for up to 20 years fig 8 the results demonstrate that five dws can infiltrate and recharge significantly higher volumes of water than an ib even after 20 years of continuous operation these results have important implications for mar operations ibs often require a large surface area to infiltrate source water within the recommended time to minimize flooding and ponding lacdpw 2014 yu and kaighn 1992 the implementation of ibs as a bmp in urban areas is especially challenging due to the limited land availability figs 7 and 8 clearly demonstrate that the installation of up to 5 dws with a minimal footprint can easily replace a 70 m diameter surface of 3847 m2 ib dws offer unique design opportunities to install such devices in places where space is very tight such as parking lots parks and streets figs 5 7 and 8 demonstrated that ibs require a large volume of water to saturate the vadose zone μs before recharge can occur this leads to a significant loss when the source water is seasonal stormwater rainwater and peak river flow or expensive recycled wastewater a previous study on vadose zone trenches demonstrated that infiltration increased between parallel trenches with increasing spacing and number of trenches and when trenches were continuously full heilweil et al 2015 dw offers flexibility to install with adequate spacing between each unit to enhance the infiltration and recharge even in urban areas the presented numerical modeling tool can be used to predict the best distribution of dws and it can be done with high accuracy when the site specific subsurface heterogeneity information is available ibs are generally considered as the mar technique of choice to enhance aquifer recharge and achieve groundwater sustainability teatini et al 2015 however expected long term declines in the groundwater level could result in compaction of fine grained deposits which causes land subsidence galloway et al 1999 for example land subsidence from groundwater pumping in the san joaquin valley of central california began in the mid 1920 s and by 1970 about 13500 km2 of land had subsided more than 0 3 m bertoldi et al 1991 poland et al 1975 the sustainable groundwater management act sgma recognizes that groundwater is best managed at the local level due to variabilities in geographic geologic and hydrologic parameters the sgma provides 20 years to implement reliable groundwater management plans to achieve long term groundwater sustainability faunt et al 2016 there is therefore an urgency for rapid recharge of these depleted aquifers before the aquifer storage space is irreversibly lost maples et al 2019 in their modeling study on the infiltration basin at central valley ca demonstrated that geologic heterogeneity plays a huge role in the arrival time of recharge at the water table the recharge potential from an ib is highly dependent on subsurface geologic structure with a nearly two orders of magnitude range of recharge across the domain they suggested that networks of interconnected coarse texture facies provide a pathway for rapid infiltration and that the fine texture facies accommodate a substantial fraction of the total recharge volume even for coarse dominated sites maples et al 2019 similarly this research demonstrates that it can take several years for an ib to begin recharging an aquifer depending on its size and the subsurface heterogeneity and permeability in contrast dws can rapidly achieve significant amounts of recharge in a shallow unconfined aquifer within a much shorter time frame natural geologic processes in sedimentary basins tend to produce soil textural layers and lenses that form parallel to the soil surface these layered soil profiles can often involve highly permeable sand layers followed by less permeable clay lenses with extensions and thicknesses of several tens to hundreds of meters phillips and lorz 2008 numerical experiments iii table 1 were therefore conducted to study the influence of a shallow clay layer under an ib on infiltration and recharge a layered soil profile with sand loamy sand sandy loam sandy clay loam and clay was considered in these simulations table 1 fig s2 shows an illustration of the simulation domain and soil layers when considering an ib a dw and a dw integrated into an ib denoted as db ib independent ib and dw scenarios were used to better understand the infiltration and recharge behavior in the layered soil profile with these two structures in contrast the dw ib approach fig 9 b allowed us to assess the potential benefits of this mar system fig 9a and 9b show the water content θ and pressure head h profiles respectively for all three flow domains after 1 5 days the results demonstrate that once the moisture front reached the clay layer water started spreading laterally the effect of a low permeable soil layer on the infiltration rate and downward migration from an infiltration basin was previously demonstrated using numerical experiments d aniello et al 2019 this enhanced lateral movement of water in the clay layer can be attributed to the fact that at higher tension the hydraulic conductivity of fine textured materials can be higher than in coarse textured materials and water may prefer to spread laterally in a fine bed than to move vertically through coarser ones routson et al 1979 sasidharan et al 2020 the presence of such geological formations under an ib could delay groundwater recharge from 1 to more than 100 years in contrast a dw that penetrates tight clay layers and releases water below them can facilitate rapid infiltration and recharge a dw can therefore be an ideal engineering solution to use in conjunction with an existing ib or when planning a new mar site when there are shallow clay layers and recharge is the primary goal the average one time installation cost of a drywell maxwell iv torrentresources usa personal communication 2020 is between 28 000 and 35 000 us dollar the maxwell plus torrentresources usa drywell with additional pre treatment can cost 38 000 45 000 us dollar or higher the average yearly maintenance cost vacuuming the sedimentation chamber to remove the debris and sediments for one drywell is about 1 000 us dollars per year since a drywell has a very small surface footprint developers do not usually lose any land when installing a drywell the land cost for a drywell can therefore be assumed to be nearly zero dejong 2020 consequently the installation and operation of a drywell over 20 years can cost around 48 000 65 000 us dollar whereas those for five drywells can cost up to 240 000 325 000 us dollar the orange county water district ocwd of california usa implements extensive mar programs using seasonal stormwater 185 million m3 per year and recycled water 123 million m3 per year for aquifer replenishment or recharge seawater intrusion control water quality protection and improvement hutchinson et al 2017 the major cost associated with ibs is the acquisition of land especially in highly urbanized areas with little available land for example the ocwd spent 4m us dollars per ha in 2014 to purchase land for a groundwater spreading basin hutchinson et al 2017 in addition clogging of the recharge facility is the biggest hurdle to maximizing the capacity of existing infrastructure a recent study conducted by the ocwd on a riverbed filtration system rfs demonstrated that this technique was highly effective in removing suspended solids in recharge water and increasing the recharge capacity of the receiving basin however the installation of an operational scale rfs at the site has an annualized cost of 5 1 m us dollar hutchinson et al 2017 constraints on land availability and costs of land acquisition and maintenance therefore make it difficult to transfer these mar techniques to other parts of the world especially in developing countries 4 conclusions numerical simulations using hydrus 2d 3d were conducted to evaluate the performance of an ib for infiltration and recharge under various design parameters i e diameter and area in a homogeneous soil domain the infiltration and recharge from an ib increase in a linear fashion with the ib s area however the arrival time of recharge at a depth of 60 m increases with decreasing ib area therefore installation of a large greater than70 m diameter ib is required when rapid recharge to a deep aquifer is essential additional numerical simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of a 70 m diameter ib and a 38 m deep dw for infiltration recharge and storage under various stochastic heterogeneity conditions the water content profiles for the ib and dw systems showed that after a 2 year constant head simulation the areas of infiltration and recharge were similar for both dw and ib the result demonstrated that during the first year of operation cumulative infiltration and recharge would be higher for a single dw than an ib under the same stochastic heterogeneity conditions additional comparisons between the mean cumulative infiltration and recharge volume from 70 stochastic simulations under steady state conditions demonstrated that five dws could easily replace a 70 m diameter ib to achieve significantly higher infiltration and recharge with a comparatively smaller volume of water lost to storage benefits from drywells were most pronounced during the first couple of years but still held under steady state conditions over 20 years of operation additional numerical experiments were conducted to understand the effect of a layered soil profile on dw ib and dw ib performance results demonstrate that drywells could potentially be used in combination with an ib to bypass low permeability layers such as a claypan bypassing clay rich layers can provide an additional benefit by preventing the mobilization of in situ contaminants to groundwater additional field scale research is warranted to assess the full implications of this practice on in situ contaminant transport and groundwater quality a dw provides additional benefits over an ib for example the surface area for a 70 m ib is 3857 m2 whereas it is only 2 54 m2 for a dw the acquisition of land for an ib operation can be expensive or the availability of land that meets ib engineering criteria might be scarce in an urban area in contrast drywells in the urban area often look similar to a utility hole and do not obstruct the development or landscape of infrastructures such as parking lots streets or pavement furthermore drywells have minimal or zero evaporative losses in comparison with an ib since all of its infiltration area is underground therefore drywells may be more attractive than an ib especially in highly urbanized arid and semiarid regions of the world one of the biggest challenges in the continuous operation of ibs is the sedimentation of colloidal particles on the surface and the formation of a clogged surface layer which requires a complete halt in operation and scrapping of the surface ibs also require additional maintenance such as vector control vegetation and landscape maintenance and testing of sediments from ibs for the accumulation of toxins metals and hydrocarbons cabmp handbook 2003 in contrast drywells offer an opportunity for pre treatment of the source water before injecting it into a drywell without altering its operation efficiency therefore dws can potentially replace ibs when the operation of ibs is not ideal or when dws can be installed in conjunction with ibs to improve their efficiency this study provides new design considerations and applications for dws in combination with ibs based on numerical modeling note that dws are often considered as a bmp for periodically capturing stormwater for recharge under transient water flow conditions however this study considers the use of a dw as a mar technique under constant head or continuous infiltration conditions dws also offer an opportunity to design a transient falling head mar system by merely turning on or off the source water pipe to control the residence time for contaminant attenuation however field scale validation and long term monitoring are essential to demonstrate these potential benefits and this will be explored in future projects credit authorship contribution statement salini sasidharan conceptualization investigation

4891,drywells dws and infiltration basins ibs are widely used as managed aquifer recharge mar devices to capture stormwater runoff and recharge groundwater however no published research has compared the performance of these two engineered systems under shared conditions numerical experiments were conducted on an idealized 2d axisymmetric domain using the hydrus 2d 3d software to systematically study the performance of a circular ib design diameter and area and partially penetrating dw 38 m length with water table 60 m the effects of subsurface heterogeneity on infiltration recharge and storage from the dw and ib under constant head conditions were investigated the mean cumulative infiltration μi and recharge μr volumes increased and the arrival time of recharge decreased with the ib area values of μi were higher for a 70 m diameter ib than an dw whereas the value of μr was higher for a dw after 1 year of a constant head simulation under selected subsurface heterogeneity conditions a comparison between mean μi μr and mean vadose zone storage μs values for all dw and ib stochastic simulations 70 for each mar scenario under steady state conditions demonstrated that five dws can replace a 70 m diameter ib to achieve significantly higher infiltration and recharge over 20 years of operation additional numerical experiments were conducted to study the influence of a shallow clay layer by considering an ib dw and a dw integrated into an ib the presence of such a low permeable layer delayed groundwater recharge from an ib in contrast a dw can penetrate tight clay layers and release water below them and facilitate rapid infiltration and recharge the potential benefits of a dw compared to an ib include a smaller footprint the potential for pre treatments to remove contaminants less evaporation less mobilization of in situ contaminants and potentially lower maintenance costs besides this study demonstrates that combining both ib and dw helps to get the

development of urban areas increases the impermeable surface area and the amount of runoff stormwater runoff threatens urban infrastructures bridges roads and buildings and wastewater treatment facilities while contaminants associated with impervious surfaces including fossil fuels nutrients and heavy metals can impair surface water and groundwater quality welker et al 2006 the elevated volume of surface runoff therefore has an adverse impact not only on the ecology and health of local rivers and streams but also has environmental effects miles downstream due to flooding erosion sediments and contaminants braga et al 2007 to tackle this problem engineers are investing time money and research to develop best management practices bmps welker et al 2006 infiltration structures such as infiltration basins and trenches coupled with retention compartments are widely used for urban stormwater management across the world dechesne et al 2004 2005 infiltration basins contribute valuable technical and environmental benefits by capturing stormwater runoff and letting it infiltrate into the underlying soil ferguson 1994 they are an especially attractive and feasible option when the surface soil has adequate permeability and the site has a shallow water table akan 2002 often ibs drain runoff from mixed watersheds that have residential commercial and industrial zones major roads and reclaimed water dechesne et al 2004 drewes and fox 1999 the use of ibs enhances groundwater recharge reduces the peak flow and volume of water in downstream networks limits pollution discharges to surface waters and decreases stormwater flows in sewer systems dechesne et al 2004 2005 infiltration basins are also attractive to the public because they can improve urban landscapes when designed as parks or playgrounds they have a lower cost than buried systems and act as drainage outlets from highways and parking lots dechesne et al 2004 2005 although there are many potential benefits associated with the use of ibs for stormwater capture their more extensive application has certain limitations for example even though ibs are used as a stormwater management system in the urban area it may not significantly decrease the total volume of runoff all the time traver and chadderton 1983 therefore they may not control potential flash flooding erosion and pollutants dechesne et al 2005 even though the topsoil layer of ibs can act as a barrier for pollutants mikkelsen et al 1994 nightingale 1987 contamination of the underlying soil and groundwater still remains an issue barraud et al 2002 dechesne et al 2004 in addition clogging of ib surfaces barraud et al 1999 gonzalez merchan et al 2012 hutchinson et al 2017 may occur through a combination of mechanical biological and chemical processes that depend on the sediment load and organic composition of the inflow water gonzalez merchan et al 2012 clogging reduces the infiltration capacity of ibs and causes frequent ponding or overflows reduces the treatment capacity and decreases groundwater recharge dechesne et al 2005 gonzalez merchan et al 2012 the annual cost associated with ibs maintenance such as scrapping of clogged surfaces and pre treatment of source water can be expensive erickson et al 2010 ibs can be operated for 20 30 years however the long term performance of ibs is neither well understood nor controlled during operation dechesne et al 2005 knowledge about the long term environmental impacts of ibs is limited since there is no information on how to restore functionality if adequate infiltration capacity is lost welker et al 2006 also there is a quantifiable decrease in the available area to operate ibs with increasing urbanization braga et al 2007 there is therefore a critical need for alternative mar practices that can resolve challenges associated with ibs in growing urban environments in the past decade dws have gained a lot of attention in the united states and across the world dws capture stormwater and infiltrate it in the vadose zone up to 10 40 m below the soil surface and at least 1 3 m above the water table lacdpw 2014 sasidharan et al 2018 2019 2020 dws are often used as a low impact development bmp engineering system to capture seasonal stormwater to maintain the urban green infrastructure this study investigates the use of dws for mar as an alternative and or in combination with ibs dws can be implemented as a mar technique in semi arid and arid regions where the groundwater table is deep e g 60 300 m or more when high permeable soils and or sufficiently large land areas for surface infiltration systems are not available or when the installation of deep boreholes in saturated zones are expensive bouwer 2002 liang et al 2018 there are several additional advantages of using dws over ibs for example dws have minimal water loss by evaporation a small installation area a large ponding depth hydraulic driving head a shorter recharge time and an opportunity for pre treatment of sediments and contaminants in source water edwards et al 2016 sasidharan et al 2018 2019 2020 a few major cities in california arizona and washington achieve nearly 70 100 percent of their groundwater recharge through dw infiltration and many other cities are planning to build dws cadmus 1999 epa 1999 graf 2010 marsh et al 1995 snyder et al 1994 dws are therefore an attractive option for mar in areas where an ib is not ideal or can be used as an integrated infrastructure to enhance the recharge of existing ibs several investigations have determined infiltration rates from infiltration basins bouwer 2002 bouwer and rice 1989 masetti et al 2016 in addition several researchers have compared the performance of an ib with other mar techniques for example lab scale experiments coupled with numerical modeling have demonstrated that clogging is likely to influence the infiltration capacity of certain mar systems e g infiltration basins more than others e g recharge wells glass et al 2020 a small diameter 2 5 5 cm diameter and 10 12 m depth well was reported to improve the infiltration in comparison to a spreading basin händel et al 2016a 2014 2016b however these studies used a small well that was not comparable to the drywell size of this investigation 1 2 m diameter and 38 m depth jokela and kallio 2015 compared the performance of deep injection wells 40 cm diameter and 32 45 m depth to a sprinkler infiltration system comparison between infiltration trenches and spreading basins demonstrated that trenches are promising to enhance infiltration when compared to spreading basins heilweil et al 2015 heilweil and watt 2011 in all of these studies the well geometry was not identical to a drywell and water was injected directly into the water table furthermore differences in vadose zone storage and stochastic subsurface heterogeneity were not considered in these works mar techniques are highly dependent on soil textural properties and the subsurface heterogeneity that controls both the permeability and flow fields for example the infiltration capacity will vary with the vadose zone thickness and the presence and distribution of high and low permeable soil layers and their connectivity to the underlying aquifer mantoglou and gelhar 1987 o geen et al 2015 schilling et al 2017 xie et al 2014 yeh et al 1985a 1985b many parts of the us have soil horizons layers that are cemented or consist of claypans or layers with strongly contrasting particle size distributions these layers can have exceptionally low saturated hydraulic conductivity ks values that severely limit the vertical movement of infiltrated water o geen et al 2015 this restricts the site suitability and operation of ibs and does not guarantee that aquifer recharge from ibs will occur over short time frames in some cases it may be several years the objective of this study is to compare groundwater recharge from dws and ibs under various homogeneous and heterogeneous subsurface conditions the hydrus 2d 3d software was used to directly simulate cumulative infiltration and recharge volumes from dws and ibs constant head conditions were considered in dws and ibs to determine the comparable upper limit for recharge subsurface heterogeneity was described in this model by generating stochastic realizations of soil hydraulic properties the performance of dws and ibs were assessed based on simulated values of cumulative infiltration and recharge the number of dws required to achieve similar or improved behavior to an ib and the long term operational benefits and costs the approach and numerical model tool in this research can be used to screen mar designs for a specific site applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 mathematical model the hydrus 2d 3d software package version 3 šejna et al 2018 šimůnek et al 2018 2016 was used to simulate infiltration redistribution in the vadose zone and groundwater recharge from dws and ibs hydrus 2d 3d numerically solves the 2 dimensional axisymmetric form of the richards equation using the van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 unsaturated soil hydraulic functions input parameters initial conditions and boundary conditions that were employed in these simulations were generally based on the results from dws located in fort irwin ca sasidharan et al 2020 table 1 provides a summary of hydraulic parameters that were employed in experiments i and ii of this study including the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks 0 046 m day 1 the shape parameter in the soil water retention function α 9 17 m 1 the residual soil water content θr 0 043 the saturated soil water content θs 0 39 the pore size distribution parameter in the soil water retention function n 2 76 and the tortuosity parameter in the hydraulic conductivity function l 0 5 in numerical experiments iii table 1 default values of hydraulic parameters for various soil textural classes were taken from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog carsel and parrish 1988 the data for axisymmetric dw simulations presented in this work one year constant head simulation was adapted from our previously published work sasidharan et al 2020 this manuscript provides details about the expanded simulation domain model parameters and the dynamics of water infiltration redistribution and recharge these results are compared with similar simulations for ibs in this work fig 1 shows a schematic of an example model domain geometry initial conditions and boundary conditions that were employed in the ib simulations the axisymmetric flow domain was 60 m h height 50 m w radius the ib had a height of 2 m and a diameter of 10 20 30 40 50 60 or 70 m and was continuously ponded with a water height of 0 6 m the model domain was discretized using a two dimensional triangular finite element mesh with the meshgen tool available within hydrus 2d 3d the mesh was refined at the top boundary of the domain where infiltration from the ib was simulated to reduce the mass balance error the finite element mesh was adjusted such that the size of elements was smaller 0 05 0 1 m near the ib surface and the grid size was gradually increased with the radial distance from the ib with a maximum element size of 0 5 0 75 m the quality of the finite element mesh was assessed by checking the mass balance error reported by hydrus 2d 3d at the end of the simulation mass balance errors were always below 1 and these values are generally considered acceptable brunetti et al 2017 a no flux boundary condition was assigned to nodes between the ib surface and the upper right corner and the whole right and left sides of the flow domain fig 1a nodes at the bottom boundary z 60 m were assigned a free drainage boundary condition i e the water table was assumed to be far below this point note that numerical experiments in this study do not account for the effect of the water table and future site specific analyses and modeling studies are therefore warranted a constant pressure head condition was considered in this study to evaluate the continuous long term performance of an ib and potential application of a dw as an independent or integrated infrastructure with an ib to represent a continuously filled ib 0 6 m the total head h h z at the upper boundary at z 1 4 to 2 m was constant i e the pressure head decreased linearly with depth from 0 6 m at the bottom of the ib z 2 m to 0 at the water level z 1 4 m fig 1 the initial condition in the flow domain was specified in terms of the soil water pressure head h x z and was set equal to a constant pressure head of 0 5 m fig 1 sasidharan et al 2020 2 2 numerical experiment 2 2 1 homogeneous domain numerical experiments i table 1 were conducted to determine the values of cumulative infiltration i and cumulative recharge r after 730 days 2 years as a function of the area of ib when considering a homogeneous fort irwin soil the hydraulic parameters for the fort irwin soil table 1 were taken from sasidharan et al 2020 the value of i was collected over simulated time as the total volume of water infiltrated from the ib similarly the value of r was calculated as the total volume of water drained through the bottom free drainage boundary note that all this information was available in output files of the hydrus 2d 3d software 2 2 2 heterogeneous domain numerical experiments i considered idealized homogeneous soil systems however most field scale soil profiles are highly heterogeneous with hydraulic parameters changing over short distances in this study highly permeable horizontal and vertical soil layers lenses were represented using the miller miller similitude geostatistical approach which has been widely used in previous research feyen et al 1998 roth 1995 roth and hammel 1996 sasidharan et al 2019 2020 vereecken et al 2007 the hydrus 2d 3d computer software has an option to generate stochastic distributions of hydraulic conductivity αk and pressure head αh scaling factors using the miller miller similitude approximation miller and miller 1956 which links these two scaling factors as follows αk αh 2 a lognormal distribution of scaling factors was employed and the stochastic field was generated using the standard deviation σ of log10 αk and its correlation length in the lateral the x correlation length x and vertical the z correlation length z directions procedures for generating autocorrelated or uncorrelated scaling factor fields and the original algorithm used in hydrus have been described in detail in the literature el kadi 1986 freeze 1975 mejía and rodríguez iturbe 1974 constant head ib simulations that employed stochastic realizations were conducted to accurately capture and compare the infiltration and recharge behavior of ibs with published constant head stochastic dw simulations sasidharan et al 2020 soil hydraulic parameters for the fort irwin soil table 1 were employed in conjunction with stochastic scaling factors in these simulations constant head simulations were used to determine i and r after two years in experiment ii table 1 multiple realizations of the stochastic parameters were employed and the mean values of i μi and r μr and associated standard deviations were calculated the following hypothetical combinations of scaling factors with variable σ σ 0 25 0 5 and 1 for x 1 m and z 0 1 m x x 0 1 1 and 10 m for σ 1 and z 0 1 m and z z 0 1 1 and 2 m for σ 1 and x 1 were used similar parameter ranges have been measured in the field freeze 1975 sudicky and macquarrie 1989 and employed in previous modeling studies sasidharan et al 2019 2020 only ten realizations were considered for these stochastic heterogeneity parameter combinations to minimize the computational time and cost our previous research demonstrated that ten realizations were sufficient to accurately capture the mean and variance of the infiltration behavior of dws in the heterogeneous realizations of the numerical experiments sasidharan et al 2019 2020 mean parameter values and 95 confidence intervals ci were calculated for all parameters from the ten simulation realizations of the ib after two years the calculated values of μi and μr for ibs were compared with those for dws sasidharan et al 2020 with the same heterogeneous domain after 1 year we also compare the steady state performance of a combined system with a 70 m diameter ib and a dw over two years in order to develop recommendations on how a dw can replace or complement an ib figure s1 demonstrates that the steady state infiltration i and recharge r rates were reached in constant head dw sasidharan et al 2020 and ib simulations after one and two years respectively these values of i and r were multiplied by a selected duration to determine the total steady state volume of i and r respectively after two years the corresponding steady state volume change of water in storage s in the vadose zone was determined as i r steady state values of μi μr and μs and their associated 95 confidence intervals over a two year duration were determined and compared for all dw and ib simulations 70 simulations for each mar approach steady state ib results were also compared with multiple dws up to 5 over 20 years of operation in this case values of μi μr and μs for two years were divided by two to obtain yearly results and then multiplied by the number of years of operation and the number of dws parameters μi μr and μs denote mean cumulative infiltration recharge and storage respectively under steady state conditions using the 70 simulations as discussed in the introduction fine textured soil layers can lead to reductions in soil permeability and recharge additional simulations were therefore conducted to investigate the use of various mar strategies to overcome these challenges in a profile with sand loamy sand sandy loam sandy clay loam and clay layers experiment iii table 1 soil hydraulic parameters for various soil textures were taken from the hydrus 2d 3d soil catalog table 1 mar simulations considered a single dw and ib separately as well as a dw integrated into an ib fig 1b and s2 2 2 3 cost analysis fordw and ib a brief economic analysis of the installation and operational costs of ibs and dws was also conducted literature values and data collected from various commercial operators were used for this purpose 3 result and discussions 3 1 performance of an ib in different soil profiles the infiltration recharge and vadose zone storage volume for an ib with a diameter of 10 70 m were investigated as a function of time 1 2 years and depth 7 60 m using hydrus 2d 3d numerical modeling experiments selected numerical experiments were conducted for homogeneous and stochastic fort irwin soil profiles to understand the effect of subsurface soil heterogeneity on ib performance 3 1 1 homogeneous soil profiles numerical experiment i was conducted to better understand the relationship between the size and the infiltration and recharge behavior of an ib in a homogeneous soil domain ibs with a diameter of 10 20 30 40 50 60 and 70 m were considered in this study it should be mentioned that some existing ibs are much larger 1000 acre 4 million m2 and can infiltrate up to 308 million m3 of water hutchinson et al 2017 however this work only considers a small ib with a maximum diameter of 70 m in order to minimize the computational time and cost associated with simulations on larger flow domains and to stay within the empirical experience catchment basin size at the fort irwin study site fig 2 shows the simulated water content θ profiles for ibs of different sizes after a 2 year constant head numerical simulation figs 3 and 4 present corresponding information about i and r in these same simulations fig 3a shows a plot of i versus time for two years 730 days of numerical simulation fig 3b shows a plot of i versus the ib area after one and two years the value of i increases in nearly a linear fashion over time fig 3a and with the ib area fig 3b the design and operation standards for ibs are set by various states and counties for example in virginia the maximum drainage area of an ib is restricted to 50 acres and the basin should be emptied within 48 h yu and kaighn 1992 in contrast los angeles county in california requires that the 85th percentile of a 24 hr runoff event be infiltrated within 96 h lacdpw 2014 however acquiring the needed land area for an ib can be expensive and challenging especially in an urban area engineers therefore often seek ways to minimize the surface area of an ib but this can be challenging because it may require a ponding depth that is either impractical or violates design parameters besides the actual configuration of an ib is largely dependent on the site specific topography and other constraints yu and kaighn 1992 ibs may therefore not be an ideal bmp or mar technique when suitable locations are not readily available such as in highly urbanized landscapes with utilities in karst areas and when surface slopes are higher than 20 percent yu and kaighn 1992 fig 4a 4b 4c and 4d show plots of cumulative recharge r as a function of time over one year and depth when the ib diameter was equal to 10 30 50 and 70 m respectively the value of r was negligible for all ibs with a 60 m deep soil profile during the first year this happens because most of the infiltrating water below the ib contributes to the change in the vadose zone storage until the pore space is filled the size of the ib influences the arrival time of the infiltrating water at a specified depth in particular a decrease in the ib diameter produced a later arrival time for example the arrival time at a depth of 22 m for an ib with a 10 m diameter was 164 8 days whereas it was 126 8 days when the ib diameter was 70 m this occurs because lateral spreading plays a relatively more significant role for smaller diameter ibs fig 2 fig 4e shows a plot of r as a function of the ib area at depths of 7 22 and 60 m after one and two years the value of r was very small or negligible after one year when the depth was 60 m but then rapidly increased when the vadose zone storage filled and the simulation approached a steady state condition at the end of the second year for example the value of r at a depth of 60 m after 2 years was slightly less than r at a depth of 7 m after 1 year fig 4e this reflects the difference in the vadose zone storage and the time needed to reach steady state conditions at these depths it also indicates that ibs may not be the ideal mar strategy when rapid groundwater recharge is needed for example the central valley in california is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world which heavily relies on surface water diversions and groundwater pumping for crop irrigation faunt et al 2016 greater reliance on groundwater during droughts has caused large scale land subsidence harter 2015 and the loss of up to 10 m of aquifer storage in some parts of the central valley scanlon et al 2016 rapid recharge within a short period is therefore essential for mitigating land subsidence and irreversible loss in aquifer storage in shallow aquifers 60 70 m however our experiment i simulation results demonstrate that the ib design will determine the arrival time for groundwater recharge in some cases this may take several years even for a homogeneous soil profile with high permeability 3 1 2 heterogeneous soil profiles in reality the natural subsurface is inherently heterogeneous and the layering of soil structures is very common hencher et al 2011 phillips and lorz 2008 sasidharan et al 2019 sidle et al 2000 smith et al 2008 uchida et al 2003 usda 2016 fig 5 shows representative θ distributions in stochastic domains under a 70 m diameter ib that had constant head conditions for two years the fort irwin soil hydraulic parameters and stochastic parameters x 0 1 1 and 10 z 0 1 1 and 2 and σ 0 25 0 5 and 1 were employed in these experiment ii simulations table 1 heterogeneous domains with x 10 1 and 0 1 lateral layering fig 5a 5b and 5c display wider θ distributions in the saturated area under the ibs compared to other heterogeneous domains however constant head simulation results indicate that a dw sasidharan et al 2020 with a 1 8 m diameter can create a similar sized cone of infiltration as a 70 m diameter ib fig s3 the operation of ibs is mainly controlled by gravity driven vertical water flow but the pressure head for an ib is very small 0 6 m in contrast a dw can have a pressure head of up to 38 m that pushes water initially laterally through high permeable zones and then water flows vertically by gravity therefore a dw with a very small surface footprint can create a recharge zone as big as a 70 m diameter ib in particular the surface area of a 70 m ib is 3857 m2 whereas it is only 2 54 m2 for a dw fig 6 shows values of μi and μr and their 95 confidence intervals after 365 days as a function of σ fig 6a x fig 6b and z fig 6c for the dw sasidharan et al 2020 and ib sasidharan et al 2020 previously demonstrated in dw simulations that the infiltration volume the distribution and volume of trapped water in the flow domain and the subsequent recharge are highly dependent on the subsurface heterogeneity similarly fig 6a shows that μi and μr tended to increase with σ fig 6a for both ib and dw an increase in σ leads to the formation of more permeable regions which enhance infiltration sasidharan et al 2020 the μi was higher for the ib than for the dw but μr for the ib was smaller than for the dw the value of μi and μr for the ib and dw overlapped for x fig 6b and in some cases μi and μr were higher for the dw than for the ib in contrast the value of μi was higher and μr smaller for the ib in comparison with the dw for various z fig 6c an increase in x and z creates larger horizontal and vertical lenses that can enhance the rapid movement of the wetting front in horizontal and vertical directions respectively sasidharan et al 2019 2020 the above numerical modeling observations can be explained by differences in the vadose zone storage and the time to reach steady state flow conditions in general the dw has less vadose zone storage and therefore reaches steady state flow conditions faster than the ib fig s3 recharge from the ib is therefore smaller than from the dw in the short term researchers have previously reported extensive lateral water movement but limited vertical water movement in different subsurface soil profiles mantoglou and gelhar 1987 routson et al 1979 sinai et al 1974 yeh et al 1985a 1985b it is important to understand the infiltration recharge and arrival time behavior during short term dw and ib operations to identify the best technique to infiltrate or recharge water rapidly fig s4 shows a plot of μi and μr as a function of time 365 days for ib simulations when σ 0 25 0 5 and 1 and when x 1 m and z 0 1 m the value of μi and μr tended to increase with σ but μr was orders of magnitude smaller than μi due to vadose zone storage the value of μr was equal to zero after one year for the ib when σ 0 25 whereas the recharge arrival time for a dw was approximately 100 days when σ 0 25 sasidharan et al 2020 fig s5 shows a plot of μi and μr for the ib when x 0 1 1 10 m z 0 1 m and σ 1 the values of μi and μr decreased with increasing x these trends reflect increasing water spreading with x due to larger lenses in the lateral direction with high permeability sasidharan et al 2020 the value of μr was again orders of magnitude smaller than μi due to the vadose zone storage the arrival time for the worst case recharge scenario x 10 z 0 1 m and σ 1 was approximately 250 days for the ib fig s5b compared to about 68 days for the dw sasidharan et al 2020 fig s6 shows a plot of μi and μr as a function of time 365 days for ib simulations when z 0 1 1 and 2 x 1 m and σ 1 the presence of highly permeable vertical lenses facilitates the faster downward movement of water and thus an early arrival time sasidharan et al 2020 however even for the best case recharge scenario x 1 z 2 and σ 1 the arrival time for the ib was approximately 135 days fig s6b whereas it was only about 34 days from the dw sasidharan et al 2020 the above results clearly demonstrate that dws have a much faster recharge arrival time than ibs 3 2 performance comparison between ib and dw an ib has several benefits when used as a mar technique however the biggest constrain on the installation of an ib often is land availability both in urban and rural areas direct injection wells such as aquifer storage and recovery has gained attention as a solution to this problem however injection water needs to meet strict water quality standards before being injected which are achieved using energy intensive treatments which makes this technique very expensive drywells usually are considered as a low impact development lid bmp for capturing episodic stormwater mostly in urban areas however this study proposes its potential use as a mar under constant head conditions where the installation and continuous operation of an ib are not feasible therefore additional numerical experiments were conducted to compare the infiltration and recharge performance between a dw and an ib under various scenarios the purpose of these specific simulations was to demonstrate the potential application of a drywell as an independent mar technique in place of an ib or its use in conjunction with existing ib infrastructure such a combination of a dw with an ib has never been systematically investigated before section 3 1 demonstrated that a single dw could infiltrate and recharge less equivalent or more water than a 70 m diameter ib depending on specific subsurface heterogeneity conditions additional calculations were conducted in this section to compare the overall performance of multiple dws and an ib fig 7 shows plots of mean steady state values of μi μr and μs for simulations with an ib and a dw 70 for each mar scenario in heterogeneous domains as a function of the number of dws the value of μi and μr for a 70 m diameter ib and a single dw were very close to each other fig 7a and 7b however increasing the number of dws at a location increases values of μi and μr over the ib correspondingly to their numbers interestingly the value of μs for a single dw was smaller than that for an ib but the 95 ci for the vadose zone storage volume for five dws overlapped that of a single ib these results demonstrate that five dws can easily replace a 70 m diameter a surface area of 3847 m2 ib to achieve significantly higher infiltration and recharge additional calculations were conducted to compare the performance of five dws with a 70 m diameter ib that was operated for up to 20 years fig 8 the results demonstrate that five dws can infiltrate and recharge significantly higher volumes of water than an ib even after 20 years of continuous operation these results have important implications for mar operations ibs often require a large surface area to infiltrate source water within the recommended time to minimize flooding and ponding lacdpw 2014 yu and kaighn 1992 the implementation of ibs as a bmp in urban areas is especially challenging due to the limited land availability figs 7 and 8 clearly demonstrate that the installation of up to 5 dws with a minimal footprint can easily replace a 70 m diameter surface of 3847 m2 ib dws offer unique design opportunities to install such devices in places where space is very tight such as parking lots parks and streets figs 5 7 and 8 demonstrated that ibs require a large volume of water to saturate the vadose zone μs before recharge can occur this leads to a significant loss when the source water is seasonal stormwater rainwater and peak river flow or expensive recycled wastewater a previous study on vadose zone trenches demonstrated that infiltration increased between parallel trenches with increasing spacing and number of trenches and when trenches were continuously full heilweil et al 2015 dw offers flexibility to install with adequate spacing between each unit to enhance the infiltration and recharge even in urban areas the presented numerical modeling tool can be used to predict the best distribution of dws and it can be done with high accuracy when the site specific subsurface heterogeneity information is available ibs are generally considered as the mar technique of choice to enhance aquifer recharge and achieve groundwater sustainability teatini et al 2015 however expected long term declines in the groundwater level could result in compaction of fine grained deposits which causes land subsidence galloway et al 1999 for example land subsidence from groundwater pumping in the san joaquin valley of central california began in the mid 1920 s and by 1970 about 13500 km2 of land had subsided more than 0 3 m bertoldi et al 1991 poland et al 1975 the sustainable groundwater management act sgma recognizes that groundwater is best managed at the local level due to variabilities in geographic geologic and hydrologic parameters the sgma provides 20 years to implement reliable groundwater management plans to achieve long term groundwater sustainability faunt et al 2016 there is therefore an urgency for rapid recharge of these depleted aquifers before the aquifer storage space is irreversibly lost maples et al 2019 in their modeling study on the infiltration basin at central valley ca demonstrated that geologic heterogeneity plays a huge role in the arrival time of recharge at the water table the recharge potential from an ib is highly dependent on subsurface geologic structure with a nearly two orders of magnitude range of recharge across the domain they suggested that networks of interconnected coarse texture facies provide a pathway for rapid infiltration and that the fine texture facies accommodate a substantial fraction of the total recharge volume even for coarse dominated sites maples et al 2019 similarly this research demonstrates that it can take several years for an ib to begin recharging an aquifer depending on its size and the subsurface heterogeneity and permeability in contrast dws can rapidly achieve significant amounts of recharge in a shallow unconfined aquifer within a much shorter time frame natural geologic processes in sedimentary basins tend to produce soil textural layers and lenses that form parallel to the soil surface these layered soil profiles can often involve highly permeable sand layers followed by less permeable clay lenses with extensions and thicknesses of several tens to hundreds of meters phillips and lorz 2008 numerical experiments iii table 1 were therefore conducted to study the influence of a shallow clay layer under an ib on infiltration and recharge a layered soil profile with sand loamy sand sandy loam sandy clay loam and clay was considered in these simulations table 1 fig s2 shows an illustration of the simulation domain and soil layers when considering an ib a dw and a dw integrated into an ib denoted as db ib independent ib and dw scenarios were used to better understand the infiltration and recharge behavior in the layered soil profile with these two structures in contrast the dw ib approach fig 9 b allowed us to assess the potential benefits of this mar system fig 9a and 9b show the water content θ and pressure head h profiles respectively for all three flow domains after 1 5 days the results demonstrate that once the moisture front reached the clay layer water started spreading laterally the effect of a low permeable soil layer on the infiltration rate and downward migration from an infiltration basin was previously demonstrated using numerical experiments d aniello et al 2019 this enhanced lateral movement of water in the clay layer can be attributed to the fact that at higher tension the hydraulic conductivity of fine textured materials can be higher than in coarse textured materials and water may prefer to spread laterally in a fine bed than to move vertically through coarser ones routson et al 1979 sasidharan et al 2020 the presence of such geological formations under an ib could delay groundwater recharge from 1 to more than 100 years in contrast a dw that penetrates tight clay layers and releases water below them can facilitate rapid infiltration and recharge a dw can therefore be an ideal engineering solution to use in conjunction with an existing ib or when planning a new mar site when there are shallow clay layers and recharge is the primary goal the average one time installation cost of a drywell maxwell iv torrentresources usa personal communication 2020 is between 28 000 and 35 000 us dollar the maxwell plus torrentresources usa drywell with additional pre treatment can cost 38 000 45 000 us dollar or higher the average yearly maintenance cost vacuuming the sedimentation chamber to remove the debris and sediments for one drywell is about 1 000 us dollars per year since a drywell has a very small surface footprint developers do not usually lose any land when installing a drywell the land cost for a drywell can therefore be assumed to be nearly zero dejong 2020 consequently the installation and operation of a drywell over 20 years can cost around 48 000 65 000 us dollar whereas those for five drywells can cost up to 240 000 325 000 us dollar the orange county water district ocwd of california usa implements extensive mar programs using seasonal stormwater 185 million m3 per year and recycled water 123 million m3 per year for aquifer replenishment or recharge seawater intrusion control water quality protection and improvement hutchinson et al 2017 the major cost associated with ibs is the acquisition of land especially in highly urbanized areas with little available land for example the ocwd spent 4m us dollars per ha in 2014 to purchase land for a groundwater spreading basin hutchinson et al 2017 in addition clogging of the recharge facility is the biggest hurdle to maximizing the capacity of existing infrastructure a recent study conducted by the ocwd on a riverbed filtration system rfs demonstrated that this technique was highly effective in removing suspended solids in recharge water and increasing the recharge capacity of the receiving basin however the installation of an operational scale rfs at the site has an annualized cost of 5 1 m us dollar hutchinson et al 2017 constraints on land availability and costs of land acquisition and maintenance therefore make it difficult to transfer these mar techniques to other parts of the world especially in developing countries 4 conclusions numerical simulations using hydrus 2d 3d were conducted to evaluate the performance of an ib for infiltration and recharge under various design parameters i e diameter and area in a homogeneous soil domain the infiltration and recharge from an ib increase in a linear fashion with the ib s area however the arrival time of recharge at a depth of 60 m increases with decreasing ib area therefore installation of a large greater than70 m diameter ib is required when rapid recharge to a deep aquifer is essential additional numerical simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of a 70 m diameter ib and a 38 m deep dw for infiltration recharge and storage under various stochastic heterogeneity conditions the water content profiles for the ib and dw systems showed that after a 2 year constant head simulation the areas of infiltration and recharge were similar for both dw and ib the result demonstrated that during the first year of operation cumulative infiltration and recharge would be higher for a single dw than an ib under the same stochastic heterogeneity conditions additional comparisons between the mean cumulative infiltration and recharge volume from 70 stochastic simulations under steady state conditions demonstrated that five dws could easily replace a 70 m diameter ib to achieve significantly higher infiltration and recharge with a comparatively smaller volume of water lost to storage benefits from drywells were most pronounced during the first couple of years but still held under steady state conditions over 20 years of operation additional numerical experiments were conducted to understand the effect of a layered soil profile on dw ib and dw ib performance results demonstrate that drywells could potentially be used in combination with an ib to bypass low permeability layers such as a claypan bypassing clay rich layers can provide an additional benefit by preventing the mobilization of in situ contaminants to groundwater additional field scale research is warranted to assess the full implications of this practice on in situ contaminant transport and groundwater quality a dw provides additional benefits over an ib for example the surface area for a 70 m ib is 3857 m2 whereas it is only 2 54 m2 for a dw the acquisition of land for an ib operation can be expensive or the availability of land that meets ib engineering criteria might be scarce in an urban area in contrast drywells in the urban area often look similar to a utility hole and do not obstruct the development or landscape of infrastructures such as parking lots streets or pavement furthermore drywells have minimal or zero evaporative losses in comparison with an ib since all of its infiltration area is underground therefore drywells may be more attractive than an ib especially in highly urbanized arid and semiarid regions of the world one of the biggest challenges in the continuous operation of ibs is the sedimentation of colloidal particles on the surface and the formation of a clogged surface layer which requires a complete halt in operation and scrapping of the surface ibs also require additional maintenance such as vector control vegetation and landscape maintenance and testing of sediments from ibs for the accumulation of toxins metals and hydrocarbons cabmp handbook 2003 in contrast drywells offer an opportunity for pre treatment of the source water before injecting it into a drywell without altering its operation efficiency therefore dws can potentially replace ibs when the operation of ibs is not ideal or when dws can be installed in conjunction with ibs to improve their efficiency this study provides new design considerations and applications for dws in combination with ibs based on numerical modeling note that dws are often considered as a bmp for periodically capturing stormwater for recharge under transient water flow conditions however this study considers the use of a dw as a mar technique under constant head or continuous infiltration conditions dws also offer an opportunity to design a transient falling head mar system by merely turning on or off the source water pipe to control the residence time for contaminant attenuation however field scale validation and long term monitoring are essential to demonstrate these potential benefits and this will be explored in future projects credit authorship contribution statement salini sasidharan conceptualization investigation

4892,natural water retention measures nwrms belong to the broad range of nature based solutions and are receiving increased attention for targeting environmental problems of river catchments as they effectively support the restoration of natural processes and cycles challenges involved in nwrms planning include the development of tools able to project and diagnose the effects at different spatial scales e g catchment or the reach this paper focuses on nwrms addressing fine bed material deposits fbmds with the aim of a assessing factors and scales that control fbmds b simulating the cascading impact of nwrms on catchment hydrology sediment loads reach hydraulics and fbmd and c assessing the effectiveness of nwrms in targeting fbmds at different spatial scales catchment and reach a modeling cascade was used to propagate the effects this included a hydrological model swat a hydraulic model hec ras and a spatially distributed random forest ensemble to model fbmds risk for the aist catchment 650 km2 austria our results show that upstream sediment loads are an important predictor controlling the likelihood of sites to be classified as low risk the effectiveness of nwrms in reducing fbmds is variable and depends on the target risk class vegetated filter strips that can trap sediments before they enter into the stream are more effective in increasing the extent of the river network towards natural conditions 5 increase compared to baseline sediment retention ponds are effective in reducing the extent of reaches where instream habitats are completely clogged by fbmds 8 hydromorphological improvements are effective in targeting sites where fbmds are transported even during mean flow 10 a combination of nwrms could benefit both high risk as well as low risk sites the effectiveness of nwrms can greatly differ when both reach and catchment diagnostics are analyzed thus multi scale assessment of the effectiveness can support nwrms planning by unraveling all the potential benefits and highlighting tradeoffs hidden by analyses limited to a single spatial scale keywords modeling cascade swat sediment retention measures multiple spatial scales 1 introduction freshwater ecosystems are threatened by multiple pressures including organic and inorganic pollution geomorphological alterations land use change and climate change borgwardt et al 2019 grizzetti et al 2017 complex interactions between such diverse pressures occur at different spatial scales bracken et al 2015 stoll et al 2016 and the resulting physicochemical morphological and habitat alterations impact water use quality security and biodiversity strayer and dudgeon 2010 vörösmarty et al 2010 with subsequent losses of ecosystem functions and services dodds et al 2013 natural water retention measures nwrms include a broad set of in stream off stream structural and management practices that aim to mitigate negative impacts of human activities on freshwater ecosystems burek et al 2012 collentine and futter 2018 european commission 2013 2012 recently introduced in the european policy nwrms are part of the broader concept of nature based solutions as they use natural processes and cycles to generate benefits to society and the environment keesstra et al 2018 nesshöver et al 2017 nwrms are targeting the alteration of hydrological nutrient and sediment cycles similarly to agricultural and forestry best management practices liu et al 2017 however with nwrms the focus is on the restoration and rehabilitation of degraded aquatic ecosystems therefore the planning and implementation of nwrms can take place at very different spatial scales ranging from local habitats to catchments in this regard at least two challenges exist that hinder the realization of the full potential benefits resulting from the implementation of nwrms the first challenge is related to the development of tools or tool kits able to propagate the effects of nwrms at different spatial scales river systems are shaped by interactions between processes acting at very different spatial scales ranging from catchment hydrological response soil erosion sediment transport down to the reach meso and micro scale local hydraulics nutrient processing in the hyporheic zone sediment deposition and resuspension jähnig et al 2012 stoll et al 2016 current studies have used large scale catchment hydrological models 102 km2 to predict biotic and abiotic responses to the implementation of some nwrms at the reach scale einheuser et al 2012 sommerlot et al 2013 woznicki et al 2015 however such developments neglect the important role of meso and micro scale 102 m2 conditions for local hydraulics nutrient and sediment transport guse et al 2015 kail et al 2015 modeling cascades mcs integrate models with different spatial scales and purposes jähnig et al 2012 lian et al 2007 for example baldan et al 2020 integrated a catchment scale hydrological and sediment generation model with a reach scale hydraulic model and a mesohabitat scale sediment deposition model mcs offer the potential to propagate the effects of nwrm along different spatial scales the second challenge is related to the scale at which the effects of nwrms are assessed zhang and chui 2019 zhang et al 2017 hydrological models are used for assessing the effectiveness of nwrms at the catchment scale liu et al 2017 rao et al 2009 this approach supports the planning process by providing information on the cumulative effectiveness compliance with regulatory frameworks lam et al 2011 and tradeoffs with other environmental or societal sectors e g agricultural production haas et al 2017 it also allows the exploration of different targeting allocation and optimization strategies teshager et al 2017 yang and best 2015 zhang and chui 2018 however this approach does not evaluate effects of nwrms at the local scale e g river reach or mesohabitat scale liu et al 2017 xie et al 2015 that are relevant for river management the effectiveness of a single nwrm can be assessed locally with experimental studies monitoring numerical modeling or remote sensing but upscaling possibilities are limited golden and hoghooghi 2018 zhang and chui 2019 therefore tools that allow for the diagnosis of their effects at multiple spatial scales can greatly support the planning of nwrms fine bed material can be distinguished from the natural substrate because much of it is commonly transported and deposited selectively lisle and hilton 1999 excessive fine bed material deposition has become an increasing concern for river systems around the world for its negative effects on the morphological physicochemical and biological status of water bodies doretto et al 2018 naden et al 2016 wohl et al 2015 fine bed material deposits fbmds alter the river morphology by reducing the heterogeneity of mesohabitat structures pool riffle plain bed hauer 2015 at smaller spatial scales fbmds can clog the hyporheic zone matrix leading to accumulation of toxic substances and to dissolved oxygen depletion geist and auerswald 2007 mueller et al 2013 scheder et al 2015 thus fbmds also can potentially impair fish spawning sternecker and geist 2010 and reduce macroinvertebrate abundances larsen et al 2009 leitner et al 2015 generally fine sediment inputs and land use change are recognized to be a dominant factor shaping biological communities of fish mueller et al 2020 and macroinvertebrate doretto et al 2018 finally fbmds constituted of sand and fine gravel modal diameter 1 10 mm the focus of this study are particularly affecting the stream bed stability such size classes require the lowest critical water flow velocity to initiate their motion compared to coarser and finer size classes hjülström 1935 strayer 2008 unstable streambeds are also recognized to be detrimental for the biotic compartment fuller and death 2018 leitner et al 2015 fbmds are governed by a variety of catchment reach and micro scale factors bracken et al 2015 czuba et al 2017 hancock et al 2017 wohl et al 2015 despite evidence of the importance of soil erosion and fine sediment inputs for stream health mueller et al 2020 a clear link between fbmds and their controlling processes is still lacking anlauf and moffitt 2010 sutherland et al 2010 fbmds can be reduced with different nwrm strategies for example hydromorphological improvements hmi are structural modifications of the river morphology for increasing habitat heterogeneity bisson et al 1992 such modifications include removal of bank fixation addition of wooden debris installation of flow deflectors or cross sectional modifications such as re meandering or floodplain reconstruction haase et al 2013 cross sectional modifications can support the achievement of stable conditions for net sediment transport and prevent sediment deposition without targeting sediment fluxes flödl and hauer 2019 alternatively vegetated filter strips are buffers of dense vegetation located at the edge of agricultural fields and along river banks with the purpose of trapping sediments daniels and gilliam 1996 magette et al 1989 moreover sedimentation ponds can be implemented in agricultural and forested areas to store excess runoff water and to trap sediments mekonnen et al 2015 verstraeten and poesen 2002 given the challenges and the knowledge gaps highlighted above the objectives of this paper were to a apply a mc for identifying the controls for fbmds b propagate the effects of selected nwrms on the catchment hydrological response and sediment generation and on reach hydraulics and c diagnose the effectiveness of nwrms to mitigate fbmds at different spatial scales catchment and reach scales the assessment was undertaken for the aist catchment austria 2 methods 2 1 the aist catchment the aist catchment 650 km2 is located in the northeastern part of the state of upper austria fig 1 a the climate is temperate with an average annual temperature of 7 1 c and an average annual precipitation of 835 mm hdlo 2017 the aist river forms after the confluence of two main tributaries the feldaist and the waldaist draining respectively an agriculture pasture dominated landscape 47 main crops winter wheat winter barley corn silage and a pasture forest dominated landscape 49 with a small share of land use by settlements 4 the catchment is part of the bohemian massif ofenböck et al 2004 with granite and gneiss bedrock gba 2019 and sandy loam to silty loam haplic cambisols hengl et al 2017 rivers in the aist catchment have a mainly plane bed morphology with cobbles and sands as dominating substrates leitner et al 2015 while steep sections are classified as cascade type with a boulder substrate hauer 2015 both feldaist and waldaist are affected by fbmds in the form of sand to fine gravel modal diameters 1 10 mm fig 1b 2 2 modeling cascade the mc used in this study is composed of a sequence of models structured in a way that the outputs from the coarser spatial scale model can be used as inputs to finer scale models kiesel et al 2013 a complete description of the mc the models setups and performances is provided in baldan et al 2020 here a summary of the main components of the mc is presented illustration in fig s1 i the ecohydrological soil and water assessment tool swat 2012 v670 arnold et al 2012 simulates discharge and sediment generation and transport at a daily time step and at the catchment scale ii the hydrodynamic numerical 1d model hydraulic engineering centre river analysis system hec ras v5 0 5 brunner 2002 simulates hydraulics at the river reach scale iii an ensemble of random forests rfs r package caret kuhn 2008 using swat and hec ras outputs to classify the fbmd risk at the mesohabitat scale 102 m2 the semi distributed process based model swat discretizes the landscape in subcatchments and further in hydrological response units hrus unique combinations of land use soil type and slope see table s1 in the supplementary material for the input data used the model was first calibrated at five gauging stations for daily discharge then a second calibration for monthly discharge and sediment loads was performed as continuously recorded sediment data for the aist catchment are not available sediment loads for calibration were obtained using bi weekly total suspended solids data and flow constituents regressions for the five gauging stations baldan et al 2020 the model was calibrated for the years 2002 2010 and validated for the years 2011 2016 calibration and validation were performed at the daily time step for flow and at the monthly time step for sediment as measured by the kling gupta efficiency kge knoben et al 2019 the model performed well for both calibration kge 0 70 0 12 for flow and 0 67 0 21 for sediments standard deviation represents variability across flow and sediment gauges respectively and validation kge 0 78 0 10 for flow and 0 63 0 17 for sediment the calibrated swat model was used to simulate daily discharge and monthly sediment loads at the outlet of 103 subcatchments mean area 6 km2 mean reach length 5 5 km fig 1d high medium and low flow discharges 90th 50th and 10th percentiles were calculated from daily hydrographs modeled in swat and used to perform static flow profiles in the hec ras model hydraulics calculations were carried out for the feldaist and tributaries n 10 reaches length between 3 4 km and 32 6 km the waldaist and tributaries n 7 length between 4 5 km and 61 0 km and for the aist and tributaries n 3 length between 7 3 km and 21 8 km for a total of 20 reaches and 11 000 cross sections fig 1d water surface elevation for model calibration was measured in the feldaist system at three representative reaches ten cross sections each 250 m sections during low flow conditions the difference between the measured and modeled water surface elevation was always smaller than 3 cm considered acceptable according to bolla pittaluga et al 2014 miori et al 2006 field measurements of water surface elevation were not possible during high flow conditions here the calibrated roughness values from a flood hazard analysis study for the aist system were applied hauer et al 2015 outputs from both swat and hec ras were processed and used as inputs hereafter predictors to the rfs ensemble starting from the swat modeled daily hydrographs indicators of hydrological alteration ihas describing flow magnitude frequency duration and rate of change were calculated for each subcatchment r package eflowstats olden and poff 2003 and used as predictors tables 1 s3 predictors describing the average and peak 50th and 90th percentiles lateral and upstream sediment input into streams units t km 1 y 1 were calculated from the swat model sediment outputs tables 1 s3 predictors were generated also out of hec ras cross section outputs including flow velocity m s 1 flow depth m and shear stress pa tables 1 s3 all predictors were rasterized along the channel centerlines and resampled at a resolution of 50 m the swat simulations to generate the predictors covered the years 2002 2013 the rfs ensemble breiman 2001 uses the predictors listed in table 1 to estimate the fbmd risk class at the mesohabitat scale length scale 50 m the data used to train the rf models composition collected between december 2013 and july 2014 consist of the classification of the river bed into five risk classes ranging from 0 natural status low risk to 3 fbmd unstable even during low flows high risk hauer 2015 table 2 figs 1b s2 s3 the model compositions in the ensemble were calibrated on different random splits of the input dataset 70 for training 30 for testing for a total number of 1000 models rokach 2010 the use of ensembles ensures the stability of both the classification and the variable importance measure calle and urrea 2011 millard and richardson 2015 the performance of the model compositions was always acceptable accuracy 0 72 0 02 kappa 0 61 0 02 standard deviation represents the variability across individual models allouche et al 2006 for each model composition the class specific predictors importance was measured as the drop in accuracy when a predictor is randomly permuted strobl et al 2009 partial dependence plots friedman 2001 were used to relate the changes in the likelihood of each sand accumulation risk class when a single predictor is varied empirical partial dependence plots were fitted with two different functions monotonous log logicstic and optimum brain cousen r package drc ritz et al 2015 the best fitting function selected based on akaike s information criterion provides information on the type of the response monotonous positive negative slope or optimum global maximum minimum 2 3 scenario development and swat sediment control measures five different sets of sediment control measures were implemented in swat table 3 including three individual measures set i hydromorphological improvements hmi ii vegetated filter strips vfs and iii sediment retention ponds pnd with two different volumes design the last measures set was a combination of hmi and vfs for each set of measures two strategies for implementation were used i a catchment wide uniform distribution of the measures in each hru subbasin reach henceafter catchment strategy and ii a targeted implementation of each measure in specific hrus subbasins reaches henceafter local strategy criteria used for the local implementation were based on the current stream hydromorphological status and on the geographic position of hotspots of sediment generation modeled with swat scenarios were defined as a swat model setup with a unique combination of a measure type and implementation strategy table 3 scenarios were implemented by executing the following steps i modifying swat input files according to a scenario definition ii running swat model for the time interval 2002 2013 iii passing the resulting modeled outputs along into the next part of the modeling cascade the results of the ten scenarios were then compared to the baseline scenario the baseline scenario was implemented by running the models for 2002 2013 without any implemented measure 2 3 1 hydromorphological improvements for the catchment strategy hmi were implemented for each swat reach that was modeled with hec ras for the local strategy only the reaches that are classified as having a moderate to very bad status in the hydromorphological quality elements of the water framework directive were selected for the improvement fig 1d data source government of upper austria the implementation of hmi was done at the subcatchment level in swat by increasing the manning s channel roughness up to a maximum of 0 05 parameter ch n2 table 4 aldridge and garrett 1973 arabi et al 2008 cowan 1956 arcement and schneider 1989 a reduction factor corresponding to the fraction of the reach where hmi are needed fig 1d was applied to the maximum increase 2 3 2 vegetated filter strips for the catchment strategy vfs were implemented in every hru including forest dominated hrus for the local implementation strategy all hrus from the 17 subcatchments responsible for generating 88 of the total catchment sediment yield were selected for vfs fig 1d such an high number of subcatchments was considered to be acceptable as vfs are relatively low cost and are employed to target diffused pollution liu et al 2019 the vfs impact on sediment transport was assessed with the semi empirical routine implemented in swat that calculates sediment loads reduction as a function of the size of the vfs and flow channelization white and arnold 2009 the parameters filter con filter ch and filter ratio were adjusted to account for the impact of landscape heterogeneities on sediment trapping table 4 verstraeten et al 2006 the selected parametrization yields sediment trapping efficiencies of approximately 30 at the hru scale hösl et al 2012 zessner et al 2019 2 3 3 sediment retention ponds for the catchment strategy sediment retention ponds were implemented in every subcatchment for the local implementation strategy eight subcatchments responsible for 58 of the sediment yield in the catchment were selected for ponds implementation fig 1d as sediment retention ponds are more expensive to build than vfs and are designed to retain sediments with a higher efficiency ockenden et al 2012 rickson 2014 they were located in the few subcatchments with high sediment yields sediment retention ponds in swat are located off stream receiving a fraction of the subcatchment runoff and releasing it with defined outflow rules jalowska and yuan 2019 pond properties are lumped at the subcatchment scale thus an equivalent pond needs to be defined for each subcatchment neitsch et al 2011 the physical dimensions of the pond impact the water and sediment routing through ponds two approaches were used to define the required equivalent volumes the first approach stores the surface runoff resulting from a 10 year return period rainfall huffman et al 2011 the swat derived subcatchment specific rainfall runoff coefficients were analyzed together with precipitation data to assess the volume of the pond to store the calculated water yield which resulted in a volume per unit subcatchment area of 330 80 m3 ha 1 mean standard deviation across subcatchments hence after pnd300 measures set the second approach balances the sediment trapping efficiency ste and pond volume requirements by considering the mean annual 90th precipitation percentile as a design parameter papa et al 1999 urbonas 2000 resulting in pond volumes in the range of 45 5 m3 ha 1 mean standard deviation across subcatchments hence after pnd50 measures set in both setups 1984 2016 precipitation data were used the two sets of pond volumes were assigned to the pnd evol parameter in the swat model the other parameters defining pond volumes and area were calculated accordingly table 4 as the swat routine for pond outflow maximizes water storage for agricultural use jalowska and yuan 2019 new outflow rules were defined to allow for water storage during high flows and a gradual release during low flows the new criteria were implemented by modifying the outflow rules in the swat 2012 v670 source code as follows 1 1 if v p v o l t h e n o u t 0 1 2 if pvol v e v o l t h e n o u t v p v o l n d t a r g 1 3 if v e v o l t h e n o u t v e v o l where v is the volume of the pond ndtarg is the number of days needed to empty the pond pvol is the principal volume of the pond and evol the volume at full capacity therefore when the pond is filled above the full capacity volume no water retention occurs i e failure water storage and slow release occurs only when the volume is below the full capacity volume the ndtarg parameter was set to 5 to simulate a slow release of the stored water the permeability of the bottom of the pond pnd k was set to 1 mm h 1 habets et al 2018 sediments are routed in swat ponds with a simplified settling model based on equilibrium sediment concentration jalowska and yuan 2019 a one at a time sensitivity analysis was performed to check the sensitivity of each parameter with the new code fig s4 s7 the sensitivity analysis revealed the ste to have a low sensitivity to changes in pond volume fig s5 thus sediment parameters pnd nsed and pnd d50 table 4 were adjusted to obtain a ste value of approximately 70 i e within the ranges reported by mekonnen et al 2015 verstraeten and poesen 2002 and verstraeten and poesen 2001 2 4 assessment of the effectiveness in reducing sediment accumulations at different spatial scales the impact of nwrms on the swat and hec ras predictors table 1 was diagnosed at the catchment scale the relative percent change of predictors rcp compared to the baseline was calculated for each predictor the modal value of the rcp indices for each scenario namely mrcp was used as an assessment of the effectiveness of measures the impact of measures on the simulated fbmds risk was diagnosed at two different spatial extents i for the whole catchment and ii for selected reaches fig 1c tables 3 and 5 corresponding to sites of high ecological value reaches a b c baldan et al 2020 or to sites where the fbmds issue is severe reaches d and e first the spatial coverage of each fbmd risk class was computed in the selected spatial extent second the relative percent change and the absolute change in the spatial coverage of each fbmd class rce and ace were computed for each model in the rf ensemble the modal values of rce and ace namely mrce and mace calculated across all ensemble members for each scenario and diagnostic extent were also used to assess the effectiveness the uncertainty in mrcp mrce and mace estimations was assessed using the direction of the change index dc 2 dc 2 f 0 0 5 where f 0 is the fraction of rcp rce or ace that is positive the dc ranges between 0 and 1 with dc 1 when all the rcp rce or ace indices are positive or negative clear direction of the change and dc 0 when the distribution of rcp rce or ace is centered on 0 unclear direction of the change 3 results 3 1 important predictors controlling fine bed material deposits the assessment of the rfs ensemble s predictors importance shows that different predictors control the allocation of fbdms to different risk classes fig 2 a high flow shear stresses dominate for risk classes 0 1 and 3 low flow velocity and flow depth are relevant for class 3 for risk classes 0 and 1 peak upstream sediment inputs are also important risk classes 2 and 3 do not show a dominant predictor the fitting of empirical partial dependence plots shows that the relationship between the risk class likelihood of occurrence and predictors is different depending on the risk classes fig 2b risk class 0 natural conditions is more likely to occur for sites where shear stresses during high flow are high and when the upstream peak sediment load is low class 3 is more likely to occur when the high flow depth is high and the high flow shear stresses and low flow velocity are low while the dependency from the high flow shear stresses and high flow frequency has an optimum class 3 is more likely to occur when high flow shear stresses and flow depth are low 3 2 effectiveness of measures on hydrology hydraulics sediment loads at the catchment scale the nwrms implemented in the mc lead to changes in hydrology hydraulics and sediment predictors measured by mrcp figs 3 s10 s12 reductions in sediment loads are similar for both sediment retention ponds and vfs 40 4 and 28 2 respectively for the catchment strategy and 8 9 and 9 3 respectively for the local strategy in addition ponds affect the hydrological regime of the catchment with p300 being the most effective at reducing magnitude 11 5 for catchment strategy 1 6 for local strategy duration 12 2 for catchment strategy 1 4 for local strategy and frequency 20 4 for catchment strategy 2 3 for local strategy of high flows pnd50 are more effective in increasing magnitude of low flows for the catchment strategy 15 7 hmi provide the greatest increase in low flow magnitude for the local strategy 2 8 pnd300 are more effective in reducing high flow shear stresses 3 2 for catchment strategy 0 6 for local strategy and flow depth 2 7 for catchment strategy 0 5 for local strategy 3 3 effectiveness of measures on fine bed material deposits at the reach scale the baseline scenario status of diagnostic reaches is diverse table 6 fig s8 with reach a having a high aerial share of sites free from fbmds risk class 0 36 reaches b and c being occupied by intermediate risk classes 1 and 2 reach d being dominated by risk class 3 37 4 and e being dominated by risk class 3 67 the effectiveness of the measures implemented changes based on the diagnostic reach fig 5 in reach a pnd300 reduce the extent of risk class 0 and 3 mace 2 and 2 2 km respectively for the catchment strategy while the local strategy shows no clear preference ranking for measure types and an overall low effectiveness mace always 0 2 km reach b has a low sensitivity to the implementation of measures mace 0 2 km with hmi and ponds being able to reduce the extent of risk class 2 and increase the extent of risk class 1 both for the local and for the catchment strategy in reach c both ponds and vfs can reduce the extent of risk class 3 mace 0 5 km and increase the extent of risk class 1 mace up to 2 1 km with local and catchment strategies showing similar effectiveness in reach d ponds are effective in reducing the extent of classes 3 and 3 mace 1 km and increasing the extent of risk classes 0 and 1 mace 0 7 and 1 5 km for pnd50 respectively low effectiveness is observed for the local strategy mace always 0 2 km when compared to the catchment strategy mace up to 1 5 km in reach e sediment ponds are more effective in reducing the extent of risk classes 3 and 3 mace 0 4 km and 2 5 km respectively while in the local strategy only pnd50 are highly effective in reducing risk class 3 mace 2 km 3 4 effectiveness of measures on fine bed material deposits at the catchment scale for the baseline scenario the rf models predict sites with risk classes 0 and 3 to occupy a small share of the reach at the catchment scale respectively 11 6 and 5 9 table 6 fig s9 the effects of the measures implemented in the mc on fbmds at the catchment scale are diverse and depend on the implementation strategy measures that are most effective mrce fig 4 in reducing the spatial extent of class 3 are hmi 10 3 and ponds 18 5 however sedimentation ponds are not effective for class 3 when located strategically on sediment generation hotspots dc 0 32 for pnd300 while pnd50 do not reduce the extent both pnd300 and pnd50 are effective at reducing the extent of risk class 3 for the catchment strategy 28 9 and 18 1 respectively and the local strategy 5 8 and 8 3 respectively pnd300 and pnd50 are also effective at reducing the extent of risk class 2 59 1 and 56 4 respectively and increasing the extent of risk class 1 97 4 and 78 6 respectively for the catchment strategy but the changes are highly uncertain when the local strategy is implemented dc 0 34 for class 2 and 0 47 for class 0 when implemented locally alone or in combination with hmi vfs are more effective in reducing the extent of risk class 2 13 5 and 17 respectively and increasing the extent of risk class 1 15 5 and 13 5 respectively for the catchment strategy pnd300 is the only measure that increases the extent of risk class 0 while for the local strategy vfs alone or in combination with hmi are effective 4 7 and 3 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 important predictors controlling fine bed material deposits the ensemble of rf models allowed to rank the importance of the predictors in defining the fbmds risk classification consistent with the literature the local hydraulics were identified as the most important predictor controlling the in stream sediment depositions van rijn 1993 shear stresses that occur during high flow the most important predictor were computed for the 90th percentile of discharge which is often used as a proxy for bank full discharge that causes the maximum transport of sediments to take place doyle et al 2007 thus sites with low shear stresses are more likely to be prone to sediment accumulations the negative sloped dependence of risk class 3 from the flow depth might be an indication that the local morphology of sites with low shear stress risk class 3 has been already altered hauer 2015 in sites belonging to the high risk class the natural substrate is filled up with sediments the channel dynamics prevail with fbmds not being linked to the upstream channel supply of sediments in the catchment czuba et al 2017 on the contrary the amount of upstream sediment loads is an important predictor for low risk classes to occur i e low upstream sediment loads cause lower risk classes downstream suggesting sites with low fbmds risk are supply limited naden et al 2016 thus achieving a supply limited state along a reach can be a strategy for increasing the spatial extent that is free from fbmds however this strategy might not be sufficient for sites where fine bed material deposits are stable due to the reduced transport capacity sutherland et al 2010 understanding the controlling factors for fbmds is thus beneficial for a process based diagnosis for determining the critical sites i e the sites that are at high risk for fines deposits and for identifying the management options that can be implemented in a catchment collins et al 2011 naden et al 2016 wohl et al 2015 the approach used in this work allows to predict fbmds occurrence risk at the meso habitat scale neglecting other factors that are potentially driving spatial heterogeneities at finer scales such as the macrophytes cover reach sinuosity and spatial autocorrelation braun et al 2012 the developed relationships should be updated to include such factors if the mc was intended to be used at finer spatial scales downscaling can benefit greatly from including finer scale riverbed mapping and 2d hydrodynamic models in the mc e g kiesel et al 2013 4 2 effectiveness of measures on hydrology hydraulics and sediment loads at the catchment scale the relative changes in predictors after the implementation of nwrms were generally higher for hydrology and sediment loads than for the hydraulics this can be explained by the different responses of reach morphologies and structures e g pools riffles fast runs to the changes in flow percentiles hauer et al 2013 this variability in the response is lost when changes are averaged over larger spatial extents as noted in a mc by guse et al 2015 the hmis lead to an increase in low flow velocity high flow shear stresses and water depth this measure was implemented in swat with a simplistic approach with roughness increments failing to fully capture two important aspects first cross sectional modifications can be designed to target specific flow magnitudes e g flows above bankfull flödl and hauer 2019 second micro topographical roughness increases local turbulences and consequently might increase the fbmds transport capacity hauer et al 2019 on the contrary those sections of the river with reduced flow velocities might have increased sediment deposition a higher detail level can be implemented by modifying the hec ras geometries this approach might be labor intensive for a catchment scale analysis but is valuable when the analysis is restricted to smaller spatial extents e g following the approach in hester and doyle 2008 impacts of ponds on the water fluxes include the reduction of high flow magnitude and the reduction of high flow shear stresses pnd300 have stronger effects than pnd50 while effects on sediment flows are comparable sedimentation ponds can be filled with sediment in a short time after implementation verstraeten and poesen 2002 thus it can be expected that the effects of sediment ponds on hydrology and hydraulics will decrease quickly over time as the water storage volume decreases when the hydrological component is neglected sediment ponds and vfs have similar impacts on sediment trapping and a preference ranking should be established based on other criteria land availability or potential losses in water yield e g strauch et al 2013 assessing the effectiveness of nwrms on different environmental components through a mc can support decision making as changes in the hydrological hydraulic and sediment predictors are made explicit this allows for a comparison of possible management alternatives based on different environmental criteria liu et al 2017 rickson 2014 4 3 effectiveness of measures on fine bed material deposits at the reach scale our analysis revealed that both the effectiveness and the preference ranking of measures change when the results are examined in different diagnostic reaches in some cases results are contradictory when compared to the catchment scale effectiveness such variability can be explained by the fact that diagnostics at the catchment scale hinders the diversity in the local effects by averaging the changes over a large spatial extent the diversity in the responses found among the reaches can be explained by the local geomorphic conditions reaches a and b in the waldaist are located in a semi natural state e g generally good hydromorphological status table 5 with reduced sediment loads entering the stream reach c in the waldaist is also in a good hydromorphological status but the sediment pressure is higher on the other hand reaches d and e located in the waldaist already have a poor hydromorphological status and a higher sediment pressure sediment retention ponds are among the measures that show the highest variability in the response this can be explained by the interplay between the selected timing for outflow regulation five days and the time of concentration of the subcatchment located upstream of the diagnostic reaches the lack of a clear pattern in the local responses to nwrms implementation highlights the importance of considering different local conditions when simulating the impacts of measures to reduce fbmds in a river network guse et al 2015 to account for the contrasting results they could be used the first step of a multi criteria decision analysis kiker et al 2005 with the aim of defining a compromise measure set where criteria risk class to be improved and spatial weights high priority reaches can be defined furthermore the optimal spatial arrangement and intensity of measures that maximizes the reduction of the extent of high risk classes under the constraint of minimizing the loss of the extent of low risk classes could be further explored with optimization algorithms yang and best 2015 zhang and chui 2018 4 4 effectiveness of measures on fine bed material deposits at the catchment scale existing approaches to study fbmds make use of empirical linkages that do not consider the processes involved in sediment transport and deposition anlauf and moffitt 2010 bilotta et al 2012 naden et al 2016 sutherland et al 2010 the use of mcs can help filling this gap the assessment of the response of fbmds to predictors subsection 4 1 explains the observed nwrms effectiveness on fbmds by considering the intermediate cascading effects on different environmental compartments subsection 4 2 a prioritization of measures can be obtained based on the target risk class for instance the spatial extent covered by sites in risk classes 0 natural conditions and 1 low risk can be increased by implementing specific nwrms targeting sediment fluxes before they enter in the stream wharton et al 2017 on the other hand the effects of sediment ponds on the hydrology can reduce the in stream sediment transport capacity by reducing the peak flows and therefore lead to increased sediment deposition downstream moreover the spatial extent covered by sites in risk class 3 can be reduced by implementing specific nwrms able to improve the cross sectional transport capacity and the in stream bed quality auerswald and geist 2018 the additional implementation of vfs in combination with hmi shows the greatest reduction in the spatial extent while vfs alone do not provide significant changes sediment control measures alone are not sufficient to reduce the extent of the risk class 3 sites as the substrate is saturated with sediment and the remobilization of sediment stored in the upstream channel might occur naden et al 2016 our analysis reveals that a combination of measures targeting different aspects sediment generation hillslope sediment transport in stream transport capacity potentially has the highest effectiveness to reduce all the risk classes knott et al 2019 using synergies between in stream and catchment sediment transport measures to tackle fbmds have been recommended auerswald and geist 2018 but is still rarely considered in measures planning auerswald et al 2019 the interactions between different nwrms types can result in nonlinear cumulative effectiveness e g the interaction between hmi and vfs effects is linear for class 3 and nonlinear for risk class 0 optimization algorithms can be useful for testing different spatial arrangements and parametrizations chen et al 2015 yang and best 2015 zhang and chui 2018 4 5 implications for management in the aist catchment our results suggest an effective plan for sediment management in the aist catchment should involve the use of sets of measures tackling different aspects significant improvements for the risk classes 0 areal increase and 3 areal increase at the catchment scale can be achieved already when vfs are located on few sediment generation hotspots 17 of the catchment area and when hmi are located in reaches with a poor hydromorphological status according to the wfd approximately 10 of the modeled river network greater improvements for classes 1 up to 40 areal increase and class 2 up to 25 areal decrease can be achieved by increasing the implementation magnitude of hmi and vfs implementing nwrms in the aist catchment can also lead to synergistic benefits for species conservation and climate change mitigation in fact the reduction of river sections occupied by high fbmd risk classes has beneficial ecological consequences not only for the conservation of the highly endangered freshwater pearl mussel baldan et al 2020 hauer 2015 but also in general for the health of benthic communities leitner et al 2015 furthermore changes in precipitation runoff patterns have been recorded in the area hauer et al 2015 thus the implementation of structures increasing the mean water residence time in the catchment can be also an effective mitigation strategy for climate change impacts in the area hauer et al 2016 2013 5 conclusion in this paper we assessed the potential of different nwrms scenarios in mitigating fbdms this was done by propagating the effects of measures from the catchment scale to the meso habitat scale with a sequence of models in a mc framework general implications for fbmds management from this study are i the identification of the controlling factors for fbmds provides a rationale for the selection of the appropriate nwrms to implement ii fbmds responses to measures that are implemented can be different when diagnosed at different spatial scales iii combinations of nswrms have the potential to address multiple goals e g reducing the spatial extent of sites severely impacted by fbmds and increasing the spatial extent of sites in natural conditions thus planning of nwrms should account for the effects of measures across multiple spatial scales considering both catchment and local scales diagnostics when assessing the impacts on the reduction of sediment a multi scale assessment of the effectiveness of the nwrms can be beneficial to unravel all the potential benefits and highlight tradeoffs hidden by analyses limited to only one specific spatial scale a combination of measures has the potential to mitigate tradeoffs and provide sound solutions to fbmds finally the presented work underlines the advantage of implementing nature based solutions to increase the multifunctionality of the river network as discussed for the aist catchment nwrms implemented for mitigating the fbmds issue can also lead to synergies of soil conservation species conservations and climatic goals geist and auerswald 2019 credit authorship contribution statement damiano baldan conceptualization

4892,natural water retention measures nwrms belong to the broad range of nature based solutions and are receiving increased attention for targeting environmental problems of river catchments as they effectively support the restoration of natural processes and cycles challenges involved in nwrms planning include the development of tools able to project and diagnose the effects at different spatial scales e g catchment or the reach this paper focuses on nwrms addressing fine bed material deposits fbmds with the aim of a assessing factors and scales that control fbmds b simulating the cascading impact of nwrms on catchment hydrology sediment loads reach hydraulics and fbmd and c assessing the effectiveness of nwrms in targeting fbmds at different spatial scales catchment and reach a modeling cascade was used to propagate the effects this included a hydrological model swat a hydraulic model hec ras and a spatially distributed random forest ensemble to model fbmds risk for the aist catchment 650 km2 austria our results show that upstream sediment loads are an important predictor controlling the likelihood of sites to be classified as low risk the effectiveness of nwrms in reducing fbmds is variable and depends on the target risk class vegetated filter strips that can trap sediments before they enter into the stream are more effective in increasing the extent of the river network towards natural conditions 5 increase compared to baseline sediment retention ponds are effective in reducing the extent of reaches where instream habitats are completely clogged by fbmds 8 hydromorphological improvements are effective in targeting sites where fbmds are transported even during mean flow 10 a combination of nwrms could benefit both high risk as well as low risk sites the effectiveness of nwrms can greatly differ when both reach and catchment diagnostics are analyzed thus multi scale assessment of the effectiveness can support nwrms planning by unraveling all the potential benefits and highlighting tradeoffs hidden by analyses limited to a single spatial scale keywords modeling cascade swat sediment retention measures multiple spatial scales 1 introduction freshwater ecosystems are threatened by multiple pressures including organic and inorganic pollution geomorphological alterations land use change and climate change borgwardt et al 2019 grizzetti et al 2017 complex interactions between such diverse pressures occur at different spatial scales bracken et al 2015 stoll et al 2016 and the resulting physicochemical morphological and habitat alterations impact water use quality security and biodiversity strayer and dudgeon 2010 vörösmarty et al 2010 with subsequent losses of ecosystem functions and services dodds et al 2013 natural water retention measures nwrms include a broad set of in stream off stream structural and management practices that aim to mitigate negative impacts of human activities on freshwater ecosystems burek et al 2012 collentine and futter 2018 european commission 2013 2012 recently introduced in the european policy nwrms are part of the broader concept of nature based solutions as they use natural processes and cycles to generate benefits to society and the environment keesstra et al 2018 nesshöver et al 2017 nwrms are targeting the alteration of hydrological nutrient and sediment cycles similarly to agricultural and forestry best management practices liu et al 2017 however with nwrms the focus is on the restoration and rehabilitation of degraded aquatic ecosystems therefore the planning and implementation of nwrms can take place at very different spatial scales ranging from local habitats to catchments in this regard at least two challenges exist that hinder the realization of the full potential benefits resulting from the implementation of nwrms the first challenge is related to the development of tools or tool kits able to propagate the effects of nwrms at different spatial scales river systems are shaped by interactions between processes acting at very different spatial scales ranging from catchment hydrological response soil erosion sediment transport down to the reach meso and micro scale local hydraulics nutrient processing in the hyporheic zone sediment deposition and resuspension jähnig et al 2012 stoll et al 2016 current studies have used large scale catchment hydrological models 102 km2 to predict biotic and abiotic responses to the implementation of some nwrms at the reach scale einheuser et al 2012 sommerlot et al 2013 woznicki et al 2015 however such developments neglect the important role of meso and micro scale 102 m2 conditions for local hydraulics nutrient and sediment transport guse et al 2015 kail et al 2015 modeling cascades mcs integrate models with different spatial scales and purposes jähnig et al 2012 lian et al 2007 for example baldan et al 2020 integrated a catchment scale hydrological and sediment generation model with a reach scale hydraulic model and a mesohabitat scale sediment deposition model mcs offer the potential to propagate the effects of nwrm along different spatial scales the second challenge is related to the scale at which the effects of nwrms are assessed zhang and chui 2019 zhang et al 2017 hydrological models are used for assessing the effectiveness of nwrms at the catchment scale liu et al 2017 rao et al 2009 this approach supports the planning process by providing information on the cumulative effectiveness compliance with regulatory frameworks lam et al 2011 and tradeoffs with other environmental or societal sectors e g agricultural production haas et al 2017 it also allows the exploration of different targeting allocation and optimization strategies teshager et al 2017 yang and best 2015 zhang and chui 2018 however this approach does not evaluate effects of nwrms at the local scale e g river reach or mesohabitat scale liu et al 2017 xie et al 2015 that are relevant for river management the effectiveness of a single nwrm can be assessed locally with experimental studies monitoring numerical modeling or remote sensing but upscaling possibilities are limited golden and hoghooghi 2018 zhang and chui 2019 therefore tools that allow for the diagnosis of their effects at multiple spatial scales can greatly support the planning of nwrms fine bed material can be distinguished from the natural substrate because much of it is commonly transported and deposited selectively lisle and hilton 1999 excessive fine bed material deposition has become an increasing concern for river systems around the world for its negative effects on the morphological physicochemical and biological status of water bodies doretto et al 2018 naden et al 2016 wohl et al 2015 fine bed material deposits fbmds alter the river morphology by reducing the heterogeneity of mesohabitat structures pool riffle plain bed hauer 2015 at smaller spatial scales fbmds can clog the hyporheic zone matrix leading to accumulation of toxic substances and to dissolved oxygen depletion geist and auerswald 2007 mueller et al 2013 scheder et al 2015 thus fbmds also can potentially impair fish spawning sternecker and geist 2010 and reduce macroinvertebrate abundances larsen et al 2009 leitner et al 2015 generally fine sediment inputs and land use change are recognized to be a dominant factor shaping biological communities of fish mueller et al 2020 and macroinvertebrate doretto et al 2018 finally fbmds constituted of sand and fine gravel modal diameter 1 10 mm the focus of this study are particularly affecting the stream bed stability such size classes require the lowest critical water flow velocity to initiate their motion compared to coarser and finer size classes hjülström 1935 strayer 2008 unstable streambeds are also recognized to be detrimental for the biotic compartment fuller and death 2018 leitner et al 2015 fbmds are governed by a variety of catchment reach and micro scale factors bracken et al 2015 czuba et al 2017 hancock et al 2017 wohl et al 2015 despite evidence of the importance of soil erosion and fine sediment inputs for stream health mueller et al 2020 a clear link between fbmds and their controlling processes is still lacking anlauf and moffitt 2010 sutherland et al 2010 fbmds can be reduced with different nwrm strategies for example hydromorphological improvements hmi are structural modifications of the river morphology for increasing habitat heterogeneity bisson et al 1992 such modifications include removal of bank fixation addition of wooden debris installation of flow deflectors or cross sectional modifications such as re meandering or floodplain reconstruction haase et al 2013 cross sectional modifications can support the achievement of stable conditions for net sediment transport and prevent sediment deposition without targeting sediment fluxes flödl and hauer 2019 alternatively vegetated filter strips are buffers of dense vegetation located at the edge of agricultural fields and along river banks with the purpose of trapping sediments daniels and gilliam 1996 magette et al 1989 moreover sedimentation ponds can be implemented in agricultural and forested areas to store excess runoff water and to trap sediments mekonnen et al 2015 verstraeten and poesen 2002 given the challenges and the knowledge gaps highlighted above the objectives of this paper were to a apply a mc for identifying the controls for fbmds b propagate the effects of selected nwrms on the catchment hydrological response and sediment generation and on reach hydraulics and c diagnose the effectiveness of nwrms to mitigate fbmds at different spatial scales catchment and reach scales the assessment was undertaken for the aist catchment austria 2 methods 2 1 the aist catchment the aist catchment 650 km2 is located in the northeastern part of the state of upper austria fig 1 a the climate is temperate with an average annual temperature of 7 1 c and an average annual precipitation of 835 mm hdlo 2017 the aist river forms after the confluence of two main tributaries the feldaist and the waldaist draining respectively an agriculture pasture dominated landscape 47 main crops winter wheat winter barley corn silage and a pasture forest dominated landscape 49 with a small share of land use by settlements 4 the catchment is part of the bohemian massif ofenböck et al 2004 with granite and gneiss bedrock gba 2019 and sandy loam to silty loam haplic cambisols hengl et al 2017 rivers in the aist catchment have a mainly plane bed morphology with cobbles and sands as dominating substrates leitner et al 2015 while steep sections are classified as cascade type with a boulder substrate hauer 2015 both feldaist and waldaist are affected by fbmds in the form of sand to fine gravel modal diameters 1 10 mm fig 1b 2 2 modeling cascade the mc used in this study is composed of a sequence of models structured in a way that the outputs from the coarser spatial scale model can be used as inputs to finer scale models kiesel et al 2013 a complete description of the mc the models setups and performances is provided in baldan et al 2020 here a summary of the main components of the mc is presented illustration in fig s1 i the ecohydrological soil and water assessment tool swat 2012 v670

fbmd risk at the mesohabitat scale 102 m2 the semi distributed process based model swat discretizes the landscape in subcatchments and further in hydrological response units hrus unique combinations of land use soil type and slope see table s1 in the supplementary material for the input data used the model was first calibrated at five gauging stations for daily discharge then a second calibration for monthly discharge and sediment loads was performed as continuously recorded sediment data for the aist catchment are not available sediment loads for calibration were obtained using bi weekly total suspended solids data and flow constituents regressions for the five gauging stations baldan et al 2020 the model was calibrated for the years 2002 2010 and validated for the years 2011 2016 calibration and validation were performed at the daily time step for flow and at the monthly time step for sediment as measured by the kling gupta efficiency kge knoben et al 2019 the model performed well for both calibration kge 0 70 0 12 for flow and 0 67 0 21 for sediments standard deviation represents variability across flow and sediment gauges respectively and validation kge 0 78 0 10 for flow and 0 63 0 17 for sediment the calibrated swat model was used to simulate daily discharge and monthly sediment loads at the outlet of 103 subcatchments mean area 6 km2 mean reach length 5 5 km fig 1d high medium and low flow discharges 90th 50th and 10th percentiles were calculated from daily hydrographs modeled in swat and used to perform static flow profiles in the hec ras model hydraulics calculations were carried out for the feldaist and tributaries n 10 reaches length between 3 4 km and 32 6 km the waldaist and tributaries n 7 length between 4 5 km and 61 0 km and for the aist and tributaries n 3 length between 7 3 km and 21 8 km for a total of 20 reaches and 11 000 cross sections fig 1d water surface elevation for model calibration was measured in the feldaist system at three representative reaches ten cross sections each 250 m sections during low flow conditions the difference between the measured and modeled water surface elevation was always smaller than 3 cm considered acceptable according to bolla pittaluga et al 2014 miori et al 2006 field measurements of water surface elevation were not possible during high flow conditions here the calibrated roughness values from a flood hazard analysis study for the aist system were applied hauer et al 2015 outputs from both swat and hec ras were processed and used as inputs hereafter predictors to the rfs ensemble starting from the swat modeled daily hydrographs indicators of hydrological alteration ihas describing flow magnitude frequency duration and rate of change were calculated for each subcatchment r package eflowstats olden and poff 2003 and used as predictors tables 1 s3 predictors describing the average and peak 50th and 90th percentiles lateral and upstream sediment input into streams units t km 1 y 1 were calculated from the swat model sediment outputs tables 1 s3 predictors were generated also out of hec ras cross section outputs including flow velocity m s 1 flow depth m and shear stress pa tables 1 s3 all predictors were rasterized along the channel centerlines and resampled at a resolution of 50 m the swat simulations to generate the predictors covered the years 2002 2013 the rfs ensemble breiman 2001 uses the predictors listed in table 1 to estimate the fbmd risk class at the mesohabitat scale length scale 50 m the data used to train the rf models composition collected between december 2013 and july 2014 consist of the classification of the river bed into five risk classes ranging from 0 natural status low risk to 3 fbmd unstable even during low flows high risk hauer 2015 table 2 figs 1b s2 s3 the model compositions in the ensemble were calibrated on different random splits of the input dataset 70 for training 30 for testing for a total number of 1000 models rokach 2010 the use of ensembles ensures the stability of both the classification and the variable importance measure calle and urrea 2011 millard and richardson 2015 the performance of the model compositions was always acceptable accuracy 0 72 0 02 kappa 0 61 0 02 standard deviation represents the variability across individual models allouche et al 2006 for each model composition the class specific predictors importance was measured as the drop in accuracy when a predictor is randomly permuted strobl et al 2009 partial dependence plots friedman 2001 were used to relate the changes in the likelihood of each sand accumulation risk class when a single predictor is varied empirical partial dependence plots were fitted with two different functions monotonous log logicstic and optimum brain cousen r package drc ritz et al 2015 the best fitting function selected based on akaike s information criterion provides information on the type of the response monotonous positive negative slope or optimum global maximum minimum 2 3 scenario development and swat sediment control measures five different sets of sediment control measures were implemented in swat table 3 including three individual measures set i hydromorphological improvements hmi ii vegetated filter strips vfs and iii sediment retention ponds pnd with two different volumes design the last measures set was a combination of hmi and vfs for each set of measures two strategies for implementation were used i a catchment wide uniform distribution of the measures in each hru subbasin reach henceafter catchment strategy and ii a targeted implementation of each measure in specific hrus subbasins reaches henceafter local strategy criteria used for the local implementation were based on the current stream hydromorphological status and on the geographic position of hotspots of sediment generation modeled with swat scenarios were defined as a swat model setup with a unique combination of a measure type and implementation strategy table 3 scenarios were implemented by executing the following steps i modifying swat input files according to a scenario definition ii running swat model for the time interval 2002 2013 iii passing the resulting modeled outputs along into the next part of the modeling cascade the results of the ten scenarios were then compared to the baseline scenario the baseline scenario was implemented by running the models for 2002 2013 without any implemented measure 2 3 1 hydromorphological improvements for the catchment strategy hmi were implemented for each swat reach that was modeled with hec ras for the local strategy only the reaches that are classified as having a moderate to very bad status in the hydromorphological quality elements of the water framework directive were selected for the improvement fig 1d data source government of upper austria the implementation of hmi was done at the subcatchment level in swat by increasing the manning s channel roughness up to a maximum of 0 05 parameter ch n2 table 4 aldridge and garrett 1973 arabi et al 2008 cowan 1956 arcement and schneider 1989 a reduction factor corresponding to the fraction of the reach where hmi are needed fig 1d was applied to the maximum increase 2 3 2 vegetated filter strips for the catchment strategy vfs were implemented in every hru including forest dominated hrus for the local implementation strategy all hrus from the 17 subcatchments responsible for generating 88 of the total catchment sediment yield were selected for vfs fig 1d such an high number of subcatchments was considered to be acceptable as vfs are relatively low cost and are employed to target diffused pollution liu et al 2019 the vfs impact on sediment transport was assessed with the semi empirical routine implemented in swat that calculates sediment loads reduction as a function of the size of the vfs and flow channelization white and arnold 2009 the parameters filter con filter ch and filter ratio were adjusted to account for the impact of landscape heterogeneities on sediment trapping table 4 verstraeten et al 2006 the selected parametrization yields sediment trapping efficiencies of approximately 30 at the hru scale hösl et al 2012 zessner et al 2019 2 3 3 sediment retention ponds for the catchment strategy sediment retention ponds were implemented in every subcatchment for the local implementation strategy eight subcatchments responsible for 58 of the sediment yield in the catchment were selected for ponds implementation fig 1d as sediment retention ponds are more expensive to build than vfs and are designed to retain sediments with a higher efficiency ockenden et al 2012 rickson 2014 they were located in the few subcatchments with high sediment yields sediment retention ponds in swat are located off stream receiving a fraction of the subcatchment runoff and releasing it with defined outflow rules jalowska and yuan 2019 pond properties are lumped at the subcatchment scale thus an equivalent pond needs to be defined for each subcatchment neitsch et al 2011 the physical dimensions of the pond impact the water and sediment routing through ponds two approaches were used to define the required equivalent volumes the first approach stores the surface runoff resulting from a 10 year return period rainfall huffman et al 2011 the swat derived subcatchment specific rainfall runoff coefficients were analyzed together with precipitation data to assess the volume of the pond to store the calculated water yield which resulted in a volume per unit subcatchment area of 330 80 m3 ha 1 mean standard deviation across subcatchments hence after pnd300 measures set the second approach balances the sediment trapping efficiency ste and pond volume requirements by considering the mean annual 90th precipitation percentile as a design parameter papa et al 1999 urbonas 2000 resulting in pond volumes in the range of 45 5 m3 ha 1 mean standard deviation across subcatchments hence after pnd50 measures set in both setups 1984 2016 precipitation data were used the two sets of pond volumes were assigned to the pnd evol parameter in the swat model the other parameters defining pond volumes and area were calculated accordingly table 4 as the swat routine for pond outflow maximizes water storage for agricultural use jalowska and yuan 2019 new outflow rules were defined to allow for water storage during high flows and a gradual release during low flows the new criteria were implemented by modifying the outflow rules in the swat 2012 v670 source code as follows 1 1 if v p v o l t h e n o u t 0 1 2 if pvol v e v o l t h e n o u t v p v o l n d t a r g 1 3 if v e v o l t h e n o u t v e v o l where v is the volume of the pond ndtarg is the number of days needed to empty the pond pvol is the principal volume of the pond and evol the volume at full capacity therefore when the pond is filled above the full capacity volume no water retention occurs i e failure water storage and slow release occurs only when the volume is below the full capacity volume the ndtarg parameter was set to 5 to simulate a slow release of the stored water the permeability of the bottom of the pond pnd k was set to 1 mm h 1 habets et al 2018 sediments are routed in swat ponds with a simplified settling model based on equilibrium sediment concentration jalowska and yuan 2019 a one at a time sensitivity analysis was performed to check the sensitivity of each parameter with the new code fig s4 s7 the sensitivity analysis revealed the ste to have a low sensitivity to changes in pond volume fig s5 thus sediment parameters pnd nsed and pnd d50 table 4 were adjusted to obtain a ste value of approximately 70 i e within the ranges reported by mekonnen et al 2015 verstraeten and poesen 2002 and verstraeten and poesen 2001 2 4 assessment of the effectiveness in reducing sediment accumulations at different spatial scales the impact of nwrms on the swat and hec ras predictors table 1 was diagnosed at the catchment scale the relative percent change of predictors rcp compared to the baseline was calculated for each predictor the modal value of the rcp indices for each scenario namely mrcp was used as an assessment of the effectiveness of measures the impact of measures on the simulated fbmds risk was diagnosed at two different spatial extents i for the whole catchment and ii for selected reaches fig 1c tables 3 and 5 corresponding to sites of high ecological value reaches a b c baldan et al 2020 or to sites where the fbmds issue is severe reaches d and e first the spatial coverage of each fbmd risk class was computed in the selected spatial extent second the relative percent change and the absolute change in the spatial coverage of each fbmd class rce and ace were computed for each model in the rf ensemble the modal values of rce and ace namely mrce and mace calculated across all ensemble members for each scenario and diagnostic extent were also used to assess the effectiveness the uncertainty in mrcp mrce and mace estimations was assessed using the direction of the change index dc 2 dc 2 f 0 0 5 where f 0 is the fraction of rcp rce or ace that is positive the dc ranges between 0 and 1 with dc 1 when all the rcp rce or ace indices are positive or negative clear direction of the change and dc 0 when the distribution of rcp rce or ace is centered on 0 unclear direction of the change 3 results 3 1 important predictors controlling fine bed material deposits the assessment of the rfs ensemble s predictors importance shows that different predictors control the allocation of fbdms to different risk classes fig 2 a high flow shear stresses dominate for risk classes 0 1 and 3 low flow velocity and flow depth are relevant for class 3 for risk classes 0 and 1 peak upstream sediment inputs are also important risk classes 2 and 3 do not show a dominant predictor the fitting of empirical partial dependence plots shows that the relationship between the risk class likelihood of occurrence and predictors is different depending on the risk classes fig 2b risk class 0 natural conditions is more likely to occur for sites where shear stresses during high flow are high and when the upstream peak sediment load is low class 3 is more likely to occur when the high flow depth is high and the high flow shear stresses and low flow velocity are low while the dependency from the high flow shear stresses and high flow frequency has an optimum class 3 is more likely to occur when high flow shear stresses and flow depth are low 3 2 effectiveness of measures on hydrology hydraulics sediment loads at the catchment scale the nwrms implemented in the mc lead to changes in hydrology hydraulics and sediment predictors measured by mrcp figs 3 s10 s12 reductions in sediment loads are similar for both sediment retention ponds and vfs 40 4 and 28 2 respectively for the catchment strategy and 8 9 and 9 3 respectively for the local strategy in addition ponds affect the hydrological regime of the catchment with p300 being the most effective at reducing magnitude 11 5 for catchment strategy 1 6 for local strategy duration 12 2 for catchment strategy 1 4 for local strategy and frequency 20 4 for catchment strategy 2 3 for local strategy of high flows pnd50 are more effective in increasing magnitude of low flows for the catchment strategy 15 7 hmi provide the greatest increase in low flow magnitude for the local strategy 2 8 pnd300 are more effective in reducing high flow shear stresses 3 2 for catchment strategy 0 6 for local strategy and flow depth 2 7 for catchment strategy 0 5 for local strategy 3 3 effectiveness of measures on fine bed material deposits at the reach scale the baseline scenario status of diagnostic reaches is diverse table 6 fig s8 with reach a having a high aerial share of sites free from fbmds risk class 0 36 reaches b and c being occupied by intermediate risk classes 1 and 2 reach d being dominated by risk class 3 37 4 and e being dominated by risk class 3 67 the effectiveness of the measures implemented changes based on the diagnostic reach fig 5 in reach a pnd300 reduce the extent of risk class 0 and 3 mace 2 and 2 2 km respectively for the catchment strategy while the local strategy shows no clear preference ranking for measure types and an overall low effectiveness mace always 0 2 km reach b has a low sensitivity to the implementation of measures mace 0 2 km with hmi and ponds being able to reduce the extent of risk class 2 and increase the extent of risk class 1 both for the local and for the catchment strategy in reach c both ponds and vfs can reduce the extent of risk class 3 mace 0 5 km and increase the extent of risk class 1 mace up to 2 1 km with local and catchment strategies showing similar effectiveness in reach d ponds are effective in reducing the extent of classes 3 and 3 mace 1 km and increasing the extent of risk classes 0 and 1 mace 0 7 and 1 5 km for pnd50 respectively low effectiveness is observed for the local strategy mace always 0 2 km when compared to the catchment strategy mace up to 1 5 km in reach e sediment ponds are more effective in reducing the extent of risk classes 3 and 3 mace 0 4 km and 2 5 km respectively while in the local strategy only pnd50 are highly effective in reducing risk class 3 mace 2 km 3 4 effectiveness of measures on fine bed material deposits at the catchment scale for the baseline scenario the rf models predict sites with risk classes 0 and 3 to occupy a small share of the reach at the catchment scale respectively 11 6 and 5 9 table 6 fig s9 the effects of the measures implemented in the mc on fbmds at the catchment scale are diverse and depend on the implementation strategy measures that are most effective mrce fig 4 in reducing the spatial extent of class 3 are hmi 10 3 and ponds 18 5 however sedimentation ponds are not effective for class 3 when located strategically on sediment generation hotspots dc 0 32 for pnd300 while pnd50 do not reduce the extent both pnd300 and pnd50 are effective at reducing the extent of risk class 3 for the catchment strategy 28 9 and 18 1 respectively and the local strategy 5 8 and 8 3 respectively pnd300 and pnd50 are also effective at reducing the extent of risk class 2 59 1 and 56 4 respectively and increasing the extent of risk class 1 97 4 and 78 6 respectively for the catchment strategy but the changes are highly uncertain when the local strategy is implemented dc 0 34 for class 2 and 0 47 for class 0 when implemented locally alone or in combination with hmi vfs are more effective in reducing the extent of risk class 2 13 5 and 17 respectively and increasing the extent of risk class 1 15 5 and 13 5 respectively for the catchment strategy pnd300 is the only measure that increases the extent of risk class 0 while for the local strategy vfs alone or in combination with hmi are effective 4 7 and 3 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 important predictors controlling fine bed material deposits the ensemble of rf models allowed to rank the importance of the predictors in defining the fbmds risk classification consistent with the literature the local hydraulics were identified as the most important predictor controlling the in stream sediment depositions van rijn 1993 shear stresses that occur during high flow the most important predictor were computed for the 90th percentile of discharge which is often used as a proxy for bank full discharge that causes the maximum transport of sediments to take place doyle et al 2007 thus sites with low shear stresses are more likely to be prone to sediment accumulations the negative sloped dependence of risk class 3 from the flow depth might be an indication that the local morphology of sites with low shear stress risk class 3 has been already altered hauer 2015 in sites belonging to the high risk class the natural substrate is filled up with sediments the channel dynamics prevail with fbmds not being linked to the upstream channel supply of sediments in the catchment czuba et al 2017 on the contrary the amount of upstream sediment loads is an important predictor for low risk classes to occur i e low upstream sediment loads cause lower risk classes downstream suggesting sites with low fbmds risk are supply limited naden et al 2016 thus achieving a supply limited state along a reach can be a strategy for increasing the spatial extent that is free from fbmds however this strategy might not be sufficient for sites where fine bed material deposits are stable due to the reduced transport capacity sutherland et al 2010 understanding the controlling factors for fbmds is thus beneficial for a process based diagnosis for determining the critical sites i e the sites that are at high risk for fines deposits and for identifying the management options that can be implemented in a catchment collins et al 2011 naden et al 2016 wohl et al 2015 the approach used in this work allows to predict fbmds occurrence risk at the meso habitat scale neglecting other factors that are potentially driving spatial heterogeneities at finer scales such as the macrophytes cover reach sinuosity and spatial autocorrelation braun et al 2012 the developed relationships should be updated to include such factors if the mc was intended to be used at finer spatial scales downscaling can benefit greatly from including finer scale riverbed mapping and 2d hydrodynamic models in the mc e g kiesel et al 2013 4 2 effectiveness of measures on hydrology hydraulics and sediment loads at the catchment scale the relative changes in predictors after the implementation of nwrms were generally higher for hydrology and sediment loads than for the hydraulics this can be explained by the different responses of reach morphologies and structures e g pools riffles fast runs to the changes in flow percentiles hauer et al 2013 this variability in the response is lost when changes are averaged over larger spatial extents as noted in a mc by guse et al 2015 the hmis lead to an increase in low flow velocity high flow shear stresses and water depth this measure was implemented in swat with a simplistic approach with roughness increments failing to fully capture two important aspects first cross sectional modifications can be designed to target specific flow magnitudes e g flows above bankfull flödl and hauer 2019 second micro topographical roughness increases local turbulences and consequently might increase the fbmds transport capacity hauer et al 2019 on the contrary those sections of the river with reduced flow velocities might have increased sediment deposition a higher detail level can be implemented by modifying the hec ras geometries this approach might be labor intensive for a catchment scale analysis but is valuable when the analysis is restricted to smaller spatial extents e g following the approach in hester and doyle 2008 impacts of ponds on the water fluxes include the reduction of high flow magnitude and the reduction of high flow shear stresses pnd300 have stronger effects than pnd50 while effects on sediment flows are comparable sedimentation ponds can be filled with sediment in a short time after implementation verstraeten and poesen 2002 thus it can be expected that the effects of sediment ponds on hydrology and hydraulics will decrease quickly over time as the water storage volume decreases when the hydrological component is neglected sediment ponds and vfs have similar impacts on sediment trapping and a preference ranking should be established based on other criteria land availability or potential losses in water yield e g strauch et al 2013 assessing the effectiveness of nwrms on different environmental components through a mc can support decision making as changes in the hydrological hydraulic and sediment predictors are made explicit this allows for a comparison of possible management alternatives based on different environmental criteria liu et al 2017 rickson 2014 4 3 effectiveness of measures on fine bed material deposits at the reach scale our analysis revealed that both the effectiveness and the preference ranking of measures change when the results are examined in different diagnostic reaches in some cases results are contradictory when compared to the catchment scale effectiveness such variability can be explained by the fact that diagnostics at the catchment scale hinders the diversity in the local effects by averaging the changes over a large spatial extent the diversity in the responses found among the reaches can be explained by the local geomorphic conditions reaches a and b in the waldaist are located in a semi natural state e g generally good hydromorphological status table 5 with reduced sediment loads entering the stream reach c in the waldaist is also in a good hydromorphological status but the sediment pressure is higher on the other hand reaches d and e located in the waldaist already have a poor hydromorphological status and a higher sediment pressure sediment retention ponds are among the measures that show the highest variability in the response this can be explained by the interplay between the selected timing for outflow regulation five days and the time of concentration of the subcatchment located upstream of the diagnostic reaches the lack of a clear pattern in the local responses to nwrms implementation highlights the importance of considering different local conditions when simulating the impacts of measures to reduce fbmds in a river network guse et al 2015 to account for the contrasting results they could be used the first step of a multi criteria decision analysis kiker et al 2005 with the aim of defining a compromise measure set where criteria risk class to be improved and spatial weights high priority reaches can be defined furthermore the optimal spatial arrangement and intensity of measures that maximizes the reduction of the extent of high risk classes under the constraint of minimizing the loss of the extent of low risk classes could be further explored with optimization algorithms yang and best 2015 zhang and chui 2018 4 4 effectiveness of measures on fine bed material deposits at the catchment scale existing approaches to study fbmds make use of empirical linkages that do not consider the processes involved in sediment transport and deposition anlauf and moffitt 2010 bilotta et al 2012 naden et al 2016 sutherland et al 2010 the use of mcs can help filling this gap the assessment of the response of fbmds to predictors subsection 4 1 explains the observed nwrms effectiveness on fbmds by considering the intermediate cascading effects on different environmental compartments subsection 4 2 a prioritization of measures can be obtained based on the target risk class for instance the spatial extent covered by sites in risk classes 0 natural conditions and 1 low risk can be increased by implementing specific nwrms targeting sediment fluxes before they enter in the stream wharton et al 2017 on the other hand the effects of sediment ponds on the hydrology can reduce the in stream sediment transport capacity by reducing the peak flows and therefore lead to increased sediment deposition downstream moreover the spatial extent covered by sites in risk class 3 can be reduced by implementing specific nwrms able to improve the cross sectional transport capacity and the in stream bed quality auerswald and geist 2018 the additional implementation of vfs in combination with hmi shows the greatest reduction in the spatial extent while vfs alone do not provide significant changes sediment control measures alone are not sufficient to reduce the extent of the risk class 3 sites as the substrate is saturated with sediment and the remobilization of sediment stored in the upstream channel might occur naden et al 2016 our analysis reveals that a combination of measures targeting different aspects sediment generation hillslope sediment transport in stream transport capacity potentially has the highest effectiveness to reduce all the risk classes knott et al 2019 using synergies between in stream and catchment sediment transport measures to tackle fbmds have been recommended auerswald and geist 2018 but is still rarely considered in measures planning auerswald et al 2019 the interactions between different nwrms types can result in nonlinear cumulative effectiveness e g the interaction between hmi and vfs effects is linear for class 3 and nonlinear for risk class 0 optimization algorithms can be useful for testing different spatial arrangements and parametrizations chen et al 2015 yang and best 2015 zhang and chui 2018 4 5 implications for management in the aist catchment our results suggest an effective plan for sediment management in the aist catchment should involve the use of sets of measures tackling different aspects significant improvements for the risk classes 0 areal increase and 3 areal increase at the catchment scale can be achieved already when vfs are located on few sediment generation hotspots 17 of the catchment area and when hmi are located in reaches with a poor hydromorphological status according to the wfd approximately 10 of the modeled river network greater improvements for classes 1 up to 40 areal increase and class 2 up to 25 areal decrease can be achieved by increasing the implementation magnitude of hmi and vfs implementing nwrms in the aist catchment can also lead to synergistic benefits for species conservation and climate change mitigation in fact the reduction of river sections occupied by high fbmd risk classes has beneficial ecological consequences not only for the conservation of the highly endangered freshwater pearl mussel baldan et al 2020 hauer 2015 but also in general for the health of benthic communities leitner et al 2015 furthermore changes in precipitation runoff patterns have been recorded in the area hauer et al 2015 thus the implementation of structures increasing the mean water residence time in the catchment can be also an effective mitigation strategy for climate change impacts in the area hauer et al 2016 2013 5 conclusion in this paper we assessed the potential of different nwrms scenarios in mitigating fbdms this was done by propagating the effects of measures from the catchment scale to the meso habitat scale with a sequence of models in a mc framework general implications for fbmds management from this study are i the identification of the controlling factors for fbmds provides a rationale for the selection of the appropriate nwrms to implement ii fbmds responses to measures that are implemented can be different when diagnosed at different spatial scales iii combinations of nswrms have the potential to address multiple goals e g reducing the spatial extent of sites severely impacted by fbmds and increasing the spatial extent of sites in natural conditions thus planning of nwrms should account for the effects of measures across multiple spatial scales considering both catchment and local scales diagnostics when assessing the impacts on the reduction of sediment a multi scale assessment of the effectiveness of the nwrms can be beneficial to unravel all the potential benefits and highlight tradeoffs hidden by analyses limited to only one specific spatial scale a combination of measures has the potential to mitigate tradeoffs and provide sound solutions to fbmds finally the presented work underlines the advantage of implementing nature based solutions to increase the multifunctionality of the river network as discussed for the aist catchment nwrms implemented for mitigating the fbmds issue can also lead to synergies of soil conservation species conservations and climatic goals geist and auerswald 2019 credit authorship contribution statement damiano baldan conceptualization

4893,quantitatively assessing the practicality and sustainability of saline groundwater for irrigation at the regional level could provide a valuable reference for macro decision making and management in terms of alleviating the severe contradiction between freshwater shortages and food production in this study the distributed agro hydrological swap wofost soil water atmosphere plant world food study model was applied in the east central north china plain ncp the model was used to simulate the five saline water irrigation scenarios for a 20 year period and the effects on the spatiotemporal variations in crop yield water productivity wp and soil water and salt balances were analyzed furthermore appropriate saline water irrigation schemes were solved considering crop yield reduction and soil salt accumulation finally spatial matching between the appropriate irrigation schemes and saline groundwater resources from the perspectives of water quality and water quantity was evaluated the main results were as follows 1 the average yield and wp of winter wheat during the simulation period remained stable or increased slightly under saline water 2 6 g l 1 irrigation for winter wheat compared with that under freshwater irrigation whereas the average yield and wp of the following summer maize decreased to varying degrees 2 when the sum of seasonal precipitation and irrigation of summer maize was 450 mm 401 450 mm 351 400 mm 200 350 mm and 200 mm the average soil salt leaching depth was approximately 120 cm 100 cm 80 cm 60 cm and 40 cm respectively 3 on the premise that the average salt content of the 2 m soil profile at summer maize harvest during the simulation period was less than 3 g kg 1 if the average crop yield reduction of the rotation system in the range of 500 kg hm 2 1000 kg hm 2 1500 kg hm 2 and 2000 kg hm 2 was permitted the dominant maximum irrigation water salinity in the study area was 3 g l 1 4 g l 1 6 g l 1 and 6 g l 1 respectively 4 the average saline water amount needed for winter wheat irrigation during the simulation period was approximately 22 78 108 m3 which was approximately 9 more than the exploitable amount of saline groundwater the results could support decision making related to developing and using shallow saline groundwater for irrigation keywords saline groundwater irrigation winter wheat summer maize double cropping swap wofost model optimization matching degree north china plain 1 introduction irrigation plays a significant role in global food production döll and siebert 2002 wada et al 2012 world bank 2017 the worldwide demand for food is expected to double from 2005 to 2050 as the population grows tilman et al 2011 thus further increasing the need for water resources however irrigation consumes approximately 90 of the global freshwater resources scanlon et al 2007 siebert et al 2010 the supply of good quality water for irrigation has continued to decline in many parts of the world döll and siebert 2002 strzepek and boehlert 2010 rodell et al 2018 thus irrigation with marginal water e g brackish or saline water could help alleviate the pressure imposed by food production on water needs letey et al 2011 skaggs et al 2014 assouline et al 2015 in fact saline water has been used for irrigation in india egypt america china israel italy morocco and tunisia e g minhas 1996 ashour et al 1997 mehta et al 2000 fang and chen 2007 kan and rapaport rom 2012 leogrande et al 2016 el oumlouki et al 2018 louati et al 2018 furthermore the use of saline water to supplement the limited freshwater available for irrigation will become increasingly common in the future kan and rapaport rom 2012 chowdhury et al 2018 hence it is of great practical significance to evaluate the performance of saline water irrigation at a regional level for agricultural development and food production in areas with freshwater shortages groundwater which is an important water source for irrigation in many grain producing areas worldwide aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 gleeson et al 2012 has been overexploited resulting in continuous groundwater level drawdown giordano 2009 dalin et al 2017 the north china plain ncp is one of the main grain producing areas in china and one of the areas with the most serious decline in groundwater levels worldwide giordano 2009 cao et al 2013 rodell et al 2018 in particular the heilonggang region in the east central ncp is one of the most water deficient areas in china national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2004 2017 general office of people s government of hebei province hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2013 and the slowly renewing deep groundwater has been severely overexploited in this area zheng et al 2010 shi et al 2011 shang et al 2016 on the other hand brackish and saline water resources are widely distributed in the shallow aquifers of this area fang and chen 2007 zhang et al 2009 zhou et al 2012 huang et al 2015 and have great exploitation and utilization potential chen 1999 zhang and li 2005 zhang et al 2009 to address the deep groundwater security crisis and ensure grain production to a certain extent the chinese government has proposed to promote the use of brackish water for irrigation in this area the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2015 2019 however on a regional scale long term saline water irrigation might induce crop yield reduction and soil salt accumulation which would affect the irrigation sustainability additionally the spatial variability of saline water resources might affect the practicality of saline water irrigation and saline water irrigation should be carried out considering the specific time and place because of the differences in meteorology soil crop irrigation and other factors thus assessing the effects of saline water irrigation on crop growth and soil water and salt movements exploring the appropriate saline water irrigation schemes by considering negative impacts and evaluating the spatial matching between saline water resources and the appropriate irrigation schemes could provide scientific references for the sustainable use of saline water for irrigation adapted to local conditions in this representative area and other similar areas to reasonably use the widely distributed brackish and saline groundwater resources for irrigation many field experiments have been conducted to study the performance of saline or brackish water irrigation for winter wheat summer maize double cropping system at several experimental stations in this area since the 1980s some of the experiments emphasized the impact on crop growth ma et al 2010 cao et al 2014 or soil salt ma et al 2011 in terms of research content most previous experiments chen et al 2011 fang and chen 1997 guo et al 2017 jiao et al 2013 liu et al 2016 ma et al 2008 soothar et al 2019a wu and wang 2010 focused on the comprehensive effects of saline or brackish water irrigation on crop growth and soil environment meanwhile the ps123 qiao and yu 2003 hydrus 1d he et al 2017 liu et al 2019 and saltmed soothar et al 2019b models have been used to better describe the soil water and salt dynamics or crop growth under different saline water irrigation conditions at the station scale in this area it should be noted that these experimental results could represent the specific fields and years considered in analysis and the simulation studies were carried out at the station level moreover simultaneously conducting field experiments with different saline water irrigation schemes over long term and large scale conditions seems almost impossible thus a distributed agro hydrological model may prove to be a unique tool that can be used to assess the effects of various saline water irrigation schemes on crop yield water productivity wp and soil water and salt dynamics in this area which has multiple factors that display spatial heterogeneity the swap soil water atmosphere plant model and its embedded detailed crop module which is derived from the wofost world food study model can simulate the transports of water solute and heat in the vadose zone in interaction with crop growth in detail boogaard et al 1998 kroes et al 2009 after calibration and validation the swap model has been widely used to evaluate the impacts of saline water irrigation on soil water and salt movements and or crop growth at the station level in italy tedeschi and menenti 2002 india singh 2004 mandare et al 2008 verma et al 2014 kumar et al 2015 iran hassanli et al 2016 israel ben asher et al 2006 china huang et al 2009 jiang et al 2016 wang et al 2016 and other countries furthermore the swap or swap wofost model combined with geographic information system gis technology has been applied to analyze the influences of specific water management scenarios on crop yield wp and soil water and salt balances at the regional scale droogers et al 2000 singh et al 2006 van dam et al 2006 noory et al 2011 in addition xue and ren 2017 employed the distributed swap wofost model to estimate the performance of the conjunctive use of saline and non saline water for irrigation and recommend cropping structures we noted that few studies have been conducted to identify appropriate saline water irrigation schemes at a regional level by considering the negative effects and using the simulation results from the distributed swap wofost model and to evaluate the spatial matching of the appropriate irrigation schemes and saline water resources it is noteworthy that the distributed swap wofost model was established calibrated and validated for use in the study area using multisource and multiscale data li and ren 2019a and the effects of limited irrigation on wp and reducing deep groundwater exploitation were evaluated using the model li and ren 2019b in this paper we continue to apply the model to simulate and analyze saline water irrigation scenarios at the regional scale this study not only carries out a comprehensive agro hydrological simulation in this typical area using the validated model but also quantitatively studies another irrigation strategy other than limited irrigation that can be used to reduce the exploitation of deep groundwater therefore the main aim of this study is to identify appropriate saline groundwater irrigation schemes at the regional scale specifically the objectives are to 1 simulate and analyze different saline water irrigation scenarios using the calibrated and validated distributed swap wofost model 2 solve the maximum irrigation water salinity under specific constraints at the simulation unit level and obtain the distribution of the appropriate irrigation schemes 3 evaluate the spatial matching degree between the saline groundwater resources and the appropriate irrigation schemes 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area the heilonggang region is the main distribution area of saline groundwater in the ncp and the major deep groundwater overexploited area in hebei province fig 1 a this region has an area of approximately 4 104 km2 covering 53 counties fig 1b more than 80 of the land area is cropland the climate is warm temperate semi arid and semi humid monsoon wang 2010 according to the collected meteorological data the average precipitation in the study area in 1993 2012 was approximately 499 8 mm and approximately 3 4 25 1 62 0 and 9 5 of the precipitation was concentrated in january march april june july september and october december respectively loam soil prevails in this area the areas where the layered soil textures are loam 0 200 cm sandy loam 0 200 cm loam 0 70 cm sandy loam 70 200 cm clay loam 0 200 cm and loam 0 30 cm silty loam 30 200 cm account for approximately 45 4 16 3 5 9 5 7 and 5 0 of the study area respectively totalling approximately 78 shi et al 2004 2010 the study area is one of the key grain production areas in hebei province wang 2010 wheat and maize are the most important grain crops which contribute approximately 45 7 and 40 6 respectively to the total planting area of grain crops general office of people s government of hebei province hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2013 in other words the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system is the most dominant planting pattern saline groundwater is widely distributed and the areas with shallow groundwater salinities of 1 g l 1 1 2 g l 1 2 3 g l 1 3 5 g l 1 5 10 g l 1 and 10 g l 1 account for approximately 18 8 38 5 22 4 13 2 6 9 and 0 2 respectively of the study area fig 1a zhang and fei 2009 2 2 distributed swap wofost model in this paper the distributed swap wofost model which was established calibrated and validated in our previous study li and ren 2019a was used to simulate different saline water irrigation scenarios the main assumption of the distributed swap wofost model in this study is that an ensemble of individually homogeneous units can equivalently represent a spatially heterogeneous area this assumption is valid in the study area because of the insignificant runoff and the greater depth and smaller hydraulic gradient of shallow groundwater li and ren 2019a twelve types of zoning information fig 1c related to meteorology soil crops irrigation land use water resources shallow groundwater and administrative divisions were combined using gis which resulted in 2809 simulation units on cropland fig 1b the classification basis and spatial distribution of the 12 zones as well as the corresponding data in each zone were detailed in li and ren 2019a furthermore the parameters related to the soil water movement salt transport and crop growth modules were calibrated in detail based on global sensitivity analysis and the model simulation accuracy was evaluated using multi spatiotemporal scale data li and ren 2019a this result showed that the distributed swap wofost model could reasonably simulate the agro hydrological cycle and crop growth of winter wheat summer maize fields in the study area thus it is feasible to use the model to simulate saline water irrigation scenarios 2 3 setting the saline water irrigation scenarios this study aimed to evaluate the performance of using saline water to replace freshwater for irrigation under the current irrigation conditions thus the irrigation frequency timing and amount under the saline water irrigation scenarios were consistent with the generalized current irrigation schedule presented in li and ren 2019a the model run period consistently included a warm up period october 1989 to september 1992 and a simulation period october 1992 to october 2012 in the study area the precipitation during the summer maize growing season can often meet the water requirements in most simulation years collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 li and ren 2019a moreover the salt tolerance of maize is regularly lower than that of wheat maas and hoffman 1977 thus saline water irrigation scenarios were set only for winter wheat it is important to maintain low soil salinity during the germination and emergence periods of wheat maas and poss 1989 thus saline water irrigation was applied at the raising to jointing booting to anthesis and early grain filling stages of winter wheat considering the distribution of shallow groundwater salinity the irrigation water salinity in the winter wheat growing season was set to 2 g l 1 3 g l 1 4 g l 1 5 g l 1 and 6 g l 1 for scenarios 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively the irrigation water salinity before winter wheat sowing and during the summer maize growing season was still 1 g l 1 the five scenarios were collectively called the saline water irrigation scenarios and the current irrigation schedule was called the freshwater irrigation scheme in this paper notably under the current irrigation schedule the study area was subdivided into three irrigation zones i e zones i ii and iii fig 2 a based on spatial differences in the irrigation conditions additionally the irrigation frequency and timing of winter wheat and summer maize depended on the peps of the two crops li and ren 2019a as a result the settings of the five scenarios for the winter wheat summer maize rotation system with different peps in each irrigation zone are shown in fig 2b the five scenarios were simulated and analyzed for the 2809 simulation units over a period of 20 rotation years 2 4 solving the appropriate saline water irrigation schemes in the study area it would be difficult to maintain deep groundwater exploitation for irrigation and the widely distributed shallow saline groundwater could be used for irrigation moreover this area plays an important role in grain production in hebei province and secondary salinization should be avoided under saline water irrigation conditions as a result the simulation results from the distributed swap wofost model were combined with the classic 0 1 linear programming approach in this study to explore the maximum irrigation water salinity in the winter wheat growing season max z under the constraints of specific crop yield reduction and soil salt content crop yield under saline water irrigation might be reduced compared with the yield obtained under freshwater irrigation fang and chen 1997 ma et al 2008 moreover irrigating winter wheat with saline water might lead to a higher soil salt content at the early growth stage of the following summer maize and have a negative effect on summer maize yield chen et al 2011 liu et al 2016 thus the crop yield reduction observed in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system was considered when solving the maximum irrigation water salinity meanwhile soil salt accumulation would be observed after saline water irrigation for winter wheat but the accumulated salt would be leached to the deeper soil layer by precipitation and irrigation during the summer maize season liu et al 2019 thus the level of soil salt accumulation in the rotation system was considered when solving the maximum irrigation water salinity in other words the salt content of the 2 m soil profile at the end of a rotation year i e at summer maize harvest was constrained by a threshold details about the 0 1 linear programming approach for each simulation unit are as follows 1 objective function max z i 0 5 c i x i 2 constraints s t i 0 5 y i x i a i 0 1 5 i 0 5 s i x i b i 0 1 5 i 0 5 x i 1 i 0 1 5 x i 0 or 1 i 0 1 5 where i represents the irrigation scheme where a value of zero indicates the freshwater irrigation scheme i e current irrigation schedule and the values from one to five indicate the saline water irrigation scenarios of i ci is the irrigation water salinity in the winter wheat growing season under the ith irrigation scheme g l 1 xi is the decision variable which has a value of one if the ith irrigation scheme is selected and a value of zero otherwise yi is the average yield reduction of the winter wheat summer maize rotation system during the simulation period under the ith irrigation scheme compared with that observed under the freshwater irrigation scheme kg hm 2 si is the average salt content of the 2 m soil profile at summer maize harvest during the simulation period under the ith irrigation scheme g kg 1 a is the threshold of crop yield reduction kg hm 2 and b is the threshold of the soil salt content g kg 1 after analyzing the crop yield under the five scenarios four yield reductions i e 500 kg hm 2 1000 kg hm 2 1500 kg hm 2 and 2000 kg hm 2 were successively set as threshold a soil is non saline or slightly saline when the salt content is less than 3 0 g kg 1 bao 2010 thus the value of 3 0 g kg 1 was applied as threshold b under the four combinations of the two constraints the maximum irrigation water salinity was solved at the simulation unit level the irrigation schemes with irrigation water salinities less than or equal to the solved maximum value were called the appropriate irrigation schemes for the purpose of optimization the 0 1 linear programming approach was solved in batch 11 236 times i e four constraint schemes and 2809 simulation units using vba in excel 2 5 evaluating the matching degree between the solved irrigation schemes and the saline groundwater to implement saline water irrigation based on the local conditions of the study area the matching degree between the appropriate saline water irrigation schemes and shallow saline groundwater resources was evaluated specifically at the simulation unit level if the shallow groundwater salinity was less than or equal to the solved maximum irrigation water salinity under the two constraints the shallow groundwater met the needs of the appropriate irrigation schemes from the perspective of water quality and vice versa at the county level the ratio of the exploitable amount of shallow saline groundwater qs to the amount of saline water needed for winter wheat irrigation is was defined as the assurance coefficient of saline groundwater resources a higher coefficient represented a greater assurance ability of shallow saline groundwater to irrigate winter wheat from the perspective of water quantity the values of is and qs were estimated in each county the steps of calculating is were as follows 1 the irrigation quota of saline water for winter wheat i e the sum of the saline water irrigation amount in the winter wheat growing season was different among irrigation zones and peps thus the average saline water irrigation quota mm during the simulation period in each simulation unit was calculated 2 the average saline water irrigation quota mm in each county was estimated using the area weighted average 3 the is value 108 m3 in each county was calculated by multiplying the average saline water irrigation quota by the average planting area of winter wheat in 1994 2012 general office of people s government of hebei province hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2013 the steps of estimating qs were as follows 1 the natural recharge values of brackish 1 3 g l 1 and semi saline 3 5 g l 1 groundwater and the exploitable amount of brackish groundwater in each county were collected from the national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 the natural recharge of semi saline groundwater was greater than zero in 25 counties thus the exploitable amount of semi saline groundwater was estimated based on its natural recharge 2 the total recharge is the sum of natural recharge and well irrigation recharge zhang and li 2005 and the well irrigation recharge of semi saline groundwater accounted for 1 3 2 5 of its total recharge in the hebei plain national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 zhang and li 2005 thus the natural recharge of semi saline groundwater was assumed to be the total recharge 3 the exploitable amount under the current condition is the total recharge minus the irretrievable groundwater leakage and phreatic evaporation zhang and li 2005 the sum of leakage and phreatic evaporation of semi saline groundwater accounted for 25 00 13 92 0 00 45 45 40 00 and 41 35 of its total recharge in the cities of handan xingtai baoding cangzhou langfang and hengshui respectively zhang et al 2009 thus the total recharge of semi saline groundwater in each county was converted to the exploitable amount based on the above proportions of the corresponding city 4 the sum of the exploitable amounts of brackish and semi saline groundwater was recorded as qs at the county level overall the detailed flow chart is shown in fig 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation results of saline water irrigation scenarios 3 1 1 crop yield the saline water irrigation frequencies for winter wheat in zones i ii and iii were 2 3 1 2 and 0 1 respectively fig 2 the average winter wheat yield during the simulation period under the five saline water irrigation scenarios in zones i ii and iii increased by approximately 0 55 1 01 3 04 14 63 and 1 85 10 25 respectively compared with the average yield under the freshwater irrigation scheme except for zone i under scenario 5 where the average winter wheat yield decreased by approximately 14 0 kg hm 2 table 1 although the summer maize was still irrigated with freshwater the average summer maize yield decreased by approximately 3 31 22 60 6 85 32 53 and 3 88 20 31 in zones i ii and iii respectively as a result of using saline water irrigation for winter wheat table 1 overall the average yield of the winter wheat summer maize rotation system under the five scenarios was reduced by approximately 1 57 12 54 2 50 11 76 and 2 40 12 41 in zones i ii and iii respectively table 1 the reasons for the increase in winter wheat yield and the decrease in summer maize yield were as follows 1 summer maize was rain fed in most simulation years under the current irrigation schedule and summer maize with relatively high salt sensitivity would suffer salt stress if there was not enough precipitation during its early growth stage to leach the salt that accumulated during the winter wheat season and this salt stress would have a negative impact on the root water uptake and yield of summer maize 2 after the raising stage winter wheat was relatively less sensitive to salt stress maas and poss 1989 fang and chen 2008 and obvious salt stress on winter wheat growth was not observed when the irrigation water salinity was less than or equal to 6 g l 1 in particular in zones ii and iii which had poor current irrigation conditions li and ren 2019a the root water uptake of summer maize was affected by the application of saline water irrigation for winter wheat which would increase the available water in the 2 m soil profile in the upcoming winter wheat season alleviate the water stress of winter wheat and further increase the yield at nanpi station fang and chen 1997 found that the winter wheat yield was reduced by approximately 2 2 when saline water 5 6 g l 1 was applied after the jointing stage and freshwater was applied at the seedling stage liu et al 2016 found that the applications of saline water 2 g l 1 or 5 g l 1 at the jointing stage and freshwater at the overwintering stage did not significantly decrease the winter wheat yield however these applications had a negative impact on the following summer maize soothar et al 2019a observed that saline water 4 7 ds m 1 irrigation at the jointing and anthesis stages of winter wheat caused a 2 reduction in grain yield compared with freshwater irrigation at hengshui station an increase in winter wheat yield and a decrease in summer maize yield were observed at lingxian station in an area close to the study area when saline water 3 g l 1 was used to irrigate winter wheat at the jointing and anthesis stages pang et al 2010 wang et al 2015 reported that as water salinity increased from 3 3 ds m 1 to 5 0 ds m 1 and 6 8 ds m 1 the winter wheat yield decreased in the 2011 2012 season and increased and then decreased in the 2012 2013 season at fengqiu station in the area surrounding the study area these site specific results in the ncp suggest that our simulation results at the regional scale were reliable to some extent the average yield reduction of the rotation system under each scenario reached its maximum value in zone i followed by that in zones ii and iii table 1 because the average saline water irrigation frequency in zone i was greater than that in zones ii and iii and further led to more soil salt despite the same irrigation water salinity the results could provide a quantitative reference for the trade off between irrigation water salinity and irrigation frequency when implementing saline water irrigation in each simulation year the application of saline water with salinity less than or equal to 6 g l 1 to irrigate winter wheat had little influence on its average yield in the study area compared to the freshwater irrigation scheme with annual variations that were basically within 10 fig 4 a e the annual variation in the average summer maize yield gradually increased as the irrigation water salinity for winter wheat increased fig 4a e taking scenario 5 as an example the average reduction of the summer maize yield was greater than 1000 kg hm 2 in most simulation years except 1997 1998 1999 2001 2002 and 2004 fig 4e in 1997 1998 1999 and 2002 the peps of summer maize were at least 75 i e dry or drier season thus lower summer maize yields were achieved in these years because of the higher water stress li and ren 2019b which means there was less room for further yield reductions caused by salt stress in 2001 and 2004 soil salt was leached as a result of the greater precipitation during the winter wheat season li and ren 2019b which led to a lower soil salt content in the early stage of summer maize and lower salt stress 3 1 2 wp wp quantifies the crop production per unit of water used singh et al 2006 and was defined as the ratio of crop yield to seasonal evapotranspiration in this study compared with the freshwater irrigation scheme the average wp of winter wheat during the simulation period remained virtually unchanged in zones i and iii under scenarios 1 and 2 decreased by 0 84 2 52 in zone i and increased by 2 00 4 00 in zone iii under scenarios 3 to 5 and increased by 2 41 8 43 in zone ii under the five scenarios table 1 the average wp of summer maize under the five scenarios in zones i ii and iii decreased by 1 66 14 36 4 58 24 43 and 2 52 15 13 respectively except for zone ii under scenario 2 where the average wp increased by 1 53 table 1 furthermore the average wp of the rotation system in the three zones decreased by 0 68 9 46 1 85 9 26 and 2 17 10 87 respectively table 1 compared with the freshwater irrigation scheme the average interannual variation in the winter wheat wp was slight within 0 04 kg m 3 under the five scenarios while the average interannual variation in the summer maize wp increased as the salinity of the irrigation water used for winter wheat increased fig s1a e wang et al 2015 found that the effect of irrigation water salinity for winter wheat on its wp was non significant at fengqiu station which is similar to our simulation results 3 1 3 water balance components as reported in our previous study li and ren 2019a the study area involves two bottom boundary condition zones i e the area with free drainage of the 2 m soil profile was zone a and the area with zero flux of the 15 m soil profile was zone b the growth of winter wheat and summer maize under the saline water irrigation scenarios was strongly affected by the soil water and salt conditions in the root zone thus the water balance components of the 0 200 cm soil profiles were analyzed under the six irrigation schemes i e the freshwater irrigation scheme and the five saline water irrigation scenarios the differences in the water balance components during the winter wheat season fig 5 a summer maize season fig 5b and the rotation system fig 5c were observed even though the precipitation and irrigation amounts remained constant for the two crops when the irrigation water salinity for winter wheat increased from 1 g l 1 to 6 g l 1 the average interception during the simulation period in the study area increased by approximately 0 4 mm for winter wheat fig 5a and decreased by approximately 4 0 mm for summer maize fig 5b the average transpiration of winter wheat increased from approximately 318 1 mm to 328 9 mm and then decreased to 328 4 mm with a maximum increase of 3 4 under scenario 4 fig 5a and the average transpiration of summer maize decreased from approximately 253 7 mm to 204 4 mm with a maximum decrease of 19 4 fig 5b correspondingly the average proportion of transpiration in the outflow i e the sum of interception transpiration evaporation and bottom flux decreased from 74 6 to 72 5 for winter wheat fig 5a and from 72 3 to 63 8 for summer maize fig 5b the average amounts of evaporation and bottom flux leakage during the winter wheat fig 5a and summer maize fig 5b seasons increased as the salinity of the irrigation water used for winter wheat increased as the irrigation water salinity increased from 1 g l 1 to 6 g l 1 the average soil water storage change in the 0 200 cm profiles ranged from approximately 44 3 mm to 70 9 mm during the winter wheat season fig 5a and from approximately 34 1 mm to 64 7 mm during the summer maize season fig 5b on average the outflow during the winter wheat season increased slightly 4 8 26 7 mm under the five scenarios compared with the freshwater irrigation scheme fig 5a soothar et al 2019a found that the difference in outflow was not statistically significant under the freshwater and saline water irrigation treatments in summary an increase in the salinity of water used to irrigate winter wheat would result in an increase in soil salt content in the early stage of the following summer maize which affected the root water uptake of summer maize and further reduced transpiration meanwhile the higher soil salt content would decrease the average leaf area index lai of summer maize and further reduce interception the parts of precipitation and irrigation during the summer maize season that were consumed by interception and transpiration would decrease as the salinity of the irrigation water applied to winter wheat increased resulting in increases in the evaporation leakage and soil water storage change for summer maize the increased soil water storage during the summer maize season would provide more soil water to be consumed by the next winter wheat season and might increase the average lai of winter wheat the increase in lai might lead to increases in the interception and transpiration of winter wheat the increased soil water storage was not completely consumed by winter wheat transpiration thus the average evaporation and leakage amounts increased the increase in the transpiration of winter wheat might be caused by the following reasons 1 winter wheat was irrigated with saline water at its salt tolerant stage 2 the accumulated salt was leached to the deeper soil layers by the seasonal precipitation and irrigation of summer maize and the pre sowing freshwater irrigation of winter wheat and 3 the increasing salt stress on summer maize resulted in greater available soil water storage that could be used for winter wheat growth on average along with the increase in irrigation water salinity applied to winter wheat the interception and transpiration amounts of the rotation system decreased while the amounts of evaporation leakage and soil water storage change increased fig 5c 3 1 4 salt balance distribution and leaching the salt storage index ssi is defined as the ratio of salt storage change ssc in the soil profile to the initial salt storage singh et al 2003 the ssi expresses the salt build up in the root zone and it must be near zero or negative over a long period for a system to be sustainable singh et al 2003 on average the salts in the 0 200 cm soil profiles were mainly derived from irrigation for winter wheat and summer maize under the six irrigation schemes fig 6 the average ssc values during the winter wheat season were positive under the six irrigation schemes fig 6 because the salt flux leaching from the 0 200 cm soil profiles was less than the salt flux of irrigation in contrast the average ssc values during the summer maize season were negative overall the ssc values of the rotation system were also positive fig 6 the average salt flux of irrigation for summer maize was maintained at a constant level i e 2 05 mg cm 2 under the six irrigation schemes fig 6 when the irrigation water salinity for winter wheat increased from 1 g l 1 to 6 g l 1 the average salt flux of irrigation during the winter wheat season ranged from approximately 26 56 mg cm 2 to 124 16 mg cm 2 the average salt flux leaching from the 0 200 cm soil profiles increased from approximately 10 14 mg cm 2 to 59 50 mg cm 2 during the winter wheat season and from approximately 9 27 mg cm 2 to 40 69 mg cm 2 during the summer maize season and the average ssc value of the rotation system increased from approximately 9 20 mg cm 2 to 26 02 mg cm 2 with the proportion of ssc in the total salt flux of irrigation decreasing from approximately 32 2 to 20 6 fig 6 the results showed that the increasing salinity of irrigation water applied to winter wheat resulted in increases in both the salt flux of irrigation during the winter wheat season and the salt flux leaching from the soil profile during the winter wheat and summer maize seasons resulting in a slight increase in the ssc value of the rotation system when the irrigation water salinity was greater than or equal to 3 g l 1 the average ssi values of the 0 200 cm soil profiles of the rotation system remained generally stable fig 6 the study area was related to the three irrigation zones i e zones i ii and iii and two bottom boundary condition zones i e zones a and b and the differences in the average salt balance components of the 0 200 cm soil profiles in the overlapping areas of zone i and zone a fig s2 of zone i and zone b fig s3 of zone ii and zone b fig s4 and of zone iii and zone b fig s5 were observed under the six irrigation schemes on average 71 1 84 1 of the total salt flux of irrigation was leached from the 2 m soil profile in zone a fig s2 similar results have been reported by other researchers sharma et al 1994 chauhan et al 2008 verma et al 2012 verma et al 2012 concluded that salt build up was observed during the winter season due to saline water irrigation and the concentrated excess precipitation during the monsoon season would leach the accumulated salts thus leading to a salt free root zone in areas with a deep water table in monsoon climatic regions with an average annual precipitation exceeding 500 mm more than 80 of the salt accumulated during wheat cultivation is leached without any long term increase in the soil salinity sharma et al 1994 chauhan et al 2008 notably limited by the function of the swap wofost model it would be difficult to show that the saline groundwater used for irrigation was exploited from the shallow aquifers i e the salt flux of irrigation was from an external source in the simulation thus saline water irrigation would increase the salt content in the saturated unsaturated soil profiles to some extent from the perspective of the salt balance and it might increase the shallow groundwater salinity in zone a the shallow groundwater depth was basically greater than 4 m and the water and salt movements in the 2 m soil profile would be slightly affected by the fluctuation of shallow groundwater depth thus the change in shallow groundwater salinity might have less of an effect on the reliability of the simulation results in zone b three simulation units were selected from the central part of zones i ii and iii to conduct numerical experiments and the results showed that the use of saline water from an external source for irrigation for 20 years would not significantly increase the shallow groundwater salinity thus it might be acceptable to evaluate the impact of saline water irrigation on crop growth and secondary salinization risk without considering the change in shallow groundwater salinity the average ssc value of the 0 200 cm soil profiles in the study area during the winter wheat season was negative only in 2001 and 2004 and it was greater than zero in the other simulation years under the six irrigation schemes fig s6b g showing different degrees of salt accumulation the average ssc values during the summer maize season were typically negative each year and the interannual differences in the ssc value increased as the salinity of irrigation water applied to winter wheat increased fig s6b g the seasonal precipitation of summer maize was higher in 1994 1995 1996 and 2012 fig s6a which were wet years li and ren 2019b thus the reduction of the average salt storage in these years was more than that in the other simulation years for each simulation unit in each simulation year the changes in the soil salt concentration mg cm 3 in each layer 20 cm per layer of the 0 200 cm soil profiles during the winter wheat season summer maize season and rotation system under the six irrigation schemes were simulated and calculated furthermore for each soil layer the proportion of the distribution area where the change in soil salt concentration fell within a specific range in the total simulation area was calculated finally the average values of the proportion and ssi during the simulation period were calculated during the winter wheat season the average ssi values in each layer of the 0 120 cm profiles were positive under the five designed scenarios and the changes in soil salt concentration in these layers were predominantly greater than 0 mg cm 3 i e salt accumulation fig 7 a salt accumulation was observed in each layer of the 0 60 cm profiles in more than 90 of the simulation area fig 7a in each layer of the 120 200 cm profiles the average ssi values were less than or equal to zero and salt leaching i e the soil salt concentration change was negative occurred in more than 60 of the simulation area fig 7a the experimental results after applying saline water irrigation for winter wheat at quzhou station showed that the salt mainly accumulated in the 0 40 cm soil layer qiao et al 1999 and the salt load rapidly increased notably in the upper 80 cm ma et al 2008 under the five scenarios the soil depth with salt accumulation during the winter wheat season varied in the study area probably because of the spatial variabilities of the irrigation frequency seasonal precipitation and vertical soil texture under the six irrigation schemes the changes in the soil salt concentration in each layer of the 0 100 cm profiles during the summer maize season were less than 0 mg cm 3 in more than half of the simulation area and the average ssi values were also negative indicating salt leaching fig 7b additionally the proportion of the area with salt leaching to the total simulation area decreased with increasing soil depth during the summer maize season this result means that the spatiotemporal differences in precipitation and irrigation during the summer maize season might affect the salt leaching depth thus the soil salt variations under different precipitation and irrigation levels were further analyzed specifically for each simulation year and each soil layer of the 0 200 cm profiles the distribution area where the change in soil salt concentration during the summer maize season was less than 0 mg cm 3 i e salt leaching was counted when the sum of seasonal precipitation and irrigation of summer maize pism was within a specific range furthermore the average proportion of the distribution area with salt leaching to the total area and the average ssi value in each soil layer were calculated fig 8 when the pism value was greater than 450 mm the average ssi values in each layer of the 0 120 cm profiles were less than or equal to zero under the five scenarios fig 8b f that is the average soil depth of salt leaching reached 120 cm at this time salt was leached from the 0 120 cm soil layer in more than 50 of the total area and mainly accumulated in the 120 200 cm soil layer when the pism value was 401 450 mm the average ssi values in each layer of the 0 100 cm profiles were negative under each scenario and salt leaching occurred in each layer of the 0 100 cm profiles in more than 60 of the total area fig 8b f as the pism value ranged from 351 to 400 mm the average ssi values were less than zero in each layer of the 0 80 cm profiles under the five scenarios fig 8b f when the pism value ranged from 301 mm to 350 mm the average ssi values were negative in each layer of the 0 60 cm profiles under scenarios 1 and 2 fig 8b c and they were no more than zero in each layer of the 0 80 cm profiles under scenarios 3 to 5 fig 8d f the average ssi values were negative in each layer of the 0 60 cm profiles under each scenario when the pism value was 200 300 mm fig 8b f as the pism value less than 200 mm the average ssi values were negative in each layer of the 0 40 cm profiles under the five scenarios and salt accumulated in the 40 120 cm soil layer fig 8b f the results showed there was a positive correlation between salt leaching depth and pism value the experimental results at nanpi station showed that the 0 40 cm soil layer was desalinated when the precipitation from july to august was greater than 300 mm and desalination occurred in the 40 80 cm soil layer in wet years while salt accumulation occurred in dry years fang and chen 1997 from the experimental results at quzhou station the maximum soil depth to which the salt was leached in the wet season was approximately 150 cm ma et al 2008 he et al 2017 used the hydrus 1d model to simulate saline water irrigation for winter wheat at nanpi station and found that freshwater irrigation in conjunction with precipitation during the summer maize season leached soil salts from the root zone 0 100 cm with salt accumulation in the 160 220 cm soil layer liu et al 2019 calibrated and validated the hydrus 1d model at two sites in nanpi county and applied the model to evaluate the two saline water irrigation scenarios the results showed that the seasonal precipitation distribution determined the seasonal characteristics of salt changes in the topsoil layer 0 100 cm the results at the station level from the above experimental and simulation studies could support our simulation results at the regional level in other words sufficient precipitation in the summer maize season could leach salt to the deeper soil layer but the leaching depth varied due to the differences in soil conditions and the amounts and distributions of precipitation and irrigation our results at a finer scale could provide quantitative information for assessing the effect of the specific saline water irrigation scenario on salt accumulation on different temporal and spatial scales considering that more than 80 of the roots of winter wheat and summer maize were distributed in the 0 40 cm soil layer zhang 1999 the average salt concentration in the soil water of this layer at the three time points i e one day before and after pre sowing irrigation of winter wheat and one day before sowing of summer maize was analyzed the application of saline water with a salinity less than or equal to 6 g l 1 to irrigate winter wheat significantly increased the salt concentration before summer maize sowing fig s7a f fang and chen 1997 indicated that the salt tolerance threshold at the seedling stage of wheat was 10 mg cm 3 the salt concentration before winter wheat pre sowing irrigation decreased considerably exceeding the salt tolerance threshold only in some simulation years however it was within the suitable range after pre sowing irrigation in nearly all simulation years fig s7a f the results could quantify the contribution of freshwater pre sowing irrigation of winter wheat to the alleviation of salt stress on the winter wheat growth under saline water irrigation conditions 3 2 appropriate irrigation schemes compared with the freshwater irrigation scheme the average yield reduction of the winter wheat summer maize rotation system during the 20 simulation years p was less than or equal to 500 kg hm 2 in more than 98 of the simulation area under scenario 1 the p value was less than or equal to 1000 kg hm 2 in more than 97 of the simulation area under scenario 2 the p value was less than or equal to 1500 kg hm 2 in more than 93 of the simulation area under scenarios 3 and 4 and the p value was less than or equal to 2000 kg hm 2 in more than 94 of the simulation area under scenario 5 fig 9a 1 the average salt content of the 2 m soil profile at summer maize harvest during the 20 simulation years q was less than or equal to 3 g kg 1 in more than 95 of the simulation area under the freshwater irrigation scheme and scenario 1 and it was less than or equal to 5 g kg 1 in more than 96 of the simulation area under scenarios 2 to 5 fig 9a 2 on each simulation unit the maximum irrigation water salinity for winter wheat was solved in turn under the two constraints i e p was no more than a specific threshold and q was less than 3 g kg 1 and there were four constraint schemes under the first scheme i e p 500 kg hm 2 and q 3 g kg 1 the areas where the maximum irrigation water salinity in the winter wheat growing season was 1 g l 1 2 g l 1 3 g l 1 4 g l 1 5 g l 1 and 6 g l 1 accounted for 4 4 23 9 42 7 21 4 4 5 and 2 0 respectively of the total area fig 9b 1 and the spatial distribution of the maximum is shown in fig 9b 2 under the second scheme i e p 1000 kg hm 2 and q 3 g kg 1 the areas where the maximum irrigation water salinity was 1 g l 1 2 g l 1 3 g l 1 4 g l 1 5 g l 1 and 6 g l 1 were distributed in 3 8 9 8 16 7 28 7 22 4 and 17 5 respectively of the simulation area fig 9b 1 and fig 9b 3 under the third scheme i e p 1500 kg hm 2 and q 3 g kg 1 the proportions of the area with the maximum irrigation water salinity of 1 g l 1 2 g l 1 3 g l 1 4 g l 1 5 g l 1 and 6 g l 1 to the total area were 3 8 9 6 10 7 15 8 24 2 and 34 8 respectively fig 9b 1 and fig 9b 4 under the fourth scheme i e p 2000 kg hm 2 and q 3 g kg 1 the maximum irrigation water salinity with values of 1 g l 1 2 g l 1 3 g l 1 4 g l 1 5 g l 1 and 6 g l 1 were distributed in 3 8 9 6 10 7 14 1 15 7 and 45 0 respectively of the simulation area fig 9b 1 and fig 9b 5 in addition all irrigation schemes could not satisfy the two constraints in approximately 1 1 of the simulation area which was mainly distributed in the coastal area fig 9 b because of the higher initial soil salt content bai 1999 as well as the lower depth and higher salinity of shallow groundwater zhang and fei 2009 which resulted in q values greater than 3 g kg 1 under all irrigation schemes under a specific constraint scheme it should be noted that the maximum irrigation water salinity was lower in some parts of the study area the appropriate irrigation water salinity should not be too high in areas with more clay in the 2 m soil profile shi et al 2004 2010 because it is not conducive for salt leaching under saline water irrigation the shallow groundwater in some areas has a lower depth li and ren 2019a and higher salinity zhang and fei 2009 and the upward movement of shallow groundwater would bring salt into the root zone and impose more salt stress on crop growth thus the appropriate irrigation water salinity should not be too high the appropriate irrigation schemes were explored on the fine simulation unit level by making full use of the simulation results from the distributed swap wofost model for 20 rotation years which facilitates the formulation of suitable saline water irrigation schemes by policy makers based on the spatial heterogeneity of multiple factors e g meteorology soil crop and irrigation crop yield levels and secondary salinization risk 3 3 matching degree between the appropriate irrigation schemes and saline groundwater resources the matching degree between the appropriate irrigation schemes and saline groundwater resources was evaluated at the regional level fig 9c to provide quantitative references for the implementation of saline water irrigation according to local conditions the areas where the shallow groundwater salinity was 1 g l 1 1 3 g l 1 3 5 g l 1 and 5 g l 1 accounted for 18 35 62 01 13 58 and 6 06 respectively of the total simulation area fig 9d 1 in the whole study area the exploitable amount of shallow saline groundwater qs and the amount of saline water needed for winter wheat irrigation is were approximately 20 87 108 m3 and 22 78 108 m3 respectively and they differed by 1 91 108 m3 the assurance coefficient of the saline groundwater resources in each county is shown in fig 9d 2 the number of counties with assurance coefficients in the ranges of 1 00 0 81 1 00 0 60 0 80 and 0 60 was 23 3 9 and 18 respectively accounting for 43 40 5 66 16 98 and 33 96 of the total 53 counties fig 9d 2 and the assurance ability of the saline groundwater resources with the four ranges was defined as good fair poor and very poor respectively the 23 counties with good assurance ability are shown in fig 9c the qs value in these counties could meet the need for winter wheat irrigation in some parts of these counties the shallow groundwater salinity was higher than the maximum obtained under the four constraint schemes fig 9c thus the shallow saline groundwater should be mixed with freshwater e g deep groundwater surface water to reduce the salinity to a suitable range for irrigation in other parts of the counties the shallow groundwater salinity could satisfy the appropriate irrigation schemes and showed a higher matching degree fig 9c in the other 30 counties the qs value was less than the is value and the counties with fair poor and very poor assurance abilities are shown in fig 9c first there was no saline groundwater in the north western part of the study area i e non saline groundwater area fig 9c where the shallow fresh groundwater has been overexploited ren et al 2007 transferred water e g south to north water diversion project yellow river to hebei province water transfer project or non conventional water e g reclaimed water collected precipitation could be used to relieve groundwater overexploitation in the non saline groundwater area the utilization of farm ponds to collect precipitation is an efficient way to improve water use in the ncp sun et al 2016 and the collected precipitation might be saline which could be regarded as an extra source of saline water in this area thus the assessment of saline water irrigation in this area could help evaluate the risk of using other saline water resources for irrigation second for the areas where the assurance ability was not good e g fair poor or very poor and the shallow groundwater salinity did not exceed the solved maximum fig 9c transferred water or non conventional water could be used to supplement the shortage of saline groundwater for irrigation moreover saline water irrigation could be combined with limited irrigation that is saline water irrigation could be applied one or two times at the key growth stages of winter wheat to prevent saline groundwater overexploitation which is an important measure for sustainable grain production that was proposed by zhang et al 2016 finally for the areas where the assurance ability was not good and the shallow groundwater salinity did not satisfy the appropriate irrigation schemes fig 9c some measures e g mixed or rotation irrigation with saline water and freshwater combined use of other water resources decreasing saline water irrigation frequency could be comprehensively adopted to achieve the goal of reducing deep groundwater exploitation based on local conditions in addition the appropriate irrigation schemes could not be solved under the two given constraints in approximately 1 1 of the simulation area which was defined as the non solution area fig 9c the risk of saline water irrigation was higher in this area thus it is suggested to maintain the current irrigation schedule or implement rain fed in this area the study area is the most important area in the action plan for the comprehensive treatment of groundwater overexploitation in north china following the framework of simulation optimization evaluation the results would provide a valuable reference for this area to reduce deep groundwater exploitation develop and utilize shallow saline groundwater for irrigation reasonably and implement saline water irrigation schemes according to the local conditions 4 conclusions in view of the importance of the study area in wheat production the difficulty in continuing deep groundwater exploitation and the possibility to exploit shallow saline groundwater for irrigation the distributed agro hydrological swap wofost model was applied after calibration and validation to simulate and analyze different saline water irrigation scenarios at the regional level furthermore the appropriate saline water irrigation schemes were solved under the two constraints of acceptable crop yield reduction and soil salt accumulation finally the spatial matching between the appropriate irrigation schemes and saline groundwater resources was evaluated several conclusions were drawn as follows 1 saline water 2 6 g l 1 was used to irrigate winter wheat two or three times in zone i and the average yield and wp of winter wheat during the simulation period remained generally stable with variations less than 3 compared with the value under freshwater irrigation the average reductions in yield and wp of the following summer maize were within 23 and 15 respectively in zones ii and iii where the saline water irrigation frequency was 1 2 and 0 1 respectively the average yield and wp of winter wheat increased under the five designed scenarios with a maximum increase of less than 15 while the average yield and wp of summer maize decreased with a maximum decrease of 33 the results might help to quantify the impact of using shallow saline groundwater instead of deep groundwater for winter wheat irrigation on grain production 2 on average compared with the freshwater irrigation scheme the application of saline water for winter wheat irrigation reduced the interception and transpiration of the following summer maize while it increased the evaporation leakage and soil water storage change in the 2 m soil profile more soil water storage was consumed by the subsequent winter wheat resulting in increases in interception transpiration evaporation and leakage of winter wheat to varying degrees under the five scenarios salt mainly accumulated in the 0 120 cm soil layer especially in the upper 60 cm layer during the winter wheat season and salt mostly leached from the 0 100 cm soil layer during the summer maize season when the sum of the precipitation and irrigation amounts during the summer maize season was in the range of 450 mm 401 450 mm 351 400 mm 200 350 mm and 200 mm the average salt leaching depth reached approximately 120 cm 100 cm 80 cm 60 cm and 40 cm respectively the results could enhance our understanding of soil water and salt movement characteristics at the macro level 3 under the two constraints that the average crop yield reduction of the rotation system during the 20 simulation years p was no more than 500 kg hm 2 and the average salt content of the 2 m soil profile at summer maize harvest during the 20 simulation years q was less than 3 g kg 1 the maximum irrigation water salinity for winter wheat was predominantly 3 g l 1 in the study area under the second i e p 1000 kg hm 2 and q 3 g kg 1 third i e p 1500 kg hm 2 and q 3 g kg 1 and fourth i e p 2000 kg hm 2 and q 3 g kg 1 constraint schemes the maximum irrigation water salinity was mainly 4 g l 1 6 g l 1 and 6 g l 1 respectively the irrigation water salinity in the areas with more clay in the soil and a lower depth and higher salinity of shallow groundwater should be lower than that used in other areas the results could be instrumental for the relevant management departments to select appropriate saline water irrigation schemes considering the spatial variability of multiple factors the crop yield level and the secondary salinization risk 4 in the whole study area the average amount of saline water needed for winter wheat irrigation during the simulation period was approximately 22 78 108 m3 which was 1 91 108 m3 more than the exploitable amount of saline groundwater in the 23 counties located in the northeast and south of the study area the exploitable amount of saline groundwater could meet the needs of winter wheat irrigation with a good assurance ability in most parts of these counties the shallow groundwater salinity could also satisfy the appropriate irrigation schemes showing a high matching degree in the other counties with fair poor and very poor assurance abilities some practical measures were proposed to alleviate the severe deep groundwater overexploitation considering the spatial distribution of water resources this study not only provides quantitative bases for implementing sustainable agricultural water management in the study area but also presents a typical case that other areas can reference when trying to use saline water to relieve the contradiction between freshwater shortages and food production because of limitations in the relevant data spatiotemporal changes in the salinity of shallow groundwater and the exploitable amount of saline groundwater during the simulation period are difficult to estimate which may cause some degree of uncertainty in the evaluation results credit authorship contribution statement pei li conceptualization

4893,quantitatively assessing the practicality and sustainability of saline groundwater for irrigation at the regional level could provide a valuable reference for macro decision making and management in terms of alleviating the severe contradiction between freshwater shortages and food production in this study the distributed agro hydrological swap wofost soil water atmosphere plant world food study model was applied in the east central north china plain ncp the model was used to simulate the five saline water irrigation scenarios for a 20 year period and the effects on the spatiotemporal variations in crop yield water productivity wp and soil water and salt balances were analyzed furthermore appropriate saline water irrigation schemes were solved considering crop yield reduction and soil salt accumulation finally spatial matching between the appropriate irrigation schemes and saline groundwater resources from the perspectives of water quality and water quantity was evaluated the main results were as follows 1 the average yield and wp of winter wheat during the simulation period remained stable or increased slightly under saline water 2 6 g l 1 irrigation for winter wheat compared with that under freshwater irrigation whereas the average yield and wp of the following summer maize decreased to varying degrees 2 when the sum of seasonal precipitation and irrigation of summer maize was 450 mm 401 450 mm 351 400 mm 200 350 mm and 200 mm the average soil salt leaching depth was approximately 120 cm 100 cm 80 cm 60 cm and 40 cm respectively 3 on the premise that the average salt content of the 2 m soil profile at summer maize harvest during the simulation period was less than 3 g kg 1 if the average crop yield reduction of the rotation system in the range of 500 kg hm 2 1000 kg hm 2 1500 kg hm 2 and 2000 kg hm 2 was permitted the dominant maximum irrigation water salinity in the study area was 3 g l 1 4 g l 1 6 g l 1 and 6 g l 1 respectively 4 the average saline water amount needed for winter wheat irrigation during the simulation period was approximately 22 78 108 m3 which was approximately 9 more than the exploitable amount of saline groundwater the results could support decision making related to developing and using shallow saline groundwater for irrigation keywords saline groundwater irrigation winter wheat summer maize double cropping swap wofost model optimization matching degree north china plain 1 introduction irrigation plays a significant role in global food production döll and siebert 2002 wada et al 2012 world bank 2017 the worldwide demand for food is expected to double from 2005 to 2050 as the population grows tilman et al 2011 thus further increasing the need for water resources however irrigation consumes approximately 90 of the global freshwater resources scanlon et al 2007 siebert et al 2010 the supply of good quality water for irrigation has continued to decline in many parts of the world döll and siebert 2002 strzepek and boehlert 2010 rodell et al 2018 thus irrigation with marginal water e g brackish or saline water could help alleviate the pressure imposed by food production on water needs letey et al 2011 skaggs et al 2014 assouline et al 2015 in fact saline water has been used for irrigation in india egypt america china israel italy morocco and tunisia e g minhas 1996 ashour et al 1997 mehta et al 2000 fang and chen 2007 kan and rapaport rom 2012 leogrande et al 2016 el oumlouki et al 2018 louati et al 2018 furthermore the use of saline water to supplement the limited freshwater available for irrigation will become increasingly common in the future kan and rapaport rom 2012 chowdhury et al 2018 hence it is of great practical significance to evaluate the performance of saline water irrigation at a regional level for agricultural development and food production in areas with freshwater shortages groundwater which is an important water source for irrigation in many grain producing areas worldwide aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 gleeson et al 2012 has been overexploited resulting in continuous groundwater level drawdown giordano 2009 dalin et al 2017 the north china plain ncp is one of the main grain producing areas in china and one of the areas with the most serious decline in groundwater levels worldwide giordano 2009 cao et al 2013 rodell et al 2018 in particular the heilonggang region in the east central ncp is one of the most water deficient areas in china national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2004 2017 general office of people s government of hebei province hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2013 and the slowly renewing deep groundwater has been severely overexploited in this area zheng et al 2010 shi et al 2011 shang et al 2016 on the other hand brackish and saline water resources are widely distributed in the shallow aquifers of this area fang and chen 2007 zhang et al 2009 zhou et al 2012 huang et al 2015 and have great exploitation and utilization potential chen 1999 zhang and li 2005 zhang et al 2009 to address the deep groundwater security crisis and ensure grain production to a certain extent the chinese government has proposed to promote the use of brackish water for irrigation in this area the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2015 2019 however on a regional scale long term saline water irrigation might induce crop yield reduction and soil salt accumulation which would affect the irrigation sustainability additionally the spatial variability of saline water resources might affect the practicality of saline water irrigation and saline water irrigation should be carried out considering the specific time and place because of the differences in meteorology soil crop irrigation and other factors thus assessing the effects of saline water irrigation on crop growth and soil water and salt movements exploring the appropriate saline water irrigation schemes by considering negative impacts and evaluating the spatial matching between saline water resources and the appropriate irrigation schemes could provide scientific references for the sustainable use of saline water for irrigation adapted to local conditions in this representative area and other similar areas to reasonably use the widely distributed brackish and saline groundwater resources for irrigation many field experiments have been conducted to study the performance of saline or brackish water irrigation for winter wheat summer maize double cropping system at several experimental stations in this area since the 1980s some of the experiments emphasized the impact on crop growth ma et al 2010 cao et al 2014 or soil salt ma et al 2011 in terms of research content most previous experiments chen et al 2011 fang and chen 1997 guo et al 2017 jiao et al 2013 liu et al 2016 ma et al 2008 soothar et al 2019a wu and wang 2010 focused on the comprehensive effects of saline or brackish water irrigation on crop growth and soil environment meanwhile the ps123 qiao and yu 2003 hydrus 1d he et al 2017 liu et al 2019 and saltmed soothar et al 2019b models have been used to better describe the soil water and salt dynamics or crop growth under different saline water irrigation conditions at the station scale in this area it should be noted that these experimental results could represent the specific fields and years considered in analysis and the simulation studies were carried out at the station level moreover simultaneously conducting field experiments with different saline water irrigation schemes over long term and large scale conditions seems almost impossible thus a distributed agro hydrological model may prove to be a unique tool that can be used to assess the effects of various saline water irrigation schemes on crop yield water productivity wp and soil water and salt dynamics in this area which has multiple factors that display spatial heterogeneity the swap soil water atmosphere plant model and its embedded detailed crop module which is derived from the wofost world food study model can simulate the transports of water solute and heat in the vadose zone in interaction with crop growth in detail boogaard et al 1998 kroes et al 2009 after calibration and validation the swap model has been widely used to evaluate the impacts of saline water irrigation on soil water and salt movements and or crop growth at the station level in italy tedeschi and menenti 2002 india singh 2004 mandare et al 2008 verma et al 2014 kumar et al 2015 iran hassanli et al 2016 israel ben asher et al 2006 china huang et al 2009 jiang et al 2016 wang et al 2016 and other countries furthermore the swap or swap wofost model combined with geographic information system gis technology has been applied to analyze the influences of specific water management scenarios on crop yield wp and soil water and salt balances at the regional scale droogers et al 2000 singh et al 2006 van dam et al 2006 noory et al 2011 in addition xue and ren 2017 employed the distributed swap wofost model to estimate the performance of the conjunctive use of saline and non saline water for irrigation and recommend cropping structures we noted that few studies have been conducted to identify appropriate saline water irrigation schemes at a regional level by considering the negative effects and using the simulation results from the distributed swap wofost model and to evaluate the spatial matching of the appropriate irrigation schemes and saline water resources it is noteworthy that the distributed swap wofost model was established calibrated and validated for use in the study area using multisource and multiscale data li and ren 2019a and the effects of limited irrigation on wp and reducing deep groundwater exploitation were evaluated using the model li and ren 2019b in this paper we continue to apply the model to simulate and analyze saline water irrigation scenarios at the regional scale this study not only carries out a comprehensive agro hydrological simulation in this typical area using the validated model but also quantitatively studies another irrigation strategy other than limited irrigation that can be used to reduce the exploitation of deep groundwater therefore the main aim of this study is to identify appropriate saline groundwater irrigation schemes at the regional scale specifically the objectives are to 1 simulate and analyze different saline water irrigation scenarios using the calibrated and validated distributed swap wofost model 2 solve the maximum irrigation water salinity under specific constraints at the simulation unit level and obtain the distribution of the appropriate irrigation schemes 3 evaluate the spatial matching degree between the saline groundwater resources and the appropriate irrigation schemes 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area the heilonggang region is the main distribution area of saline groundwater in the ncp and the major deep groundwater overexploited area in hebei province fig 1 a this region has an area of approximately 4 104 km2 covering 53 counties fig 1b more than 80 of the land area is cropland the climate is warm temperate semi arid and semi humid monsoon wang 2010 according to the collected meteorological data the average precipitation in the study area in 1993 2012 was approximately 499 8 mm and approximately 3 4 25 1 62 0 and 9 5 of the precipitation was concentrated in january march april june july september and october december respectively loam soil prevails in this area the areas where the layered soil textures are loam 0 200 cm sandy loam 0 200 cm loam 0 70 cm sandy loam 70 200 cm clay loam 0 200 cm and loam 0 30 cm silty loam 30 200 cm account for approximately 45 4 16 3 5 9 5 7 and 5 0 of the study area respectively totalling approximately 78 shi et al 2004 2010 the study area is one of the key grain production areas in hebei province wang 2010 wheat and maize are the most important grain crops which contribute approximately 45 7 and 40 6 respectively to the total planting area of grain crops general office of people s government of hebei province hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2013 in other words the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system is the most dominant planting pattern saline groundwater is widely distributed and the areas with shallow groundwater salinities of 1 g l 1 1 2 g l 1 2 3 g l 1 3 5 g l 1 5 10 g l 1 and 10 g l 1 account for approximately 18 8 38 5 22 4 13 2 6 9 and 0 2 respectively of the study area fig 1a zhang and fei 2009 2 2 distributed swap wofost model in this paper the distributed swap wofost model which was established calibrated and validated in our previous study li and ren 2019a was used to simulate different saline water irrigation scenarios the main assumption of the distributed swap wofost model in this study is that an ensemble of individually homogeneous units can equivalently represent a spatially heterogeneous area this assumption is valid in the study area because of the insignificant runoff and the greater depth and smaller hydraulic gradient of shallow groundwater li and ren 2019a twelve types of zoning information fig 1c related to meteorology soil crops irrigation land use water resources shallow groundwater and administrative divisions were combined using gis which resulted in 2809 simulation units on cropland fig 1b the classification basis and spatial distribution of the 12 zones as well as the corresponding data in each zone were detailed in li and ren 2019a furthermore the parameters related to the soil water movement salt transport and crop growth modules were calibrated in detail based on global sensitivity analysis and the model simulation accuracy was evaluated using multi spatiotemporal scale data li and ren 2019a this result showed that the distributed swap wofost model could reasonably simulate the agro hydrological cycle and crop growth of winter wheat summer maize fields in the study area thus it is feasible to use the model to simulate saline water irrigation scenarios 2 3 setting the saline water irrigation scenarios this study aimed to evaluate the performance of using saline water to replace freshwater for irrigation under the current irrigation conditions thus the irrigation frequency timing and amount under the saline water irrigation scenarios were consistent with the generalized current irrigation schedule presented in li and ren 2019a the model run period consistently included a warm up period october 1989 to september 1992 and a simulation period october 1992 to october 2012 in the study area the precipitation during the summer maize growing season can often meet the water requirements in most simulation years collaborative group for water demand contour map of major crop in china 1993 li and ren 2019a moreover the salt tolerance of maize is regularly lower than that of wheat maas and hoffman 1977 thus saline water irrigation scenarios were set only for winter wheat it is important to maintain low soil salinity during the germination and emergence periods of wheat maas and poss 1989 thus saline water irrigation was applied at the raising to jointing booting to anthesis and early grain filling stages of winter wheat considering the distribution of shallow groundwater salinity the irrigation water salinity in the winter wheat growing season was set to 2 g l 1 3 g l 1 4 g l 1 5 g l 1 and 6 g l 1 for scenarios 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively the irrigation water salinity before winter wheat sowing and during the summer maize growing season was still 1 g l 1 the five scenarios were collectively called the saline water irrigation scenarios and the current irrigation schedule was called the freshwater irrigation scheme in this paper notably under the current irrigation schedule the study area was subdivided into three irrigation zones i e zones i ii and iii fig 2 a based on spatial differences in the irrigation conditions additionally the irrigation frequency and timing of winter wheat and summer maize depended on the peps of the two crops li and ren 2019a as a result the settings of the five scenarios for the winter wheat summer maize rotation system with different peps in each irrigation zone are shown in fig 2b the five scenarios were simulated and analyzed for the 2809 simulation units over a period of 20 rotation years 2 4 solving the appropriate saline water irrigation schemes in the study area it would be difficult to maintain deep groundwater exploitation for irrigation and the widely distributed shallow saline groundwater could be used for irrigation moreover this area plays an important role in grain production in hebei province and secondary salinization should be avoided under saline water irrigation conditions as a result the simulation results from the distributed swap wofost model were combined with the classic 0 1 linear programming approach in this study to explore the maximum irrigation water salinity in the winter wheat growing season max z under the constraints of specific crop yield reduction and soil salt content crop yield under saline water irrigation might be reduced compared with the yield obtained under freshwater irrigation fang and chen 1997 ma et al 2008 moreover irrigating winter wheat with saline water might lead to a higher soil salt content at the early growth stage of the following summer maize and have a negative effect on summer maize yield chen et al 2011 liu et al 2016 thus the crop yield reduction observed in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system was considered when solving the maximum irrigation water salinity meanwhile soil salt accumulation would be observed after saline water irrigation for winter wheat but the accumulated salt would be leached to the deeper soil layer by precipitation and irrigation during the summer maize season liu et al 2019 thus the level of soil salt accumulation in the rotation system was considered when solving the maximum irrigation water salinity in other words the salt content of the 2 m soil profile at the end of a rotation year i e at summer maize harvest was constrained by a threshold details about the 0 1 linear programming approach for each simulation unit are as follows 1 objective function max z i 0 5 c i x i 2 constraints s t i 0 5 y i x i a i 0 1 5 i 0 5 s i x i b i 0 1 5 i 0 5 x i 1 i 0 1 5 x i 0 or 1 i 0 1 5 where i represents the irrigation scheme where a value of zero indicates the freshwater irrigation scheme i e current irrigation schedule and the values from one to five indicate the saline water irrigation scenarios of i ci is the irrigation water salinity in the winter wheat growing season under the ith irrigation scheme g l 1 xi is the decision variable which has a value of one if the ith irrigation scheme is selected and a value of zero otherwise yi is the average yield reduction of the winter wheat summer maize rotation system during the simulation period under the ith irrigation scheme compared with that observed under the freshwater irrigation scheme kg hm 2 si is the average salt content of the 2 m soil profile at summer maize harvest during the simulation period under the ith irrigation scheme g kg 1 a is the threshold of crop yield reduction kg hm 2 and b is the threshold of the soil salt content g kg 1 after analyzing the crop yield under the five scenarios four yield reductions i e 500 kg hm 2 1000 kg hm 2 1500 kg hm 2 and 2000 kg hm 2 were successively set as threshold a soil is non saline or slightly saline when the salt content is less than 3 0 g kg 1 bao 2010 thus the value of 3 0 g kg 1 was applied as threshold b under the four combinations of the two constraints the maximum irrigation water salinity was solved at the simulation unit level the irrigation schemes with irrigation water salinities less than or equal to the solved maximum value were called the appropriate irrigation schemes for the purpose of optimization the 0 1 linear programming approach was solved in batch 11 236 times i e four constraint schemes and 2809 simulation units using vba in excel 2 5 evaluating the matching degree between the solved irrigation schemes and the saline groundwater to implement saline water irrigation based on the local conditions of the study area the matching degree between the appropriate saline water irrigation schemes and shallow saline groundwater resources was evaluated specifically at the simulation unit level if the shallow groundwater salinity was less than or equal to the solved maximum irrigation water salinity under the two constraints the shallow groundwater met the needs of the appropriate irrigation schemes from the perspective of water quality and vice versa at the county level the ratio of the exploitable amount of shallow saline groundwater qs to the amount of saline water needed for winter wheat irrigation is was defined as the assurance coefficient of saline groundwater resources a higher coefficient represented a greater assurance ability of shallow saline groundwater to irrigate winter wheat from the perspective of water quantity the values of is and qs were estimated in each county the steps of calculating is were as follows 1 the irrigation quota of saline water for winter wheat i e the sum of the saline water irrigation amount in the winter wheat growing season was different among irrigation zones and peps thus the average saline water irrigation quota mm during the simulation period in each simulation unit was calculated 2 the average saline water irrigation quota mm in each county was estimated using the area weighted average 3 the is value 108 m3 in each county was calculated by multiplying the average saline water irrigation quota by the average planting area of winter wheat in 1994 2012 general office of people s government of hebei province hebei provincial bureau of statistics 1995 2013 the steps of estimating qs were as follows 1 the natural recharge values of brackish 1 3 g l 1 and semi saline 3 5 g l 1 groundwater and the exploitable amount of brackish groundwater in each county were collected from the national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 the natural recharge of semi saline groundwater was greater than zero in 25 counties thus the exploitable amount of semi saline groundwater was estimated based on its natural recharge 2 the total recharge is the sum of natural recharge and well irrigation recharge zhang and li 2005 and the well irrigation recharge of semi saline groundwater accounted for 1 3 2 5 of its total recharge in the hebei plain national groundwater resource assessment project office 2004 zhang and li 2005 thus the natural recharge of semi saline groundwater was assumed to be the total recharge 3 the exploitable amount under the current condition is the total recharge minus the irretrievable groundwater leakage and phreatic evaporation zhang and li 2005 the sum of leakage and phreatic evaporation of semi saline groundwater accounted for 25 00 13 92 0 00 45 45 40 00 and 41 35 of its total recharge in the cities of handan xingtai baoding cangzhou langfang and hengshui respectively zhang et al 2009 thus the total recharge of semi saline groundwater in each county was converted to the exploitable amount based on the above proportions of the corresponding city 4 the sum of the exploitable amounts of brackish and semi saline groundwater was recorded as qs at the county level overall the detailed flow chart is shown in fig 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation results of saline water irrigation scenarios 3 1 1 crop yield the saline water irrigation frequencies for winter wheat in zones i ii and iii were 2 3 1 2 and 0 1 respectively fig 2 the average winter wheat yield during the simulation period under the five saline water irrigation scenarios in zones i ii and iii increased by approximately 0 55 1 01 3 04 14 63 and 1 85 10 25 respectively compared with the average yield under the freshwater irrigation scheme except for zone i under scenario 5 where the average winter wheat yield decreased by approximately 14 0 kg hm 2 table 1 although the summer maize was still irrigated with freshwater the average summer maize yield decreased by approximately 3 31 22 60 6 85 32 53 and 3 88 20 31 in zones i ii and iii respectively as a result of using saline water irrigation for winter wheat table 1 overall the average yield of the winter wheat summer maize rotation system under the five scenarios was reduced by approximately 1 57 12 54 2 50 11 76 and 2 40 12 41 in zones i ii and iii respectively table 1 the reasons for the increase in winter wheat yield and the decrease in summer maize yield were as follows 1 summer maize was rain fed in most simulation years under the current irrigation schedule and summer maize with relatively high salt sensitivity would suffer salt stress if there was not enough precipitation during its early growth stage to leach the salt that accumulated during the winter wheat season and this salt stress would have a negative impact on the root water uptake and yield of summer maize 2 after the raising stage winter wheat was relatively less sensitive to salt stress maas and poss 1989 fang and chen 2008 and obvious salt stress on winter wheat growth was not observed when the irrigation water salinity was less than or equal to 6 g l 1 in particular in zones ii and iii which had poor current irrigation conditions li and ren 2019a the root water uptake of summer maize was affected by the application of saline water irrigation for winter wheat which would increase the available water in the 2 m soil profile in the upcoming winter wheat season alleviate the water stress of winter wheat and further increase the yield at nanpi station fang and chen 1997 found that the winter wheat yield was reduced by approximately 2 2 when saline water 5 6 g l 1 was applied after the jointing stage and freshwater was applied at the seedling stage liu et al 2016 found that the applications of saline water 2 g l 1 or 5 g l 1 at the jointing stage and freshwater at the overwintering stage did not significantly decrease the winter wheat yield however these applications had a negative impact on the following summer maize soothar et al 2019a observed that saline water 4 7 ds m 1 irrigation at the jointing and anthesis stages of winter wheat caused a 2 reduction in grain yield compared with freshwater irrigation at hengshui station an increase in winter wheat yield and a decrease in summer maize yield were observed at lingxian station in an area close to the study area when saline water 3 g l 1 was used to irrigate winter wheat at the jointing and anthesis stages pang et al 2010 wang et al 2015 reported that as water salinity increased from 3 3 ds m 1 to 5 0 ds m 1 and 6 8 ds m 1 the winter wheat yield decreased in the 2011 2012 season and increased and then decreased in the 2012 2013 season at fengqiu station in the area surrounding the study area these site specific results in the ncp suggest that our simulation results at the regional scale were reliable to some extent the average yield reduction of the rotation system under each scenario reached its maximum value in zone i followed by that in zones ii and iii table 1 because the average saline water irrigation frequency in zone i was greater than that in zones ii and iii and further led to more soil salt despite the same irrigation water salinity the results could provide a quantitative reference for the trade off between irrigation water salinity and irrigation frequency when implementing saline water irrigation in each simulation year the application of saline water with salinity less than or equal to 6 g l 1 to irrigate winter wheat had little influence on its average yield in the study area compared to the freshwater irrigation scheme with annual variations that were basically within 10 fig 4 a e the annual variation in the average summer maize yield gradually increased as the irrigation water salinity for winter wheat increased fig 4a e taking scenario 5 as an example the average reduction of the summer maize yield was greater than 1000 kg hm 2 in most simulation years except 1997 1998 1999 2001 2002 and 2004 fig 4e in 1997 1998 1999 and 2002 the peps of summer maize were at least 75 i e dry or drier season thus lower summer maize yields were achieved in these years because of the higher water stress li and ren 2019b which means there was less room for further yield reductions caused by salt stress in 2001 and 2004 soil salt was leached as a result of the greater precipitation during the winter wheat season li and ren 2019b which led to a lower soil salt content in the early stage of summer maize and lower salt stress 3 1 2 wp wp quantifies the crop production per unit of water used singh et al 2006 and was defined as the ratio of crop yield to seasonal evapotranspiration in this study compared with the freshwater irrigation scheme the average wp of winter wheat during the simulation period remained virtually unchanged in zones i and iii under scenarios 1 and 2 decreased by 0 84 2 52 in zone i and increased by 2 00 4 00 in zone iii under scenarios 3 to 5 and increased by 2 41 8 43 in zone ii under the five scenarios table 1 the average wp of summer maize under the five scenarios in zones i ii and iii decreased by 1 66 14 36 4 58 24 43 and 2 52 15 13 respectively except for zone ii under scenario 2 where the average wp increased by 1 53 table 1 furthermore the average wp of the rotation system in the three zones decreased by 0 68 9 46 1 85 9 26 and 2 17 10 87 respectively table 1 compared with the freshwater irrigation scheme the average interannual variation in the winter wheat wp was slight within 0 04 kg m 3 under the five scenarios while the average interannual variation in the summer maize wp increased as the salinity of the irrigation water used for winter wheat increased fig s1a e wang et al 2015 found that the effect of irrigation water salinity for winter wheat on its wp was non significant at fengqiu station which is similar to our simulation results 3 1 3 water balance components as reported in our previous study li and ren 2019a the study area involves two bottom boundary condition zones i e the area with free drainage of the 2 m soil profile was zone a and the area with zero flux of the 15 m soil profile was zone b the growth of winter wheat and summer maize under the saline water irrigation scenarios was strongly affected by the soil water and salt conditions in the root zone thus the water balance components of the 0 200 cm soil profiles were analyzed under the six irrigation schemes i e the freshwater irrigation scheme and the five saline water irrigation scenarios the differences in the water balance components during the winter wheat season fig 5 a summer maize season fig 5b and the rotation system fig 5c were observed even though the precipitation and irrigation amounts remained constant for the two crops when the irrigation water salinity for winter wheat increased from 1 g l 1 to 6 g l 1 the average interception during the simulation period in the study area increased by approximately 0 4 mm for winter wheat fig 5a and decreased by approximately 4 0 mm for summer maize fig 5b the average transpiration of winter wheat increased from approximately 318 1 mm to 328 9 mm and then decreased to 328 4 mm with a maximum increase of 3 4 under scenario 4 fig 5a and the average transpiration of summer maize decreased from approximately 253 7 mm to 204 4 mm with a maximum decrease of 19 4 fig 5b correspondingly the average proportion of transpiration in the outflow i e the sum of interception transpiration evaporation and bottom flux decreased from 74 6 to 72 5 for winter wheat fig 5a and from 72 3 to 63 8 for summer maize fig 5b the average amounts of evaporation and bottom flux leakage during the winter wheat fig 5a and summer maize fig 5b seasons increased as the salinity of the irrigation water used for winter wheat increased as the irrigation water salinity increased from 1 g l 1 to 6 g l 1 the average soil water storage change in the 0 200 cm profiles ranged from approximately 44 3 mm to 70 9 mm during the winter wheat season fig 5a and from approximately 34 1 mm to 64 7 mm during the summer maize season fig 5b on average the outflow during the winter wheat season increased slightly 4 8 26 7 mm under the five scenarios compared with the freshwater irrigation scheme fig 5a soothar et al 2019a found that the difference in outflow was not statistically significant under the freshwater and saline water irrigation treatments in summary an increase in the salinity of water used to irrigate winter wheat would result in an increase in soil salt content in the early stage of the following summer maize which affected the root water uptake of summer maize and further reduced transpiration meanwhile the higher soil salt content would decrease the average leaf area index lai of summer maize and further reduce interception the parts of precipitation and irrigation during the summer maize season that were consumed by interception and transpiration would decrease as the salinity of the irrigation water applied to winter wheat increased resulting in increases in the evaporation leakage and soil water storage change for summer maize the increased soil water storage during the summer maize season would provide more soil water to be consumed by the next winter wheat season and might increase the average lai of winter wheat the increase in lai might lead to increases in the interception and transpiration of winter wheat the increased soil water storage was not completely consumed by winter wheat transpiration thus the average evaporation and leakage amounts increased the increase in the transpiration of winter wheat might be caused by the following reasons 1 winter wheat was irrigated with saline water at its salt tolerant stage 2 the accumulated salt was leached to the deeper soil layers by the seasonal precipitation and irrigation of summer maize and the pre sowing freshwater irrigation of winter wheat and 3 the increasing salt stress on summer maize resulted in greater available soil water storage that could be used for winter wheat growth on average along with the increase in irrigation water salinity applied to winter wheat the interception and transpiration amounts of the rotation system decreased while the amounts of evaporation leakage and soil water storage change increased fig 5c 3 1 4 salt balance distribution and leaching the salt storage index ssi is defined as the ratio of salt storage change ssc in the soil profile to the initial salt storage singh et al 2003 the ssi expresses the salt build up in the root zone and it must be near zero or negative over a long period for a system to be sustainable singh et al 2003 on average the salts in the 0 200 cm soil profiles were mainly derived from irrigation for winter wheat and summer maize under the six irrigation schemes fig 6 the average ssc values during the winter wheat season were positive under the six irrigation schemes fig 6 because the salt flux leaching from the 0 200 cm soil profiles was less than the salt flux of irrigation in contrast the average ssc values during the summer maize season were negative overall the ssc values of the rotation system were also positive fig 6 the average salt flux of irrigation for summer maize was maintained at a constant level i e 2 05 mg cm 2 under the six irrigation schemes fig 6 when the irrigation water salinity for winter wheat increased from 1 g l 1 to 6 g l 1 the average salt flux of irrigation during the winter wheat season ranged from approximately 26 56 mg cm 2 to 124 16 mg cm 2 the average salt flux leaching from the 0 200 cm soil profiles increased from approximately 10 14 mg cm 2 to 59 50 mg cm 2 during the winter wheat season and from approximately 9 27 mg cm 2 to 40 69 mg cm 2 during the summer maize season and the average ssc value of the rotation system increased from approximately 9 20 mg cm 2 to 26 02 mg cm 2 with the proportion of ssc in the total salt flux of irrigation decreasing from approximately 32 2 to 20 6 fig 6 the results showed that the increasing salinity of irrigation water applied to winter wheat resulted in increases in both the salt flux of irrigation during the winter wheat season and the salt flux leaching from the soil profile during the winter wheat and summer maize seasons resulting in a slight increase in the ssc value of the rotation system when the irrigation water salinity was greater than or equal to 3 g l 1 the average ssi values of the 0 200 cm soil profiles of the rotation system remained generally stable fig 6 the study area was related to the three irrigation zones i e zones i ii and iii and two bottom boundary condition zones i e zones a and b and the differences in the average salt balance components of the 0 200 cm soil profiles in the overlapping areas of zone i and zone a fig s2 of zone i and zone b fig s3 of zone ii and zone b fig s4 and of zone iii and zone b fig s5 were observed under the six irrigation schemes on average 71 1 84 1 of the total salt flux of irrigation was leached from the 2 m soil profile in zone a fig s2 similar results have been reported by other researchers sharma et al 1994 chauhan et al 2008 verma et al 2012 verma et al 2012 concluded that salt build up was observed during the winter season due to saline water irrigation and the concentrated excess precipitation during the monsoon season would leach the accumulated salts thus leading to a salt free root zone in areas with a deep water table in monsoon climatic regions with an average annual precipitation exceeding 500 mm more than 80 of the salt accumulated during wheat cultivation is leached without any long term increase in the soil salinity sharma et al 1994 chauhan et al 2008 notably limited by the function of the swap wofost model it would be difficult to show that the saline groundwater used for irrigation was exploited from the shallow aquifers i e the salt flux of irrigation was from an external source in the simulation thus saline water irrigation would increase the salt content in the saturated unsaturated soil profiles to some extent from the perspective of the salt balance and it might increase the shallow groundwater salinity in zone a the shallow groundwater depth was basically greater than 4 m and the water and salt movements in the 2 m soil profile would be slightly affected by the fluctuation of shallow groundwater depth thus the change in shallow groundwater salinity might have less of an effect on the reliability of the simulation results in zone b three simulation units were selected from the central part of zones i ii and iii to conduct numerical experiments and the results showed that the use of saline water from an external source for irrigation for 20 years would not significantly increase the shallow groundwater salinity thus it might be acceptable to evaluate the impact of saline water irrigation on crop growth and secondary salinization risk without considering the change in shallow groundwater salinity the average ssc value of the 0 200 cm soil profiles in the study area during the winter wheat season was negative only in 2001 and 2004 and it was greater than zero in the other simulation years under the six irrigation schemes fig s6b g showing different degrees of salt accumulation the average ssc values during the summer maize season were typically negative each year and the interannual differences in the ssc value increased as the salinity of irrigation water applied to winter wheat increased fig s6b g the seasonal precipitation of summer maize was higher in 1994 1995 1996 and 2012 fig s6a which were wet years li and ren 2019b thus the reduction of the average salt storage in these years was more than that in the other simulation years for each simulation unit in each simulation year the changes in the soil salt concentration mg cm 3 in each layer 20 cm per layer of the 0 200 cm soil profiles during the winter wheat season summer maize season and rotation system under the six irrigation schemes were simulated and calculated furthermore for each soil layer the proportion of the distribution area where the change in soil salt concentration fell within a specific range in the total simulation area was calculated finally the average values of the proportion and ssi during the simulation period were calculated during the winter wheat season the average ssi values in each layer of the 0 120 cm profiles were positive under the five designed scenarios and the changes in soil salt concentration in these layers were predominantly greater than 0 mg cm 3 i e salt accumulation fig 7 a salt accumulation was observed in each layer of the 0 60 cm profiles in more than 90 of the simulation area fig 7a in each layer of the 120 200 cm profiles the average ssi values were less than or equal to zero and salt leaching i e the soil salt concentration change was negative occurred in more than 60 of the simulation area fig 7a the experimental results after applying saline water irrigation for winter wheat at quzhou station showed that the salt mainly accumulated in the 0 40 cm soil layer qiao et al 1999 and the salt load rapidly increased notably in the upper 80 cm ma et al 2008 under the five scenarios the soil depth with salt accumulation during the winter wheat season varied in the study area probably because of the spatial variabilities of the irrigation frequency seasonal precipitation and vertical soil texture under the six irrigation schemes the changes in the soil salt concentration in each layer of the 0 100 cm profiles during the summer maize season were less than 0 mg cm 3 in more than half of the simulation area and the average ssi values were also negative indicating salt leaching fig 7b additionally the proportion of the area with salt leaching to the total simulation area decreased with increasing soil depth during the summer maize season this result means that the spatiotemporal differences in precipitation and irrigation during the summer maize season might affect the salt leaching depth thus the soil salt variations under different precipitation and irrigation levels were further analyzed specifically for each simulation year and each soil layer of the 0 200 cm profiles the distribution area where the change in soil salt concentration during the summer maize season was less than 0 mg cm 3 i e salt leaching was counted when the sum of seasonal precipitation and irrigation of summer maize pism was within a specific range furthermore the average proportion of the distribution area with salt leaching to the total area and the average ssi value in each soil layer were calculated fig 8 when the pism value was greater than 450 mm the average ssi values in each layer of the 0 120 cm profiles were less than or equal to zero under the five scenarios fig 8b f that is the average soil depth of salt leaching reached 120 cm at this time salt was leached from the 0 120 cm soil layer in more than 50 of the total area and mainly accumulated in the 120 200 cm soil layer when the pism value was 401 450 mm the average ssi values in each layer of the 0 100 cm profiles were negative under each scenario and salt leaching occurred in each layer of the 0 100 cm profiles in more than 60 of the total area fig 8b f as the pism value ranged from 351 to 400 mm the average ssi values were less than zero in each layer of the 0 80 cm profiles under the five scenarios fig 8b f when the pism value ranged from 301 mm to 350 mm the average ssi values were negative in each layer of the 0 60 cm profiles under scenarios 1 and 2 fig 8b c and they were no more than zero in each layer of the 0 80 cm profiles under scenarios 3 to 5 fig 8d f the average ssi values were negative in each layer of the 0 60 cm profiles under each scenario when the pism value was 200 300 mm fig 8b f as the pism value less than 200 mm the average ssi values were negative in each layer of the 0 40 cm profiles under the five scenarios and salt accumulated in the 40 120 cm soil layer fig 8b f the results showed there was a positive correlation between salt leaching depth and pism value the experimental results at nanpi station showed that the 0 40 cm soil layer was desalinated when the precipitation from july to august was greater than 300 mm and desalination occurred in the 40 80 cm soil layer in wet years while salt accumulation occurred in dry years fang and chen 1997 from the experimental results at quzhou station the maximum soil depth to which the salt was leached in the wet season was approximately 150 cm ma et al 2008 he et al 2017 used the hydrus 1d model to simulate saline water irrigation for winter wheat at nanpi station and found that freshwater irrigation in conjunction with precipitation during the summer maize season leached soil salts from the root zone 0 100 cm with salt accumulation in the 160 220 cm soil layer liu et al 2019 calibrated and validated the hydrus 1d model at two sites in nanpi county and applied the model to evaluate the two saline water irrigation scenarios the results showed that the seasonal precipitation distribution determined the seasonal characteristics of salt changes in the topsoil layer 0 100 cm the results at the station level from the above experimental and simulation studies could support our simulation results at the regional level in other words sufficient precipitation in the summer maize season could leach salt to the deeper soil layer but the leaching depth varied due to the differences in soil conditions and the amounts and distributions of precipitation and irrigation our results at a finer scale could provide quantitative information for assessing the effect of the specific saline water irrigation scenario on salt accumulation on different temporal and spatial scales considering that more than 80 of the roots of winter wheat and summer maize were distributed in the 0 40 cm soil layer zhang 1999 the average salt concentration in the soil water of this layer at the three time points i e one day before and after pre sowing irrigation of winter wheat and one day before sowing of summer maize was analyzed the application of saline water with a salinity less than or equal to 6 g l 1 to irrigate winter wheat significantly increased the salt concentration before summer maize sowing fig s7a f fang and chen 1997 indicated that the salt tolerance threshold at the seedling stage of wheat was 10 mg cm 3 the salt concentration before winter wheat pre sowing irrigation decreased considerably exceeding the salt tolerance threshold only in some simulation years however it was within the suitable range after pre sowing irrigation in nearly all simulation years fig s7a f the results could quantify the contribution of freshwater pre sowing irrigation of winter wheat to the alleviation of salt stress on the winter wheat growth under saline water irrigation conditions 3 2 appropriate irrigation schemes compared with the freshwater irrigation scheme the average yield reduction of the winter wheat summer maize rotation system during the 20 simulation years p was less than or equal to 500 kg hm 2 in more than 98 of the simulation area under scenario 1 the p value was less than or equal to 1000 kg hm 2 in more than 97 of the simulation area under scenario 2 the p value was less than or equal to 1500 kg hm 2 in more than 93 of the simulation area under scenarios 3 and 4 and the p value was less than or equal to 2000 kg hm 2 in more than 94 of the simulation area under scenario 5 fig 9a 1 the average salt content of the 2 m soil profile at summer maize harvest during the 20 simulation years q was less than or equal to 3 g kg 1 in more than 95 of the simulation area under the freshwater irrigation scheme and scenario 1 and it was less than or equal to 5 g kg 1 in more than 96 of the simulation area under scenarios 2 to 5 fig 9a 2 on each simulation unit the maximum irrigation water salinity for winter wheat was solved in turn under the two constraints i e p was no more than a specific threshold and q was less than 3 g kg 1 and there were four constraint schemes under the first scheme i e p 500 kg hm 2 and q 3 g kg 1 the areas where the maximum irrigation water salinity in the winter wheat growing season was 1 g l 1 2 g l 1 3 g l 1 4 g l 1 5 g l 1 and 6 g l 1 accounted for 4 4 23 9 42 7 21 4 4 5 and 2 0 respectively of the total area fig 9b 1 and the spatial distribution of the maximum is shown in fig 9b 2 under the second scheme i e p 1000 kg hm 2 and q 3 g kg 1 the areas where the maximum irrigation water salinity was 1 g l 1 2 g l 1 3 g l 1 4 g l 1 5 g l 1 and 6 g l 1 were distributed in 3 8 9 8 16 7 28 7 22 4 and 17 5 respectively of the simulation area fig 9b 1 and fig 9b 3 under the third scheme i e p 1500 kg hm 2 and q 3 g kg 1 the proportions of the area with the maximum irrigation water salinity of 1 g l 1 2 g l 1 3 g l 1 4 g l 1 5 g l 1 and 6 g l 1 to the total area were 3 8 9 6 10 7 15 8 24 2 and 34 8 respectively fig 9b 1 and fig 9b 4 under the fourth scheme i e p 2000 kg hm 2 and q 3 g kg 1 the maximum irrigation water salinity with values of 1 g l 1 2 g l 1 3 g l 1 4 g l 1 5 g l 1 and 6 g l 1 were distributed in 3 8 9 6 10 7 14 1 15 7 and 45 0 respectively of the simulation area fig 9b 1 and fig 9b 5 in addition all irrigation schemes could not satisfy the two constraints in approximately 1 1 of the simulation area which was mainly distributed in the coastal area fig 9 b because of the higher initial soil salt content bai 1999 as well as the lower depth and higher salinity of shallow groundwater zhang and fei 2009 which resulted in q values greater than 3 g kg 1 under all irrigation schemes under a specific constraint scheme it should be noted that the maximum irrigation water salinity was lower in some parts of the study area the appropriate irrigation water salinity should not be too high in areas with more clay in the 2 m soil profile shi et al 2004 2010 because it is not conducive for salt leaching under saline water irrigation the shallow groundwater in some areas has a lower depth li and ren 2019a and higher salinity zhang and fei 2009 and the upward movement of shallow groundwater would bring salt into the root zone and impose more salt stress on crop growth thus the appropriate irrigation water salinity should not be too high the appropriate irrigation schemes were explored on the fine simulation unit level by making full use of the simulation results from the distributed swap wofost model for 20 rotation years which facilitates the formulation of suitable saline water irrigation schemes by policy makers based on the spatial heterogeneity of multiple factors e g meteorology soil crop and irrigation crop yield levels and secondary salinization risk 3 3 matching degree between the appropriate irrigation schemes and saline groundwater resources the matching degree between the appropriate irrigation schemes and saline groundwater resources was evaluated at the regional level fig 9c to provide quantitative references for the implementation of saline water irrigation according to local conditions the areas where the shallow groundwater salinity was 1 g l 1 1 3 g l 1 3 5 g l 1 and 5 g l 1 accounted for 18 35 62 01 13 58 and 6 06 respectively of the total simulation area fig 9d 1 in the whole study area the exploitable amount of shallow saline groundwater qs and the amount of saline water needed for winter wheat irrigation is were approximately 20 87 108 m3 and 22 78 108 m3 respectively and they differed by 1 91 108 m3 the assurance coefficient of the saline groundwater resources in each county is shown in fig 9d 2 the number of counties with assurance coefficients in the ranges of 1 00 0 81 1 00 0 60 0 80 and 0 60 was 23 3 9 and 18 respectively accounting for 43 40 5 66 16 98 and 33 96 of the total 53 counties fig 9d 2 and the assurance ability of the saline groundwater resources with the four ranges was defined as good fair poor and very poor respectively the 23 counties with good assurance ability are shown in fig 9c the qs value in these counties could meet the need for winter wheat irrigation in some parts of these counties the shallow groundwater salinity was higher than the maximum obtained under the four constraint schemes fig 9c thus the shallow saline groundwater should be mixed with freshwater e g deep groundwater surface water to reduce the salinity to a suitable range for irrigation in other parts of the counties the shallow groundwater salinity could satisfy the appropriate irrigation schemes and showed a higher matching degree fig 9c in the other 30 counties the qs value was less than the is value and the counties with fair poor and very poor assurance abilities are shown in fig 9c first there was no saline groundwater in the north western part of the study area i e non saline groundwater area fig 9c where the shallow fresh groundwater has been overexploited ren et al 2007 transferred water e g south to north water diversion project yellow river to hebei province water transfer project or non conventional water e g reclaimed water collected precipitation could be used to relieve groundwater overexploitation in the non saline groundwater area the utilization of farm ponds to collect precipitation is an efficient way to improve water use in the ncp sun et al 2016 and the collected precipitation might be saline which could be regarded as an extra source of saline water in this area thus the assessment of saline water irrigation in this area could help evaluate the risk of using other saline water resources for irrigation second for the areas where the assurance ability was not good e g fair poor or very poor and the shallow groundwater salinity did not exceed the solved maximum fig 9c transferred water or non conventional water could be used to supplement the shortage of saline groundwater for irrigation moreover saline water irrigation could be combined with limited irrigation that is saline water irrigation could be applied one or two times at the key growth stages of winter wheat to prevent saline groundwater overexploitation which is an important measure for sustainable grain production that was proposed by zhang et al 2016 finally for the areas where the assurance ability was not good and the shallow groundwater salinity did not satisfy the appropriate irrigation schemes fig 9c some measures e g mixed or rotation irrigation with saline water and freshwater combined use of other water resources decreasing saline water irrigation frequency could be comprehensively adopted to achieve the goal of reducing deep groundwater exploitation based on local conditions in addition the appropriate irrigation schemes could not be solved under the two given constraints in approximately 1 1 of the simulation area which was defined as the non solution area fig 9c the risk of saline water irrigation was higher in this area thus it is suggested to maintain the current irrigation schedule or implement rain fed in this area the study area is the most important area in the action plan for the comprehensive treatment of groundwater overexploitation in north china following the framework of simulation optimization evaluation the results would provide a valuable reference for this area to reduce deep groundwater exploitation develop and utilize shallow saline groundwater for irrigation reasonably and implement saline water irrigation schemes according to the local conditions 4 conclusions in view of the importance of the study area in wheat production the difficulty in continuing deep groundwater exploitation and the possibility to exploit shallow saline groundwater for irrigation the distributed agro hydrological swap wofost model was applied after calibration and validation to simulate and analyze different saline water irrigation scenarios at the regional level furthermore the appropriate saline water irrigation schemes were solved under the two constraints of acceptable crop yield reduction and soil salt accumulation finally the spatial matching between the appropriate irrigation schemes and saline groundwater resources was evaluated several conclusions were drawn as follows 1 saline water 2 6 g l 1 was used to irrigate winter wheat two or three times in zone i and the average yield and wp of winter wheat during the simulation period remained generally stable with variations less than 3 compared with the value under freshwater irrigation the average reductions in yield and wp of the following summer maize were within 23 and 15 respectively in zones ii and iii where the saline water irrigation frequency was 1 2 and 0 1 respectively the average yield and wp of winter wheat increased under the five designed scenarios with a maximum increase of less than 15 while the average yield and wp of summer maize decreased with a maximum decrease of 33 the results might help to quantify the impact of using shallow saline groundwater instead of deep groundwater for winter wheat irrigation on grain production 2 on average compared with the freshwater irrigation scheme the application of saline water for winter wheat irrigation reduced the interception and transpiration of the following summer maize while it increased the evaporation leakage and soil water storage change in the 2 m soil profile more soil water storage was consumed by the subsequent winter wheat resulting in increases in interception transpiration evaporation and leakage of winter wheat to varying degrees under the five scenarios salt mainly accumulated in the 0 120 cm soil layer especially in the upper 60 cm layer during the winter wheat season and salt mostly leached from the 0 100 cm soil layer during the summer maize season when the sum of the precipitation and irrigation amounts during the summer maize season was in the range of 450 mm 401 450 mm 351 400 mm 200 350 mm and 200 mm the average salt leaching depth reached approximately 120 cm 100 cm 80 cm 60 cm and 40 cm respectively the results could enhance our understanding of soil water and salt movement characteristics at the macro level 3 under the two constraints that the average crop yield reduction of the rotation system during the 20 simulation years p was no more than 500 kg hm 2 and the average salt content of the 2 m soil profile at summer maize harvest during the 20 simulation years q was less than 3 g kg 1 the maximum irrigation water salinity for winter wheat was predominantly 3 g l 1 in the study area under the second i e p 1000 kg hm 2 and q 3 g kg 1 third i e p 1500 kg hm 2 and q 3 g kg 1 and fourth i e p 2000 kg hm 2 and q 3 g kg 1 constraint schemes the maximum irrigation water salinity was mainly 4 g l 1 6 g l 1 and 6 g l 1 respectively the irrigation water salinity in the areas with more clay in the soil and a lower depth and higher salinity of shallow groundwater should be lower than that used in other areas the results could be instrumental for the relevant management departments to select appropriate saline water irrigation schemes considering the spatial variability of multiple factors the crop yield level and the secondary salinization risk 4 in the whole study area the average amount of saline water needed for winter wheat irrigation during the simulation period was approximately 22 78 108 m3 which was 1 91 108 m3 more than the exploitable amount of saline groundwater in the 23 counties located in the northeast and south of the study area the exploitable amount of saline groundwater could meet the needs of winter wheat irrigation with a good assurance ability in most parts of these counties the shallow groundwater salinity could also satisfy the appropriate irrigation schemes showing a high matching degree in the other counties with fair poor and very poor assurance abilities some practical measures were proposed to alleviate the severe deep groundwater overexploitation considering the spatial distribution of water resources this study not only provides quantitative bases for implementing sustainable agricultural water management in the study area but also presents a typical case that other areas can reference when trying to use saline water to relieve the contradiction between freshwater shortages and food production because of limitations in the relevant data spatiotemporal changes in the salinity of shallow groundwater and the exploitable amount of saline groundwater during the simulation period are difficult to estimate which may cause some degree of uncertainty in the evaluation results credit authorship contribution statement pei li conceptualization

4894,long term imbalance of water demand over supply in drylands can result in serious ecological issues such as severe soil desiccation posing a great challenge to sustainable development of dryland orchards this study examined the effects of multi intensity summer pruning on water balance production and water use efficiency of apple orchards on china s loess plateau using in situ measurements and the process based maespa model a field experiment with four intensities representing no 0 or control light 10 moderate 25 and heavy 40 pruning of branches was carried out in three replicates under each treatment the pruning intensities dictated transpiration soil moisture and drainage although light pruning had weak impacts on these factors moderate and heavy pruning significantly reduced growing season transpiration by an average 10 4 and 28 5 respectively however the effects progressively faded away with time at both diurnal and seasonal scales moderate and heavy pruning also increased soil water content in the 20 180 cm by an average 18 3 and 20 8 respectively and thus enhanced drainage below 180 cm 220 mm relative to light pruning and control 170 mm furthermore light and moderate pruning clearly promoted apple yield and water use efficiency whereas heavy pruning significantly reduced 24 7 apple yield thus moderate pruning can be a good choice for apple orchards in normal precipitation years while heavy pruning may be an alternative in severe drought years the maespa model reliably simulated seasonal variations of transpiration r2 0 799 0 910 root mean square

quantify the effects of pruning on hydrological processes in dryland apple orchards this study provides insights into the development of a sustainable management strategy in dryland orchards keywords canopy pruning soil moisture evapotranspiration maespa loess plateau 1 introduction drylands cover nearly half of the world s terrestrial land surface and support over a quarter of the global population s living space koutroulis 2019 they are the main contributor to global food production plaza et al 2018 and the optimal area of a variety of fruit trees due to abundant sunshine and large diurnal temperature variation china s loess plateau is dominated by drylands and covers the world s largest area under apple trees providing the livelihood for 10 million smallholder farmers in 2017 the area and production reached beyond 1 30 million ha and 23 million tons accounting for 25 and 27 of world s total respectively china agriculture statistical report 2018 however water scarcity results in an imbalance between supply and demand of water hindering the sustainable development of apple orchards under more intensive droughts in drylands huang et al 2016 therefore it is important to optimize water management strategies to reduce water consumption while maintaining yield the shift from cropland or natural vegetation to plantations become more common in the past two decades due to various economic and ecological reasons foley et al 2005 markewitz et al 2010 however the high water demanding plantations incur severe land degradation in drylands where groundwater is unavailable robinson et al 2006 wang et al 2011 gao et al 2018a goulden and bales 2019 jia et al 2019 for examples in southwest western australia 7 year old mallee eucalyptus depleted soil water to wilting point at layers below 15 m impeding groundwater recharge robinson et al 2006 gao et al 2018a found that the single species and mixed plantations of robinia pseudoacacia platycladus orientalis caragana korshinskii and hippophae rhamnoides caused severe desiccation at deep soils on the loess plateau deep layer soil desiccation has also been reported in dryland apple orchards due to excessive water consumption for instance wang et al 2015 reported that soil layers as deep as 16 m underwent severe desiccation in 17 year old apple orchards on the loess plateau reducing apple production and quality peng et al 2017 therefore identifying ways to alleviate soil desiccation and water stress in dryland apple orchards is paramount various management practices have been developed to cope with water scarcity in drylands unlike terracing and mulching practices which aim to increase infiltration and decrease soil evaporation li et al 2018 wang et al 2019 canopy pruning is frequently used in forest management to reduce canopy transpiration and rainfall interception forrester et al 2012 hipps et al 2014 chen et al 2016 conesa et al 2019 ma et al 2019 by altering canopy structure leaf area and micrometeorology forrester et al 2012 for example hipps et al 2014 reported that removal of the outer 30 length of all major branches of london plane platanus acerifolia trees conserved soil moisture abad et al 2019 found that only heavy pruning trimming 40 60 of shoot length can reduce water stress of grapevine vitis vinifera l during prolonged droughts ma et al 2019 also found that heavy pruning decreased canopy transpiration by nearly 80 and increased water use efficiency in jujube ziziphus jujuba mill plantations on the loess plateau of china for dryland orchards summer pruning is adopted to remove unproductive shoots called water sprouts and even part of the productive shoots to maintain water status during droughts for example lopez et al 2006 and conesa et al 2019 reported that summer pruning significantly improved stem water potential in peach prunus persica trees compared to those without pruning nevertheless the effect of summer pruning on water balance production and water use efficiency remains limited for dryland orchards which is unfavorable for optimizing field management strategy for sustainable water use in addition to field observations process based modeling has promise for evaluating the effects of canopy pruning on water consumption of fruit trees and providing valuable information for orchard management significant efforts have been made to simulate transpiration root water uptake and or soil water changes using penman monteith model crago and brutsaert 1992 shuttleworth wallace model chen et al 2015 dzikiti et al 2018 richards equations green et al 2003 deb et al 2013 and root water uptake models hildebrandt et al 2016 models have also been developed to simulate the effects of pruning on net biomass production pinkard et al 1999 and tree growth berninger et al 2000 however process oriented models have rarely been used to explore the interaction between pruning and evapotranspiration and soil water dynamics in orchards despite their great promise in developing management strategies the maespa model which couples the maestra multi array evaporation stand tree radiation a wang and jarvis 1990 and spa soil plant atmosphere williams et al 2001 models is a mechanistic and 3d model that simulates canopy radiation absorption photosynthesis and water and energy balance at either single tree or stand scale duursma and medlyn 2012 in recent years this model has been successfully used to simulate transpiration profile soil water growth and production and other physiological traits in both natural forests and plantations subjected to human management christina et al 2017 vezy et al 2018 thus the maespa model has strong potential for investigating the effects of pruning on evapotranspiration and soil moisture variations in apple orchards on the loess plateau apple trees plantings are mainly located in semiarid and dry sub humid regions where the mean annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 650 mm these areas often suffer severe seasonal droughts in growing periods which exacerbates water paucity and forces trees to forage water in deep soils gao et al 2018b however once deep soil water has been excessively exploited it is difficult to be replenished with the limited precipitation and deep ground water 30 m severe soil desiccation can occur in apple orchards wang et al 2015 which significantly affects the growth production and sustainable development of apple trees wang et al 2011 huang et al 2019 therefore this study aimed to 1 evaluate the effects of multi intensity canopy pruning on water balance i e transpiration soil evaporation soil moisture and drainage production and physiological traits in a two year field experiment and 2 test the efficacy of the process based model maespa for simulating seasonal variations in these critical water balance variables 2 materials and methods 2 1 summer pruning experiment a field experiment was conducted in the qingshuigou commercial apple orchard 37 27ʹ n 110 20ʹe within zizhou county shannxi province china fig s1 the study area has a semiarid climate with the mean annual precipitation of 450 mm with 60 falling in july august and september the experimental orchard is located in a tableland with an altitude of 989 m the soil is a silt loam with an average bulk density of 1 41 g cm 3 in the top 1 m the apple trees malus domestica borkh cv honeycrisp which were eight years old at the start of the experiment were planted with 2 m apart within rows with 3 m between rows the summer pruning experiment incorporated four pruning intensity treatments light pruning sp i 10 removal of lateral branches moderate pruning sp ii 25 removal of lateral branches heavy pruning sp iii 40 removal of lateral branches and no pruning as the control no removal of any branches the traditional management strategy each treatment had three replicates or tree plots and each plot 2 m in width and 6 m in length had three apple trees which was isolated from surrounding trees with plastic plates down to 2 m depth to reduce the impacts of adjacent trees on water balance summer pruning was carried out preferentially to control the total length of lateral branches to preserve fruit branches and remove the water sprouts overlapping branches and twigs the details of the morphological traits of apple trees subjected to different pruning intensities are presented in table 1 summer pruning was first conducted on 1 july 2018 and repeated on 3 june 2019 uniform regular winter pruning was carried out for all treatments to maintain the tree structure during the study period 2 2 determination of ecohydrological variables 2 2 1 sap flow and transpiration in each experimental plot the apple tree in the central position was selected to monitor stem sap flow rate and used as a proxy for canopy transpiration rate a flgs tdp xm1000 system dynamax co usa was used to measure sap flow rate which included 12 thermal dissipation probes tdps with two needles 10 mm in length and 2 mm in diameter and one cr1000 data logger each tdp probe comprised two temperature probes that were used to monitor the temperature difference all monitor positions were covered with aluminum foil to reduce heat radiation and the aluminum foil was sealed to prevent water entry the tdp probes were installed on the trunk at 30 cm above the land surface a reading was recorded every 30 min and the sap flux density was calculated according to standard calibration equation granier 1987 1 j s 0 0119 δ t max δ t δ t 1 231 where js is sap flux density g m 2 s 1 δtmax is the temperature difference at midnight sap flux density c and δt is the temperature difference between heated and unheated temperature probes c hourly sap flow of a given apple tree was calculated as follows 2 sf a s j s 3600 where sf is hourly transpiration g h 1 and a s is sapwood area m2 sapwood area was determined by cutting neighboring trees of orchard in winter to avoid damaging sample trees and ensure the experiment s continuity the relationship between sapwood and tree diameter at breast height is shown in fig s2 2 2 2 soil water and soil evaporation soil water content was monitored using portable time domain reflectometry tdr system trime pico iph t3 imko germany with the measurement accuracy of 2 volumetric content a 180 cm long tube was installed 30 cm away from the trunk of the central position apple tree in each plot soil water content was measured at each 20 cm down to 180 cm twice a week during the growing seasons daily soil evaporation was measured using micro lysimeters two per plot which were made from pvc tubes 11 cm diameter 15 cm long and installed between the apple trees the bottom of each micro lysimeter was wrapped with gauze to prevent soil loss the soil samples were replaced immediately following rainfall the micro lysimeters were weighed at sunset using an electric balance with a precision of 0 1 g discrete measurements were taken for 34 times and 85 times in 2018 and in 2019 respectively soil evaporation e mm d 1 was calculated as follows 3 e 10 δ w ρ π d 2 2 where δw is the difference in weight g of the micro lysimeter in 24 h ρ is the water density g cm 3 and d is the micro lysimeter diameter cm 2 2 3 meteorological variables half hourly meteorological data were monitored with an automatic weather station located at a nearby experiment field the measured meteorological variables included solar radiation rn air temperature t relative humidity rh and precipitation p these data are presented in fig 1 vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from air temperature and relative humidity as follows 4 vpd 0 611 e x p 17 27 t 237 3 t 1 rh 100 2 3 maespa model 2 3 1 model description the maespa model is a 3d process based and single tree based eco physiological and ecohydrological model that calculates radiation distribution photosynthesis and water balance http maespa github io index html the model calculates the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation for individual trees by considering light competition between neighboring trees wang and jarvis 1990 the water balance module included the physical processes of infiltration root water uptake soil evaporation canopy interception drainage and others water flow in this sub model is driven by water potential gradients of soils roots leaves and air and the hydraulic conductivity between these compartments the maespa model has demonstrated its efficacy in simulating ecohydrological process in tree ecosystems christina et al 2017 the main parameters of the maespa model used in this study are given in table s1 2 3 2 transpiration and soil evaporation simulation in the maespa model the target trees were divided into a series of grid points the absorbed radiation in each grid drove the transpiration routine leaf transpiration rate was calculated using the penman monteith equation 5 e l s r

water balance equation soil water storage in each layer was calculated by considering drainage infiltration evaporation and vegetation water consumption meanwhile hydraulic conductivity and soil retention curves at different depths were used to describe soil hydraulic characteristics in the maespa model overland flow does not occur until soils are saturated on the loess plateau the situation is different where surface runoff occurs when rainfall intensity exceeds infiltration capacity here we first simulated surface runoff following rainstorms using the hydrus 1d model which has been well demonstrated in predicting overland flow hilten et al 2008 yu et al 2016 unlike the maespa model the hydrus 1d uses the richards equation as the governing flow model described in detail in simunek et al 2008 2 4 model parameterization 2 4 1 canopy morphological parameters canopy diameter tree height stem diameter trunk height and total leaf area were measured during the study period total tree leaf area was sampled destructively in late october 2018 and 2019 when leaves began to fall and calculated by dividing the total length of the canopy into 5 equal vertical length portions where each portion was calculated separately vertical leaf area density was used to quantify the crown being divided by canopy volume at corresponding portion leaf area index lai was measured nondestructively with an li 2200c plant canopy analyzer fortnightly li cor usa the a readings over the canopy and b readings below the canopy were recorded for each measurement with one above canopy and five below canopy readings the interval of measurement was biweekly 2 4 2 physiological traits and stomatal conductance parameters the relationship between the electron transport rate and photosynthetically active radiation was measured using a pam 2500 portable x ray fluorescence spectrometer walz germany we used a non rectangular hyperbolic model to estimate the quantum yield and the curvature of the light response of the electron transportation curve the maximum rate of carboxylation was estimated using a linear relation with the maximum rate of electron transport wullschleger 1993 the temperature dependence of the maximum rate of rubisco carboxylation vcmax and maximum rate of electron transport jmax are well known that is the variation of the photosynthetic parameters varies with the temperature please refer to harley et al 1992 for the related parameters of temperature response δha δhd stomatal conductance and net photosynthetic rate were recorded for each tree under investigation using a portable gas exchange system li cor 6400xt li cor usa based on medlyn optimal stomatal conductance equation apple tree s stomatal conductance to h2o was estimated as follows

plant hydraulic conductivity the total leaf specific plant hydraulic conductance k p was estimated from the sap flow measurements and the leaf water potential was measured at predawn and midday three trees were selected from each treatment to estimate the sap flow and leaf water potential the whole plant hydraulic conductivity was estimated from the transpiration at midday per unit leaf area divided by the difference between the predawn and midday leaf water potentials the leaf water potentials at predawn and midday were measured using a pms model 1000 pressure chamber pms instruments oregon usa 2 4 4 soil characteristics the root zone soil profiles were uniformly divided into 9 layers down to a depth of 1 8 m soil water retention parameters were determined by fitting the equation developed by van genuchten 1980 to soil water retention curves which were measured at each of the 9 layers using pressure chambers saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using a guelph permeameter soilmoisture equipment corp usa soil porosity and saturated water content in each layer were measured using cutting ring a hand auger was used to sample roots in each treatment which were stored in a refrigerator in 5 c the fraction of roots in each layer was obtained by washing the samples in a sieve and used as an input parameter in the model 2 5 model evaluation and statistics model performance was assessed using the determination coefficient r2 the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse indices the rmse and nse was calculated as follows 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n m

package in r v 3 5 3 r core team 2019 3 results 3 1 effects of pruning on transpiration rate 3 1 1 diurnal variations diurnal variation in half hourly transpiration rate th on typical sunny days in different months three sunny days for each month are shown in fig 2 for different pruning treatments overall the diurnal changes of th showed unimodality with peak values emerged at around noon time summer pruning greatly reduced th in daytime the peak values decreased with increase in pruning intensity and in time however slight pruning promoted th to some extent in july 2018 and july and august 2019 the difference in th also faded away with time indicating reduction in the efficacy of pruning this was most prominent in september 2019 when the difference in th was almost minimum furthermore summer pruning appeared to modify the diurnal behaviors of th leading to clear lags in the initiation of sap flow in contrast to sunny days th on cloudy days showed clear multimodality irrespective of pruning intensities fig s3 the maespa model well simulated the diurnal evolutions of th fig 3 which is positivity and significantly correlated to observed values for all pruning intensities with r2 from 0 878 to 0 910 rmse from 0 012 to 0 019 mm and nse from 0 863 to 0 902 fig 4 however the simulated daytime th values were clearly higher than the observed values particularly around noon local time is one hour late than the standard beijing time especially in control sp i and sp ii furthermore the observed th lagged the simulated values to some extent at the onset of daytime transpiration in addition slight nocturnal transpiration was observed for all pruning treatments which was not captured by the model 3 1 2 seasonal variations seasonal variation in daily transpiration rate td for different pruning intensities are presented in fig 5 overall td behaved similarly with time reaching a peak during late may to early jun 2019 peak value 2 5 mm d 1 before progressively decreased the canopy pruning intensities clearly modified the magnitude of td in 2019 the peak value reached 2 42 mm d 1 in the control treatment but only 1 5 mm d 1 in the heavy pruning sp iii treatment the effects of pruning on td also progressively decreased with time to become negligible by september in both years due to the lack of data before july in 2018 the transpiration at the growing season scale was only analyzed in 2019 light pruning slightly increased transpiration but did not significantly differ from the control moderate and heavy pruning significantly p 0 05 reduced transpiration by an average 10 4 and 28 5 respectively relative to the control the maespa model was also used to simulate temporal changes of td at the growing season scale over two years the scatter plots of simulated and observed td are presented in fig 6 for the different pruning intensity treatments in general the simulated values were significantly and positively correlated with observed values for all treatments with r2 ranging from 0 799 to 0 910 rmse from 0 111 to 0 207 mm and nse from 0 787 to 0 903 indicating that the maespa model performed well at reproducing growing season td for all pruning intensities 3 2 effect of pruning on soil evaporation the temporal evolutions of observed and modeled soil evaporation are presented in fig 7 the temporal variation in observed soil evaporation was closely related to precipitation events and solar radiation soil evaporation increased immediately after precipitation maximum value 5 mm d 1 and then decreased gradually as strong radiation continued canopy pruning slightly increased soil evaporation relative to the control but there were no significant differences between treatments fig s4 the maespa model captured the temporal behaviors of observed soil evaporation during the study period but failed to capture several extremely high values in 2018 much better predictions were obtained in 2019 than 2018 average r2 0 628 vs 0 368 nse 0 097 vs 0 314 and rmse 0 468 vs 1 076 mm respectively table 2 3 3 effects of pruning on soil water profiles temporal changes of observed soil water content in the 0 180 cm for different treatments are presented in fig 8 the initial soil water contents were similar in all treatments irrespective of soil layers soil water in the 0 20 cm depth fluctuated greatly and the degree of fluctuation decreased with increasing soil depth relatively weak variations were observed in soil layers below 60 cm canopy pruning intensity had a negligible effect on surface soil water in the 0 20 cm but significant p 0 05 variations between different treatments were observed in the subsurface soil water content the mean soil water content in the sp i sp ii and sp iii treatments increased by 6 7 14 6 and 23 4 respectively in the 20 60 cm and increased by 8 9 23 1 and 25 6 respectively in the 60 120 cm relative to control at the combined depth of 20 180 cm the sp i sp ii and sp iii treatments increased soil water content by an average 7 1 18 3 and 20 8 respectively relative to the control the effects of pruning on soil water content were not immediate but increased progressively during the growing season fig 8 the greatest difference in soil water content between treatments occurred in august and september furthermore drainage below the 180 cm was calculated using the water balance method as shown in fig 9 canopy pruning enhanced drainage relative to the control the drainage in sp ii and sp iii reached 227 3 and 221 3 mm respectively significantly p 0 05 higher than in sp i 173 1 mm and control 159 8 mm the modeled soil water content for each treatment is shown in fig 10 overall the maespa model well reproduced the time series of soil water content in both rainfall and inter rainfall periods irrespective of soil depths and treatments the r2 ranged from 0 400 to 0 894 rmse from 0 50 to 2 42 and nse from 0 269 to 0 802 table 3 an extreme precipitation event 30 mm within half an hour occurred on 17 august 2018 and prominent surface runoff was observed for all plots as a result the model overestimated soil water content at different soil depths following this extreme precipitation event fig 10 in this situation the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate surface runoff the updated rainfall input that was derived by subtracting simulated runoff from precipitation was used in the water balance module in maespa the optimized model produced better simulations than the original model 3 4 effects of pruning on production and physiological traits table 4 shows the yield water use efficiency wue and mean mid day leaf water potential ψmd for all treatments in 2018 and 2019 the apple yields were low 6059 7403 kg ha 1 in 2018 because of severe frost in the blossoming period in 2019 the apple yield ranged from 16 682 to 27044 kg ha 1 the light sp i and moderate sp ii pruning treatments increased yields by 22 1 and 6 4 respectively relative to the control whereas the heavy pruning sp iii reduced apple yield by 24 7 which differed significantly p 0 05 from the light pruning the light and moderate pruning treatments had significantly p 0 05 higher wue than the heavy pruning and the control the wue of the moderate pruning treatment was 18 7 higher than the control summer pruning significantly p 0 05 promoted mid day leaf water potential particularly for the moderate and heavy pruning treatments 4 discussion 4 1 effects of pruning on canopy transpiration soil evaporation and soil moisture canopy transpiration can be altered by management practices such as thinning and pruning qiu et al 2013 weng et al 2007 here for the first time in apple orchards we showed that moderate and heavy pruning significantly p 0 05 reduced transpiration at both diurnal and seasonal scales figs 2 and 5 and increased soil water content at subsurface soil layers below 20 cm fig 8 these findings are generally consistent with those in other orchards or plantations ma et al 2019 the effect of pruning on transpiration can be attributed to the reduced leaf area as water is transpired through the stomata in leaves to atmosphere generally a strong correlation exists between leaf area and transpiration rate forrester et al 2012 bayala et al 2002 however transpiration is not necessarily proportional to the leaf area reduction alcorn et al 2013 molina et al 2019 but may be related to management practices excessive removal of shading leaves may not significantly reduce whole tree transpiration due to the weak effects of stomatal conductance on shaded leaves transpiration nicolas et al 2008 we found that light pruning enhanced transpiration to some extent relative to the control fig 5 a possible explanation is that the light pruning of water sprouts and overlapping branches enhanced micro meteorological conditions e g radiation and wind speed in the pruned canopy and promoted the stomatal conductance and transpiration of the remaining leaves which may be induced by tree s compensation mechanism maurin and desrochers 2013 quentin et al 2011 moreover the effects of pruning on transpiration was immediate but progressively decreased with time fig 5 which may be associated with the compensated water use mechanism after summer pruning emerging lateral shoots can start to compensate for the reduction of total leaf area abad et al 2019 which may be greater in more heavily pruned canopies from greater penetrated radiation as observed in our study these emerged lateral shoots increased stomatal conductance and canopy transpiration such that the treatment differences progressively diminished as no further pruning took place the moderate and heavy pruning also increased soil water content during the study period fig 8 which can be ascribed to the decline in transpiration and hence root water uptake from soils the effect of pruning on soil water content primarily occurred in the subsurface layers 20 cm fig 8 this is probably because the surface soil water content 0 20 cm is largely controlled by soil evaporation which did not significantly differ between treatments fig 7 furthermore the effect of pruning on soil water content lagged fig 8 on the one hand fine roots for absorbing water can exist in the entire rooting zone meaning that the water sources for apple trees are dispersed in the rooting zone and the effect of pruning on soil water content at given layers may not emerge immediately on the other hand the reduction of water consumption would promote soil water infiltration however soil infiltration to subsurface layers is a slow hydrological process continuing from days to several months gao et al 2014 li et al 2018 the lower water consumption transpiration and higher soil water content in the moderate and heavy pruning treatments accounted for the higher amount of drainage to soils below 180 cm fig 9 this is favorable for apple orchards to avoid soil desiccation in deep layers which has been intensively reported wang et al 2015 2020 4 2 model performances the maespa model reliably simulated canopy transpiration in apple orchards for all pruning intensities at the diurnal and growing season scales figs 3 and 6 however there was slight hysteresis in the observed sap flow rate to the simulated diurnal transpiration rate fig 3 more often than not measured sap flow lags canopy transpiration due to the hydraulic transmission resistance of the xylem which is one mechanism for determining water storage utilization kume et al 2008 long term sap flow can still represent the variation and characteristics of transpiration besides the simulated transpiration rate was greater than the observed sap flow rate in the daytime for all treatments fig 3 due to the buffering effect of storage water verbeeck et al 2007 we further analyzed the relationship between measured sap flow and simulated transpiration versus radiation fig 11 to explain the higher simulated transpiration rate in the daytime the trees had a higher simulated transpiration rate than the sap flow rate under higher radiation when the radiation is low trees show water storage characteristics and the sap flow rate is higher than the simulated transpiration rate kumagai et al 2009 moreover we considered that the incoming radiation at night was zero but the sap flow data indicated low flows in all treatments fig 3 the simulated transpiration showed a great discrepancy with observation sap flow after 18 00 pm fig 3 most eco physiological and hydrological models do not account for nighttime sap flow vogel et al 2017 whitley et al 2013 several studies have argued that when comparing diurnal pattern of simulating transpiration and sap flow measurements the ability of tree water storage at nighttime should not be neglected dawson et al 2007 forster 2014 rosado et al 2012 verbeeck et al 2007 solid evidences show that nighttime sap flow may account for a large proportion of vegetation water consumption for some plant species even beyond 60 of the total water consumption snyder et al 2003 therefore neglecting nocturnal sap flow in the model could underestimate plant water use zeppel et al 2014 future studies that onsider nocturnal transpiration in ecohydrological and ecophysiological models are needed overall the maespa model reliably reproduced the temporal evolution of soil evaporation in all treatments with better modeling accuracy in 2019 however the model failed to capture the extreme values following rainstorms in 2018 fig 7 since soil evaporation is mainly controlled by soil water availability and atmospheric conditions alvenas and jansson 1997 the uncertainties of surface soil water simulations and representations of micrometeorological variables in apple orchards are likely responsible for the deviations between modeled and observed soil evaporation generally the model well simulated the time series of soil water content in all treatments relatively larger modeling error was observed at surface soil layer than at the subsurface layers fig 10 because of complex hydrological processes at the soil atmosphere interface in terms of precipitation surface runoff and evapotranspiration a criticism of the maespa model is the subroutine of soil moisture modeling in the water balance module where surface runoff occurred only when all the soil layers in question become saturated however surface runoff often occurs on the loess plateau as infiltration rate is lower than the rainfall intensity during heavy rainstorms therefore the model is expected to overestimate soil water content following rainstorms which was observed in our data fig 10 the hdyrus model employing the richards equation to describe water flux has been extensively used to simulate surface runoff and good accuracies have been reported hilten et al 2008 yu et al 2016 therefore the precipitation input was updated using the original data minus the surface runoff modeled by the hydrus 1d model which improved the prediction accuracy in the surface soil fig 10 this implies that more researches are needed to optimize the water balance module in the maespa model to better represent the case of excess infiltration runoff 4 3 implications this study demonstrated that moderate and heavy summer pruning significantly reduced transpiration fig 5 increased soil water content in subsurface layers fig 8 and promoted leaf water potential table 4 while light and moderate pruning enhanced apple production and water use efficiency table 4 this demonstrates that summer pruning is a feasible management practice of regulating water cycling in apple orchards here and could apply in other apple orchards in drylands three pruning intensities were tested for their effects on water use by apple trees in wet years we suggest light summer pruning i e removing about 10 of lateral water sprouts overlapping branches and twigs in normal precipitation years moderate pruning i e removing approximately 25 of lateral branches is the optimal choice because it significantly reduced transpiration while promoted production and wue to a moderate extent in severe drought years heavy pruning i e removing approximately 40 of lateral branches is strongly recommended despite low production heavy pruning substantially reduces water consumption and promotes leaf water potential which is favorable to avoid hydraulic failure the inability of trees to move water from roots to leaves and realize sustainable development under future climate extremes 5 conclusion we investigated the effects of summer pruning light moderate and heavy intensity on water balance production and water use efficiency of apple orchards on the semiarid loess plateau using both observations and the process based maespa model while light pruning had weak impacts moderate and heavy pruning significantly reduced diurnal and growing season transpiration increased soil water content in subsurface layers and promoted drainage below 180 cm relative to the control indicating that summer pruning could promote water cycling and sustainable water use particularly the effect of pruning on transpiration progressively decreased with time becoming negligible in middle autumn at the diurnal and seasonal scale light and moderate pruning promoted production and water use efficiency whereas heavy pruning significantly reduced production generally the maespa model reliably reproduced transpiration at the diurnal and growing season scales soil evaporation and soil moisture at all pruning intensities demonstrating its efficacy in modeling pruning effects on hydrological processes of orchards credit authorship contribution statement miaotai ye methodology

4894,long term imbalance of water demand over supply in drylands can result in serious ecological issues such as severe soil desiccation posing a great challenge to sustainable development of dryland orchards this study examined the effects of multi intensity summer pruning on water balance production and water use efficiency of apple orchards on china s loess plateau using in situ measurements and the process based maespa model a field experiment with four intensities representing no 0 or control light 10 moderate 25 and heavy 40 pruning of branches was carried out in three replicates under each treatment the pruning intensities dictated transpiration soil moisture and drainage although light pruning had weak impacts on these factors moderate and heavy pruning significantly reduced growing season transpiration by an average 10 4 and 28 5 respectively however the effects progressively faded away with time at both diurnal and seasonal scales moderate and heavy pruning also increased soil water content in the 20 180 cm by an average 18 3 and 20 8 respectively and thus enhanced drainage below 180 cm 220 mm relative to light pruning and control 170 mm furthermore light and moderate pruning clearly promoted apple yield and water use efficiency whereas heavy pruning significantly reduced 24 7 apple yield thus moderate pruning can be a good choice for apple orchards in normal precipitation years while heavy pruning may be an alternative in severe drought years the maespa model reliably simulated seasonal variations of transpiration r2 0 799 0 910 root mean square

quantify the effects of pruning on hydrological processes in dryland apple orchards this study provides insights into the development of a sustainable management strategy in dryland orchards keywords canopy pruning soil moisture evapotranspiration maespa loess plateau 1 introduction drylands cover nearly half of the world s terrestrial land surface and support over a quarter of the global population s living space koutroulis 2019 they are the main contributor to global food production plaza et al 2018 and the optimal area of a variety of fruit trees due to abundant sunshine and large diurnal temperature variation china s loess plateau is dominated by drylands and covers the world s largest area under apple trees providing the livelihood for 10 million smallholder farmers in 2017 the area and production reached beyond 1 30 million ha and 23 million tons accounting for 25 and 27 of world s total respectively china agriculture statistical report 2018 however water scarcity results in an imbalance between supply and demand of water hindering the sustainable development of apple orchards under more intensive droughts in drylands huang et al 2016 therefore it is important to optimize water management strategies to reduce water consumption while maintaining yield the shift from cropland or natural vegetation to plantations become more common in the past two decades due to various economic and ecological reasons foley et al 2005 markewitz et al 2010 however the high water demanding plantations incur severe land degradation in drylands where groundwater is unavailable robinson et al 2006 wang et al 2011 gao et al 2018a goulden and bales 2019 jia et al 2019 for examples in southwest western australia 7 year old mallee eucalyptus depleted soil water to wilting point at layers below 15 m impeding groundwater recharge robinson et al 2006 gao et al 2018a found that the single species and mixed plantations of robinia pseudoacacia platycladus orientalis caragana korshinskii and hippophae rhamnoides caused severe desiccation at deep soils on the loess plateau deep layer soil desiccation has also been reported in dryland apple orchards due to excessive water consumption for instance wang et al 2015 reported that soil layers as deep as 16 m underwent severe desiccation in 17 year old apple orchards on the loess plateau reducing apple production and quality peng et al 2017 therefore identifying ways to alleviate soil desiccation and water stress in dryland apple orchards is paramount various management practices have been developed to cope with water scarcity in drylands unlike terracing and mulching practices which aim to increase infiltration and decrease soil evaporation li et al 2018 wang et al 2019 canopy pruning is frequently used in forest management to reduce canopy transpiration and rainfall interception forrester et al 2012 hipps et al 2014 chen et al 2016 conesa et al 2019 ma et al 2019 by altering canopy structure leaf area and micrometeorology forrester et al 2012 for example hipps et al 2014 reported that removal of the outer 30 length of all major branches of london plane platanus acerifolia trees conserved soil moisture abad et al 2019 found that only heavy pruning trimming 40 60 of shoot length can reduce water stress of grapevine vitis vinifera l during prolonged droughts ma et al 2019 also found that heavy pruning decreased canopy transpiration by nearly 80 and increased water use efficiency in jujube ziziphus jujuba mill plantations on the loess plateau of china for dryland orchards summer pruning is adopted to remove unproductive shoots called water sprouts and even part of the productive shoots to maintain water status during droughts for example lopez et al 2006 and conesa et al 2019 reported that summer pruning significantly improved stem water potential in peach prunus persica trees compared to those without pruning nevertheless the effect of summer pruning on water balance production and water use efficiency remains limited for dryland orchards which is unfavorable for optimizing field management strategy for sustainable water use in addition to field observations process based modeling has promise for evaluating the effects of canopy pruning on water consumption of fruit trees and providing valuable information for orchard management significant efforts have been made to simulate transpiration root water uptake and or soil water changes using penman monteith model crago and brutsaert 1992 shuttleworth wallace model chen et al 2015 dzikiti et al 2018 richards equations green et al 2003 deb et al 2013 and root water uptake models hildebrandt et al 2016 models have also been developed to simulate the effects of pruning on net biomass production pinkard et al 1999 and tree growth berninger et al 2000 however process oriented models have rarely been used to explore the interaction between pruning and evapotranspiration and soil water dynamics in orchards despite their great promise in developing management strategies the maespa model which couples the maestra multi array evaporation stand tree radiation a wang and jarvis 1990 and spa soil plant atmosphere williams et al 2001 models is a mechanistic and 3d model that simulates canopy radiation absorption photosynthesis and water and energy balance at either single tree or stand scale duursma and medlyn 2012 in recent years this model has been successfully used to simulate transpiration profile soil water growth and production and other physiological traits in both natural forests and plantations subjected to human management christina et al 2017 vezy et al 2018 thus the maespa model has strong potential for investigating the effects of pruning on evapotranspiration and soil moisture variations in apple orchards on the loess plateau apple trees plantings are mainly located in semiarid and dry sub humid regions where the mean annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 650 mm these areas often suffer severe seasonal droughts in growing periods which exacerbates water paucity and forces trees to forage water in deep soils gao et al 2018b however once deep soil water has been excessively exploited it is difficult to be replenished with the limited precipitation and deep ground water 30 m severe soil desiccation can occur in apple orchards wang et al 2015 which significantly affects the growth production and sustainable development of apple trees wang et al 2011 huang et al 2019 therefore this study aimed to 1 evaluate the effects of multi intensity canopy pruning on water balance i e transpiration soil evaporation soil moisture and drainage production and physiological traits in a two year field experiment and 2 test the efficacy of the process based model maespa for simulating seasonal variations in these critical water balance variables 2 materials and methods 2 1 summer pruning experiment a field experiment was conducted in the qingshuigou commercial apple orchard 37 27ʹ n 110 20ʹe within zizhou county shannxi province china fig s1 the study area has a semiarid climate with the mean annual precipitation of 450 mm with 60 falling in july august and september the experimental orchard is located in a tableland with an altitude of 989 m the soil is a silt loam with an average bulk density of 1 41 g cm 3 in the top 1 m the apple trees malus domestica borkh cv honeycrisp which were eight years old at the start of the experiment were planted with 2 m apart within rows with 3 m between rows the summer pruning experiment incorporated four pruning intensity treatments light pruning sp i 10 removal of lateral branches moderate pruning sp ii 25 removal of lateral branches heavy pruning sp iii 40 removal of lateral branches and no pruning as the control no removal of any branches the traditional management strategy each treatment had three replicates or tree plots and each plot 2 m in width and 6 m in length had three apple trees which was isolated from surrounding trees with plastic plates down to 2 m depth to reduce the impacts of adjacent trees on water balance summer pruning was carried out preferentially to control the total length of lateral branches to preserve fruit branches and remove the water sprouts overlapping branches and twigs the details of the morphological traits of apple trees subjected to different pruning intensities are presented in table 1 summer pruning was first conducted on 1 july 2018 and repeated on 3 june 2019 uniform regular winter pruning was carried out for all treatments to maintain the tree structure during the study period 2 2 determination of ecohydrological variables 2 2 1 sap flow and transpiration in each experimental plot the apple tree in the central position was selected to monitor stem sap flow rate and used as a proxy for canopy transpiration rate a flgs tdp xm1000 system dynamax co usa was used to measure sap flow rate which included 12 thermal dissipation probes tdps with two needles 10 mm in length and 2 mm in diameter and one cr1000 data logger each tdp probe comprised two temperature probes that were used to monitor the temperature difference all monitor positions were covered with aluminum foil to reduce heat radiation and the aluminum foil was sealed to prevent water entry the tdp probes were installed on the trunk at 30 cm above the land surface a reading was recorded every 30 min and the sap flux density was calculated according to standard calibration equation granier 1987 1 j s 0 0119 δ t max δ t δ t 1 231 where js is sap flux density g m 2 s 1 δtmax is the temperature difference at midnight sap flux density c and δt is the temperature difference between heated and unheated temperature probes c hourly sap flow of a given apple tree was calculated as follows 2 sf a s j s 3600 where sf is hourly transpiration g h 1 and a s is sapwood area m2 sapwood area was determined by cutting neighboring trees of orchard in winter to avoid damaging sample trees and ensure the experiment s continuity the relationship between sapwood and tree diameter at breast height is shown in fig s2 2 2 2 soil water and soil evaporation soil water content was monitored using portable time domain reflectometry tdr system trime pico iph t3 imko germany with the measurement accuracy of 2 volumetric content a 180 cm long tube was installed 30 cm away from the trunk of the central position apple tree in each plot soil water content was measured at each 20 cm down to 180 cm twice a week during the growing seasons daily soil evaporation was measured using micro lysimeters two per plot which were made from pvc tubes 11 cm diameter 15 cm long and installed between the apple trees the bottom of each micro lysimeter was wrapped with gauze to prevent soil loss the soil samples were replaced immediately following rainfall the micro lysimeters were weighed at sunset using an electric balance with a precision of 0 1 g discrete measurements were taken for 34 times and 85 times in 2018 and in 2019 respectively soil evaporation e mm d 1 was calculated as follows 3 e 10 δ w ρ π d 2 2 where δw is the difference in weight g of the micro lysimeter in 24 h ρ is the water density g cm 3 and d is the micro lysimeter diameter cm 2 2 3 meteorological variables half hourly meteorological data were monitored with an automatic weather station located at a nearby experiment field the measured meteorological variables included solar radiation rn air temperature t relative humidity rh and precipitation p these data are presented in fig 1 vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from air temperature and relative humidity as follows 4 vpd 0 611 e x p 17 27 t 237 3 t 1 rh 100 2 3 maespa model 2 3 1 model description the maespa model is a 3d process based and single tree based eco physiological and ecohydrological model that calculates radiation distribution photosynthesis and water balance http maespa github io index html the model calculates the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation for individual trees by considering light competition between neighboring trees wang and jarvis 1990 the water balance module included the physical processes of infiltration root water uptake soil evaporation canopy interception drainage and others water flow in this sub model is driven by water potential gradients of soils roots leaves and air and the hydraulic conductivity between these compartments the maespa model has demonstrated its efficacy in simulating ecohydrological process in tree ecosystems christina et al 2017 the main parameters of the maespa model used in this study are given in table s1 2 3 2 transpiration and soil evaporation simulation in the maespa model the target trees were divided into a series of grid points the absorbed radiation in each grid drove the transpiration routine leaf transpiration rate was calculated using the penman monteith equation 5 e l s r

water balance equation soil water storage in each layer was calculated by considering drainage infiltration evaporation and vegetation water consumption meanwhile hydraulic conductivity and soil retention curves at different depths were used to describe soil hydraulic characteristics in the maespa model overland flow does not occur until soils are saturated on the loess plateau the situation is different where surface runoff occurs when rainfall intensity exceeds infiltration capacity here we first simulated surface runoff following rainstorms using the hydrus 1d model which has been well demonstrated in predicting overland flow hilten et al 2008 yu et al 2016 unlike the maespa model the hydrus 1d uses the richards equation as the governing flow model described in detail in simunek et al 2008 2 4 model parameterization 2 4 1 canopy morphological parameters canopy diameter tree height stem diameter trunk height and total leaf area were measured during the study period total tree leaf area was sampled destructively in late october 2018 and 2019 when leaves began to fall and calculated by dividing the total length of the canopy into 5 equal vertical length portions where each portion was calculated separately vertical leaf area density was used to quantify the crown being divided by canopy volume at corresponding portion leaf area index lai was measured nondestructively with an li 2200c plant canopy analyzer fortnightly li cor usa the a readings over the canopy and b readings below the canopy were recorded for each measurement with one above canopy and five below canopy readings the interval of measurement was biweekly 2 4 2 physiological traits and stomatal conductance parameters the relationship between the electron transport rate and photosynthetically active radiation was measured using a pam 2500 portable x ray fluorescence spectrometer walz germany we used a non rectangular hyperbolic model to estimate the quantum yield and the curvature of the light response of the electron transportation curve the maximum rate of carboxylation was estimated using a linear relation with the maximum rate of electron transport wullschleger 1993 the temperature dependence of the maximum rate of rubisco carboxylation vcmax and maximum rate of electron transport jmax are well known that is the variation of the photosynthetic parameters varies with the temperature please refer to harley et al 1992 for the related parameters of temperature response δha δhd stomatal conductance and net photosynthetic rate were recorded for each tree under investigation using a portable gas exchange system li cor 6400xt li cor usa based on medlyn optimal stomatal conductance equation apple tree s stomatal conductance to h2o was estimated as follows

plant hydraulic conductivity the total leaf specific plant hydraulic conductance k p was estimated from the sap flow measurements and the leaf water potential was measured at predawn and midday three trees were selected from each treatment to estimate the sap flow and leaf water potential the whole plant hydraulic conductivity was estimated from the transpiration at midday per unit leaf area divided by the difference between the predawn and midday leaf water potentials the leaf water potentials at predawn and midday were measured using a pms model 1000 pressure chamber pms instruments oregon usa 2 4 4 soil characteristics the root zone soil profiles were uniformly divided into 9 layers down to a depth of 1 8 m soil water retention parameters were determined by fitting the equation developed by van genuchten 1980 to soil water retention curves which were measured at each of the 9 layers using pressure chambers saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using a guelph permeameter soilmoisture equipment corp usa soil porosity and saturated water content in each layer were measured using cutting ring a hand auger was used to sample roots in each treatment which were stored in a refrigerator in 5 c the fraction of roots in each layer was obtained by washing the samples in a sieve and used as an input parameter in the model 2 5 model evaluation and statistics model performance was assessed using the determination coefficient r2 the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse indices the rmse and nse was calculated as follows 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n m

package in r v 3 5 3 r core team 2019 3 results 3 1 effects of pruning on transpiration rate 3 1 1 diurnal variations diurnal variation in half hourly transpiration rate th on typical sunny days in different months three sunny days for each month are shown in fig 2 for different pruning treatments overall the diurnal changes of th showed unimodality with peak values emerged at around noon time summer pruning greatly reduced th in daytime the peak values decreased with increase in pruning intensity and in time however slight pruning promoted th to some extent in july 2018 and july and august 2019 the difference in th also faded away with time indicating reduction in the efficacy of pruning this was most prominent in september 2019 when the difference in th was almost minimum furthermore summer pruning appeared to modify the diurnal behaviors of th leading to clear lags in the initiation of sap flow in contrast to sunny days th on cloudy days showed clear multimodality irrespective of pruning intensities fig s3 the maespa model well simulated the diurnal evolutions of th fig 3 which is positivity and significantly correlated to observed values for all pruning intensities with r2 from 0 878 to 0 910 rmse from 0 012 to 0 019 mm and nse from 0 863 to 0 902 fig 4 however the simulated daytime th values were clearly higher than the observed values particularly around noon local time is one hour late than the standard beijing time especially in control sp i and sp ii furthermore the observed th lagged the simulated values to some extent at the onset of daytime transpiration in addition slight nocturnal transpiration was observed for all pruning treatments which was not captured by the model 3 1 2 seasonal variations seasonal variation in daily transpiration rate td for different pruning intensities are presented in fig 5 overall td behaved similarly with time reaching a peak during late may to early jun 2019 peak value 2 5 mm d 1 before progressively decreased the canopy pruning intensities clearly modified the magnitude of td in 2019 the peak value reached 2 42 mm d 1 in the control treatment but only 1 5 mm d 1 in the heavy pruning sp iii treatment the effects of pruning on td also progressively decreased with time to become negligible by september in both years due to the lack of data before july in 2018 the transpiration at the growing season scale was only analyzed in 2019 light pruning slightly increased transpiration but did not significantly differ from the control moderate and heavy pruning significantly p 0 05 reduced transpiration by an average 10 4 and 28 5 respectively relative to the control the maespa model was also used to simulate temporal changes of td at the growing season scale over two years the scatter plots of simulated and observed td are presented in fig 6 for the different pruning intensity treatments in general the simulated values were significantly and positively correlated with observed values for all treatments with r2 ranging from 0 799 to 0 910 rmse from 0 111 to 0 207 mm and nse from 0 787 to 0 903 indicating that the maespa model performed well at reproducing growing season td for all pruning intensities 3 2 effect of pruning on soil evaporation the temporal evolutions of observed and modeled soil evaporation are presented in fig 7 the temporal variation in observed soil evaporation was closely related to precipitation events and solar radiation soil evaporation increased immediately after precipitation maximum value 5 mm d 1 and then decreased gradually as strong radiation continued canopy pruning slightly increased soil evaporation relative to the control but there were no significant differences between treatments fig s4 the maespa model captured the temporal behaviors of observed soil evaporation during the study period but failed to capture several extremely high values in 2018 much better predictions were obtained in 2019 than 2018 average r2 0 628 vs 0 368 nse 0 097 vs 0 314 and rmse 0 468 vs 1 076 mm respectively table 2 3 3 effects of pruning on soil water profiles temporal changes of observed soil water content in the 0 180 cm for different treatments are presented in fig 8 the initial soil water contents were similar in all treatments irrespective of soil layers soil water in the 0 20 cm depth fluctuated greatly and the degree of fluctuation decreased with increasing soil depth relatively weak variations were observed in soil layers below 60 cm canopy pruning intensity had a negligible effect on surface soil water in the 0 20 cm but significant p 0 05 variations between different treatments were observed in the subsurface soil water content the mean soil water content in the sp i sp ii and sp iii treatments increased by 6 7 14 6 and 23 4 respectively in the 20 60 cm and increased by 8 9 23 1 and 25 6 respectively in the 60 120 cm relative to control at the combined depth of 20 180 cm the sp i sp ii and sp iii treatments increased soil water content by an average 7 1 18 3 and 20 8 respectively relative to the control the effects of pruning on soil water content were not immediate but increased progressively during the growing season fig 8 the greatest difference in soil water content between treatments occurred in august and september furthermore drainage below the 180 cm was calculated using the water balance method as shown in fig 9 canopy pruning enhanced drainage relative to the control the drainage in sp ii and sp iii reached 227 3 and 221 3 mm respectively significantly p 0 05 higher than in sp i 173 1 mm and control 159 8 mm the modeled soil water content for each treatment is shown in fig 10 overall the maespa model well reproduced the time series of soil water content in both rainfall and inter rainfall periods irrespective of soil depths and treatments the r2 ranged from 0 400 to 0 894 rmse from 0 50 to 2 42 and nse from 0 269 to 0 802 table 3 an extreme precipitation event 30 mm within half an hour occurred on 17 august 2018 and prominent surface runoff was observed for all plots as a result the model overestimated soil water content at different soil depths following this extreme precipitation event fig 10 in this situation the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate surface runoff the updated rainfall input that was derived by subtracting simulated runoff from precipitation was used in the water balance module in maespa the optimized model produced better simulations than the original model 3 4 effects of pruning on production and physiological traits table 4 shows the yield water use efficiency wue and mean mid day leaf water potential ψmd for all treatments in 2018 and 2019 the apple yields were low 6059 7403 kg ha 1 in 2018 because of severe frost in the blossoming period in 2019 the apple yield ranged from 16 682 to 27044 kg ha 1 the light sp i and moderate sp ii pruning treatments increased yields by 22 1 and 6 4 respectively relative to the control whereas the heavy pruning sp iii reduced apple yield by 24 7 which differed significantly p 0 05 from the light pruning the light and moderate pruning treatments had significantly p 0 05 higher wue than the heavy pruning and the control the wue of the moderate pruning treatment was 18 7 higher than the control summer pruning significantly p 0 05 promoted mid day leaf water potential particularly for the moderate and heavy pruning treatments 4 discussion 4 1 effects of pruning on canopy transpiration soil evaporation and soil moisture canopy transpiration can be altered by management practices such as thinning and pruning qiu et al 2013 weng et al 2007 here for the first time in apple orchards we showed that moderate and heavy pruning significantly p 0 05 reduced transpiration at both diurnal and seasonal scales figs 2 and 5 and increased soil water content at subsurface soil layers below 20 cm fig 8 these findings are generally consistent with those in other orchards or plantations ma et al 2019 the effect of pruning on transpiration can be attributed to the reduced leaf area as water is transpired through the stomata in leaves to atmosphere generally a strong correlation exists between leaf area and transpiration rate forrester et al 2012 bayala et al 2002 however transpiration is not necessarily proportional to the leaf area reduction alcorn et al 2013 molina et al 2019 but may be related to management practices excessive removal of shading leaves may not significantly reduce whole tree transpiration due to the weak effects of stomatal conductance on shaded leaves transpiration nicolas et al 2008 we found that light pruning enhanced transpiration to some extent relative to the control fig 5 a possible explanation is that the light pruning of water sprouts and overlapping branches enhanced micro meteorological conditions e g radiation and wind speed in the pruned canopy and promoted the stomatal conductance and transpiration of the remaining leaves which may be induced by tree s compensation mechanism maurin and desrochers 2013 quentin et al 2011 moreover the effects of pruning on transpiration was immediate but progressively decreased with time fig 5 which may be associated with the compensated water use mechanism after summer pruning emerging lateral shoots can start to compensate for the reduction of total leaf area abad et al 2019 which may be greater in more heavily pruned canopies from greater penetrated radiation as observed in our study these emerged lateral shoots increased stomatal conductance and canopy transpiration such that the treatment differences progressively diminished as no further pruning took place the moderate and heavy pruning also increased soil water content during the study period fig 8 which can be ascribed to the decline in transpiration and hence root water uptake from soils the effect of pruning on soil water content primarily occurred in the subsurface layers 20 cm fig 8 this is probably because the surface soil water content 0 20 cm is largely controlled by soil evaporation which did not significantly differ between treatments fig 7 furthermore the effect of pruning on soil water content lagged fig 8 on the one hand fine roots for absorbing water can exist in the entire rooting zone meaning that the water sources for apple trees are dispersed in the rooting zone and the effect of pruning on soil water content at given layers may not emerge immediately on the other hand the reduction of water consumption would promote soil water infiltration however soil infiltration to subsurface layers is a slow hydrological process continuing from days to several months gao et al 2014 li et al 2018 the lower water consumption transpiration and higher soil water content in the moderate and heavy pruning treatments accounted for the higher amount of drainage to soils below 180 cm fig 9 this is favorable for apple orchards to avoid soil desiccation in deep layers which has been intensively reported wang et al 2015 2020 4 2 model performances the maespa model reliably simulated canopy transpiration in apple orchards for all pruning intensities at the diurnal and growing season scales figs 3 and 6 however there was slight hysteresis in the observed sap flow rate to the simulated diurnal transpiration rate fig 3 more often than not measured sap flow lags canopy transpiration due to the hydraulic transmission resistance of the xylem which is one mechanism for determining water storage utilization kume et al 2008 long term sap flow can still represent the variation and characteristics of transpiration besides the simulated transpiration rate was greater than the observed sap flow rate in the daytime for all treatments fig 3 due to the buffering effect of storage water verbeeck et al 2007 we further analyzed the relationship between measured sap flow and simulated transpiration versus radiation fig 11 to explain the higher simulated transpiration rate in the daytime the trees had a higher simulated transpiration rate than the sap flow rate under higher radiation when the radiation is low trees show water storage characteristics and the sap flow rate is higher than the simulated transpiration rate kumagai et al 2009 moreover we considered that the incoming radiation at night was zero but the sap flow data indicated low flows in all treatments fig 3 the simulated transpiration showed a great discrepancy with observation sap flow after 18 00 pm fig 3 most eco physiological and hydrological models do not account for nighttime sap flow vogel et al 2017 whitley et al 2013 several studies have argued that when comparing diurnal pattern of simulating transpiration and sap flow measurements the ability of tree water storage at nighttime should not be neglected dawson et al 2007 forster 2014 rosado et al 2012 verbeeck et al 2007 solid evidences show that nighttime sap flow may account for a large proportion of vegetation water consumption for some plant species even beyond 60 of the total water consumption snyder et al 2003 therefore neglecting nocturnal sap flow in the model could underestimate plant water use zeppel et al 2014 future studies that onsider nocturnal transpiration in ecohydrological and ecophysiological models are needed overall the maespa model reliably reproduced the temporal evolution of soil evaporation in all treatments with better modeling accuracy in 2019 however the model failed to capture the extreme values following rainstorms in 2018 fig 7 since soil evaporation is mainly controlled by soil water availability and atmospheric conditions alvenas and jansson 1997 the uncertainties of surface soil water simulations and representations of micrometeorological variables in apple orchards are likely responsible for the deviations between modeled and observed soil evaporation generally the model well simulated the time series of soil water content in all treatments relatively larger modeling error was observed at surface soil layer than at the subsurface layers fig 10 because of complex hydrological processes at the soil atmosphere interface in terms of precipitation surface runoff and evapotranspiration a criticism of the maespa model is the subroutine of soil moisture modeling in the water balance module where surface runoff occurred only when all the soil layers in question become saturated however surface runoff often occurs on the loess plateau as infiltration rate is lower than the rainfall intensity during heavy rainstorms therefore the model is expected to overestimate soil water content following rainstorms which was observed in our data fig 10 the hdyrus model employing the richards equation to describe water flux has been extensively used to simulate surface runoff and good accuracies have been reported hilten et al 2008 yu et al 2016 therefore the precipitation input was updated using the original data minus the surface runoff modeled by the hydrus 1d model which improved the prediction accuracy in the surface soil fig 10 this implies that more researches are needed to optimize the water balance module in the maespa model to better represent the case of excess infiltration runoff 4 3 implications this study demonstrated that moderate and heavy summer pruning significantly reduced transpiration fig 5 increased soil water content in subsurface layers fig 8 and promoted leaf water potential table 4 while light and moderate pruning enhanced apple production and water use efficiency table 4 this demonstrates that summer pruning is a feasible management practice of regulating water cycling in apple orchards here and could apply in other apple orchards in drylands three pruning intensities were tested for their effects on water use by apple trees in wet years we suggest light summer pruning i e removing about 10 of lateral water sprouts overlapping branches and twigs in normal precipitation years moderate pruning i e removing approximately 25 of lateral branches is the optimal choice because it significantly reduced transpiration while promoted production and wue to a moderate extent in severe drought years heavy pruning i e removing approximately 40 of lateral branches is strongly recommended despite low production heavy pruning substantially reduces water consumption and promotes leaf water potential which is favorable to avoid hydraulic failure the inability of trees to move water from roots to leaves and realize sustainable development under future climate extremes 5 conclusion we investigated the effects of summer pruning light moderate and heavy intensity on water balance production and water use efficiency of apple orchards on the semiarid loess plateau using both observations and the process based maespa model while light pruning had weak impacts moderate and heavy pruning significantly reduced diurnal and growing season transpiration increased soil water content in subsurface layers and promoted drainage below 180 cm relative to the control indicating that summer pruning could promote water cycling and sustainable water use particularly the effect of pruning on transpiration progressively decreased with time becoming negligible in middle autumn at the diurnal and seasonal scale light and moderate pruning promoted production and water use efficiency whereas heavy pruning significantly reduced production generally the maespa model reliably reproduced transpiration at the diurnal and growing season scales soil evaporation and soil moisture at all pruning intensities demonstrating its efficacy in modeling pruning effects on hydrological processes of orchards credit authorship contribution statement miaotai ye methodology
