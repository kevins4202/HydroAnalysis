2195,lake thermal stratification is important for regulating lake environments and ecosystems and is sensitive to climate change and human activity however numerical simulation of coupled hydrodynamics and heat transfer processes in deep lakes using one dimensional lake models remains challenging because of the insufficient representation of key parameters in this study lake qiandaohu a deep and warm monomictic reservoir was used as an example to investigate thermal stratification via an improved parameterization scheme of the weather research and forecast wrf lake a comparison with in situ observations demonstrated that the default wrf lake model was able to simulate well the seasonal variation of the lake thermal structure however the simulations exhibited cold biases in lake surface water temperature lswt throughout the year while generating weaker stratification in summer thereby leading to an earlier cooling period in autumn with an improved parameterization i e via determination of initial lake water temperature profiles light extinction coefficients eddy diffusion coefficients and surface roughness lengths the modified wrf lake model was able to better simulate lswt and thermal stratification critically employing realistic initial conditions for lake water temperature is essential for producing realistic hypolimnetic water temperatures the use of time dependent light extinction coefficients resulted in a deep thermocline and warm lswt enlarging eddy diffusivity led to stronger mixing in summer and further influenced autumn cooling the parameterized surface roughness lengths mitigated the excessive turbulent heat loss at the lake surface improved the model performance in simulating lswt and generated a warm mixed layer this study provides guidance on model parameterization for simulating the thermal structure of deep lakes and advances our understanding of the strength and revolution of lake thermal stratification under seasonal changes keywords thermal stratification lake reservoir numerical simulation wrf lake parameter sensitivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction thermal stratification is an important physical process in many lakes reservoirs that modulates their response to climate change and maintains lake ecosystem functions donis et al 2021 till et al 2019 stratification in lakes is mediated by the complex non linear interactions between the lake surface and the atmosphere it is influenced by atmospheric forcing and lake specific properties such as water transparency and geomorphological depth surface area factors kraemer et al 2015 richardson et al 2017 although recent studies have reported a mixing regime shift in large lakes anderson et al 2021 a fundamental and predictive understanding of lake stratification is still obscured due to the scarcity of in situ observations numerical simulations provide an opportunity to compensate for the space and time limitations of observations piccolroaz et al 2020 and diagnose the effects of potential impact factors woolway et al 2020 woolway et al 2019 growing computational power further allows the coupling of lake and climate models to simulate lake atmosphere interactions however the demand for computing efficiency in large scale and long term simulations restricts the application of sophisticated three dimensional hydrodynamic models zamani et al 2021 one dimensional 1d lake models which simplify lake physical processes but require relatively minimal calibration have been demonstrated to be effective tools for simulating thermal stratification at larger scales bruce et al 2018 stepanenko et al 2010 table 1 there are two types of one dimensional lake models based on different numerical discretization methods bulk or integral models and models based on the finite difference scheme stepanenko et al 2010 for example the freshwater lake model flake mironov 2008 as a representative bulk lake model has been incorporated into a set of climate models with high computational efficiency balsamo et al 2012 thiery et al 2014b evaluations of the flake model have shown that it is suitable for reproducing lswt and thermal structure in shallow lakes but fails to simulate the development of thermal stratification in deep lakes as it does not directly solve the physical processes huang et al 2019 thiery et al 2014a the models based on the finite difference scheme include eddy diffusion models and turbulent kinetic k ε models perroud et al 2009 eddy diffusion models use semi empirical parameterization for the representation of turbulent fluxes the k ε models solve two equations including turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate eddy diffusion models are inexpensive and proven to produce more accurate epilimnion temperature whereas the k ε models are more complicated but performed better for simulating thermocline depth guo et al 2021 eddy diffusion models are ideal candidates for coupling to climate earth system models because of their relatively low cost and better representation of mixing processes compared to flake for example the hostetler lake model and its successors have been implemented in the community land surface model clm lake oleson et al 2013 common land model colm lake dai et al 2018a and the weather research and forecast model wrf lake gu et al 2015 previous studies have shown that the lake component of wrf lake outperformed flake and other lake models based on turbulent closure schemes when simulating summer stratification in lake valkea kotinen a small shallow lake in southern finland stepanenko et al 2014 it has also been suggested that wrf lake better describes the temporal variation of the total water column temperature than flake and colm lake in lake nam co a large and deep lake on the qinghai tibet plateau huang et al 2019 hostetler model shows smaller biases compared to those utilizing more complicated algorithms when used for global application guo et al 2021 and offers a marked degree of flexibility for specific lake applications martynov et al 2010 the wrf lake model has been utilized to simulate physical processes in a variety of lakes from shallow to deep systems as well as those situated across warm and cold climatic regions gu et al 2015 gu et al 2016 huang et al 2019 su et al 2022 wu et al 2020 xiao et al 2016 xu et al 2016 the performance of wrf lake is highly sensitive to key model parameters notably the eddy diffusivity light extinction coefficient temperature of maximum water density for brackish water simulations and surface roughness lengths of lake surface huang et al 2019 these parameters are lake specific and simplified in wrf lake such simplification may be sufficient for global scale analysis in which the uncertainties for specific lakes of a single model can either be filtered directly or compensated by ensemble simulations to reveal large scale patterns but for regional scale simulations the model parameters related to lake characteristics have to be carefully tuned to achieve the required accuracy gu et al 2015 suggested that although lswt in relatively shallow lakes e g lake erie can be well captured the vertical heat transfer process predicted by wrf lake is underestimated for deep lakes e g lake superior and leads to large biases in lswt previous parameter sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the deficiency of wrf lake can be improved by enlarging the eddy diffusivity by a factor of 102 105 which has been proven to be effective in simulating the thermal structure of lake nam co huang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 however another study at the laurentian great lakes found that the parameterization scheme presented by gu et al 2015 only exerted a limited influence on lake michigan 147 5 m at the mooring site xiao et al 2016 a recent study based on the offline version of wrf lake in the deep reservoir nuozhadu utilized a more elaborate calibration for eddy diffusivity in which an enhanced term was added and enlarged for deep layers wang et al 2019 therefore it is evident that the influence and uncertainty of eddy diffusivity on simulating thermal structures in deep lakes are quite diverse yet unclear which requires proper calibration in different lakes moreover the light extinction coefficient can substantially alter the thermal structure of lakes by regulating the vertical heat transfer process read and rose 2013 rose et al 2016 for example larger light extinction coefficients will lead to more absorbed shortwave radiation resulting in thicker mixed layers wang et al 2019 reducing light extinction coefficients in clearwater lakes may deepen the thermocline and generate a warmer mixed layer wu et al 2020 previous studies on modifying the light extinction coefficient were primarily based on empirical estimations that neglected the seasonal fluctuation of lake water clarity caused by phytoplankton growth shatwell et al 2016 lake qiandaohu is located in the hilly areas of zhejiang province in eastern china it has a complex morphology and remains thermally stratified throughout the year lake qiandaohu is a warm monomictic lake and experiences short term mixing in winter or spring zhang et al 2014 thermal stratification in lake qiandaohu usually begins in march and becomes the most intense in august and lasts until december with a temperature difference between the surface and bottom ranging from 5 c to 20 c liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 although the phenology of its stratification has been well documented the influencing mechanisms and evolution of lake physical characteristics e g the water clarity and mixing process are not clear proper parameterization in simulating the stratification in lake qiandaohu as a representative of deep and warm monomictic lakes would help to understand the evolution of the lake thermal structure this study aims to 1 improve the fundamental understanding of the thermal structure of lake qiandaohu 2 address the influencing mechanism of key model parameters and 3 provide references for wrf lake application in deep lakes to achieve these goals six sensitivity experiments were conducted in lake qiandaohu in 2016 this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the wrf lake model configuration and numerical experiments and simulation results are presented in section 3 and interpreted in section 4 the major findings of this study are presented in section 5 2 numerical modeling and simulation 2 1 site description lake qiandaohu 29 37 29 83 n 118 57 119 25 e is a deep reservoir in eastern china and means thousand island archipelagoes in chinese it was established in 1959 it is a nationally protected drinking water source with a basin area of 10480 km2 and a water volume of 178 4 108 m3 when the normal water storage water level is 108 m zhang et al 2014 it has a water surface area of 580 km2 with a length and width of 150 km and 50 km respectively at its widest point zhang et al 2014 lake qiandaohu is morphologically complex and contains five sub basins the deepest of which is 105 m although the average depth of the lake is only 30 m zhang et al 2014 2 2 wrf model configurations the weather research and forecasting model version 4 0 hereafter referred to as wrf https www2 mmm ucar edu wrf users is a state of the art numerical weather prediction model it solves the fully compressible euler non hydrostatic equations using the arakawa c staggered grid second or third order runge kutta time integration scheme and terrain following vertical coordinate system skamarock et al 2019 in this study the wrf model was configured with two one way nested domains with horizontal resolutions of 5 km and 1 km centered on lake qiandaohu fig 1 with 33 levels in the vertical direction the selection of horizontal spacing considers both the computational efficiency and complex shape of lake qiandaohu after several tests the yonsei university ysu planetary boundary layer scheme hong et al 2006 and topographic correction method proposed by jiménez and dudhia 2012 were chosen to reach the minimum bias of wind speed the betts miller janjic cumulus convection scheme janjic 1994 was applied to the outer 5 km resolution domain only the noah land surface scheme chen and dudhia 2001 wsm6 microphysics scheme lim and hong 2006 revised mm5 surface layer scheme jiménez et al 2012 and ucm urban surface scheme chen et al 2011 are also affiliated to improve the atmospheric simulation the temperature humidity and horizontal wind fields above the planetary boundary layer of the outer domain were nudged to the era5 reanalysis by employing analysis nudging stauffer and seaman 1994 2 3 simulating lake processes using wrf lake 2 3 1 lake scheme of wrf lake the lake scheme of wrf lake was derived from clm 3 5 which was embedded into the wrf model gu et al 2015 wrf lake is a 1d advection diffusion lake model that discretizes the water column vertically into 0 5 snow layers 10 water ice layers and 10 soil layers the layer thickness of the first water ice layer is always set to 10 cm and the other layer thickness is adjusted with fixed proportion taking the location of the daba buoy as an example 93 m the layer depths m for the ten water ice layers are listed as follows 0 05 4 75 14 05 23 35 32 65 41 95 51 25 60 55 69 85 79 15 the layer thickness is 0 1 m for the first layer and 9 3 m for the rest we also performed numerical experiments using a 25 layer discretization scheme as a grid independence check see supporting information 2 we found that although the 25 layer scheme generated smoother vertical water temperature profiles the overall pattern of lake thermal structure was similar to that of the ten layer one variations in lake water level and area are not considered in wrf lake the exchange of heat moisture and momentum between the lake and overlying atmosphere is governed by the energy budget equation oleson et al 2004 as 1 β s g l g s h l h g 0 2 s g 1 α s w 3 l g ε σ t g 4 l w where β 0 4 is the fraction of the solar radiation absorbed at the lake surface s g is the net shortwave radiation w m 2 l g is the net emitted longwave radiation w m 2 s h is the turbulent flux of sensible heat w m 2 l h is the turbulent flux of latent heat w m 2 g

constant t g is the lake surface temperature k and l w is the downward atmospheric longwave radiation w m 2 eqn 1 is solved numerically by the newton raphson iteration method to derive t g and turbulent fluxes subsurface energy transport is governed by the 1d heat diffusion equation hostetler and bartlein 1990 oleson et al 2004 and is expressed as follows 4 t t z k m k e t z 1 c w d ϕ dz where t is the lake temperature k t is time s k m 1 43 10 7 m2 s is the molecular diffusion coefficient k e is the eddy diffusion coefficient m2 s c w is the volumetric heat capacity j m 3 k 1 and ϕ 1 β s g e x p η m a x z z s 0 is the solar radiation w m 2 penetrating to depth z m where η 1 1925 d 0 424 is the light extinction coefficient m 1 as a function of lake depth d m and z s 0 6 m is the thickness of the surface layer in wrf lake the mixing process is described using an advection diffusion model eqn 4 whereby the eddy diffusion coefficient k e for layer i was calculated from the wind speed as described by oleson et al 2004 5 k e i k w z i p 0 1 37 r i 2 exp k z i t g t f 0 t g t f where k 0 4 is the von karman constant w 0 0012 u 2 is the surface friction velocity m s where u 2 m

acceleration due to gravity and ρ i is the density of water kg m 3 2 3 2 eddy diffusivity calculation from in situ measurements the flux gradient method can be used to determine the eddy diffusivity k e from in situ temperature measurements by integrating eqn 4 from depth z to the lake bottom at depth d while assuming that the turbulent heat flux and net radiation at the lake bottom are equal to zero powell and jassby 1974 thus k e can be derived explicitly from the following expression 8 k e z z d t t d z 1 c w ϕ z t z k m where ϕ is calculated consistent with the procedure used in wrf lake eq 8 is valid only below the mixed layer where the heat transfer caused by convective mixing and horizontal advection can be neglected powell and jassby 1974 the 30 day averages of the lake water temperature and ϕ were used to estimate k e at the center of this time interval the 30 day averaging was used to smooth the profiles of k e to better illustrate its variation with depth and time central difference and forward difference approximations were used for the spatial and time derivatives with δ z 0 5 m and δ t 30 days respectively the trapezoidal rule was applied for approximating the integral with a 0 5 m subinterval negative values due to cooling of the water column or unstable water layers are excluded from the results 2 4 improvements to the wrf lake model 2 4 1 initial lake water temperature profile the default initial lake water temperature in the wrf lake was derived from the ground temperature t g as follows 9 t i t g i 1 t g z i 277 t g 50 z i 50 277 z i 50 where the layer i 1 denotes the top layer we note that eqn 8 was derived from the observed lake temperature profile of lake superior in the simulation results using the default lake scheme the initialization procedure generated a large surface bottom water temperature difference of 8 53 c which is substantially higher than the observed data 2 29 c overestimation of the initial lake water temperature gradients resulted in unrealistic cold biases for the lake bottom water temperature throughout the year for lakes that regularly experience complete turnover it can be assumed that the lake is fully mixed with a homogeneous temperature profile as the initial condition wu et al 2020 however lake qiandaohu is a monomictic lake with thermal stratification for most of the year and the temperature gradient shift caused by the default lake scheme or a uniform initial profile cannot be easily corrected during model integration perroud et al 2009 in this study a straightforward and generalized method was proposed to assign initial values for lake temperature wrf lake was modified to import lake water temperature profiles directly from external files and interpolate them onto the lake grid of the wrf model we first replaced the lake depths in wrf with the observed bathymetry data during the model initialization each water column at lake grids will be discretized into ten layers according to their lake depths then we linearly interpolated the temperature profile at daba to all grids to generate initial conditions for the entire simulation domain this procedure assumes that the water temperature in lake qiandaohu is horizontally homogenous the measurement depths at daba are also adequate for providing water temperature profiles for other lake grids the soil temperature was set equal to the lake water temperature of the bottom layer to ensure that the sediment heat flux was initially zero fig 2 a depicts the default initial lake water temperature profile in wrf lake observed values and modified initial lake water temperature profile at the daba station 0000 utc on 1st march 2016 2 4 2 time dependent light extinction coefficient the light extinction coefficient describes the rate at which the incident shortwave radiation is attenuated by lake water which determines the vertical distribution of solar radiation in the default wrf lake model the light extinction coefficient was calculated as a function of lake depth section 2 3 1 using in situ observations from 88 swedish lakes which cannot be generalized to global lakes subin et al 2012 the light extinction coefficient at the daba station for example varies between 0 3 and 0 6 throughout the year with the highest values in spring and summer however the default values in wrf lake remain constant and understated fig 2b therefore the in situ observed monthly light extinction coefficients of lake qiandaohu were taken as model inputs and disaggregated to daily resolution during the simulation period which accounted for the temporal variability of the light extinction coefficient 2 4 3 eddy diffusion coefficient the governing equation of the heat transfer in the wrf lake was controlled by molecular diffusion and eddy diffusion gu et al 2015 proved that the model performance for lake temperature was sensitive to eddy diffusion and could be improved by enlarging the eddy diffusivity k e for deep lakes the default lake model increased k e by a factor of 100 when the depth of the lake grid exceeded 15 m in this study the factor was enlarged to 104 and restricted the total heat diffusion coefficient k m k e with a maximum value of 0 01 m2 s to avoid unrealistic large diffusivity that may occur at the lake surface this criterion is the largest vertical heat diffusivity observed in the open seas as suggested by wang et al 2019 2 4 4 surface roughness lengths parameterization the surface roughness length of momentum sensible heat and latent heat for unfrozen lakes is defined as 0 001 m in the default wrf lake which can be considered excessive for lakes the method proposed by subin et al 2012 was adopted is this study it calculates the surface roughness lengths based on the friction velocity fetch and wind speed as follows 11 z 0 m m a x 0 1 v u α u 2 g 10 5 m z 0 h z 0 m e x p κ p r 4 r 0 3 2 10 5 m z 0 q z 0 m e x p κ s c 4 r 0 4 2 10 5 m where v is the kinematic viscosity of air m2 s u is the friction velocity m s α is the effective charnock coefficient given below r 0 m a x z 0 m u v 0 1 is the near surface atmospheric roughness reynolds number p r 0 71 is the molecular prandt number for air and s c 0 66 is the molecular schmidt number for water in the air the charnock coefficient is defined as follows 11 α α min α max α min e x p m i n a b a fg u 2 1 3 f c b dg u where α min 0 01 α max 0 11 f is the lake fetch m and f c was set to 22 which corresponds to the use of u instead of u when calculating a wang et al 2019 1 the fixed point iteration method proposed by wang et al 2019 was also used to update surface roughness lengths and u simultaneously 2 5 datasets 2 5 1 reanalysis datasets the initial and boundary conditions of the wrf model were provided by the 6 hourly era5 reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 data with 1 spatial resolution this is the latest fifth generation of atmospheric reanalysis dataset produced by the european center for medium range weather forecasts and has been applied widely in lake research https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets reanalysis datasets era5 the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd is a gridded near surface meteorological dataset with a 0 1 spatial resolution and a three hour temporal resolution https data tpdc ac cn en data 8028b944 daaa 4511 8769 965612652c49 it is developed by combining remote sensing data reanalysis datasets and in situ measurements he et al 2020 yang et al 2010 it has been widely used in other lake modeling studies in china wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 downward shortwave radiation and longwave radiation from this dataset were used as references to check the performance of the wrf model since the chun an weather station does not observe radiation components cmfd has been used as a representative of observation for assessing other forcing data qi et al 2022 its shortwave radiation has also been proven to be reliable for china yang et al 2017 despite that some studies in lake namco have found inconsistencies between cmfd and in situ observations huang et al 2019 shi et al 2022 wu et al 2021 to reduce the uncertainties caused by single forcing data we also included the era5 reanalysis as a reference when validating the simulated longwave and shortwave radiations 2 5 2 meteorological observation daily observations of meteorological variables including 2 m temperature 10 m wind speed and precipitation at the chun an weather station 29 62 n 119 02 e during 2016 were applied to evaluate the performance of the wrf model in simulating near surface variables data were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn 2 5 3 lake water temperature observation in lake qiandaohu in situ lake water temperature measurements at the daba buoy station in 2016 29 51 n 119 21 e hereafter referred to as daba are used to calibrate model parameters the water temperature was recorded every three hours by a multiparameter water column profiler attached to a buoy vertical depths 0 005 and water temperature 0 002 were sampled at 0 5 m intervals between 0 1 and 10 m and 2 m depth increments were used below 10 m liu et al 2019 this sampling location had a maximum depth of 93 m but the records only reached 65 m because the water temperature is vertically homogenous down below liu et al 2019 for the convenience of cross comparison the water temperature from both in situ observations and numerical experiments was interpolated to 0 5 m intervals from 0 5 to 64 m 2 5 4 light extinction coefficient measurements light extinction coefficients η m 1 were obtained from monthly sampling of water transparency z secchi m measured by the secchi disk method in this study light attenuation was calculated using the relationship η 1 3809 z secchi 0 92 which was estimated from a series of concurrent observations of z secchi and light absorption fig s5 2 6 metrics of stratification and mixing the lake analyzer https gleon org research projects lake analyzer is a numerical code package for calculating the key metrics of lake physical states from water temperature lake bathymetry and near surface wind speed read et al 2011 three indicators were selected to represent the lake thermal structure characteristics during stratification the thermocline depth thermd thickness of the metalimnion metath and bottom depth of the metalimnion metab thermd was defined as the depth of the maximum change in water density the metalimnion range is defined as the water layer where the vertical temperature gradient is 0 2 c m 1 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 schmidt stability which denotes the resistance of mechanical mixing because of potential energy was also calculated to represent the temporal variation of lake thermal stability schmidt 1928 the lake number and wedderburn number were calculated to describe the dynamic stability the two dimensionless metrics are expressed as the balance of wind stress and the stratified condition lake number represents the potential for nonlinear internal waves caused by wind forcing imberger and patterson 1989 meanwhile the wedderburn number represents the possibility of upward movement in the metalimnion thompson 1980 lower lake number and wedderburn number values indicate a higher likelihood of mixing events read et al 2011 2 7 experimental design and post processing six numerical experiments were conducted to assess the impact of key parameters that individually affect the lake thermal structure and evaluate performance of the modified wrf lake model as shown in the table below since lake temperature measurements below 30 m were not available from january to february 2016 all simulations ran from march 1 2016 to january 1 2017 and the first 20 days were discarded as model spin up in this study the mean bias error mbe was used to represent systematic error of the lake model this metric provides the average bias of a model in comparison to observations and indicates whether the model needs to be corrected the root mean square error rmse was used to assess the credibility of the model this is the standard deviation of the predicted errors and is highly sensitive to the most significant errors 3 results in this section the results from the wrf lake simulations are first validated using in situ observations and other available datasets after the sensitivity experiments the lake water temperature and the sensible and latent heat fluxes are further analyzed to determine the effects of key model parameters on the lake surface energy balance and thermal structure 3 1 model validation 3 1 1 comparison of meteorological variables the simulated near surface air temperature and wind speed from the control experiment were compared with those obtained from meteorological observations since radiation measurements from nearby weather stations were unavailable the cmfd dataset was used as a reference to assess the accuracy of downward shortwave and longwave radiation which act as the primary energy sources for the lake the wrf model accurately reproduced daily variations of 2 m air temperature downward longwave radiation and 2 m relative humidity as well as the seasonal pattern of downward shortwave radiation and 10 m wind speed fig 3 the comparison of simulated spatial pattern between ctl and reanalysis dataset were shown in figs s13 s14 as shown in fig 3 and table 2 the temporal variations in air temperature and downward longwave radiation were captured well by the wrf with an mbe of 0 4 c 0 6 13 9 w m 2 the comparison between wrf and era5 cmfd and a rmse of 1 3 c 9 3 20 4 w m 2 the wrf model underestimated relative humidity by an mbe of 1 5 this is possibly related to the warm biases in air temperature which results in larger saturated water vapor pressure the wrf model was also able to simulate reasonably the daily variation in wind speed although there is a large positive bias with an annual mbe of 2 7 m s 1 and an rmse of 3 0 m s 1 this indicates a systematic overprediction of wind speed and the degree of which amplified at higher velocities the simulated downward shortwave radiation was also overestimated with a mean mbe of 82 0 84 7 w m 2 detailed investigations of the overprediction of wind speed and shortwave radiation are not within the scope of this study however their effects on lake thermal structures are further discussed in section 4 1 3 1 2 comparison of lake surface energy processes lswt is determined by heat exchange processes at the air water interface namely absorbed radiation heat conduction and heat loss by evaporation edinger et al 1968 since the net shortwave radiation and downward longwave radiation are subjected to atmospheric conditions this section analyzes the lswt and turbulent fluxes to determine effects of the model parameters on the lake surface energy processes the emitted longwave radiation is not included because it is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature the first term on the right hand side of eqn 3 thus it varies naturally with lswt lswt in this study is the average water temperature between 0 and 2 m the simulated data at 0400 utc 12 00 in local time each day were chosen for a stable and intense thermal stratification liu et al 2019 the wrf lake results were interpolated to the location of daba buoy to compare with the observations results of simulated lswt sensible and latent heat are shown in fig 4 and fig s6 the comparison of simulated spatial pattern between ctl and other experiments of lake water temperature at the top model layer was shown in fig s15 compared with in situ data ctl successfully reproduced the seasonal variation of water temperature fig 4a but significantly underestimated lswt from september to december this results in an annual mbe of 1 3 c which indicates a systematic cold bias in addition ctl simulated excessive variation in lswt particularly during the warming period march june with an average of 1 7 c it is still comparable to the daily variation in air temperature 1 7 c but considerably higher than the observed daily variation in water temperature 0 5 c ctl generated a reasonable temporal pattern of turbulent heat fluxes at the lake surface fig 4b shows that the latent heat flux exhibited an increasing trend before september and reached its peak in autumn because of the lag between the lswt and air temperature schmid and read 2021 this is consistent with the enhanced sensible heat flux since august fig 4c and implies that the lake surface is warmer than the overlying atmosphere and serves as a heat source fig 4b and c also highlight the dominant contribution of evaporation to turbulent heat fluxes as is expected in low latitude lakes such as lake qiandaohu woolway et al 2018 as indicated by the rmse and mbe fig 5 all five parameter sensitivity experiments improved the accuracy of lswt except ini which exacerbated the cold biases results with increased light extinction coefficient warmed the water surface during most of the simulation period 93 4 consequently yielding a 0 4 c increase in annual mbe the ini experiment corrected the overestimation of lswt at the beginning of the simulation the difference between ini and ctl diminished until november when ini began to display a negative bias against ctl and eventually resulted in a decrease in annual mbe of 0 1 c the only experiment with a positive mbe of 0 1 c against observation was z0mg this matched the minimum latent heat flux generated by z0mg in the five sensitivity experiments fig 4b despite an increase of 1 1 w m 2 in the annual average sensible heat flux of z0mg the latent heat flux decreased by 14 0 w m 2 because of less effective moisture exchange at the air water interface and dominated changes in lswt enlarging the eddy diffusivity in the deep layers mitigated the cold bias of the lswt from october to december which was analogous to z0mg however for the other months of the year ke estimated colder lswt than ctl after the calibrations the mod experiment achieved a minimum mbe of 0 1 c and lowered the rmse from 2 9 c to 1 6 c the remaining cold bias was partially because of the positive bias in the near surface wind speed introduced by the wrf model fig 3b windier conditions promote stronger mixing events in the epilimnion and favor turbulent heat loss especially latent heat at the air water interface thereby resulting in a cooling effect on lswt woolway et al 2018 3 2 simulating stratification in lake qiandaohu results of the ctl experiment showed that the original lake scheme could represent the temporal evolution of lake stratification lake thermal stratification began in march and strengthened rapidly in april with the temperature difference between the surface and bottom of the lake hereafter denoted as tdiff exceeding 5 c on april 2 further lake stratification was found to be strongest during summer when the temperature difference reached 23 4 c on july 26 fig 6 a ctl captured this feature relatively well with the maximum temperature difference occurring on july 25 fig 6b however ctl predicted an earlier spring warm up and autumn cool down the hypolimnion temperature was severely underestimated which results in an unrealistic vertical temperature gradient in the deep layers this also caused the maximum tdiff of the ctl experiment to be 6 c higher than that observed moreover the default lake scheme generated weaker lake stratification which is indicated by the negative annual mbe of the thickness of the metalimnion in the ini experiment fig 10 it is noteworthy that the positive systematic error of the metalimnion bottom depth and metalimnion thickness in ctl was attributable to overestimation of the initial hypolimnion temperatures as shown in fig 6 the lake temperature simulated by kd and z0mg were very close to that of ctl although the hypolimnion temperature in the ini experiment was more accurate it simulated a metalimnion structure that was very similar to that of ctl which was greatly improved in the ke experiment these results confirm that the vertical heat distribution is primarily governed by the mixing process subin et al 2012 modifying surface properties of the lake such as surface roughness lengths and light extinction coefficient has limited effects on the vertical temperature pattern xiao et al 2016 fig 7 and fig s10 showed the differences in the temperature simulated from all the sensitivity experiments against ctl and the observations respectively the comparison of vertical water temperature profile was depicted in fig s11 it can be first noted that the kd and z0mg were both close to ctl and showed an overall warming trend in the whole water column ini and ke showed the largest deviation from ctl an increase in the light extinction coefficient resulted in a warming of the lake surface in early summer as well as a water temperature of approximately 15 m during stratification leading to a temperature increase of 2 0 c negative values only occurred at the lake surface for a few days possibly because of the increased latent heat flux fig 4c the ini experiment removed cold bias below 25 m however it tends to produce a warmer lswt from june to october and a colder metalimnion throughout the year deteriorating the model performance at 9 11 and 19 21 m fig 5 when a parameterization for surface roughness lengths was used the water column temperature increased by an average of 0 6 c above 25 m the most pronounced improvements occur at 1 15 m in winter which largely delayed the earlier prediction of the autumn cool down although an even earlier warm up was estimated fig 6e enlarging the eddy diffusivity decreased the water temperature above 5 m before september and increased the water temperature below it thereby implying that more heat energy was transferred to the deep layers by enhancing the mixing strength warmer deep layers allow more energy to be stored below the mixed layer where the air water heat exchange takes place this further enhances the resistance of the lake to declining air temperature which is indicated by the warmer water column in winter these results suggested that in addition to dominating the development of the metalimnion the mixing strength in the lake model influences the thermal structure during the subsequent cool down period we have also performed a numerical experiment with only the modified initial water temperature profile and eddy diffusivity fig s16 and table s3 the results produced a similar thermal structure with mod but the water temperatures above 25 m were colder and showed larger biases this suggests that the initial water temperature profile and eddy diffusivity were most critical for simulating the evolution of the lake thermal structure at the same time modifying light extinction coefficients and surface roughness lengths which mainly increased water temperature in shallow layers are important as well the performance of the mod experiment in simulating water temperature at certain depths is shown in fig 8 fig 8b d denotes the water temperature at a depth of 9 11 m above the thermocline 19 21 m below the thermocline and 39 41 m hypolimnion respectively in summary accuracy of the lake scheme was greatly improved by modifying the aforementioned key model parameters namely the initial lake water temperature light extinction coefficient eddy diffusion coefficient and surface roughness lengths the mod experiment captured the seasonal variation and magnitudes of water temperature and reproduced the extended highest water temperature at 19 21 m compared to that at the surface nevertheless the differences between the mod and in situ measurements became apparent as the depth increased overestimation of water temperature at 9 11 m from june to august and underestimation in 19 21 m suggests insufficient heat transfer below the thermocline the mod experiment also failed to reproduce the slow warm up of the hypolimnion temperatures thereby implying unresolved mixing processes in the deep layers the temporal variations in the four modelled lake stability indicators calculated by lake analyzer were consistent with those calculated from the observations fig 9 schmidt stability varies coherently with lswt as it only depends on the water density fig 9a the rising schmidt stability before september suggested that the kinetic energy required to disturb lake stratification increased thermal stability weakened during the cooling period but still exceeded 1000 j m 2 in winter which is reasonable for a deep and warm monomictic lake the magnitude of the schmidt stability in the mod experiment was consistent with that of the observations which was attributed to a better representation of the vertical heat content fig 9b shows that the thermocline depth changed rapidly in spring and gradually deepened with a strengthening of summer stratification during the cool down period the upper water column was fully mixed and the thermocline depth was maintained near the bottom of the metalimnion the mod and ctl experiments both captured the sudden increase in thermocline depth in autumn but failed to reproduce the steady growth behavior before that the overestimation of wind speed and hypolimnetic water density resulted in lower lake numbers in the numerical experiments fig 9c the lake number from the observations increased with schmidt stability and the bottom layer depth of the metalimnion from april to july and then slowly decreased for most of the year the lake number from the observations remained above 10 which implies that wind forcing could only stir the uppermost layer of the lake and was incapable of diapycnal mixing macintyre et al 1999 similar to the lake number the wedderburn numbers in the simulations were also underestimated owing to an overestimation of wind speed fig 9d variations in the wedderburn number were primarily determined by changes in the mixed layer depth in the ctl experiment the mixed layer depth remained stable until november which caused a downward trend in the wedderburn number from august to october owing to the reduced density difference between the epilimnion and hypolimnion however the wedderburn number increased with the mixed layer depth since september in the mod experiment and observations the wedderburn number calculated from observations seldom fell below one which suggests a low likelihood of upwelling events fig 10 demonstrates the accuracy of the simulated thermal stratification by the annual mbe and rmse of the thermal characteristics in the numerical experiments against observations the mod experiment improved the model performance in estimating metath and metab and reduced the mbe to 2 2 m and 1 7 m respectively the remaining negative biases may be attributed to the weaker mixing strength below the thermocline fig 8c d the thermd estimated by the tuned model has an mbe of 1 0 m and an rmse of 8 8 m which is significantly better than that in large scale simulations with uncalibrated models guo et al 2021 the mod experiment also improved the performance of the model in simulating the strength of summer stratification the tdiff estimated by the mod was 23 7 c occurred on july 25 with 0 2 c higher than that in observations and one day ahead 3 3 calculation and analyses of eddy diffusivity k e was computed from the observed water temperature using the approach described in section 2 3 2 to quantitively evaluate the limitation of the henderson sellers eddy diffusivity it is noteworthy that k e produced by eqn 14 is a proxy for all three dimensional processes that contribute to turbulence in lake qiandaohu therefore a similar variation pattern and magnitude of the tuned k e were expected for accurate simulation of the thermal structure fig 11 depicts k e computed from the observations k eobs and the enlarged k e in the mod experiment k emod the profiles of k emod at different seasons were very similar the k emod first decreased markedly with increasing depth and reached its minimum in the 20 50 m depth range because of increasing vertical temperature gradients notably the water temperature at deep layers was almost homogeneous in the vertical direction fig 6g fig s11 and the r i in eq 5 decreased from 102 to zero fig s12 and therefore resulted in large k emod comparable to that in shallow layers this behavior suggests that wrf lake is also unable to simulate the vertical heat distribution in the hypolimnion not only its temporal variation fig 8d which is possibly related to the unresolved heat diffusion in the hypolimnion see discussion in section 4 2 3 it is evident that the profiles of k eobs varied significantly with time and depth the k eobs values ranged from 1 3 10 8 to 3 0 10 4 m2 s with an average of 4 0 10 5 m2 s this result is consistent with previous findings in lake zurich another large and deep lake li 1973 the highest k eobs occurred in early summer march june caused by the warming of the water column and the relatively weak vertical temperature gradient after the stabilization of stratification in summer the k eobs rapidly declined because of the strong temperature gradient in august the k eobs was negative at almost every depth except 7 12 5 m where the warming trend lasted until september this phenomenon is in line with the observed lagged maximum temperature in 9 11 m compared to that in 0 2 m from observations fig 8a b the profiles of k eobs in early summer showed a local minimum of k eobs at approximately around 2 5 m which corresponds to the depth of thermocline the k eobs further increased and formed a maximum at approximately 20 m below 20 m the behavior of k eobs varied largely with depth in different seasons in march and april k eobs gradually decreases with depth from top to bottom in the remaining months however the k eobs formed a local minimum at 30 40 m which is possibly related to the warm up of water temperature at 39 41 m fig 8d the minimums of the k eobs profile matched the two gradient extremes in water temperature profile fig s7 4 discussion this study aimed to simulate the temporal evolution of thermal stratification in a subtropical deep reservoir lake qiandaohu using an improved wrf lake model the results show that the improved model with the necessary parameterization can capture variations in water temperature and intensity of lake stratification 4 1 model uncertainty in a coupled system the foremost concern is the error introduced by the atmospheric model in this case wrf for simulating physical processes in the lake the 10 m wind speed and downward shortwave radiation were largely overestimated by the model the near surface wind speed of the era5 reanalysis which provided initial and boundary conditions showed a magnitude comparable to the observations fig s8 this overprediction may be related to deficiencies in the wrf model wrf is deficient in representing the drag effect because of subgrid scale orography and tends to underestimate wind speed spatial variability over complex terrain jiménez and dudhia 2012 thus wrf overpredicts wind speed in valleys where lake qiandaohu is located fig 1b positive error of the downward shortwave radiation simulated by the wrf model is consistent with previous studies that evaluated the performance of atmospheric models in representing surface energy fluxes for example the wrf model overestimated shortwave radiation with an average mbe of 152 9 w m 2 compared to those of the hourly observations in the heihe river basin pan and li 2011 the biases of simulated surface insolation is caused by an inaccurate representation of the radiation transfer process between the top of the atmosphere and ground wild 2005 this suggests that misrepresentations of cloud properties rather than radiation schemes are responsible for these biases jousse et al 2016 studies at regional scales have also suggested that an overestimation of the downward shortwave radiation by wrf may be attributable to the lack of cumulus cloud amount and uncertainty in aerosol optical depth avolio et al 2017 kumar et al 2015 ruiz arias et al 2016 in the lake scheme wind speed was used to calculate the friction velocity which further influenced the simulated water temperature from two perspectives first the sensible and latent fluxes from eqn 1 are estimated using the bulk aerodynamic algorithm proposed by zeng et al 1998 where the surface fluxes of heat and water vapor are proportional to the friction velocity second the 2 m wind speed in eqn 5 also varies with the friction velocity therefore a higher wind speed promotes the efficiency of heat and water vapor exchange at the lake surface and enhances mixing strength in the subsurface woolway et al 2021 schmid et al 2014 investigated sensitivity of the lake surface equilibrium temperature to climate forcing variables according to these findings overestimation of the average annual 10 m wind speed by 2 7 m s 1 table 2 will lead to a decrease in lswt by 2 7 c however lswt will simultaneously increase by 2 5 4 9 c because of positive biases in solar radiation therefore the effects of overestimated wind speed and downward shortwave radiation on lswt may partially compensate for each other the remaining cold bias in lswt is presumably because of the favored turbulent heat loss especially latent heat under windy conditions woolway et al 2018 notably the enhancement of mixing strength by increased wind speed remains in the modified model and might be amplified as the eddy diffusivity is increased however extremes in eddy diffusivity was constrained with a fixed value thus it is reasonable to speculate that the influence of high wind speed on the formation of lake thermal stratification was limited moreover our sensitivity analysis using offline wrf lake model see supporting information 1 suggested that the effect of strong winds is most distinct during autumn in which the water temperature above 30 m increased possibly due to deeper mixed layer depth and larger amounts of water participated in the lake air heat exchange the enhanced solar radiation increased the water temperature above 20 m fig s2 which might increase the strength of lake stratification the changes in lake surface temperature may also influence the condition of the overlying atmosphere generally lakes could mitigate the regional climate by decreasing the annual range of air temperature and increasing nearby precipitations dai et al 2018b wen and lyu 2014 therefore we compared the temporal variations of simulated near surface air temperature and daily precipitation in the ctl and mod experiment as shown in fig s9 it can be noted first that the mod experiment has similar seasonal patterns to that of ctl the warmer lake surface in the mod experiment heated the overlying atmosphere this alleviated the underestimation of summer air temperature in ctl but also amplified the overestimation of winter air temperature the occurrences of rainfall events are consistent in these two experiments simulated precipitation in spring is underestimated in both experiments the most distinct difference existed in may and june in which the magnitude of precipitation in mod was even less this suggests that the volume of lake qiandaohu is not large enough to impact atmospheric circulations therefore the improved lake scheme may slightly influence the magnitude of atmospheric variables but cannot change its overall pattern the effects could be either improvement or deterioration depending on the original biases of wrf 4 2 parameter sensitivity 4 2 1 time dependent light extinction coefficient it has been described that darker surface waters tend to form shallower mixed layers owing to the less deeply penetrated radiation this results in more turbulent heat loss at the lake surface and larger variation in the epilimnion temperature heiskanen et al 2015 zolfaghari et al 2017 the results from guseva et al 2020 suggested that different 1d lake models respond similarly to changes in water clarity and that the thermocline depth increases in clear waters however the simulation results showed a slight increase in the thermocline depth when larger light extinction coefficients were used which is indicated by the reduced negative biases in kd compared with those in ctl fig 10a although the direct influence of penetrated radiation is restricted in shallow layers it seems that this heating effect has extended down to approximately 15 m since june fig 7a this could possibly contribute to a deepening of the thermocline the results also showed that a larger light extinction coefficient generated a thicker metalimnion which corresponds to the linear relationship deduced from in situ water temperature measurements in lake qiandaohu where a negative correlation between metalimnion thickness and water transparency was found zhang et al 2014 therefore it can be tentatively concluded that the response of lake stratification to changes in water clarity may differ in lakes with different depths and thermal regimes it is difficult to determine the influence of light attenuation on lake stratification because research on this parameter at regional or global scales is still lacking this literature deficiency may be attributed to insufficient high frequency measurements of water clarity and water temperature satellite derived series of water transparency combined with lake models may shed more light on this issue 4 2 2 initial lake water temperature in monomictic lakes sensitivity experiment of the calibrated initial lake temperature profile showed that this modification is crucial for generating realistic hypolimnion temperatures even though the influence of changes in the initial lake temperature profile on lswt did not last for more than one month this is unsurprising given that lswt is driven by the surface energy balance and its variation can be captured by lake models even in the absence of a reasonable subsurface temperature stepanenko et al 2013 monomictic lakes do not experience complete overturn in winter and thus cannot reset the deep water temperature like dicmictic lakes therefore the underestimation of the hypolimnion temperature in monomictic lakes induced by initial conditions implies insufficient heat storage and could eventually lead to shifts in thermal dynamic processes during long term simulations perroud et al 2009 4 2 3 simulating heat transfer in 1d lake models the eddy diffusivity parameterization based on henderson sellers 1985 struggles to simulate the mixing strength in deep lakes perroud et al 2009 stepanenko et al 2010 thiery et al 2014b despite that this type of model has been used widely in lake simulations because of its flexibility which allows it to produce acceptable results without considerable modification martynov et al 2010 our results confirmed that the tuned model can simulate seasonal variation of the lake thermal structure with reasonable error during summer suggesting that this model can be further applied to simulations in which the interannual variations of the lake thermal regime matter it is believed that the 1d mixing processes can be theoretically tuned to imitate the behavior of that in a real lake based on available empirical formulas but the limitation of original eddy diffusivity could not be completely solved by enlarging or shrinking it which is a common approach bennington et al 2014 wu et al 2020 xiao et al 2016 the results suggest that tuning eddy diffusivity affects only the thermal structure in the epilimnion and upper metalimnion as this coefficient decreases exponentially with depth and levels off below the thermocline with a magnitude far less than the molecular diffusivity this implies little or no turbulence in the modeled deep layer which is not the case in reality the vertical structure of the henderson sellers eddy diffusivity raises two questions first the heat diffusion between the thermocline and hypolimnion is lacking in the modeled lake therefore the water temperature in the lower metalimnion could not be well reproduced it is apparent that the k eobs concaved at depths with large gradients and decreased mildly with increasing depth in contrast the k esim dropped sharply and became less than the molecular diffusivity between 15 and 40 m thus although lake qiandaohu formed two zones with steep temperature gradients it is believed that this conclusion is tenable in other deep lakes moreover albm and mtcr 1 which both uses henderson sellers diffusivity also failed to reproduce the temporal and depth variability of vertical eddy diffusivity in a temperate dimictic lake guseva et al 2020 although the models generated satisfactory thermal structure therefore it is reasonable to infer that this issue not only existed in wrf lake but also in all advective diffusive models based on the same parameterization method the next problem is unresolved heat diffusion in the hypolimnion for example internal seiches generated from hypolimnetic currents that transfer wind energy from the lake surface to turbulence at the bottom imberger 1998 this deficiency exists in selected 1d lake models that do not consider internal waves even the more sophisticated k ε model can only calculate the turbulence above the thermocline perroud et al 2009 and thus the extra parameterization for turbulences in deep layers is required it has been found that the vertical diffusivity of heat in stratified layers of many lakes can be described as k b n 2 m where m and b are constants related to lake properties jassby and powell 1975 therefore some models such as the probe model svensson 1978 the lake component in clm 4 5 and an offline version of the wrf lake model wang et al 2019 adopted this expression to mimic the unresolved mixing process in factual lakes it is noteworthy that the weight of this additional term must be cautiously selected for a specific lake throughout the testing process this added term was required for certain depths to better simulate the deepening of the metalimnion in the spring and early summer however during the decay of summer stratification this term must be turned off or decreased to prevent over mixing in the water column zhang et al 2019 also found that the lake module in clm 4 5 failed to reproduce the transition between stratification and overturn because of this arbitrary attached term although it still worked well for some lakes wang et al 2019 overall it seems that the inclusion of an enhanced term such as that of other water mixing schemes and parameterization methods for major types of unresolved heat diffusion is a compromise between computational cost and more complicated three dimensional hydrodynamic models 5 conclusions in the current study the wrf lake model was improved to simulate the lake thermal regime over a monomictic deep lake qiandaohu by tuning four key model parameters i e the initial lake water temperature profiles light extinction coefficients eddy diffusion coefficients and the surface roughness lengths we found that 1 the modified 1d lake model wrf lake simulated thermal structure of lake qiandaohu with satisfactory performance the mbe and rmse of lswt between simulation results and in situ observations were reduced from 1 3 c to 0 1 c and 2 9 c to 1 6 c respectively the evolution of lake stratification was well captured which is indicated by three metrics for example the mbe of the thermocline depth decreased from 13 0 m to 1 7 m 2 the wrf model overpredicted the near surface wind speed and downward shortwave radiation on the ground by an mbe of 2 7 m s 1 and 82 0 w m 2 respectively the impacts of high wind speed on simulating lswt are in contrast to those of enhanced shortwave radiation but cannot be completely offset the tuned maximum value of eddy diffusivity limited the effects of wind speed on mixing strength in the subsurface water layers 3 the initial lake water temperature determined the magnitude of the water temperature in the hypolimnion which seldom experiences the water air heat exchange caused by in complete mixing events in deep lakes the light extinction coefficients and surface roughness lengths have the greatest impact on lswt by governing the penetration of shortwave radiation in water layers and the exchange efficiency of heat and water vapor at the lake surface however they still slightly improve the model performance in simulating subsurface water temperature modifications of the eddy diffusivity improved the model performance in simulating the strength of stratification 4 the schmidt stability of lake qiandaohu varied with lswt and was well simulated by the modified wrf lake model development of the thermocline from june to october is difficult to reproduce the modified wrf lake reduced the annual mbe of the thermocline depth from 5 8 m to 1 0 m the temporal variation of lake number and wedderburn number derived from the simulation results agreed with those of the observations although the magnitude showed negative biases the large values of schmidt stability and low values of lake number and wedderburn number demonstrate that lake qiandaohu was strongly thermally stratified throughout the year and the wind driven internal waves in deep water and mixing were weak thus our results demonstrated that the modified wrf lake model could simulate lswt and evolution of lake stratification with the lowest mbe and rmse which contributes to improvements in simulating lake thermal dynamics although geomorphology and optical characteristics differ between lakes the revised version of wrf lake can be generalized to other study sites after minor modifications finally more lake water temperature measurements are required to improve the representativeness of the mixing process parameterization scheme

2195,lake thermal stratification is important for regulating lake environments and ecosystems and is sensitive to climate change and human activity however numerical simulation of coupled hydrodynamics and heat transfer processes in deep lakes using one dimensional lake models remains challenging because of the insufficient representation of key parameters in this study lake qiandaohu a deep and warm monomictic reservoir was used as an example to investigate thermal stratification via an improved parameterization scheme of the weather research and forecast wrf lake a comparison with in situ observations demonstrated that the default wrf lake model was able to simulate well the seasonal variation of the lake thermal structure however the simulations exhibited cold biases in lake surface water temperature lswt throughout the year while generating weaker stratification in summer thereby leading to an earlier cooling period in autumn with an improved parameterization i e via determination of initial lake water temperature profiles light extinction coefficients eddy diffusion coefficients and surface roughness lengths the modified wrf lake model was able to better simulate lswt and thermal stratification critically employing realistic initial conditions for lake water temperature is essential for producing realistic hypolimnetic water temperatures the use of time dependent light extinction coefficients resulted in a deep thermocline and warm lswt enlarging eddy diffusivity led to stronger mixing in summer and further influenced autumn cooling the parameterized surface roughness lengths mitigated the excessive turbulent heat loss at the lake surface improved the model performance in simulating lswt and generated a warm mixed layer this study provides guidance on model parameterization for simulating the thermal structure of deep lakes and advances our understanding of the strength and revolution of lake thermal stratification under seasonal changes keywords thermal stratification lake reservoir numerical simulation wrf lake parameter sensitivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction thermal stratification is an important physical process in many lakes reservoirs that modulates their response to climate change and maintains lake ecosystem functions donis et al 2021 till et al 2019 stratification in lakes is mediated by the complex non linear interactions between the lake surface and the atmosphere it is influenced by atmospheric forcing and lake specific properties such as water transparency and geomorphological depth surface area factors kraemer et al 2015 richardson et al 2017 although recent studies have reported a mixing regime shift in large lakes anderson et al 2021 a fundamental and predictive understanding of lake stratification is still obscured due to the scarcity of in situ observations numerical simulations provide an opportunity to compensate for the space and time limitations of observations piccolroaz et al 2020 and diagnose the effects of potential impact factors woolway et al 2020 woolway et al 2019 growing computational power further allows the coupling of lake and climate models to simulate lake atmosphere interactions however the demand for computing efficiency in large scale and long term simulations restricts the application of sophisticated three dimensional hydrodynamic models zamani et al 2021 one dimensional 1d lake models which simplify lake physical processes but require relatively minimal calibration have been demonstrated to be effective tools for simulating thermal stratification at larger scales bruce et al 2018 stepanenko et al 2010 table 1 there are two types of one dimensional lake models based on different numerical discretization methods bulk or integral models and models based on the finite difference scheme stepanenko et al 2010 for example the freshwater lake model flake mironov 2008 as a representative bulk lake model has been incorporated into a set of climate models with high computational efficiency balsamo et al 2012 thiery et al 2014b evaluations of the flake model have shown that it is suitable for reproducing lswt and thermal structure in shallow lakes but fails to simulate the development of thermal stratification in deep lakes as it does not directly solve the physical processes huang et al 2019 thiery et al 2014a the models based on the finite difference scheme include eddy diffusion models and turbulent kinetic k ε models perroud et al 2009 eddy diffusion models use semi empirical parameterization for the representation of turbulent fluxes the k ε models solve two equations including turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate eddy diffusion models are inexpensive and proven to produce more accurate epilimnion temperature whereas the k ε models are more complicated but performed better for simulating thermocline depth guo et al 2021 eddy diffusion models are ideal candidates for coupling to climate earth system models because of their relatively low cost and better representation of mixing processes compared to flake for example the hostetler lake model and its successors have been implemented in the community land surface model clm lake oleson et al 2013 common land model colm lake dai et al 2018a and the weather research and forecast model wrf lake gu et al 2015 previous studies have shown that the lake component of wrf lake outperformed flake and other lake models based on turbulent closure schemes when simulating summer stratification in lake valkea kotinen a small shallow lake in southern finland stepanenko et al 2014 it has also been suggested that wrf lake better describes the temporal variation of the total water column temperature than flake and colm lake in lake nam co a large and deep lake on the qinghai tibet plateau huang et al 2019 hostetler model shows smaller biases compared to those utilizing more complicated algorithms when used for global application guo et al 2021 and offers a marked degree of flexibility for specific lake applications martynov et al 2010 the wrf lake model has been utilized to simulate physical processes in a variety of lakes from shallow to deep systems as well as those situated across warm and cold climatic regions gu et al 2015 gu et al 2016 huang et al 2019 su et al 2022 wu et al 2020 xiao et al 2016 xu et al 2016 the performance of wrf lake is highly sensitive to key model parameters notably the eddy diffusivity light extinction coefficient temperature of maximum water density for brackish water simulations and surface roughness lengths of lake surface huang et al 2019 these parameters are lake specific and simplified in wrf lake such simplification may be sufficient for global scale analysis in which the uncertainties for specific lakes of a single model can either be filtered directly or compensated by ensemble simulations to reveal large scale patterns but for regional scale simulations the model parameters related to lake characteristics have to be carefully tuned to achieve the required accuracy gu et al 2015 suggested that although lswt in relatively shallow lakes e g lake erie can be well captured the vertical heat transfer process predicted by wrf lake is underestimated for deep lakes e g lake superior and leads to large biases in lswt previous parameter sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the deficiency of wrf lake can be improved by enlarging the eddy diffusivity by a factor of 102 105 which has been proven to be effective in simulating the thermal structure of lake nam co huang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 however another study at the laurentian great lakes found that the parameterization scheme presented by gu et al 2015 only exerted a limited influence on lake michigan 147 5 m at the mooring site xiao et al 2016 a recent study based on the offline version of wrf lake in the deep reservoir nuozhadu utilized a more elaborate calibration for eddy diffusivity in which an enhanced term was added and enlarged for deep layers wang et al 2019 therefore it is evident that the influence and uncertainty of eddy diffusivity on simulating thermal structures in deep lakes are quite diverse yet unclear which requires proper calibration in different lakes moreover the light extinction coefficient can substantially alter the thermal structure of lakes by regulating the vertical heat transfer process read and rose 2013 rose et al 2016 for example larger light extinction coefficients will lead to more absorbed shortwave radiation resulting in thicker mixed layers wang et al 2019 reducing light extinction coefficients in clearwater lakes may deepen the thermocline and generate a warmer mixed layer wu et al 2020 previous studies on modifying the light extinction coefficient were primarily based on empirical estimations that neglected the seasonal fluctuation of lake water clarity caused by phytoplankton growth shatwell et al 2016 lake qiandaohu is located in the hilly areas of zhejiang province in eastern china it has a complex morphology and remains thermally stratified throughout the year lake qiandaohu is a warm monomictic lake and experiences short term mixing in winter or spring zhang et al 2014 thermal stratification in lake qiandaohu usually begins in march and becomes the most intense in august and lasts until december with a temperature difference between the surface and bottom ranging from 5 c to 20 c liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 although the phenology of its stratification has been well documented the influencing mechanisms and evolution of lake physical characteristics e g the water clarity and mixing process are not clear proper parameterization in simulating the stratification in lake qiandaohu as a representative of deep and warm monomictic lakes would help to understand the evolution of the lake thermal structure this study aims to 1 improve the fundamental understanding of the thermal structure of lake qiandaohu 2 address the influencing mechanism of key model parameters and 3 provide references for wrf lake application in deep lakes to achieve these goals six sensitivity experiments were conducted in lake qiandaohu in 2016 this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the wrf lake model configuration and numerical experiments and simulation results are presented in section 3 and interpreted in section 4 the major findings of this study are presented in section 5 2 numerical modeling and simulation 2 1 site

drinking water source with a basin area of 10480 km2 and a water volume of 178 4 108 m3 when the normal water storage water level is 108 m zhang et al 2014 it has a water surface area of 580 km2 with a length and width of 150 km and 50 km respectively at its widest point zhang et al 2014 lake qiandaohu is morphologically complex and contains five sub basins the deepest of which is 105 m although the average depth of the lake is only 30 m zhang et al 2014 2 2 wrf model configurations the weather research and forecasting model version 4 0 hereafter referred to as wrf https www2 mmm ucar edu wrf

5 km and 1 km centered on lake qiandaohu fig 1 with 33 levels in the vertical direction the selection of horizontal spacing considers both the computational efficiency and complex shape of lake

temperature humidity and horizontal wind fields above the planetary boundary layer of the outer domain were nudged to the era5 reanalysis by employing analysis nudging stauffer and seaman 1994 2 3 simulating lake processes using wrf lake 2 3 1 lake scheme of wrf lake the lake scheme of wrf lake was derived from clm 3 5 which was embedded into the wrf model gu et al 2015 wrf lake is a 1d advection diffusion lake model that discretizes the water column vertically into 0 5 snow layers 10 water ice layers and 10 soil layers the layer thickness of the first water ice layer is always set to 10 cm and the other layer thickness is adjusted with fixed proportion taking the location of the daba buoy as an example 93 m the layer depths m for the ten water ice layers are listed as follows 0 05 4 75 14 05 23 35 32 65 41 95 51 25 60 55 69 85 79 15 the layer thickness is 0 1 m for the first layer and 9 3 m for the rest we also performed numerical experiments using a 25 layer discretization scheme as a grid independence check see supporting information 2 we found that although the 25 layer scheme generated smoother vertical water temperature profiles the overall pattern of lake thermal structure was similar to that of the ten layer one variations in lake water level and area are not considered in wrf lake the exchange of heat moisture and momentum between the lake and overlying atmosphere is governed by the energy budget equation oleson et al 2004 as 1 β s g l g s h l h g 0 2 s g 1 α s w 3 l g ε σ t g 4 l w where β 0 4 is the fraction of the solar radiation absorbed at the

acceleration due to gravity and ρ i is the density of water kg m 3 2 3 2 eddy diffusivity calculation from in situ measurements the flux gradient method can be used to determine the eddy diffusivity k e from in situ temperature measurements by integrating eqn 4 from depth z to the lake bottom at depth d while assuming that the turbulent heat flux and net radiation at the lake bottom are equal to zero powell and jassby 1974 thus k e can be derived explicitly from the following expression 8 k e z z d t t d z 1 c w ϕ z t z k m where ϕ is calculated consistent with the procedure used in wrf lake eq 8 is valid only below the mixed layer where the heat transfer caused by convective mixing and horizontal advection can be neglected powell and jassby 1974 the 30 day averages of the lake water temperature and ϕ were used to estimate k e at the center of this time interval the 30 day averaging was used to smooth the profiles of k e to better illustrate its variation with depth and time central difference and forward difference approximations were used for the spatial and time derivatives with δ z 0 5 m and δ t 30 days respectively the trapezoidal rule was applied for approximating the integral with a 0 5 m subinterval negative values due to cooling of the water column or unstable water layers are excluded from the results 2 4 improvements to the wrf lake model 2 4 1 initial lake water temperature profile the default initial lake water temperature in the wrf lake was derived from the ground temperature t g as follows 9 t i t g i 1 t g z i 277 t g 50 z i 50 277 z i 50 where the layer i 1 denotes the top layer we note that eqn 8 was derived from the observed lake temperature profile of lake superior in the simulation results using the default lake scheme the initialization procedure generated a large surface bottom water temperature difference of 8 53 c which is substantially higher than the observed data 2 29 c overestimation of the initial lake water temperature gradients resulted in unrealistic cold biases for the lake bottom water temperature throughout the year for lakes that regularly experience complete turnover it can be assumed that the lake is fully mixed with a homogeneous temperature profile as the initial condition wu et al 2020 however lake qiandaohu is a monomictic lake with thermal stratification for most of the year and the temperature gradient shift caused by the default lake scheme or a uniform initial profile cannot be easily corrected during model integration perroud et al 2009 in this study a straightforward and generalized method was proposed to assign initial values for lake temperature wrf lake was modified to import lake water temperature profiles directly from external files and interpolate them onto the lake grid of the wrf model we first replaced the lake depths in wrf with the observed bathymetry data during the model initialization each water column at lake grids will be discretized into ten layers according to their lake depths then we linearly interpolated the temperature profile at daba to all grids to generate initial conditions for the entire simulation domain this procedure assumes that the water temperature in lake qiandaohu is horizontally homogenous the measurement depths at daba are also adequate for providing water temperature profiles for other lake grids the soil temperature was set equal to the lake water temperature of the bottom layer to ensure that the sediment heat flux was initially zero fig 2 a depicts the default initial lake water temperature profile in wrf lake observed values and modified initial lake water temperature profile at the daba station 0000 utc on 1st march 2016 2 4 2 time dependent light extinction coefficient the light extinction coefficient describes the rate at which the incident shortwave radiation is attenuated by lake water which determines the vertical distribution of solar radiation in the default wrf lake model the light extinction coefficient was calculated as a function of lake depth section 2 3 1 using in situ observations from 88 swedish lakes which cannot be generalized to global lakes subin et al 2012 the light extinction coefficient at the daba station for example varies between 0 3 and 0 6 throughout the year with the highest values in spring and summer however the default values in wrf lake remain constant and understated fig 2b therefore the in situ observed monthly light extinction coefficients of lake qiandaohu were taken as model inputs and disaggregated to daily resolution during the simulation period which accounted for the temporal variability of the light extinction coefficient 2 4 3 eddy diffusion coefficient the governing equation of the heat transfer in the wrf lake was controlled by molecular diffusion and eddy diffusion gu et al 2015 proved that the model performance for lake temperature was sensitive to eddy diffusion and could be improved by enlarging the eddy diffusivity k e for deep lakes the default lake model increased k e by a factor of 100 when the depth of the lake grid exceeded 15 m in this study the factor was enlarged to 104 and restricted the total heat diffusion coefficient k m k e with a maximum value of 0 01 m2 s to avoid unrealistic large diffusivity that may occur at the lake surface this criterion is the largest vertical heat diffusivity observed in the open seas as suggested by wang et al 2019 2 4 4 surface roughness lengths parameterization the surface roughness length of momentum sensible heat and latent heat for unfrozen lakes is defined as 0 001 m in the default wrf lake which can be considered excessive for lakes the method proposed by subin et al 2012 was adopted is this study it calculates the surface roughness lengths based on the friction velocity fetch and wind speed as follows 11 z 0 m m a x 0 1 v u α u 2 g 10 5 m z 0 h z 0 m e x p κ p r 4 r 0 3 2 10 5 m z 0 q z 0 m e x p κ s c 4 r 0 4 2 10 5 m where v is the kinematic viscosity of air m2 s u is the friction velocity m s α is the effective charnock coefficient given below r 0 m a x z 0 m u v 0 1 is the near surface atmospheric roughness reynolds number p r 0 71 is the molecular prandt number for air and s c 0 66 is the molecular schmidt number for water in the air the charnock coefficient is defined as follows 11 α α min α max α min e x p m i n a b a fg u 2 1 3 f c b dg u where α min 0 01 α max 0 11 f is the lake fetch m and f c was set to 22 which corresponds to the use of u instead of u when calculating a wang et al 2019 1 the fixed point iteration method proposed by wang et al 2019 was also used to update surface roughness lengths and u simultaneously 2 5 datasets 2 5 1 reanalysis datasets the initial and boundary conditions of the wrf model were provided by the 6 hourly era5 reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 data with 1 spatial resolution this is the latest fifth generation of atmospheric reanalysis dataset produced by the european center for medium range weather forecasts and has been applied widely in lake research https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets reanalysis datasets era5 the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd is a gridded near surface meteorological dataset with a 0 1 spatial resolution and a three hour temporal resolution https data tpdc ac cn en data 8028b944 daaa 4511 8769 965612652c49 it is developed by combining remote sensing data reanalysis datasets and in situ measurements he et al 2020 yang et al 2010 it has been widely used in other lake modeling studies in china wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 downward shortwave radiation and longwave radiation from this dataset were used as references to check the performance of the wrf model since the chun an weather station does not observe radiation components cmfd has been used as a representative of observation for assessing other forcing data qi et al 2022 its shortwave radiation has also been proven to be reliable for china yang et al 2017 despite that some studies in lake namco have found inconsistencies between cmfd and in situ observations huang et al 2019 shi et al 2022 wu et al 2021 to reduce the uncertainties caused by single forcing data we also included the era5 reanalysis as a reference when validating the simulated longwave and shortwave radiations 2 5 2 meteorological observation daily observations of meteorological variables including 2 m temperature 10 m wind speed and precipitation at the chun an weather station 29 62 n 119 02 e during 2016 were applied to evaluate the performance of the wrf model in simulating near surface variables data were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn 2 5 3 lake water temperature observation in lake qiandaohu in situ lake water temperature measurements at the daba buoy station in 2016 29 51 n 119 21 e hereafter referred to as daba are used to calibrate model parameters the water temperature was recorded every three hours by a multiparameter water column profiler attached to a buoy vertical depths 0 005 and water temperature 0 002 were sampled at 0 5 m intervals between 0 1 and 10 m and 2 m depth increments were used below 10 m liu et al 2019 this sampling location had a maximum depth of 93 m but the records only reached 65 m because the water temperature is vertically homogenous down below liu et al 2019 for the convenience of cross comparison the water temperature from both in situ observations and numerical experiments was interpolated to 0 5 m intervals from 0 5 to 64 m 2 5 4 light extinction coefficient measurements light extinction coefficients η m 1 were obtained from monthly sampling of water transparency z secchi m measured by the secchi disk method in this study light attenuation was calculated using the relationship η 1 3809 z secchi 0 92 which was estimated from a series of concurrent observations of z secchi and light absorption fig s5 2 6 metrics of stratification and mixing the lake analyzer https gleon org research projects lake analyzer is a numerical code package for calculating the key metrics of lake physical states from water temperature lake bathymetry and near surface wind speed read et al 2011 three indicators were selected to represent the lake thermal structure characteristics during stratification the thermocline depth thermd thickness of the metalimnion metath and bottom depth of the metalimnion metab thermd was defined as the depth of the maximum change in water density the metalimnion range is defined as the water layer where the vertical temperature gradient is 0 2 c m 1 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 schmidt stability which denotes the resistance of mechanical mixing because of potential energy was also calculated to represent the temporal variation of lake thermal stability schmidt 1928 the lake number and wedderburn number were calculated to describe the dynamic stability the two dimensionless metrics are expressed as the balance of wind stress and the stratified condition lake number represents the potential for nonlinear internal waves caused by wind forcing imberger and patterson 1989 meanwhile the wedderburn number represents the possibility of upward movement in the metalimnion thompson 1980 lower lake number and wedderburn number values indicate a higher likelihood of mixing events read et al 2011 2 7 experimental design and post processing six numerical experiments were conducted to assess the impact of key parameters that individually affect the lake thermal structure and evaluate performance of the modified wrf lake model as shown in the table below since lake temperature measurements below 30 m were not available from january to february 2016 all simulations ran from march 1 2016 to january 1 2017 and the first 20 days were discarded as model spin up in this study the mean bias error mbe was used to represent systematic error of the lake model this metric provides the average bias of a model in comparison to observations and indicates whether the model needs to be corrected the root mean square error rmse was used to assess the credibility of the model this is the standard deviation of the predicted errors and is highly sensitive to the most significant errors 3 results in this section the results from the wrf lake simulations are first validated using in situ observations and other available datasets after the sensitivity experiments the lake water temperature and the sensible and latent heat fluxes are further analyzed to determine the effects of key model parameters on the lake surface energy balance and thermal structure 3 1 model validation 3 1 1 comparison of meteorological variables the simulated near surface air temperature and wind speed from the control experiment were compared with those obtained from meteorological observations since radiation measurements from nearby weather stations were unavailable the cmfd dataset was used as a reference to assess the accuracy of downward shortwave and longwave radiation which act as the primary energy sources for the lake the wrf model accurately reproduced daily variations of 2 m air temperature downward longwave radiation and 2 m relative humidity as well as the seasonal pattern of downward shortwave radiation and 10 m wind speed fig 3 the comparison of simulated spatial pattern between ctl and reanalysis dataset were shown in figs s13 s14 as shown in fig 3 and table 2 the temporal variations in air temperature and downward longwave radiation were captured well by the wrf with an mbe of 0 4 c 0 6 13 9 w m 2 the comparison between wrf and era5 cmfd and a rmse of 1 3 c 9 3 20 4 w m 2 the wrf model underestimated relative humidity by an mbe of 1 5 this is possibly related to the warm biases in air temperature which results in larger saturated water vapor pressure the wrf model was also able to simulate reasonably the daily variation in wind speed although there is a large positive bias with an annual mbe of 2 7 m s 1 and an rmse of 3 0 m s 1 this indicates a systematic overprediction of wind speed and the degree of which amplified at higher velocities the simulated downward shortwave radiation was also overestimated with a mean mbe of 82 0 84 7 w m 2 detailed investigations of the overprediction of wind speed and shortwave radiation are not within the scope of this study however their effects on lake thermal structures are further discussed in section 4 1 3 1 2 comparison of lake surface energy processes lswt is determined by heat exchange processes at the air water interface namely absorbed radiation heat conduction and heat loss by evaporation edinger et al 1968 since the net shortwave radiation and downward longwave radiation are subjected to atmospheric conditions this section analyzes the lswt and turbulent fluxes to determine effects of the model parameters on the lake surface energy processes the emitted longwave radiation is not included because it is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature the first term on the right hand side of eqn 3 thus it varies naturally with lswt lswt in this study is the average water temperature between 0 and 2 m the simulated data at 0400 utc 12 00 in local time each day were chosen for a stable and intense thermal stratification liu et al 2019 the wrf lake results were interpolated to the location of daba buoy to compare with the observations results of simulated lswt sensible and latent heat are shown in fig 4 and fig s6 the comparison of simulated spatial pattern between ctl and other experiments of lake water temperature at the top model layer was shown in fig s15 compared with in situ data ctl successfully reproduced the seasonal variation of water temperature fig 4a but significantly underestimated lswt from september to december this results in an annual mbe of 1 3 c which indicates a systematic cold bias in addition ctl simulated excessive variation in lswt particularly during the warming period march june with an average of 1 7 c it is still comparable to the daily variation in air temperature 1 7 c but considerably higher than the observed daily variation in water temperature 0 5 c ctl generated a reasonable temporal pattern of turbulent heat fluxes at the lake surface fig 4b shows that the latent heat flux exhibited an increasing trend before september and reached its peak in autumn because of the lag between the lswt and air temperature schmid and read 2021 this is consistent with the enhanced sensible heat flux since august fig 4c and implies that the lake surface is warmer than the overlying atmosphere and serves as a heat source fig 4b and c also highlight the dominant contribution of evaporation to turbulent heat fluxes as is expected in low latitude lakes such as lake qiandaohu woolway et al 2018 as indicated by the rmse and mbe fig 5 all five parameter sensitivity experiments improved the accuracy of lswt except ini which exacerbated the cold biases results with increased light extinction coefficient warmed the water surface during most of the simulation period 93 4 consequently yielding a 0 4 c increase in annual mbe the ini experiment corrected the overestimation of lswt at the beginning of the simulation the difference between ini and ctl diminished until november when ini began to display a negative bias against ctl and eventually resulted in a decrease in annual mbe of 0 1 c the only experiment with a positive mbe of 0 1 c against observation was z0mg this matched the minimum latent heat flux generated by z0mg in the five sensitivity experiments fig 4b despite an increase of 1 1 w m 2 in the annual average sensible heat flux of z0mg the latent heat flux decreased by 14 0 w m 2 because of less effective moisture exchange at the air water interface and dominated changes in lswt enlarging the eddy diffusivity in the deep layers mitigated the cold bias of the lswt from october to december which was analogous to z0mg however for the other months of the year ke estimated colder lswt than ctl after the calibrations the mod experiment achieved a minimum mbe of 0 1 c and lowered the rmse from 2 9 c to 1 6 c the remaining cold bias was partially because of the positive bias in the near surface wind speed introduced by the wrf model fig 3b windier conditions promote stronger mixing events in the epilimnion and favor turbulent heat loss especially latent heat at the air water interface thereby resulting in a cooling effect on lswt woolway et al 2018 3 2 simulating stratification in lake qiandaohu results of the ctl experiment showed that the original lake scheme could represent the temporal evolution of lake stratification lake thermal stratification began in march and strengthened rapidly in april with the temperature difference between the surface and bottom of the lake hereafter denoted as tdiff exceeding 5 c on april 2 further lake stratification was found to be strongest during summer when the temperature difference reached 23 4 c on july 26 fig 6 a ctl captured this feature relatively well with the maximum temperature difference occurring on july 25 fig 6b however ctl predicted an earlier spring warm up and autumn cool down the hypolimnion temperature was severely underestimated which results in an unrealistic vertical temperature gradient in the deep layers this also caused the maximum tdiff of the ctl experiment to be 6 c higher than that observed moreover the default lake scheme generated weaker lake stratification which is indicated by the negative annual mbe of the thickness of the metalimnion in the ini experiment fig 10 it is noteworthy that the positive systematic error of the metalimnion bottom depth and metalimnion thickness in ctl was attributable to overestimation of the initial hypolimnion temperatures as shown in fig 6 the lake temperature simulated by kd and z0mg were very close to that of ctl although the hypolimnion temperature in the ini experiment was more accurate it simulated a metalimnion structure that was very similar to that of ctl which was greatly improved in the ke experiment these results confirm that the vertical heat distribution is primarily governed by the mixing process subin et al 2012 modifying surface properties of the lake such as surface roughness lengths and light extinction coefficient has limited effects on the vertical temperature pattern xiao et al 2016 fig 7 and fig s10 showed the differences in the temperature simulated from all the sensitivity experiments against ctl and the observations respectively the comparison of vertical water temperature profile was depicted in fig s11 it can be first noted that the kd and z0mg were both close to ctl and showed an overall warming trend in the whole water column ini and ke showed the largest deviation from ctl an increase in the light extinction coefficient resulted in a warming of the lake surface in early summer as well as a water temperature of approximately 15 m during stratification leading to a temperature increase of 2 0 c negative values only occurred at the lake surface for a few days possibly because of the increased latent heat flux fig 4c the ini experiment removed cold bias below 25 m however it tends to produce a warmer lswt from june to october and a colder metalimnion throughout the year deteriorating the model performance at 9 11 and 19 21 m fig 5 when a parameterization for surface roughness lengths was used the water column temperature increased by an average of 0 6 c above 25 m the most pronounced improvements occur at 1 15 m in winter which largely delayed the earlier prediction of the autumn cool down although an even earlier warm up was estimated fig 6e enlarging the eddy diffusivity decreased the water temperature above 5 m before september and increased the water temperature below it thereby implying that more heat energy was transferred to the deep layers by enhancing the mixing strength warmer deep layers allow more energy to be stored below the mixed layer where the air water heat exchange takes place this further enhances the resistance of the lake to declining air temperature which is indicated by the warmer water column in winter these results suggested that in addition to dominating the development of the metalimnion the mixing strength in the lake model influences the thermal structure during the subsequent cool down period we have also performed a numerical experiment with only the modified initial water temperature profile and eddy diffusivity fig s16 and table s3 the results produced a similar thermal structure with mod but the water temperatures above 25 m were colder and showed larger biases this suggests that the initial water temperature profile and eddy diffusivity were most critical for simulating the evolution of the lake thermal structure at the same time modifying light extinction coefficients and surface roughness lengths which mainly increased water temperature in shallow layers are important as well the performance of the mod experiment in simulating water temperature at certain depths is shown in fig 8 fig 8b d denotes the water temperature at a depth of 9 11 m above the thermocline 19 21 m below the thermocline and 39 41 m hypolimnion respectively in summary accuracy of the lake scheme was greatly improved by modifying the aforementioned key model parameters namely the initial lake water temperature light extinction coefficient eddy diffusion coefficient and surface roughness lengths the mod experiment captured the seasonal variation and magnitudes of water temperature and reproduced the extended highest water temperature at 19 21 m compared to that at the surface nevertheless the differences between the mod and in situ measurements became apparent as the depth increased overestimation of water temperature at 9 11 m from june to august and underestimation in 19 21 m suggests insufficient heat transfer below the thermocline the mod experiment also failed to reproduce the slow warm up of the hypolimnion temperatures thereby implying unresolved mixing processes in the deep layers the temporal variations in the four modelled lake stability indicators calculated by lake analyzer were consistent with those calculated from the observations fig 9 schmidt stability varies coherently with lswt as it only depends on the water density fig 9a the rising schmidt stability before september suggested that the kinetic energy required to disturb lake stratification increased thermal stability weakened during the cooling period but still exceeded 1000 j m 2 in winter which is reasonable for a deep and warm monomictic lake the magnitude of the schmidt stability in the mod experiment was consistent with that of the observations which was attributed to a better representation of the vertical heat content fig 9b shows that the thermocline depth changed rapidly in spring and gradually deepened with a strengthening of summer stratification during the cool down period the upper water column was fully mixed and the thermocline depth was maintained near the bottom of the metalimnion the mod and ctl experiments both captured the sudden increase in thermocline depth in autumn but failed to reproduce the steady growth behavior before that the overestimation of wind speed and hypolimnetic water density resulted in lower lake numbers in the numerical experiments fig 9c the lake number from the observations increased with schmidt stability and the bottom layer depth of the metalimnion from april to july and then slowly decreased for most of the year the lake number from the observations remained above 10 which implies that wind forcing could only stir the uppermost layer of the lake and was incapable of diapycnal mixing macintyre et al 1999 similar to the lake number the wedderburn numbers in the simulations were also underestimated owing to an overestimation of wind speed fig 9d variations in the wedderburn number were primarily determined by changes in the mixed layer depth in the ctl experiment the mixed layer depth remained stable until november which caused a downward trend in the wedderburn number from august to october owing to the reduced density difference between the epilimnion and hypolimnion however the wedderburn number increased with the mixed layer depth since september in the mod experiment and observations the wedderburn number calculated from observations seldom fell below one which suggests a low likelihood of upwelling events fig 10 demonstrates the accuracy of the simulated thermal stratification by the annual mbe and rmse of the thermal characteristics in the numerical experiments against observations the mod experiment improved the model performance in estimating metath and metab and reduced the mbe to 2 2 m and 1 7 m respectively the remaining negative biases may be attributed to the weaker mixing strength below the thermocline fig 8c d the thermd estimated by the tuned model has an mbe of 1 0 m and an rmse of 8 8 m which is significantly better than that in large scale simulations with uncalibrated models guo et al 2021 the mod experiment also improved the performance of the model in simulating the strength of summer stratification the tdiff estimated by the mod was 23 7 c occurred on july 25 with 0 2 c higher than that in observations and one day ahead 3 3 calculation and analyses of eddy diffusivity k e was computed from the observed water temperature using the approach described in section 2 3 2 to quantitively evaluate the limitation of the henderson sellers eddy diffusivity it is noteworthy that k e produced by eqn 14 is a proxy for all three dimensional processes that contribute to turbulence in lake qiandaohu therefore a similar variation pattern and magnitude of the tuned k e were expected for accurate simulation of the thermal structure fig 11 depicts k e computed from the observations k eobs and the enlarged k e in the mod experiment k emod the profiles of k emod at different seasons were very similar the k emod first decreased markedly with increasing depth and reached its minimum in the 20 50 m depth range because of increasing vertical temperature gradients notably the water temperature at deep layers was almost homogeneous in the vertical direction fig 6g fig s11 and the r i in eq 5 decreased from 102 to zero fig s12 and therefore resulted in large k emod comparable to that in shallow layers this behavior suggests that wrf lake is also unable to simulate the vertical heat distribution in the hypolimnion not only its temporal variation fig 8d which is possibly related to the unresolved heat diffusion in the hypolimnion see discussion in section 4 2 3 it is evident that the profiles of k eobs varied significantly with time and depth the k eobs values ranged from 1 3 10 8 to 3 0 10 4 m2 s with an average of 4 0 10 5 m2 s this result is consistent with previous findings in lake zurich another large and deep lake li 1973 the highest k eobs occurred in early summer march june caused by the warming of the water column and the relatively weak vertical temperature gradient after the stabilization of stratification in summer the k eobs rapidly declined because of the strong temperature gradient in august the k eobs was negative at almost every depth except 7 12 5 m where the warming trend lasted until september this phenomenon is in line with the observed lagged maximum temperature in 9 11 m compared to that in 0 2 m from observations fig 8a b the profiles of k eobs in early summer showed a local minimum of k eobs at approximately around 2 5 m which corresponds to the depth of thermocline the k eobs further increased and formed a maximum at approximately 20 m below 20 m the behavior of k eobs varied largely with depth in different seasons in march and april k eobs gradually decreases with depth from top to bottom in the remaining months however the k eobs formed a local minimum at 30 40 m which is possibly related to the warm up of water temperature at 39 41 m fig 8d the minimums of the k eobs profile matched the two gradient extremes in water temperature profile fig s7 4 discussion this study aimed to simulate the temporal evolution of thermal stratification in a subtropical deep reservoir lake qiandaohu using an improved wrf lake model the results show that the improved model with the necessary parameterization can capture variations in water temperature and intensity of lake stratification 4 1 model uncertainty in a coupled system the foremost concern is the error introduced by the atmospheric model in this case wrf for simulating physical processes in the lake the 10 m wind speed and downward shortwave radiation were largely overestimated by the model the near surface wind speed of the era5 reanalysis which provided initial and boundary conditions showed a magnitude comparable to the observations fig s8 this overprediction may be related to deficiencies in the wrf model wrf is deficient in representing the drag effect because of subgrid scale orography and tends to underestimate wind speed spatial variability over complex terrain jiménez and dudhia 2012 thus wrf overpredicts wind speed in valleys where lake qiandaohu is located fig 1b positive error of the downward shortwave radiation simulated by the wrf model is consistent with previous studies that evaluated the performance of atmospheric models in representing surface energy fluxes for example the wrf model overestimated shortwave radiation with an average mbe of 152 9 w m 2 compared to those of the hourly observations in the heihe river basin pan and li 2011 the biases of simulated surface insolation is caused by an inaccurate representation of the radiation transfer process between the top of the atmosphere and ground wild 2005 this suggests that misrepresentations of cloud properties rather than radiation schemes are responsible for these biases jousse et al 2016 studies at regional scales have also suggested that an overestimation of the downward shortwave radiation by wrf may be attributable to the lack of cumulus cloud amount and uncertainty in aerosol optical depth avolio et al 2017 kumar et al 2015 ruiz arias et al 2016 in the lake scheme wind speed was used to calculate the friction velocity which further influenced the simulated water temperature from two perspectives first the sensible and latent fluxes from eqn 1 are estimated using the bulk aerodynamic algorithm proposed by zeng et al 1998 where the surface fluxes of heat and water vapor are proportional to the friction velocity second the 2 m wind speed in eqn 5 also varies with the friction velocity therefore a higher wind speed promotes the efficiency of heat and water vapor exchange at the lake surface and enhances mixing strength in the subsurface woolway et al 2021 schmid et al 2014 investigated sensitivity of the lake surface equilibrium temperature to climate forcing variables according to these findings overestimation of the average annual 10 m wind speed by 2 7 m s 1 table 2 will lead to a decrease in lswt by 2 7 c however lswt will simultaneously increase by 2 5 4 9 c because of positive biases in solar radiation therefore the effects of overestimated wind speed and downward shortwave radiation on lswt may partially compensate for each other the remaining cold bias in lswt is presumably because of the favored turbulent heat loss especially latent heat under windy conditions woolway et al 2018 notably the enhancement of mixing strength by increased wind speed remains in the modified model and might be amplified as the eddy diffusivity is increased however extremes in eddy diffusivity was constrained with a fixed value thus it is reasonable to speculate that the influence of high wind speed on the formation of lake thermal stratification was limited moreover our sensitivity analysis using offline wrf lake model see supporting information 1 suggested that the effect of strong winds is most distinct during autumn in which the water temperature above 30 m increased possibly due to deeper mixed layer depth and larger amounts of water participated in the lake air heat exchange the enhanced solar radiation increased the water temperature above 20 m fig s2 which might increase the strength of lake stratification the changes in lake surface temperature may also influence the condition of the overlying atmosphere generally lakes could mitigate the regional climate by decreasing the annual range of air temperature and increasing nearby precipitations dai et al 2018b wen and lyu 2014 therefore we compared the temporal variations of simulated near surface air temperature and daily precipitation in the ctl and mod experiment as shown in fig s9 it can be noted first that the mod experiment has similar seasonal patterns to that of ctl the warmer lake surface in the mod experiment heated the overlying atmosphere this alleviated the underestimation of summer air temperature in ctl but also amplified the overestimation of winter air temperature the occurrences of rainfall events are consistent in these two experiments simulated precipitation in spring is underestimated in both experiments the most distinct difference existed in may and june in which the magnitude of precipitation in mod was even less this suggests that the volume of lake qiandaohu is not large enough to impact atmospheric circulations therefore the improved lake scheme may slightly influence the magnitude of atmospheric variables but cannot change its overall pattern the effects could be either improvement or deterioration depending on the original biases of wrf 4 2 parameter sensitivity 4 2 1 time dependent light extinction coefficient it has been described that darker surface waters tend to form shallower mixed layers owing to the less deeply penetrated radiation this results in more turbulent heat loss at the lake surface and larger variation in the epilimnion temperature heiskanen et al 2015 zolfaghari et al 2017 the results from guseva et al 2020 suggested that different 1d lake models respond similarly to changes in water clarity and that the thermocline depth increases in clear waters however the simulation results showed a slight increase in the thermocline depth when larger light extinction coefficients were used which is indicated by the reduced negative biases in kd compared with those in ctl fig 10a although the direct influence of penetrated radiation is restricted in shallow layers it seems that this heating effect has extended down to approximately 15 m since june fig 7a this could possibly contribute to a deepening of the thermocline the results also showed that a larger light extinction coefficient generated a thicker metalimnion which corresponds to the linear relationship deduced from in situ water temperature measurements in lake qiandaohu where a negative correlation between metalimnion thickness and water transparency was found zhang et al 2014 therefore it can be tentatively concluded that the response of lake stratification to changes in water clarity may differ in lakes with different depths and thermal regimes it is difficult to determine the influence of light attenuation on lake stratification because research on this parameter at regional or global scales is still lacking this literature deficiency may be attributed to insufficient high frequency measurements of water clarity and water temperature satellite derived series of water transparency combined with lake models may shed more light on this issue 4 2 2 initial lake water temperature in monomictic lakes sensitivity experiment of the calibrated initial lake temperature profile showed that this modification is crucial for generating realistic hypolimnion temperatures even though the influence of changes in the initial lake temperature profile on lswt did not last for more than one month this is unsurprising given that lswt is driven by the surface energy balance and its variation can be captured by lake models even in the absence of a reasonable subsurface temperature stepanenko et al 2013 monomictic lakes do not experience complete overturn in winter and thus cannot reset the deep water temperature like dicmictic lakes therefore the underestimation of the hypolimnion temperature in monomictic lakes induced by initial conditions implies insufficient heat storage and could eventually lead to shifts in thermal dynamic processes during long term simulations perroud et al 2009 4 2 3 simulating heat transfer in 1d lake models the eddy diffusivity parameterization based on henderson sellers 1985 struggles to simulate the mixing strength in deep lakes perroud et al 2009 stepanenko et al 2010 thiery et al 2014b despite that this type of model has been used widely in lake simulations because of its flexibility which allows it to produce acceptable results without considerable modification martynov et al 2010 our results confirmed that the tuned model can simulate seasonal variation of the lake thermal structure with reasonable error during summer suggesting that this model can be further applied to simulations in which the interannual variations of the lake thermal regime matter it is believed that the 1d mixing processes can be theoretically tuned to imitate the behavior of that in a real lake based on available empirical formulas but the limitation of original eddy diffusivity could not be completely solved by enlarging or shrinking it which is a common approach bennington et al 2014 wu et al 2020 xiao et al 2016 the results suggest that tuning eddy diffusivity affects only the thermal structure in the epilimnion and upper metalimnion as this coefficient decreases exponentially with depth and levels off below the thermocline with a magnitude far less than the molecular diffusivity this implies little or no turbulence in the modeled deep layer which is not the case in reality the vertical structure of the henderson sellers eddy diffusivity raises two questions first the heat diffusion between the thermocline and hypolimnion is lacking in the modeled lake therefore the water temperature in the lower metalimnion could not be well reproduced it is apparent that the k eobs concaved at depths with large gradients and decreased mildly with increasing depth in contrast the k esim dropped sharply and became less than the molecular diffusivity between 15 and 40 m thus although lake qiandaohu formed two zones with steep temperature gradients it is believed that this conclusion is tenable in other deep lakes moreover albm and mtcr 1 which both uses henderson sellers diffusivity also failed to reproduce the temporal and depth variability of vertical eddy diffusivity in a temperate dimictic lake guseva et al 2020 although the models generated satisfactory thermal structure therefore it is reasonable to infer that this issue not only existed in wrf lake but also in all advective diffusive models based on the same parameterization method the next problem is unresolved heat diffusion in the hypolimnion for example internal seiches generated from hypolimnetic currents that transfer wind energy from the lake surface to turbulence at the bottom imberger 1998 this deficiency exists in selected 1d lake models that do not consider internal waves even the more sophisticated k ε model can only calculate the turbulence above the thermocline perroud et al 2009 and thus the extra parameterization for turbulences in deep layers is required it has been found that the vertical diffusivity of heat in stratified layers of many lakes can be described as k b n 2 m where m and b are constants related to lake properties jassby and powell 1975 therefore some models such as the probe model svensson 1978 the lake component in clm 4 5 and an offline version of the wrf lake model wang et al 2019 adopted this expression to mimic the unresolved mixing process in factual lakes it is noteworthy that the weight of this additional term must be cautiously selected for a specific lake throughout the testing process this added term was required for certain depths to better simulate the deepening of the metalimnion in the spring and early summer however during the decay of summer stratification this term must be turned off or decreased to prevent over mixing in the water column zhang et al 2019 also found that the lake module in clm 4 5 failed to reproduce the transition between stratification and overturn because of this arbitrary attached term although it still worked well for some lakes wang et al 2019 overall it seems that the inclusion of an enhanced term such as that of other water mixing schemes and parameterization methods for major types of unresolved heat diffusion is a compromise between computational cost and more complicated three dimensional hydrodynamic models 5 conclusions in the current study the wrf lake model was improved to simulate the lake thermal regime over a monomictic deep lake qiandaohu by tuning four key model parameters i e the initial lake water temperature profiles light extinction coefficients eddy diffusion coefficients and the surface roughness lengths we found that 1 the modified 1d lake model wrf lake simulated thermal structure of lake qiandaohu with satisfactory performance the mbe and rmse of lswt between simulation results and in situ observations were reduced from 1 3 c to 0 1 c and 2 9 c to 1 6 c respectively the evolution of lake stratification was well captured which is indicated by three metrics for example the mbe of the thermocline depth decreased from 13 0 m to 1 7 m 2 the wrf model overpredicted the near surface wind speed and downward shortwave radiation on the ground by an mbe of 2 7 m s 1 and 82 0 w m 2 respectively the impacts of high wind speed on simulating lswt are in contrast to those of enhanced shortwave radiation but cannot be completely offset the tuned maximum value of eddy diffusivity limited the effects of wind speed on mixing strength in the subsurface water layers 3 the initial lake water temperature determined the magnitude of the water temperature in the hypolimnion which seldom experiences the water air heat exchange caused by in complete mixing events in deep lakes the light extinction coefficients and surface roughness lengths have the greatest impact on lswt by governing the penetration of shortwave radiation in water layers and the exchange efficiency of heat and water vapor at the lake surface however they still slightly improve the model performance in simulating subsurface water temperature modifications of the eddy diffusivity improved the model performance in simulating the strength of stratification 4 the schmidt stability of lake qiandaohu varied with lswt and was well simulated by the modified wrf lake model development of the thermocline from june to october is difficult to reproduce the modified wrf lake reduced the annual mbe of the thermocline depth from 5 8 m to 1 0 m the temporal variation of lake number and wedderburn number derived from the simulation results agreed with those of the observations although the magnitude showed negative biases the large values of schmidt stability and low values of lake number and wedderburn number demonstrate that lake qiandaohu was strongly thermally stratified throughout the year and the wind driven internal waves in deep water and mixing were weak thus our results demonstrated that the modified wrf lake model could simulate lswt and evolution of lake stratification with the lowest mbe and rmse which contributes to improvements in simulating lake thermal dynamics although geomorphology and optical characteristics differ between lakes the revised version of wrf lake can be generalized to other study sites after minor modifications finally more lake water temperature measurements are required to improve the representativeness of the mixing process parameterization scheme

2196,the economic literature has extensively researched water markets finding that this instrument can deliver superior resource allocations under growing scarcity however these assessments typically ignore the information bargaining and enforcement costs that occur in trades known as transaction costs which can be particularly relevant in emerging markets such as those for water this paper presents a multi agent cellular automata model that couples a positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup model with an agent based model abm to elicit the information transaction costs of water trading under alternative market and climate scenarios a first experiment evaluates an ideal water market with no transaction costs which is then compared to alternative decentralized spot market setups representing different degrees of information availability that are modeled using the coupled pmaup abm the difference between the economic surplus under the ideal market and that achieved under alternative market setups with information constraints is used as a proxy value of information transaction costs methods are illustrated with an application to the douro river basin in central spain results show that information transaction costs can reduce the economic surplus between 0 6 and 45 depending on the scenario keywords mathematical programming model mpm agent based model abm water markets transaction costs socio hydrology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction farming accounts for approximately 70 of water withdrawals in the world today while often constituting the marginal i e least productive uses of freshwater resources fao 2021 in a context of growing scarcity water markets can support the reallocation of water towards agricultural uses with higher added value hence offering an opportunity to enhance economic growth and social welfare without increasing demand damania et al 2017 agricultural and behavioral economics research has developed increasingly sophisticated empirical models to elicit agent s preferences and reveal market equilibria through demand supply interaction including programming models graveline 2016 econometrics zuo et al 2015 data envelopment analysis frija et al 2011 hedonic pricing faux and perry 1999 and contingent valuation storm et al 2011 of which the former is the most commonly used approach most of these models suggest a promising performance of water markets which are expected to significantly increase the efficiency in water resources use wheeler 2021 yet despite relevant methodological and empirical advances in the application of behavioral economics methods and techniques the assumption of zero transaction costs tcs remains a major limitation in achieving realistic estimates of the economic performance of water markets tcs can be broadly defined as the costs of arranging a contract ex ante and then monitoring and enforcing it ex post as opposed to the more conventional reallocation costs which are the costs of executing the contract i e the foregone income or the monetized utility loss of the seller matthews 1986 broadly speaking we can divide tcs into two macro categories private and institutional tcs private tcs are the ones concerning the traders while the institutional ones refer to the creation of the market institutional tcs can be considered a one time component deng et al 2018 and therefore independent from single transactions while the private tcs are directly connected to market exchanges loch et al 2018 define private tcs as the sum of the following elements i time invested in monitoring market activity and identifying buyers sellers or information tcs ii negotiation time iii monitoring and mitigating third party effects iv contracting or conveyance to secure the trade v possible dispute resolution and vi barriers to trade resulting from restrictions or quotas either of which may increase time spent checking the feasibility of trade opportunities tcs are usually evaluated ex post i e where markets are already implemented and tcs can be directly measured typically through surveys loch et al 2018 womble and hanemann 2020 yet ex ante evaluations with empirical models are more limited rare examples can be found in garrido 2000 and pujol et al 2005 who combine programming models with exploratory analysis i e hypothetical tcs scenarios to assess the impacts of tcs pujol et al 2005 use this approach to identify tipping points in water markets showing that economic performance rapidly decreases along with higher tcs until the market shuts down beyond tcs of 0 1 eur m3 italy and 0 075 eur m3 spain garrido 2000 evaluates market performance in spain under two hypothetical tcs 1 and 3 pesetas m3 showing that any transaction cost over 1 or 2 pesetas per exchanged cubic meter results in the shutdown of the market these results suggest that tcs can have nontrivial impacts on agents choices deviating observed market equilibria from those predicted under zero tcs ideals furthermore if tcs in water markets are larger than those of alternative water reallocation mechanisms the conventional economic wisdom that attributes water markets a superior economic performance may not hold pujol et al 2005 noteworthy a key feature of these studies is that they rely on hypothetical tcs scenarios here we explore another modeling option that employs revealed preferences techniques to quantify tcs them ex ante this paper proposes the coupling of a non linear positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup model that represents the motives and behavior of heterogenous irrigators with an abm agent based model that explicitly captures social and spatial interactions to model the performance of a decentralized water market under information asymmetries and constraints so as to ex ante quantify information tcs itcs the resulting coupled socio economic model called pam pmaup abm is forced using water availability and water allocation projections under climate change from the hydrologic decision support system dss model aquatool to ground market simulations on plausible water supply futures the modeling framework proposed in this paper falls in the category of muti agent cellular automata maca applied to land use cover land use change kremmydas et al 2018 maca are simulation models that couple a cellular component representing an environment space with human agents representing decision making berger 2001 to assess how social and spatial interactions among autonomous agents e g irrigators in an environment space e g the basin affect the macroscale e g market equilibria through the combination of the strong microeconomic foundations of pmaup and the capacity of abm to recreate the impacts of agents interactions on the macroscale the apam aquatool pam model can provide insights into how alternative socioenvironmental stimuli itcs scenarios hydrological shocks condition crop portfolio and water allocation choices of agents and lead to different market equilibria the apam model builds on the theory of revealed preferences samuelson 1938 which allows us to evaluate ex ante the itcs through the effect they have on farmers choices this paper contributes to the literature by proposing a methodology that can estimate the itcs of a decentralized spot water market in areas where markets are not yet common practice or not allowed the potential of the model is illustrated with an application in a part of the douro river basin central spain accordingly some aspects of the model are site specific particularly those referring to the hydrological modeling of the basin and the spanish regulatory context these aspects are discussed in detail respectively in section 2 and section 3 2 background and methodology 2 1 background a defining characteristic of maca models is their capacity to solve autonomous constrained optimization programming problems while exchanging variables between them through an endogenous communication process that captures the most relevant interactions between heterogeneous agents schreinemachers and berger 2011 one such critical interaction is information diffusion exchange e g on technological innovations or trading prices in a market which largely conditions tcs two seminal works mark the beginning of maca applied to land use cover land use change balmann s 1997 agripolis model and berger s 2001 multi agent system cellular automata mas ca approach in balmann s 1997 agripolis model agents aim to maximize household income by optimally allocating on farm resources and operating in the land market renting or releasing agricultural plots agents are spatially distributed with the location being the critical variable determining diffusion through transportation costs and social interactions berger 2001 develops a spatial multi agent linear pm that introduces technology diffusion constraints in the form of network threshold values that reflect the cumulative effects of experience and observation of peers experiences accordingly agents in the model decide whether to adopt the technology following a frequency dependent diffusion model in three steps i monitor adoption levels and compare it with the agent s threshold ii if adoption levels are equal or higher to the threshold obtain agent s expected income after the adoption iii if the expected income is positive adopt the technology based on the seminal work of balmann 1997 and berger 2001 a large research body has focused on the study of diffusion models in maca applied to land use cover land use change particularly for the analysis of information diffusion exchange in the context of land markets and technology adoption table 1 reviews the literature on land use cover land use change maca that i are data driven ii deal with the agriculture domain and iii use mathematical programming techniques optimization of objective function within a domain to explicitly represent and model microeconomic agents the uniqueness of such maca models lies in their capacity to combine the representation of social and spatial interactions with a strong foundation in microeconomics we find most models are sophisticated in the representation of farm exit and entry decisions as well as the representation of long term decisions and the consideration of farming styles or types using farm typologies considerably fewer attempts to model farmers emotions values learning risk and uncertainty or social interactions occur in the different case studies this could be done by coupling the abm model with a pmaup capable of eliciting farmers behavior to the best of our knowledge none of the previous maca models was used to estimate any component of the tcs emerging in water markets for agricultural users 2 2 the apam modeling framework fig 1 shows the coupling framework of the apam and describes the interactions between each of the model that composes it the modeling framework presented in this paper is a linear coupling of aquatool pmaup and abm this means that every model is independent i e it provides input data for the other model the apam model operates in four steps 1 aquatool model simulates the new water allocation for every agent and passes the information to the pmaup 2 the objective utility function for each agent is elicited using the pmaup model then the water supply demand function obtained and integrated into the abm 3 the agents decisions of whether or not to trade are now dictated by the marginal utility cost of water for potential buyers sellers or shadow price of water while 4 trading opportunities are conditioned by alternative information diffusion scenarios that are used as a proxy of the itcs this sequential optimization allows every model to be more specific and to add more rules that help represent some degree of realistic agent behavior erfani et al 2014 note that a recursive or bidirectional activation of the different modules is possible and it would be necessary in case not all the water allocated to agents was used or if the market structure allows trans basin water trading in this paper the agents consume trade all the water allotted to them and withdraw their water from the same water body therefore a recursive or bidirectional simulation was not used the three models interact with each other during every simulation specifically every year aquatool and pmaup models are used to set the initial amount of water provision for the agents and the corresponding wtp willingness to pay and wta willingness to accept are calculated for to every agent this information is reset at the beginning of each year of the simulation the simulation holds for 38 years then according to their behavior the agents trade their water five different behaviors explained in section 4 1 were programmed to simulate the market and elicit the itcs in the abm setup the farms and the agents the farmers are created and randomly distributed in the simulation environment netlogo world each simulation year consists of 40 time steps this allows for ample interactions in the model while increasing the time steps for each year no longer significantly impacts the results after 40 time steps a new year occurs and the corresponding data from aquatool and the pmaup model are loaded the dss model aquatool is the model used by spanish authorities to advise decision making at basin level and inter alia to inform water allocation between the different users aquatool model developed by andreu et al 1991 is composed of several modules each of them appropriate to produce different information about the qualitative and or quantitative status of the water bodies enclosed in the basin in this application of the aquatool model only the general interface to edit data and manage the other modules called aquatool and the module to simulate watershed management called simges were used for the calibration and simulation respectively employing these modules allows to consider all the relevant hydrologic components that modify water allocation between users surface and groundwater bodies discharge series under natural conditions river aquifer interaction infrastructures reservoirs canals irrigation systems water demand units conveyance distribution and application inefficiencies and related return flows and non beneficial consumption evaporation from reservoirs minimum environmental flows water rights and water operation rules pérez blanco et al 2021 see annex i for more details about aquatool model and its calibration the pmaup model is a mathematical programming model that aims to replicate the behavior of a representative agent that in agricultural economics is usually a single farm an irrigation district as in this model or other homogeneous aggregations of farmers mathematical programming modes are widely used in agricultural economics to simulate the economic impact of a policy e g water pricing water fertilizer caps or some quantity quality change of an input e g water fertilizer labor the reader can refer to graveline 2016 for an exhaustive review of the models used in agricultural economics pmaup is a data and computationally intensive approach that saw substantial development during the past decades driven by expanding frontiers in computational power and micro data availability gómez limón et al 2016 gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 it falls in the category of the positive models because it is calibrated this procedure elicits the parameters of the utility function that better represent the observed behavior of the real world agents because of the calibration positive models are better suited to obtain insight into the effects of a policy natural shock in a specific study area because the starting point of the simulation is equal or similar if the calibration is not perfect to the one observed e g in terms of surface allotted to the different crops while in not calibrated models it is unlikely starting from a similar situation in addition the model used in this application follows the theory of planned behavior tpb introduced by ajzen 1991 which considers human behavior a complex mechanism in which many factors can influence decision making many models used in agricultural economics consider only the expected profit as a relevant attribute to assess the decisions of the farmers while pmaup considers 5 relevant attributes namely profit risk and management complexity through its 3 proxies total labor hired labor and the ratio between direct cost and total income gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 the general formulation of the maximization problem of the pmaup model is reported below 1 max u x f z 1 x z m x subject to 2 x i 0 3 i 0 n x i 1 4 x f r n 5 z 1 x z m x z x r m where u x is the utility objective function that adopts a cobb douglas specification as common practice in pmaup see e g gómez limón et al 2016 pérez blanco et al 2016 sapino et al 2022 composed by m utility relevant attributes z 1 x z m x 5 in the case of this application the attributes are all defined as more is better i e if one of the attributes increases its value with the other constant also the utility will increase in the case of a less is better attribute like risk or management complexity the attribute is redefined as avoided risk management complexity to be consistent in the maximization process the agents of the model decide on the crop portfolio x r n a vector that represents the portion of land allotted to the n individual crops available x i i 1 n to maximize their utility function 1 the complex human decision is reduced to the choice of the crop portfolio that yields the higher possible utility in the domain f the pmaup model is programmed in gams and uses the non linear optimization algorithm conopt2 to elicit the parameters of the objective function following the approach developed by gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 a detailed description of the calibration procedure the constraints the database and the calibration results are available in annex ii in the online supplementary material the pmaup model is used to simulate adaptation strategies with decreasing water availability and elicit the wta wtp to estimate the wta wtp firstly we obtain the utility u g values when the agent s water allocation w in equation a ii 1 is progressively decreased at fixed rates of 5000 m3 then the wta wtp is elicited as the monetized utility loss mul derived from a marginal change in the water allocation constraint in eur m3 6 m u l g e u g 1 w g w g w g 1 0 g g in which g 0 corresponds to the scenario without water restrictions and g g indicates the situation where water allocation is fully relinquished e is an expenditure function representing the minimum amount of money agents would need to achieve the same utility level as in g 1 given the new water constraint w g mul values represent the wta wtp for every agent that is the information the abm model needs to perform the market simulation the last model of apam is the abm which is used to allow interaction between agents the model is programmed in netlogo wilensky 1999 and allows for interaction between the agents under different scenarios explained in section 4 1 agent based models are commonly used in many fields of research inter alia economics ecology and water resource an 2012 filatova et al 2016 haer et al 2017 kremmydas et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 these simulation models build an artificial world in which agents can move and interact with each other following the rules that the programmer has computed because of this freedom in the design of interactions they are particularly suited for simulating markets the advantage of employing these models is their ability to detect and highlight the patterns of a complex system the patterns are identified through the performance of many simulations until a satisfactory convergence of the results is reached usually every scenario is run hundreds or thousands of times note that some randomized component is usually inserted in the model e g the distribution of the agents in the simulation world or how they move in the world in this application we use zero intelligent agents farmer et al 2005 gode and sunder 1993 i e agents that do not have a strategy to behave following a common practice in exploratory modeling in social sciences chen 2012 the market structure used in the abm simulates bilateral negotiations through the simplest bargaining protocol analogous to an ultimatum game nidumolu et al 2016 i e a take it or leave it offer from the buyers that sellers accept or not based on their wta revealed thought the pmaup model according to spanish law on water markets boe 2001 we focus our simulation on a specific configuration of the market the bilateral spot market i e an annual lease contract stipulated directly between the traders more complex market structures are often integrated into abm e g single auction moreno and wooders 2002 double auction du et al 2021 and can be used as a proxy of bargaining tcs through price formation that is unknown and the auction bet reveal and opportunistic behaviors however our application concentrates on quantifying only the effect of the itcs in a simple market structure and in the specific case of spain information asymmetry can be represented for instance through varying levels of connectivity of trading agents through pre established links iori 2002 or by limiting interactions to neighbors horst 2005 however we opted to keep the estimation of itcs as simple as possible as a proxy of asymmetric information we constrain the knowledge of all the other possible traders in the market more complexity e g in market structure clearing mechanism or price formation is not always the best alternative as it can expand opportunities to enjoy gains from trade but can also greatly increase strategic complexity and failures due to behavioral failures of rationally intended but boundedly rational agents nidumolu et al 2016 this choice is also supported by frenken s 2006 kiss principle on methodological quality which recommends keeping a model as simple as possible to be better understood moreover in a decentralized bilateral market the case we are analyzing the sources of asymmetric information emerge mainly by the knowledge of the other trader and the capability of reaching an agreement and then respect it from the two parts these last two excluded from our model to avoid increasing the complexity for more details the readers can find the odd müller et al 2013 in annex iii of the online supplementary materials 3 case study area methods are illustrated with an application to the douro river basin drb in spain fig 2 the drb is one of the largest basins in europe and encompasses a large part of the central plateau of spain and northern portugal the spanish part extends for 78 886 km2 and it is an area historically rich in water but with increasing scarcity issues driven by climate change and overexploitation of the water resources indeed the annual water supply has decreased by 7 5 comparing the 1940 2018 and the 1980 2018 runoff time series while the consumption has increased considerably this results in an alarming situation with the wei index a measure of the ratio between total withdrawals and renewable water resource in a basin reaching a value of 34 1 between scarcity 20 and severe scarcity 40 threshold the increasing problem of scarcity makes the drb a perfect place in which to develop and study new policies to efficiently redistribute water between users one of which is water markets water markets are legally feasible in spain the only country in the eu since 1999 when the reform of the water law created water banks managed by the public sector called exchange centers centros de intercambio in spanish that can purchase and sell water in case of drought boe 1999 after this first attempt the royal decree 9 2006 made possible for public institutions to use these exchange centers to purchase water rights from productive uses for environmental purposes e g ensuring rivers minimum flows boe 2006 since then spot markets between users in case of drought and buyback programs for environmental purposes have been widely used in overallocated basins inter alia the júcar river basin the segura river basin and the guadiana river basin gómez et al 2017 the area of the drb selected for this study includes 23 awdus agricultural water demand units that withdraw their water directly from the douro river the awdus are a uniform aggregation of irrigators that use the same source of water commonly employed by spanish river basin authorities as a homogeneous aggregation of farmers to inform agricultural water demand considering all the awdus of the basin implies the possibility of trans catchment water transfers and their feasibility needs more research that goes beyond the purpose of this paper the agents of apam are the 23 awdus selected this means that every one of the three models composing apam uses the same agent the simulation was performed for 38 years from 1981 to 2018 these awdus include more than 22 000 ha of irrigated land and the cultivated crops are maize 29 of the total irrigated land barley 20 alfalfa 11 wheat 10 sunflower 9 sugar beet 8 potato 4 garlic and vineyard 2 and other minor crops 5 4 experiment design and results 4 1 scenarios following pérez blanco et al 2021 we integrate the 2021 draft of the douro river basin management plan drba 2021 with two additional environmental scenarios that consider the increasing of river sections with environmental minimum flows guaranteed and the effect of climate change the number of sections with minimum flow guaranteed in the new douro river basin management plan was 60 we added 91 new stretches to consider more ambitious environmental objectives furthermore we integrate the climate change effect in our analysis considering an average 11 reduction in discharges following the rcp4 5 climate change scenario the one considered in the spanish climate change adaptation plan for the drb magrama 2017 this information is used to force aquatool model that can simulate the new water allocation for every agent in the years of the simulation five different farmers behaviors were considered in the abm model i ideal behavior an ideal market with perfect information ii behavior 1 with information asymmetries ideal market with limited information iii behavior 2 with information asymmetries limited information and random interaction iv behavior 3 with information and spatial asymmetries decentralized bilateral spot market with limited information and random interaction and v behavior 4 with information and spatial asymmetries decentralized bilateral spot market with the possibility to remember past traders with limited information and random interaction in the ideal behavior the objective is to simulate an ideal market with perfect information in this case there is a central agency that knows the supply demand curve of every agent every year it orders the agents according to the wtp from highest to lowest and the wta back to front then the market starts working with the exchange of water licenses between the ordered agents until the wta exceeds the wtp this operation happens every year with drought while in the year without scarcity it is not allowed in behavior 1 the objective is to simulate the effect of information asymmetries in a market that works similarly to the ideal one this behavior aims to represent the itcs emerging from the time invested in identifying buyers sellers through the proxy of limiting the number of agents with whom it is possible to trade through this proxy it is possible to understand the effect of the knowledge about all the possible participants in a market in this simulation instead of buying from the agent that has the better price of all every buyer in decreasing order of wtp purchases the water from the agent that has the better price within the ones he can contact the ones the agent knows the contacts of every agent are assigned randomly and updated every drought year and many simulations are performed increasing the number of possible contacts from 2 to all these simulations help to understand the effect of the increasing knowledge and identify possible emerging patterns and or tipping points in case the agent can contact all the other agents the result is the same as the one of the ideal behavior the aim of behavior 2 is like the previous but itcs are assessed with a higher degree of information asymmetries this behavior simulates the effect of information asymmetries in a market in which the buyers are not ordered according to their wtp agents are selected randomly one at a time and allowed to buy from the seller that asks the lowest price between the ones they can contact from 2 to all as in the previous scenario and the simulation stops when the market reaches an equilibrium in behavior 3 the objective is to simulate a decentralized spot market in which the agents have the same kind of limited information as in the previous behaviors as before this is done by limiting the contact he can have with the other agents from 2 to all in this scenario there is a place in the simulation world called market house in which agents must move to trade this place simulates a virtual platform or a physical place in which agents can meet and trade but only the ones that are there at the same time are allowed to trade with each other moreover it allows more interaction between agents than for instance a random wondering in the simulation world as in the classic wolf sheep predation model wilensky and reisman 1998 although it maintains random interactions when the agents are selected to buy randomly between the ones in the market house they will buy all the water they can from the other agents until their wtp is lower than the sellers wta or they have contacted all the sellers they can when buyers reach the maximum number of contacts allowed or they have bought all the water lost because of the drought they return to their farm until a new drought year occurs instead in case the buyers contact a minor number of sellers than the ones allowed they will remain in the market house finally behavior 4 reproduces a decentralized spot market with the possibility to remember the trader s of the previous year with whom they have a direct interaction at the beginning of a new year the market structure is the same as in behavior 3 but after every trade the buyer registers the seller and the price of the trade the buyer is allowed to remember 3 10 or all his previous seller note that in case the trader is the same only the new selling price is registered again this is done to explore possible emerging patterns at the beginning of every new year every 40 time steps the agents in random order can contact the ones they had traded with during the previous year s and buy directly from them without being in the market house in behavior 3 and 4 the agents are distributed randomly across the simulation world 1 1 the random distribution of the agents in the simulation world has an effect only in behavior 3 and 4 while in the others a central agency regulates the market therefore the distribution in the simulation world does not affect the result in behavior 3 and 4 the agents must reach the market house to trade their water and 100 simulations are performed per scenario of incremental knowledge 5 scenarios with increasing contacts allowed 2 5 10 15 and all 22 the other agents these repetitions allow the emergence of a trend in the results due to the limited number of agents 100 simulations per behavior and scenario were enough to have a reduced discrepancy in the results with 100 simulations per every one of the 4 behavior and with 2 additional configurations in behavior 4 the abm model performs 3000 simulations of the water market in the study area the different market scenarios modeled through the abm lead to suboptimal results in terms of surplus which reveal itcs that are obtained as the difference between the market surplus of a scenario and the one of the ideal behavior 4 2 results aquatool simulation results show drought intensity in terms of water provided per awdu fig 3 note that 100 means all the water was supplied in that year the combined effect of climate change and the minimum flow provoke a straightforward effect and reveal how this irrigation area is exposed to these events with the majority of the awduss experiencing at least a reduction of 40 in the water availability during the simulated period the awdus located in the upstream part of drb are the ones that result more exposed to drought because relevant tributary rivers inter alia pisguera elsa cega flow into the douro guaranteeing more water downstream the first result of the apam model fig 4 displays the expected economic surplus of the proposed market in the different scenarios considered from this result emerges clearly that increasing the available information increases the efficiency of the market but the effect of the different information restrictions is less obvious fig 4 shows that when the available information is poor 2 or 5 contacts allowed the effect in the reduction of the surplus is huge while after 10 contacts allowed the effect is less evident particularly the results show that when the agents can contact half of the other agents the expected surplus is already similar to the one in which they have total information behavior 3 and 4 shows that with all the contacts allowed the expected surplus is slightly lower than the scenario with 15 contacts this happens because in this scenario agents purchases all the water they need when they are allowed to buy it thus the first agents that purchase the water obtain better prices than the others the impact in terms of surplus loss i e the difference with respect to the ideal market varies from 0 6 to 45 2 2 note that we are considering the average surplus per scenario and not the extreme values depending on the scenario fig 5 depicts the average number of trades successfully arranged in the market and it clearly shows that limiting information results in less trading with very little information however increasing the information in non perfect markets result in a higher level of trading this result shows that in these cases agents have to trade more to obtain a surplus similar to the one of the ideal market this is evident comparing behavior 1 and behavior 2 where the quantity traded is higher even if the surplus is similar and the same happens for the other behavior with 10 15 or all the contacts allowed finally fig 6 reports the itcs estimation per scenario the itcs are obtained as the specific cost of inefficiency i e the difference between the economic surplus of the ideal market and the one in the considered scenario divided by the quantity traded as previously noted in fig 4 the itcs fall rapidly in the first steps of the increase of knowledge with all the scenarios halving itcs between 2 and 5 contacts and another time between 5 and 10 while decreasing a few eur cents m3 after 10 contacts 5 discussion and conclusion this paper proposes a method to estimate the itcs of a water market in spain to this end we develop a maca model that couples the hydrologic dss aquatool used by spanish river basin authorities that inform water allocation decisions with a pmaup model that elicits the behavior of irrigators and simulates their responses to changes in water allocations and with an abm model that allows the irrigators to communicate and simulate the water market the model is applied in a selected area of the douro river basin spain where itcs are elicited the results show that itcs range between 1 12e and 3 eur m3 and 0 116 eur m3 depending on the information available and the scenario itcs reduce the market performance with a decrease in market surplus between 0 6 and 45 depending on the scenario the majority of our results are far below the tipping point estimated by pujol et al 2005 0 075 eur m3 in spain in which the water market would not be implemented but some scenarios exceed this point 2 ca in behavior 1 2 and 3 the large majority of our scenarios apart from the more extremes simulate lower tcs than the ones estimated for chile 0 069 usd m3 california 0 058 0 193 usd m3 and the united states 0 073 usd m3 erfani et al 2014 but it has to be noted that our methodology can estimate only part of the tcs emerging from the market and it does not consider the institutional tcs this paper presents insightful information about how to improve the economic efficiency of a decentralized water market firstly a regulatory authority e g a clearinghouse with a good degree of information improves market efficiency secondly in the case of a decentralized spot market remembering past traders behavior 4 yields higher performance and lastly poor information affects the market performance in all the simulated scenarios moreover in the case of the decentralized spot market behavior 3 and 4 total information seems not to be the best option to maximize the surplus 15 contacts allowed yield the highest surplus as explained in section 4 2 but this is explained by the specific assumption of this behavior from a policy perspective it is worth mentioning that markets are not an instrument that can reach environmental objectives or prevent future scarcity per se but they are well suited to be implemented with other policies that can reach these objectives e g caps buybacks with the advantages of compensating users that do not withdraw the water allotted to them and reducing public expenditure this is in line with tinbergen s 1952 thoughts suggesting that every policy objective should be reached with a specific policy instrument i e one per objective and mundell s 1962 assignment principle that asserts that each instrument should be used to target the objective to which it is best suited sapino et al 2023 furthermore the implementation of these policies is likely to involve significant institutional tcs the costs of arranging a resource reallocation ex ante and then monitoring and enforcing it ex post that are not estimated in our model and their effect is therefore not assessed matthews 1986 accordingly future research should explore water markets coupled with other policies and sequencing strategies that can achieve multiple objectives considering all private and institutional tcs to analyze their impact on the economic and environmental conservation performance gómez et al 2017 finally research has disclosed significant incentives in the non compliance of water resources allocation through water theft also this phenomenon needs future in depth analysis to evaluate the implications it has in terms of wrecking the market performance loch et al 2020 the results of the apam model show that itcs can be estimated and included in the analysis of a water market and different configurations of the market were explored to capture insights into realistic markets further research can extend the apam model improving the different models of which it is composed in the economic model it is possible adding a multi model ensemble of mpms to sample uncertainty through model spread use mpms that allow for other adaptation strategies notably deficit irrigation and couple the microeconomic with a macroeconomic model to better inform agents decisions accounting also for price shocks parrado et al 2019 to this end the major constraint is data availability especially to use mpms that allow deficit irrigation as an adaptation strategy the hydrologic model can also be populated with an ensemble of models and or considering multiple climate change scenarios to force the model would improve its performance under uncertainty pérez blanco et al 2021 finally in the abm additional behavior bargaining and learning process and decision making process can be explored to better evaluate the performance of the markets as well as to deepen the analysis of the tcs and their effect on policies credit authorship contribution statement francesco sapino conceptualization formal analysis methodology data curation

2196,the economic literature has extensively researched water markets finding that this instrument can deliver superior resource allocations under growing scarcity however these assessments typically ignore the information bargaining and enforcement costs that occur in trades known as transaction costs which can be particularly relevant in emerging markets such as those for water this paper presents a multi agent cellular automata model that couples a positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup model with an agent based model abm to elicit the information transaction costs of water trading under alternative market and climate scenarios a first experiment evaluates an ideal water market with no transaction costs which is then compared to alternative decentralized spot market setups representing different degrees of information availability that are modeled using the coupled pmaup abm the difference between the economic surplus under the ideal market and that achieved under alternative market setups with information constraints is used as a proxy value of information transaction costs methods are illustrated with an application to the douro river basin in central spain results show that information transaction costs can reduce the economic surplus between 0 6 and 45 depending on the scenario keywords mathematical programming model mpm agent based model abm water markets transaction costs socio hydrology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction farming accounts for approximately 70 of water withdrawals in the world today while often constituting the marginal i e least productive uses of freshwater resources fao 2021 in a context of growing scarcity water markets can support the reallocation of water towards agricultural uses with higher added value hence offering an opportunity to enhance economic growth and social welfare without increasing demand damania et al 2017 agricultural and behavioral economics research has developed increasingly sophisticated empirical models to elicit agent s preferences and reveal market equilibria through demand supply interaction including programming models graveline 2016 econometrics zuo et al 2015 data envelopment analysis frija et al 2011 hedonic pricing faux and perry 1999 and contingent valuation storm et al 2011 of which the former is the most commonly used approach most of these models suggest a promising performance of water markets which are expected to significantly increase the efficiency in water resources use wheeler 2021 yet despite relevant methodological and empirical advances in the application of behavioral economics methods and techniques the assumption of zero transaction costs tcs remains a major limitation in achieving realistic estimates of the economic performance of water markets tcs can be broadly defined as the costs of arranging a contract ex ante and then monitoring and enforcing it ex post as opposed to the more conventional reallocation costs which are the costs of executing the contract i e the foregone income or the monetized utility loss of the seller matthews 1986 broadly speaking we can divide tcs into two macro categories private and institutional tcs private tcs are the ones concerning the traders while the institutional ones refer to the creation of the market institutional tcs can be considered a one time component deng et al 2018 and therefore independent from single transactions while the private tcs are directly connected to market exchanges loch et al 2018 define private tcs as the sum of the following elements i time invested in monitoring market activity and identifying buyers sellers or information tcs ii negotiation time iii monitoring and mitigating third party effects iv contracting or conveyance to secure the trade v possible dispute resolution and vi barriers to trade resulting from restrictions or quotas either of which may increase time spent checking the feasibility of trade opportunities tcs are usually evaluated ex post i e where markets are already implemented and tcs can be directly measured typically through surveys loch et al 2018 womble and hanemann 2020 yet ex ante evaluations with empirical models are more limited rare examples can be found in garrido 2000 and pujol et al 2005 who combine programming models with exploratory analysis i e hypothetical tcs scenarios to assess the impacts of tcs pujol et al 2005 use this approach to identify tipping points in water markets showing that economic performance rapidly decreases along with higher tcs until the market shuts down beyond tcs of 0 1 eur m3 italy and 0 075 eur m3 spain garrido 2000 evaluates market performance in spain under two hypothetical tcs 1 and 3 pesetas m3 showing that any transaction cost over 1 or 2 pesetas per exchanged cubic meter results in the shutdown of the market these results suggest that tcs can have nontrivial impacts on agents choices deviating observed market equilibria from those predicted under zero tcs ideals furthermore if tcs in water markets are larger than those of alternative water reallocation mechanisms the conventional economic wisdom that attributes water markets a superior economic performance may not hold pujol et al 2005 noteworthy a key feature of these studies is that they rely on hypothetical tcs scenarios here we explore another modeling option that employs revealed preferences techniques to quantify tcs them ex ante this paper proposes the coupling of a non linear positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup model that represents the motives and behavior of heterogenous irrigators with an abm agent based model that explicitly captures social and spatial interactions to model the performance of a decentralized water market under information asymmetries and constraints so as to ex ante quantify information tcs itcs the resulting coupled socio economic model called pam pmaup abm is forced using water availability and water allocation projections under climate change from the hydrologic decision support system dss model aquatool to ground market simulations on plausible water supply futures the modeling framework proposed in this paper falls in the category of muti agent cellular automata maca applied to land use cover land use change kremmydas et al 2018 maca are simulation models that couple a cellular component representing an environment space with human agents representing decision making berger 2001 to assess how social and spatial interactions among autonomous agents e g irrigators in an environment space e g the basin affect the macroscale e g market equilibria through the combination of the strong microeconomic foundations of pmaup and the capacity of abm to recreate the impacts of agents interactions on the macroscale the apam aquatool pam model can provide insights into how alternative socioenvironmental stimuli itcs scenarios hydrological shocks condition crop portfolio and water allocation choices of agents and lead to different market equilibria the apam model builds on the theory of revealed preferences samuelson 1938 which allows us to evaluate ex ante the itcs through the effect they have on farmers choices this paper contributes to the literature by proposing a methodology that can estimate the itcs of a decentralized spot water market in areas where markets are not yet common practice or not allowed the potential of the model is illustrated with an application in a part of the douro river basin central spain accordingly some aspects of the model are site specific particularly those referring to the hydrological modeling of the basin and the spanish regulatory context these aspects are discussed in detail respectively in section 2 and section 3 2 background and methodology 2 1 background a defining characteristic of maca models is their capacity to solve autonomous constrained optimization programming problems while exchanging variables between them through an endogenous communication process that captures the most relevant interactions between heterogeneous agents schreinemachers and berger 2011 one such critical interaction is information diffusion exchange e g on technological innovations or trading prices in a market which largely conditions tcs two seminal works mark the beginning of maca applied to land use cover land use change balmann s 1997 agripolis model and berger s 2001 multi agent system cellular automata mas ca approach in balmann s 1997 agripolis model agents aim to maximize household income by optimally allocating on farm resources and operating in the land market renting or releasing agricultural plots agents are spatially distributed with the location being the critical variable determining diffusion through transportation costs and social interactions berger 2001 develops a spatial multi agent linear pm that introduces technology diffusion constraints in the form of network threshold values that reflect the cumulative effects of experience and observation of peers experiences accordingly agents in the model decide whether to adopt the technology following a frequency dependent diffusion model in three steps i monitor adoption levels and compare it with the agent s threshold ii if adoption levels are equal or higher to the threshold obtain agent s expected income after the adoption iii if the expected income is positive adopt the technology based on the seminal work of balmann 1997 and berger 2001 a large research body has focused on the study of diffusion models in maca applied to land use cover land use change particularly for the analysis of information diffusion exchange in the context of land markets and technology adoption table 1 reviews the literature on land use cover land use change maca that i are data driven ii deal with the agriculture domain and iii use mathematical programming techniques optimization of objective function within a domain to explicitly represent and model microeconomic agents the uniqueness of such maca models lies in their capacity to combine the representation of social and spatial interactions with a strong foundation in microeconomics we find most models are sophisticated in the representation of farm exit and entry decisions as well as the representation of long term decisions and the consideration of farming styles or types using farm typologies considerably fewer attempts to model farmers emotions values learning risk and uncertainty or social interactions occur in the different case studies this could be done by coupling the abm model with a pmaup capable of eliciting farmers behavior to the best of our knowledge none of the previous maca models was used to estimate any component of the tcs emerging in water markets for agricultural users 2 2 the apam modeling framework fig 1 shows the coupling framework of the apam and describes the interactions between each of the model that composes it the modeling framework presented in this paper is a linear coupling of aquatool pmaup and abm this means that every model is independent i e it provides input data for the other model the apam model operates in four steps 1 aquatool model simulates the new water allocation for every agent and passes the information to the pmaup 2 the objective utility function for each agent is elicited using the pmaup model then the water supply demand function obtained and integrated into the abm 3 the agents decisions of whether or not to trade are now dictated by the marginal utility cost of water for potential buyers sellers or shadow price of water while 4 trading opportunities are conditioned by alternative information diffusion scenarios that are used as a proxy of the itcs this sequential optimization allows every model to be more specific and to add more rules that help represent some degree of realistic agent behavior erfani et al 2014 note that a recursive or bidirectional activation of the different modules is possible and it would be necessary in case not all the water allocated to agents was used or if the market structure allows trans basin water trading in this paper the agents consume trade all the water allotted to them and withdraw their water from the same water body therefore a recursive or bidirectional simulation was not used the three models interact with each other during every simulation specifically every year aquatool and pmaup models are used to set the initial amount of water provision for the agents and the corresponding wtp willingness to pay and wta willingness to accept are calculated for to every agent this information is reset at the beginning of each year of the simulation the simulation holds for 38 years then according to their behavior the agents trade their water five different behaviors explained in section 4 1 were programmed to simulate the market and elicit the itcs in the abm setup the farms and the agents the farmers are created and randomly distributed in the simulation environment netlogo world each simulation year consists of 40 time steps this allows for ample interactions in the model while increasing the time steps for each year no longer significantly impacts the results after 40 time steps a new year occurs and the corresponding data from aquatool and the pmaup model are loaded the dss model aquatool is the model used by spanish authorities to advise decision making at basin level and inter alia to inform water allocation between the different users aquatool model developed by andreu et al 1991 is composed of several modules each of them appropriate to produce different information about the qualitative and or quantitative status of the water bodies enclosed in the basin in this application of the aquatool model only the general interface to edit data and manage the other modules called aquatool and the module to simulate watershed management called simges were used for the calibration and simulation respectively employing these modules allows to consider all the relevant hydrologic components that modify water allocation between users surface and groundwater bodies discharge series under natural conditions river aquifer interaction infrastructures reservoirs canals irrigation systems water demand units conveyance distribution and application inefficiencies and related return flows and non beneficial consumption evaporation from reservoirs minimum environmental flows water rights and water operation rules pérez blanco et al 2021 see annex i for more details about aquatool model and its calibration the pmaup model is a mathematical programming model that aims to replicate the behavior of a representative agent that in agricultural economics is usually a single farm an irrigation district as in this model or other homogeneous aggregations of farmers mathematical programming modes are widely used in agricultural economics to simulate the economic impact of a policy e g water pricing water fertilizer caps or some quantity quality change of an input e g water fertilizer labor the reader can refer to graveline 2016 for an exhaustive review of the models used in agricultural economics pmaup is a data and computationally intensive approach that saw substantial development during the past decades driven by expanding frontiers in computational power and micro data availability gómez limón et al 2016 gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 it falls in the category of the positive models because it is calibrated this procedure elicits the parameters of the utility function that better represent the observed behavior of the real world agents because of the calibration positive models are better suited to obtain insight into the effects of a policy natural shock in a specific study area because the starting point of the simulation is equal or similar if the calibration is not perfect to the one observed e g in terms of surface allotted to the different crops while in not calibrated models it is unlikely starting from a similar situation in addition the model used in this application follows the theory of planned behavior tpb introduced by ajzen 1991 which considers human behavior a complex mechanism in which many factors can influence decision making many models used in agricultural economics consider only the expected profit as a relevant attribute to assess the decisions of the farmers while pmaup considers 5 relevant attributes namely profit risk and management complexity through its 3 proxies total labor hired labor and the ratio between direct cost and total income gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 the general formulation of the maximization problem of the pmaup model is reported below 1 max u x f z 1 x z m x subject to 2 x i 0 3 i 0 n x i 1 4 x f r n 5 z 1 x z m x z x r m where u x is the utility objective function that adopts a cobb douglas specification as common practice in pmaup see e g gómez limón et al 2016 pérez blanco et al 2016 sapino et al 2022 composed by m utility relevant attributes z 1 x z m x 5 in the case of this application the attributes are all defined as more is better i e if one of the attributes increases its value with the other constant also the utility will increase in the case of a less is better attribute like risk or management complexity the attribute is redefined as avoided risk management complexity to be consistent in the maximization process the agents of the model decide on the crop portfolio x r n a vector that represents the portion of land allotted to the n individual crops available x i i 1 n to maximize their utility function 1 the complex human decision is reduced to the choice of the crop portfolio that yields the higher possible utility in the domain f the pmaup model is programmed in gams and uses the non linear optimization algorithm conopt2 to elicit the parameters of the objective function following the approach developed by gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 a detailed description of the calibration procedure the constraints the database and the calibration results are available in annex ii in the online supplementary material the pmaup model is used to simulate adaptation strategies with decreasing water availability and elicit the wta wtp to estimate the wta wtp firstly we obtain the utility u g values when the agent s water allocation w in equation a ii 1 is progressively decreased at fixed rates of 5000 m3 then the wta wtp is elicited as the monetized utility loss mul derived from a marginal change in the water allocation constraint in eur m3 6 m u l g e u g 1 w g w g w g 1 0 g g in which g 0 corresponds to the scenario without water restrictions and g g indicates the situation where water allocation is fully relinquished e is an expenditure function representing the minimum amount of money agents would need to achieve the same utility level as in g 1 given the new water constraint w g mul values represent the wta wtp for every agent that is the information the abm model needs to perform the market simulation the last model of apam is the abm which is used to allow interaction between agents the model is programmed in netlogo wilensky 1999 and allows for interaction between the agents under different scenarios explained in section 4 1 agent based models are commonly used in many fields of research inter alia economics ecology and water resource an 2012 filatova et al 2016 haer et al 2017 kremmydas et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 these simulation models build an artificial world in which agents can move and interact with each other following the rules that the programmer has computed because of this freedom in the design of interactions they are particularly suited for simulating markets the advantage of employing these models is their ability to detect and highlight the patterns of a complex system the patterns are identified through the performance of many simulations until a satisfactory convergence of the results is reached usually every scenario is run hundreds or thousands of times note that some randomized component is usually inserted in the model e g the distribution of the agents in the simulation world or how they move in the world in this application we use zero intelligent agents farmer et al 2005 gode and sunder 1993 i e agents that do not have a strategy to behave following a common practice in exploratory modeling in social sciences chen 2012 the market structure used in the abm simulates bilateral negotiations through the simplest bargaining protocol analogous to an ultimatum game nidumolu et al 2016 i e a take it or leave it offer from the buyers that sellers accept or not based on their wta revealed thought the pmaup model according to spanish law on water markets boe 2001 we focus our simulation on a specific configuration of the market the bilateral spot market i e an annual lease contract stipulated directly between the traders more complex market structures are often integrated into abm e g single auction moreno and wooders 2002 double auction du et al 2021 and can be used as a proxy of bargaining tcs through price formation that is unknown and the auction bet reveal and opportunistic behaviors however our application concentrates on quantifying only the effect of the itcs in a simple market structure and in the specific case of spain information asymmetry can be represented for instance through varying levels of connectivity of trading agents through pre established links iori 2002 or by limiting interactions to neighbors horst 2005 however we opted to keep the estimation of itcs as simple as possible as a proxy of asymmetric information we constrain the knowledge of all the other possible traders in the market more complexity e g in market structure clearing mechanism or price formation is not always the best alternative as it can expand opportunities to enjoy gains from trade but can also greatly increase strategic complexity and failures due to behavioral failures of rationally intended but boundedly rational agents nidumolu et al 2016 this choice is also supported by frenken s 2006 kiss principle on methodological quality which recommends keeping a model as simple as possible to be better understood moreover in a decentralized bilateral market the case we are analyzing the sources of asymmetric information emerge mainly by the knowledge of the other trader and the capability of reaching an agreement and then respect it from the two parts these last two excluded from our model to avoid increasing the complexity for more details the readers can find the odd müller et al 2013 in annex iii of the online supplementary materials 3 case study area methods are illustrated with an application to the douro river basin drb in spain fig 2 the drb is one of the largest basins in europe and encompasses a large part of the central plateau of spain and northern portugal the spanish part extends for 78 886 km2 and it is an area historically rich in water but with increasing scarcity issues driven by climate change and overexploitation of the water resources indeed the annual water supply has decreased by 7 5 comparing the 1940 2018 and the 1980 2018 runoff time series while the consumption has increased considerably this results in an alarming situation with the wei index a measure of the ratio between total withdrawals and renewable water resource in a basin reaching a value of 34 1 between scarcity 20 and severe scarcity 40 threshold the increasing problem of scarcity makes the drb a perfect place in which to develop and study new policies to efficiently redistribute water between users one of which is water markets water markets are legally feasible in spain the only country in the eu since 1999 when the reform of the water law created water banks managed by the public sector called exchange centers centros de intercambio in spanish that can purchase and sell water in case of drought boe 1999 after this first attempt the royal decree 9 2006 made possible for public institutions to use these exchange centers to purchase water rights from productive uses for environmental purposes e g ensuring rivers minimum flows boe 2006 since then spot markets between users in case of drought and buyback programs for environmental purposes have been widely used in overallocated basins inter alia the júcar river basin the segura river basin and the guadiana river basin gómez et al 2017 the area of the drb selected for this study includes 23 awdus agricultural water demand units that withdraw their water directly from the douro river the awdus are a uniform aggregation of irrigators that use the same source of water commonly employed by spanish river basin authorities as a homogeneous aggregation of farmers to inform agricultural water demand considering all the awdus of the basin implies the possibility of trans catchment water transfers and their feasibility needs more research that goes beyond the purpose of this paper the agents of apam are the 23 awdus selected this means that every one of the three models composing apam uses the same agent the simulation was performed for 38 years from 1981 to 2018 these awdus include more than 22 000 ha of irrigated land and the cultivated crops are maize 29 of the total irrigated land barley 20 alfalfa 11 wheat 10 sunflower 9 sugar beet 8 potato 4 garlic and vineyard 2 and other minor crops 5 4 experiment design and results 4 1 scenarios following pérez blanco et al 2021 we integrate the 2021 draft of the douro river basin management plan drba 2021 with two additional environmental scenarios that consider the increasing of river sections with environmental minimum flows guaranteed and the effect of climate change the number of sections with minimum flow guaranteed in the new douro river basin management plan was 60 we added 91 new stretches to consider more ambitious environmental objectives furthermore we integrate the climate change effect in our analysis considering an average 11 reduction in discharges following the rcp4 5 climate change scenario the one considered in the spanish climate change adaptation plan for the drb magrama 2017 this information is used to force aquatool model that can simulate the new water allocation for every agent in the years of the simulation five different farmers behaviors were considered in the abm model i ideal behavior an ideal market with perfect information ii behavior 1 with information asymmetries ideal market with limited information iii behavior 2 with information asymmetries limited information and random interaction iv behavior 3 with information and spatial asymmetries decentralized bilateral spot market with limited information and random interaction and v behavior 4 with information and spatial asymmetries decentralized bilateral spot market with the possibility to remember past traders with limited information and random interaction in the ideal behavior the objective is to simulate an ideal market with perfect information in this case there is a central agency that knows the supply demand curve of every agent every year it orders the agents according to the wtp from highest to lowest and the wta back to front then the market starts working with the exchange of water licenses between the ordered agents until the wta exceeds the wtp this operation happens every year with drought while in the year without scarcity it is not allowed in behavior 1 the objective is to simulate the effect of information asymmetries in a market that works similarly to the ideal one this behavior aims to represent the itcs emerging from the time invested in identifying buyers sellers through the proxy of limiting the number of agents with whom it is possible to trade through this proxy it is possible to understand the effect of the knowledge about all the possible participants in a market in this simulation instead of buying from the agent that has the better price of all every buyer in decreasing order of wtp purchases the water from the agent that has the better price within the ones he can contact the ones the agent knows the contacts of every agent are assigned randomly and updated every drought year and many simulations are performed increasing the number of possible contacts from 2 to all these simulations help to understand the effect of the increasing knowledge and identify possible emerging patterns and or tipping points in case the agent can contact all the other agents the result is the same as the one of the ideal behavior the aim of behavior 2 is like the previous but itcs are assessed with a higher degree of information asymmetries this behavior simulates the effect of information asymmetries in a market in which the buyers are not ordered according to their wtp agents are selected randomly one at a time and allowed to buy from the seller that asks the lowest price between the ones they can contact from 2 to all as in the previous scenario and the simulation stops when the market reaches an equilibrium in behavior 3 the objective is to simulate a decentralized spot market in which the agents have the same kind of limited information as in the previous behaviors as before this is done by limiting the contact he can have with the other agents from 2 to all in this scenario there is a place in the simulation world called market house in which agents must move to trade this place simulates a virtual platform or a physical place in which agents can meet and trade but only the ones that are there at the same time are allowed to trade with each other moreover it allows more interaction between agents than for instance a random wondering in the simulation world as in the classic wolf sheep predation model wilensky and reisman 1998 although it maintains random interactions when the agents are selected to buy randomly between the ones in the market house they will buy all the water they can from the other agents until their wtp is lower than the sellers wta or they have contacted all the sellers they can when buyers reach the maximum number of contacts allowed or they have bought all the water lost because of the drought they return to their farm until a new drought year occurs instead in case the buyers contact a minor number of sellers than the ones allowed they will remain in the market house finally behavior 4 reproduces a decentralized spot market with the possibility to remember the trader s of the previous year with whom they have a direct interaction at the beginning of a new year the market structure is the same as in behavior 3 but after every trade the buyer registers the seller and the price of the trade the buyer is allowed to remember 3 10 or all his previous seller note that in case the trader is the same only the new selling price is registered again this is done to explore possible emerging patterns at the beginning of every new year every 40 time steps the agents in random order can contact the ones they had traded with during the previous year s and buy directly from them without being in the market house in behavior 3 and 4 the agents are distributed randomly across the simulation world 1 1 the random distribution of the agents in the simulation world has an effect only in behavior 3 and 4 while in the others a central agency regulates the market therefore the distribution in the simulation world does not affect the result in behavior 3 and 4 the agents must reach the market house to trade their water and 100 simulations are performed per scenario of incremental knowledge 5 scenarios with increasing contacts allowed 2 5 10 15 and all 22 the other agents these repetitions allow the emergence of a trend in the results due to the limited number of agents 100 simulations per behavior and scenario were enough to have a reduced discrepancy in the results with 100 simulations per every one of the 4 behavior and with 2 additional configurations in behavior 4 the abm model performs 3000 simulations of the water market in the study area the different market scenarios modeled through the abm lead to suboptimal results in terms of surplus which reveal itcs that are obtained as the difference between the market surplus of a scenario and the one of the ideal behavior 4 2 results aquatool simulation results show drought intensity in terms of water provided per awdu fig 3 note that 100 means all the water was supplied in that year the combined effect of climate change and the minimum flow provoke a straightforward effect and reveal how this irrigation area is exposed to these events with the majority of the awduss experiencing at least a reduction of 40 in the water availability during the simulated period the awdus located in the upstream part of drb are the ones that result more exposed to drought because relevant tributary rivers inter alia pisguera elsa cega flow into the douro guaranteeing more water downstream the first result of the apam model fig 4 displays the expected economic surplus of the proposed market in the different scenarios considered from this result emerges clearly that increasing the available information increases the efficiency of the market but the effect of the different information restrictions is less obvious fig 4 shows that when the available information is poor 2 or 5 contacts allowed the effect in the reduction of the surplus is huge while after 10 contacts allowed the effect is less evident particularly the results show that when the agents can contact half of the other agents the expected surplus is already similar to the one in which they have total information behavior 3 and 4 shows that with all the contacts allowed the expected surplus is slightly lower than the scenario with 15 contacts this happens because in this scenario agents purchases all the water they need when they are allowed to buy it thus the first agents that purchase the water obtain better prices than the others the impact in terms of surplus loss i e the difference with respect to the ideal market varies from 0 6 to 45 2 2 note that we are considering the average surplus per scenario and not the extreme values depending on the scenario fig 5 depicts the average number of trades successfully arranged in the market and it clearly shows that limiting information results in less trading with very little information however increasing the information in non perfect markets result in a higher level of trading this result shows that in these cases agents have to trade more to obtain a surplus similar to the one of the ideal market this is evident comparing behavior 1 and behavior 2 where the quantity traded is higher even if the surplus is similar and the same happens for the other behavior with 10 15 or all the contacts allowed finally fig 6 reports the itcs estimation per scenario the itcs are obtained as the specific cost of inefficiency i e the difference between the economic surplus of the ideal market and the one in the considered scenario divided by the quantity traded as previously noted in fig 4 the itcs fall rapidly in the first steps of the increase of knowledge with all the scenarios halving itcs between 2 and 5 contacts and another time between 5 and 10 while decreasing a few eur cents m3 after 10 contacts 5 discussion and conclusion this paper proposes a method to estimate the itcs of a water market in spain to this end we develop a maca model that couples the hydrologic dss aquatool used by spanish river basin authorities that inform water allocation decisions with a pmaup model that elicits the behavior of irrigators and simulates their responses to changes in water allocations and with an abm model that allows the irrigators to communicate and simulate the water market the model is applied in a selected area of the douro river basin spain where itcs are elicited the results show that itcs range between 1 12e and 3 eur m3 and 0 116 eur m3 depending on the information available and the scenario itcs reduce the market performance with a decrease in market surplus between 0 6 and 45 depending on the scenario the majority of our results are far below the tipping point estimated by pujol et al 2005 0 075 eur m3 in spain in which the water market would not be implemented but some scenarios exceed this point 2 ca in behavior 1 2 and 3 the large majority of our scenarios apart from the more extremes simulate lower tcs than the ones estimated for chile 0 069 usd m3 california 0 058 0 193 usd m3 and the united states 0 073 usd m3 erfani et al 2014 but it has to be noted that our methodology can estimate only part of the tcs emerging from the market and it does not consider the institutional tcs this paper presents insightful information about how to improve the economic efficiency of a decentralized water market firstly a regulatory authority e g a clearinghouse with a good degree of information improves market efficiency secondly in the case of a decentralized spot market remembering past traders behavior 4 yields higher performance and lastly poor information affects the market performance in all the simulated scenarios moreover in the case of the decentralized spot market behavior 3 and 4 total information seems not to be the best option to maximize the surplus 15 contacts allowed yield the highest surplus as explained in section 4 2 but this is explained by the specific assumption of this behavior from a policy perspective it is worth mentioning that markets are not an instrument that can reach environmental objectives or prevent future scarcity per se but they are well suited to be implemented with other policies that can reach these objectives e g caps buybacks with the advantages of compensating users that do not withdraw the water allotted to them and reducing public expenditure this is in line with tinbergen s 1952 thoughts suggesting that every policy objective should be reached with a specific policy instrument i e one per objective and mundell s 1962 assignment principle that asserts that each instrument should be used to target the objective to which it is best suited sapino et al 2023 furthermore the implementation of these policies is likely to involve significant institutional tcs the costs of arranging a resource reallocation ex ante and then monitoring and enforcing it ex post that are not estimated in our model and their effect is therefore not assessed matthews 1986 accordingly future research should explore water markets coupled with other policies and sequencing strategies that can achieve multiple objectives considering all private and institutional tcs to analyze their impact on the economic and environmental conservation performance gómez et al 2017 finally research has disclosed significant incentives in the non compliance of water resources allocation through water theft also this phenomenon needs future in depth analysis to evaluate the implications it has in terms of wrecking the market performance loch et al 2020 the results of the apam model show that itcs can be estimated and included in the analysis of a water market and different configurations of the market were explored to capture insights into realistic markets further research can extend the apam model improving the different models of which it is composed in the economic model it is possible adding a multi model ensemble of mpms to sample uncertainty through model spread use mpms that allow for other adaptation strategies notably deficit irrigation and couple the microeconomic with a macroeconomic model to better inform agents decisions accounting also for price shocks parrado et al 2019 to this end the major constraint is data availability especially to use mpms that allow deficit irrigation as an adaptation strategy the hydrologic model can also be populated with an ensemble of models and or considering multiple climate change scenarios to force the model would improve its performance under uncertainty pérez blanco et al 2021 finally in the abm additional behavior bargaining and learning process and decision making process can be explored to better evaluate the performance of the markets as well as to deepen the analysis of the tcs and their effect on policies credit authorship contribution statement francesco sapino conceptualization formal analysis methodology data curation

2197,global warming has significantly impacted the hydrological processes in alpine cryosphere region water age is an essential descriptor of the hydrological function within a catchment however the mechanism of streamwater age variability remains unclear due to limited observational data and high altitudes of alpine catchment in this study long term stable isotopic data on streamwater in a catchment in the central tibetan plateau tp were collected to assess the water age using the sine wave approach and gamma distribution results showed that the mean streamwater age was 77 days and that 30 of streamwater was less than 41 days old on average the streamwater age in this study was relatively younger than that in low elevation natural catchments indicating that the rapid drainage process occurs within the glacier and permafrost catchment the fraction of young water fyw of the streamwater decreased from 39 at an upstream site to 28 at the outlet revealing the impact of permafrost low fyw 25 on streamwater age these variabilities were related to glacier and permafrost coverage specifically in catchments with higher glacier coverage that are prone to have a lower water age temporally the streamwater age was significantly influenced by precipitation relative humidity and glacier change and to a lesser extent permafrost change mechanically glacier and permafrost changes influenced the water age by increasing the vertical flowpath length this study provides new insights into the change in hydrological processes in alpine headwater catchments under global warming keywords tibetan plateau permafrost glacier stable isotope water age hydrology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global warming has caused most glaciers in the tp to shrink with area at a rate of 10 1 during the last decades which has substantial impact on regional water resources with respect to both quality and supply across asia kang et al 2010 ke et al 2015 yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 glacier melting can positively influence precipitation in the short term by increasing evapotranspiration however the long term retreat of glaciers will lead to less precipitation which cause further retreat thereby affecting the hydrology and water resources of the tp zhang et al 2012 in recent decades permafrost in the tp has experienced significant rapid and extensive degradation such as increasing soil temperature and deepening active layer thickness cheng et al 2019 wu et al 2021 these changes in cryosphere of the tp have profoundly and extensively affected regional and continental hydrological regimes as well as alpine ecosystems gao et al 2021 jin et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 permafrost degradation may cause the continuous permafrost to develop into isolated permafrost forming penetrative thaw channels or permeable layer zhao et al 2019 which enhance the interaction between deep groundwater and surface water the depth and distribution of permafrost has a strong influence on runoff pathways because it acts as an aquitard tetzlaff et al 2018 in fact the supply of glacial meltwater and permafrost thawing water to streams is thought to be increasing thereby altering the average age of the streamwater by increasing the relative proportion of old water yang et al 2021 revealing these processes in hydrological models is challenging due to the complexity of the underlying surface in alpine regions water age within a watershed an essential indicator of hydrological function is defined as the transit time of water to reach the watershed outlet after its entrance mcdonnell et al 2010 shah et al 2017 yang et al 2021 water age depends on factors that control the amount and form of water input and output mixing and storage in the landscape segura 2021 therefore knowledge of streamwater age is helpful for understanding mechanisms of changes in alpine hydrological processes such as water storage and release dynamics in the context of global warming segura 2021 yang et al 2021 the mean transit time mtt has been globally used as an effective metric for describing the water storage and release mechanisms within a catchment many previous studies have focused on determining the relationships between mtt and spatially intrinsic watershed characteristics such as topographic metrics soil characteristics and geology freyberg et al 2018 hrachowitz et al 2009 hu et al 2020 mcguire et al 2005 mosquera et al 2016 tetzlaff et al 2009 however mtt estimates have large numerical errors due to the disadvantages of aggregation bias in heterogeneous and nonstationary catchments kirchner 2016 proposed the metric of fraction of young water fyw as an alternative descriptor of transit time without aggregation bias in heterogeneous and nonstationary catchments which is defined as the proportion of water in a stream that is younger than a specific threshold age 2 3 0 8 months since 2016 the isotope based sine wave method has been increasingly applied to estimate fyw hu et al 2020 a previous study calculated the younger fraction of global streamflow by compiling data from 254 watersheds globally jasechko et al 2016 the combined use of the fyw and mtt provides more accurate and consistent data on water cycling in hydrological systems hu et al 2020 thus these two metrics of water age have been used to explore the impact of anthropogenic activities such as urbanization deforestation and extensive grazing on streamwater age as well as to understand how disturbance affects the water age in watersheds dimitrova petrova et al 2020 hrachowitz et al 2021 morales and oswald 2020 the interaction of climate and landscape characteristics determines the water ages within a catchment zhang et al 2020 thus an understanding of how water age changes is critical to understanding the effects of global warming on alpine hydrology although water age has been estimated in many regions around the world few studies have applied these metrics of water age to alpine catchments characteristically underlain by glaciers and permafrost and experiencing less anthropogenic activities long term isotope monitoring data are rare because of the difficulty of sampling in the tp song et al 2017 yang et al 2021 thus the characteristics and mechanisms of change of streamwater age in alpine regions remain largely unclear especially in the context of global warming the existing studies on water age in alpine catchment focused on investigating the impacts of topography vegetation and snow on water age using short term isotope data and did not consider the effects of glacier and permafrost changes on hydrological processes ceperley et al 2020 song et al 2017 yang et al 2021 in this study we conducted long term continuous sampling of streamwater in the dongkemadi catchment dkmd a well observed alpine catchment in the central tp 5000 m a s l and applied the sine wave approach and gamma distribution to assess the water age of the streamflow the main objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the spatio temporal variability of water age in the dkmd 2 explore the impacts of climate and cryospheric changes glacier retreat and permafrost degradation on the variability of water age thereby revealing the change of hydrological process in the alpine catchment under global warming this study provides insight for a better understanding of the potential effects of climate change on the hydrological processes in alpine catchment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the dkmb 33 00 33 06 n 91 58 92 06 e is located in the source region of the yangtze river in the central tp with an area of 50 01 km2 and an average altitude of 5418 m a s l fig 1 glaciers and permafrost are widely distributed throughout this region the dongkemadi glacier in this region for example is a continental compound valley glacier that covers an area of 15 86 km2 accounting for 32 of the total area of dkmb fujita et al 2000 table 1 with the elevations range from 5926 and 5380 m a s l respectively according to field observation data the dongkemadi glacier has been rapidly shrinking over the last decade the ds04 catchment a sub catchment of the dkmd is a typical permafrost area without and glacier this catchment has a drainage area of 2 17 km2 and an average altitude of 5 300 m a s l table 1 the climate of the dkmd features a cold season from october to may under the influence of westerlies whereas the warm season which spans from june to september is controlled by the indian monsoon li et al 2016 the mean annual precipitation 2014 2021 was 508 mm most of which occurred during may to october 90 fig 2 the maximum average annual precipitation was 674 mm in 2014 whereas the lowest was 307 mm in 2015 followed by 319 mm in 2018 the latter years were classified as typical dry years the average annual air temperature was 5 3 c and only exceeded 0 c during the warm season fig 2 given the cold climate the water in the stream network is generally frozen thus the stream network generates flowing water in the warm season only the vegetation type consists predominantly of alpine steppe and meadow accounting for 21 and 44 of the entire catchment area respectively table 1 apart from the glacier and vegetation bare land debris accounts for 3 of the dkmd 2 2 field sampling and water isotope analysis in this study we conducted long term and high frequency water sampling at five sampling sites in the dkmd the distribution and detailed information of the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 and table 2 respectively in total 381 precipitation samples were collected over 8 years 2014 2021 using bulk collectors at the tanggula cryosphere and environment observation station 5050 m a s l chinese academy of sciences cas precipitation samples were collected immediately after each precipitation event to minimize the effects of evaporation we collected 241 streamwater samples at ds01 2017 2019 2021 over 4 years 442 at ds02 over 5 years 2017 2021 856 at ds03 over 8 years 2014 2021 and 726 at ds04 over 8 years 2014 2021 at approximately one day intervals for ds02 ds03 and ds04 and approximately three day intervals for ds01 table 2 ds01 ds02 and ds03 are situated on the main stream of dkmd river streamwater samples were collected in the warm season between june and october all samples were deposited in 50 ml pe bottles that had been rinsed thrice before sampling using water from the source the bottles were immediately sealed and stored under cool conditions 10 to prevent external contamination and fractionation the four streamwater sampling sites were classified into two groups according to the different characteristics of the underlying surface permafrost ds04 and glacier permafrost catchment ds01 03 groups stable isotope δd and δ 18o values in the precipitation and streamwater were analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer model dlt 100 los gatos research inc mountain view ca usa at the state key laboratory of cryospheric sciences cas each water sample was analyzed six times and the first two rounds of results were excluded to reduce memory effects thus the average value of the last four analyses was used as the isotopic value of the water samples the results of the isotopic analysis were recorded in δ notation parts per thousand based on the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow e g δ18o 18o 16osample 18o 16ov smow 1 1000 the analytical precision for δ 18o and δd values were 0 2 and 0 6 respectively 2 3 additional datasets and statistical analysis meteorological data including annual mean relative humidity precipitation and air temperature were obtained from a meteorological station within the dkmd fig 1 the annual mean active layer thickness and soil temperature data temperature at the active layer bottom of permafrost were obtained from the blue book on climate change in china 2021 which has published vast amounts of data related to permafrost in the tp cma climate change centre 2021 the glacier mass balance data indicate the amount of glacier ablation observed by the stake method and additional snow pits 2014 2020 which is a traditional and reliable method for quantitatively measuring the glacier mass balance gao et al 2017 the data of frozen soil distribution on the tp are available from the national cryosphere desert data center https www ncdc

and data center https www resdc cn correlation analysis was performed using origin 2021 originlab corp northampton ma usa to reveal the dominant environmental factors controlling water age variability pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the strength of possible relationships between water age and environmental factors regression analysis was also performed using origin 2021 to analyze the seasonal variation of isotopes and the relationship between δ 18o and δd in precipitation and streamwater the goodness of fit r2 was used to evaluate efficiency of regression analysis results 2 4 metrics of water age we calculated two metrics of water age fyw and mtt for each sampling site following the methodology developed by kirchner 2016 in this study long term water isotope data were collected to estimate water age metrics mathematically the movement of a conservative tracer through a catchment can be expressed by the convolution integral which indicates that the streamwater at any given time δ out t consists of an input tracer δ in t τ that entered uniformly into the catchment in the past t τ which is subsequently lagged by its transit time distribution g τ the common transit time distributions ttd used in hydrologic systems include exponential exponential piston flow dispersion and gamma distributions mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 simin et al 2013 in our study we assumed that transit time follow a gamma distribution g τ with two parameters shape parameter α and scale parameter β which has been proven effective in a variety of environments for estimating fyw and mtt δ out t 0 g τ δ in t τ d τ 1 g τ τ α 1 β α γ α e α β 2 where τ is the transit time t is the time of the tracer exit from the catchment outlet and t τ represents the time at which the tracer enters the catchment we used a sine wave approach to fit the precipitation and streamwater isotope time series to obtain the cosine and sine coefficients δ p t k p a p cos 2 π f t φ p 3 δ s t k s a s cos 2 π f t φ s where f is the frequency of the cycle the subscripts p and s refer to precipitation and streamwater respectively δ is the modelled isotope value k is the observed isotope value a is the amplitude of the observed δ 18o and φ is the phase lag of the modelled isotope value in radians in this study given the lack of runoff generation and less precipitation in the cold season we used the sampling period as the fitting cycle seasonal cycles amplitude and phase shift are phenomenologically objective descriptions of input output behavior within catchments yang et al 2021 the amplitude ratio a s a p and the phase shift φ s φ p can be expressed as a function of the shape parameter α and scale parameter β respectively eqs 4 and 5 kirchner 2016 4 a s a p 1 2 π f β 2 α 2 5 φ s φ p α tan 1 2 π f β by iteratively solving eqs 4 and 5 shape parameter α and scale parameter β can be calculated using the following eq 6 6 β 1 2 π f a s a p 2 α 1 then the threshold age τyw of fyw can be determined using shape parameter α eq 7 finally we used the regularized lower incomplete gamma distribution to calculate the fraction of streamwater younger than τyw eq 8 the mtt can be calculated directly from the product of α and β eq 9 kirchner 2016 7 τ yw 0 0949 0 1065 α 0 0126 α 2 8 f yw γ τ yw α β τ 0 τ yw τ α 1 β α γ α e τ β d τ 9 mtt α β α 2 π f a s a p 2 α 1 numerical experiments showed that fyw is nearly equivalent to the amplitude ratio as ap fyw kirchner 2016 because kirchner 2016 verified that convolving the tracer cycle with the ttd will yield amplitude ratios as ap that are functions of f τ τ m t t the uncertainties of the estimated fyw and mtt results were quantified by feeding the 95 confidence bounds for the fitted amplitude as and ap and other known parameters into eqs 8 and 9 bansah and ali 2019 yang et al 2021 only δ18o was used in the estimation of mtt and fyw in this study because of the strong correlation between δ18o and δd which are likely to yield similar assessments of the water age fig 3 3 results 3 1 isotopic composition in precipitation and streamwater and its sine wave fitting to identify differences in water isotope compositions across all streamwater sampling sites the data were plotted in dual isotope space fig 3 the isotopic values for precipitation were slightly above the global meteoric water line gmwl resulting in the local meteoric water line lmwl having a higher slope 8 27 than that of the gmwl which might reflect the complex moisture sources and local recycling processes occurring on the tp fig 3 yao et al 2013 in contrast the streamwater isotope data diverged considerably from and were below the lmwl with a mean slope of 7 41 fig 3 which is indicative of evaporation induced isotope fractionation and long transit time meanwhile significant differences in the waterline slope between glacier permafrost ds01 03 7 49 and permafrost sub catchment ds04 7 18 were observed the lower slope of streamwater at ds04 reflect that the streamwater in the permafrost catchment was largely influenced by the thawing and freezing of the active soil layer song et al 2017 the variability of the isotopic composition in precipitation during the observational period was larger than that of the streamwater figs 3 and 4 on a monthly scale the isotopic composition in precipitation followed a seasonal pattern being isotopically enriched in june δ 18o 8 6 and october δ 18o 12 6 but depleted from july to september δ 18o 16 3 reflecting the shifting moisture source between the bay of bengal and the southern indian ocean yao et al 2013 a similar seasonal pattern was also found in streamwater isotopes at ds01 ds02 ds03 and ds04 however these were less variable than that of precipitation on a monthly scale to a certain extent this suggests that the variation in streamwater isotopes was largely dependent on precipitation even in glacier covered catchments meanwhile we observed that precipitation isotopes have greater monthly variability than streamwater isotopes and this variability for streamwater isotopes decreased over time fig 4 indicative of the weakening of the impact of precipitation on streamwater at the end of the indian summer monsoon season interestingly the isotope compositions in stream water from ds01 03 showed different patterns of altitude effects during different time periods as the altitude increased the streamwater was enriched with heavy isotopes in july however the opposite occurred in september and october isotope variation was relatively constant from upstream to downstream in june these phenomena reflect changes in the replenishment sources for streamwater during different seasonal periods in july the streamwater was replenished by large amounts of precipitation thus heavy isotopes depleted from upstream to downstream however in september and october more supra permafrost water might recharge the streamwater from upstream to downstream due to the thicker permafrost active layer storing a larger amount of water enriched heavy isotopes which is supported by the findings that the isotopic values of the outlet water ds03 are close to those of the permafrost catchment ds04 the lack of altitude effects in august indicates more complex mixing processes among precipitation supra permafrost water and glacier meltwater previous studies found that the altitude effect mainly appeared during ablation in glacier permafrost areas and attributed it to the comprehensive influence of different recharge sources li et al 2020 in terms of daily variations stable isotopic signals for streamwater also follow variations in precipitation δ 18o both of which show sine wave variability thus we fitted the seasonal variations to the daily δ 18o in precipitation and streamwater using sine wave model fig 5 and the results showed the model was a good fit for simulating water isotope variations based on daily data with an r 2 of 0 25 for precipitation 0 51 for streamwater at ds01 0 47 for streamwater at ds02 0 31 for streamwater at ds03 and 0 28 for streamwater at ds04 all the fits passed the significance test p 0 001 the δ 18o seasonal variations of streamwater exhibited relatively weak amplitudes mean amplitude 1 70 compared with the precipitation mean 5 41 which indicates that the isotope values in streamwater represent a mixture of precipitation within the catchment thereby smoothing the variability of isotopic values in rivers this phenomenon further provides a prerequisite for the estimation of water age mtt and fyw using sine wave and gamma distribution the mean amplitude of streamwater in our study is consistent with previous results from a study in the zuomaokong watershed of the central tp 1 76 song et al 2017 the low amplitude of stream water at ds04 1 36 is associated with a long transit time in the streamflow stewart et al 2010 these differences in seasonal isotopic signals suggest contrasting hydrological processes between catchments covered by different landscape glacier vs permafrost 3 2 assessment of streamwater age the usefulness of the amplitude ratio as ap method for estimating the young water fraction in alpine catchments covered by glaciers and permafrost regions is not well understood therefore we applied two approaches gamma distribution and amplitude ratio as ap for fyw estimation using precipitation as the input signal to the hydrological system table s2 the results showed that the estimated fyw values based on the gamma distribution are nearly equivalent to the amplitude ratio as ap fyw fig 6 which is consistent with previous results kirchner 2016 therefore the amplitude ratio as ap can be used to estimate the fyw it may comprise a useful reference for future fyw estimates in alpine catchments given the strong relationship between the estimates of fyw and fyw the analysis of young water fractions using any of these estimates would be similar to each other the analysis below is based on the fyw results estimated by the gamma distribution the estimated fyw values for the streamwater at all four sampling sites ranged from 0 03 to 0 54 during the study periods with an average fyw of 0 30 the threshold ages τyw ranged from 25 to 49 days with an average of 41 days table s2 and fig 7 these results indicate that 30 of streamwater was less than 41 days old on average the tributary water ds04 had the lowest fraction of young water with 25 of the streamwater being less than 43 days old ds01 had the largest fraction of young water with 39 of the streamwater being less than 36 days old the fractions of young water were 33 for ds02 and 0 28 for ds03 our calculations imply that 28 of precipitation reached the catchment outlet ds03 within the average 41 days in the mainstream ds01 03 the smallest value of fyw was observed at ds03 in 2015 0 12 and the largest value was observed in 2020 0 54 for the permafrost catchment the lowest value of fyw was observed at ds04 in 2018 0 03 the second was in 2015 0 19 and the largest value was in 2020 0 47 the mtt for all sampling sites ranged from 37 to 153 days with a mean of 77 days table s2 and fig s1 the range of mtt at ds01 was 39 87 days with a mean of 60 days the mtt at ds02 ranged from 49 to 101 days with a mean of 70 days the mtt at ds03 ranged from 37 to 114 days with a mean of 80 days finally the mtt at ds04 ranged from 51 to 153 days with a mean of 86 days across sampling sites in the mainstream ds01 03 the highest mtt value was observed at ds03 in 2015 113 days and the lowest value was observed at ds03 in 2020 37 days for the permafrost catchment the highest mtt value was observed at ds04 in 2018 153 days followed by 2015 97 days and the lowest value was also observed in 2020 51 days overall the estimated water age showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneities the water age in ds04 represented older water in this catchment and that at ds01 represented the youngest water moreover the water age variability at ds04 was consistent with that at sites ds01 03 except in 2018 fig 8 and s2 the average water age of the outlet water ds03 was between the oldest water and the youngest water and was closest to the average water age of all sampling sites which is thus taken to represent the water age of the entire dkmd catchment 3 3 influencing factors of water age variability the regression analysis showed that fyw values were inversely related to mtt for all sampling sites fig 9 r 2 0 94 p 0 001 indicating that the estimated mtt in this study may have a low aggregation bias considering the strong relationship between fyw and mtt the results of the controlling factor analysis for mtt may be similar to those of fyw thus this study only reports the analysis results of the influencing factors of fyw using the fyw values of all the sampling sites the relationships between fyw permafrost change and climatic factors were evaluated fig 10 the fyw values were positively correlated with precipitation fig 10d r 0 36 p 0 07 and relative humidity fig 10e r 0 46 p 0 02 whereas the active layer thickness soil temperature and air temperature were slightly correlated with fyw values fig 10 notably there was a strong positive correlation between the fyw values of ds01 03 and glacier mass balance fig 10f r 0 63 p 0 02 in contrast the fyw values of ds04 had a stronger relationship with precipitation r 0 60 p 0 12 than that of ds01 03 r 0 27 p 0 3 fig 10d we used the average fyw value for each sampling site to investigate the correlation between the landscape characteristics and water age fig 11 and results showed that the relationships between the average fyw and both elevation r 0 95 p 0 04 and slope r 0 89 p 0 11 were positive the fyw was negatively correlated with the percentage of permafrost cover r 0 92 p 0 08 and positively correlated with the percentage of glacier cover r 0 93 p 0 07 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with water age estimates in other studies in this study long term water isotope data were used to estimate water age in a typical alpine catchment covered by glaciers and permafrost the estimated fraction of young water was comparable to global results reported by jasechko et al 2016 who compiled a global precipitation and streamwater isotope dataset of samples from 254 rivers and found that on average 26 of global streamwater is less than three months old meanwhile the water age evaluated at the outlet of the dkmd mtt 73 days fyw 0 32 was close to that of the pian venezia overlain by glaciers mtt 200 days fyw 0 34 ceperley et al 2020 overall we found that streamwater at all sampling sites had a relatively short water age compared with the water age of specific watersheds in other regions such as forests and grasslands in low altitude natural catchments table 3 these results indicate that glaciers and permafrost as special aquicludes have a relatively quicker hydrological response of surface water to precipitation input or faster drainage processes ceperley et al 2020 mechanically this response is related to the short flow paths and lack of mixing with groundwater old water due to the presence of glaciers and permafrost similar studies have found that the short water age in the elsick catchment are associated with relatively shallow soil and impermeable glacial drift dimitrova petrova et al 2020 these impermeable layers not only shorten the water flow path but also block the interaction between surface water and groundwater thereby inhibiting mixing and shortening the water transit time however the estimated water ages were relatively younger in glacier and permafrost catchments in the dkmd compared with the similar studies in alpine permafrost regions song et al 2017 yang et al 2021 table 3 both sites have lower elevations than our study area this is because the permafrost active layer is thick in the relatively low altitude catchments result in more water in the active layer or deep groundwater old water contributes to the streamwater in particular the nagqu river basin despite its high altitude is a transitional zone between permafrost and seasonal frozen ground resulting in an older water age due to the contribution of deep groundwater water to the river wang et al 2021 yang et al 2021 interestingly the artificial impacted catchments such as agricultural area bansah and ali 2019 stevenson et al 2022 stockinger et al 2016 artificial ponds and drains dimitrova petrova et al 2020 morales and oswald 2020 also have a young water age often in a similar range or of a younger age when compared to the findings of this study table 3 indicating that anthropogenic activities on the land surface might modify water flow and storage by increasing impervious surface coverage although our study area is located in a remote area far from the disturbance of urban and agricultural management extensive grazing in this region may result in soil compaction thereby increasing overland flow resulting in faster delivery of water to the stream network and thus shortened water age dimitrova petrova et al 2020 o connell et al 2007 additionally it is worth noting that the water age of the arctic permafrost catchment 1 5 y was longer than that of our results possibly revealing differences in hydrological processes between the alpine permafrost and the arctic catchment tetzlaff et al 2018 overall the estimated water age was lower in the dkmd than in other regions which is likely a unique phenomenon in alpine catchment covered by glaciers and permafrost 4 2 climate controls on water age variability glaciers and permafrost are sensitive to climate change therefore it is necessary to probe the influence of climate factors on water age in alpine catchments and further analyze the consequent changes in hydrological processes in the alpine region correlation analysis showed that permafrost change had slight influence on water age in both tributaries and main streams in the dkmd this finding indicates that air and soil temperature may affect water transport and storage by changing the thickness of active layer because the deepening of the active layer thickness can increase the length of water flow pathway and slow the transport velocities due to a shift in flow direction from horizontal flow to vertical flow thereby increasing water age frampton and destouni 2015 additionally it is worth noting that the strong correlation between water age and glacier mass balance demonstrates that glacier shrinkage appears to have led to a high streamwater age the water age in dkmd varied greatly between the dry and wet years especially the estimated water ages in 2015 and 2018 were older than in the other years at all streamflow sampling sites which may be due to less precipitation during these dry years correlation analysis also confirmed that precipitation and relative humidity were the dominant climatic factors controlling the water age in this catchment fig 10 and s4 this finding is consistent with previous studies on mountainous watersheds in pennsylvania mcguire et al 2002 swiss catchments freyberg et al 2018 cold prairie watersheds in north america bansah and ali 2019 and humid systems in scotland birkel et al 2012 however a negative correlation between precipitation and fyw found in the bode catchment is contrary to our findings this negative correlation in the bode catchment was spurious because of the combined effects of several landscape characteristics in the mountainous region lutz et al 2018 the water age was positively correlated with precipitation in seven small mountainous watersheds in the western cascade range of oregon likely owing to the absence of snowpack ultimately resulting in lower connectivity between surface water in the streams older subsurface water and shorter active flow paths segura 2021 in our study on the one hand a dry climate less precipitation accelerated the melting of glaciers and permafrost releasing previously stored old water on the other hand the increase of precipitation thinned the thickness of active layer by decreasing soil heat flux and cooling the soil luo et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 thus climate variables affected the water age of streamwater mainly by changing the thickness of permafrost active layer even within a catchment covered by glaciers 4 3 landscape and topography controls on water age variability the estimated water ages for each sampling site showed great spatial variability fig 7 the water derived from the permafrost catchment ds04 was older than that from the catchment covered by both glaciers and permafrost ds01 03 especially for ds01 which is consistent with previous findings whereby the water age in glacier dominated catchments was younger than that in two adjacent catchments without glacier cover ceperley et al 2020 the distribution of permafrost and glaciers within the catchment area might play a role in the variability in water age this hypothesis is supported by the positive negative correlation of mtt fyw with the proportion of permafrost area and negative positive correlation with the proportion of glacier area fig 11 and s3 acting as a solid reservoir the glacier can not only release new water by melting new water from solid precipitation but can also release old water by melting glacier ice from the glacier ablation area that enters the stream network thus glacier ablation areas are strongly affected by climate change and the new precipitation on the glacier surface is less likely to reside for a long time the permafrost active layer acts as a water storage layer and the maximum active layer depth in our study area can reach 3 m and provide a source of water and nutrients for vegetation growth xu et al 2019 active layer evolution recharges the stream network quickly with more old water and replenishes it with new water song et al 2017 a previous study highlighted the influence of permafrost thawing on the activation of deeper flow paths smith et al 2007 walvoord et al 2012 which suggests that the existence of a permafrost active layer may result in vertical drainage and deeper flow paths than those of glaciers in fact this difference in landscape drainage characteristics explains the differences in runoff coefficients between permafrost and glacier areas generally the runoff coefficient of the glacier area 0 85 as an impervious surface area is higher than that of the vegetation covered permafrost area 0 26 li and zhu 2016 wang et al 2009 moreover related studies have found strong correlations between water age and runoff coefficients cartwright et al 2020 therefore the landscape differences between permafrost and glacier areas might drive the variability of water ages in alpine catchment topography may also be a key factor for the spatial variation of water age according to the catchment characteristic statistics table 1 we found that areas with higher glacial proportions corresponded to higher elevation and slope the results of the correlation analysis showed that the high elevation sampling sites had a shorter water age than sites located at low elevations fig 11a and s3a we also found that like elevation slope was also related to water age fig 11b and s3b catchment slope is a better index for comparing catchment functioning because it integrates the hydrologic connectivity of the hillslope riparian and stream areas mosquera et al 2016 therefore from a topographical perspective we suggest that landscape features play an important role in determining water age in alpine catchment similar to our study site a significant control of slopes on water age in the zhurucay basin is attributed to the higher proportion of wetlands mosquera et al 2016 however our findings are not consistent with a global analysis reported by jasechko et al 2016 who found that steeper watersheds tend to have older streamflow higher water age because steeper landscapes tend to favor deeper vertical infiltration rather than shallow lateral flow in our study owing to the existence of glaciers the path of water vertical infiltration was reduced which was not conducive to water retention because in the dkmd glaciers were mainly distributed in high altitude regions which have relatively steep slopes thus our results indicate that topography and landscape characteristics jointly contribute to the spatial heterogeneity of water age in alpine catchment in the context of global warming glacial shrinkage can positively influence precipitation in the short term however further shrinkage of glaciers will lead to less precipitation zhang et al 2012 furthermore glacier shrinkage might indirectly lead to an increase in the permafrost area additionally the rapid and extensive permafrost degradation in the tp results in increases in soil temperature permafrost layer thaw rates and greater active layer thickness cheng et al 2019 wu et al 2021 these phenomena eventually lengthen the water age slowing the rate of water circulation in alpine catchments as a result overall the variability in water age in alpine catchment can be ascribed to the combined effects of climate and landscape 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the variability of water age and discussed its contributing factors in an alpine catchment in the central tp using long term stable isotope data our results revealed that the isotope composition in streamwater is influenced by precipitation even in glacier covered catchment the water age was 77 days and 30 of the streamwater was less than 41 days old on average which suggests that the streamwater was younger than that in low elevation natural regions the obvious spatial variability of water age was related to the landscape features of the catchment temporally water ages were significantly controlled by precipitation relative humidity and glacier mass balance and were slightly influenced by permafrost change glacier shrinkage and permafrost change driven by global warming may prolong water age by increasing the length of the vertical flow path eventually slowing the rate of water circulation in alpine catchments the findings of this study enhance our understanding of hydrological processes and provide insight into how hydrological dynamics are changing in the face of climate change as the hydrological investigation at high altitude regions was extremely challenging we only conducted long term isotope monitoring at four sites within a single catchment during the warm season which may have resulted in sampling biases and a lack of the data representativeness meanwhile such a short sampling period and the lack of precipitation samples in the cold season may underestimate the water age when comparing our results with other studies where sampling was conducted throughout the year thus in future water age studies should be performed in various catchments and with precipitation samples collected in the cold season additionally to further improve our understanding of hydrological processes in alpine catchments future research should focus more on the sampling of glacier and permafrost meltwater and attempt to quantify the components of streamwater particularly the contribution of glacier and permafrost meltwater

2197,global warming has significantly impacted the hydrological processes in alpine cryosphere region water age is an essential descriptor of the hydrological function within a catchment however the mechanism of streamwater age variability remains unclear due to limited observational data and high altitudes of alpine catchment in this study long term stable isotopic data on streamwater in a catchment in the central tibetan plateau tp were collected to assess the water age using the sine wave approach and gamma distribution results showed that the mean streamwater age was 77 days and that 30 of streamwater was less than 41 days old on average the streamwater age in this study was relatively younger than that in low elevation natural catchments indicating that the rapid drainage process occurs within the glacier and permafrost catchment the fraction of young water fyw of the streamwater decreased from 39 at an upstream site to 28 at the outlet revealing the impact of permafrost low fyw 25 on streamwater age these variabilities were related to glacier and permafrost coverage specifically in catchments with higher glacier coverage that are prone to have a lower water age temporally the streamwater age was significantly influenced by precipitation relative humidity and glacier change and to a lesser extent permafrost change mechanically glacier and permafrost changes influenced the water age by increasing the vertical flowpath length this study provides new insights into the change in hydrological processes in alpine headwater catchments under global warming keywords tibetan plateau permafrost glacier stable isotope water age hydrology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global warming has caused most glaciers in the tp to shrink with area at a rate of 10 1 during the last decades which has substantial impact on regional water resources with respect to both quality and supply across asia kang et al 2010 ke et al 2015 yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 glacier melting can positively influence precipitation in the short term by increasing evapotranspiration however the long term retreat of glaciers will lead to less precipitation which cause further retreat thereby affecting the hydrology and water resources of the tp zhang et al 2012 in recent decades permafrost in the tp has experienced significant rapid and extensive degradation such as increasing soil temperature and deepening active layer thickness cheng et al 2019 wu et al 2021 these changes in cryosphere of the tp have profoundly and extensively affected regional and continental hydrological regimes as well as alpine ecosystems gao et al 2021 jin et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 permafrost degradation may cause the continuous permafrost to develop into isolated permafrost forming penetrative thaw channels or permeable layer zhao et al 2019 which enhance the interaction between deep groundwater and surface water the depth and distribution of permafrost has a strong influence on runoff pathways because it acts as an aquitard tetzlaff et al 2018 in fact the supply of glacial meltwater and permafrost thawing water to streams is thought to be increasing thereby altering the average age of the streamwater by increasing the relative proportion of old water yang et al 2021 revealing these processes in hydrological models is challenging due to the complexity of the underlying surface in alpine regions water age within a watershed an essential indicator of hydrological function is defined as the transit time of water to reach the watershed outlet after its entrance mcdonnell et al 2010 shah et al 2017 yang et al 2021 water age depends on factors that control the amount and form of water input and output mixing and storage in the landscape segura 2021 therefore knowledge of streamwater age is helpful for understanding mechanisms of changes in alpine hydrological processes such as water storage and release dynamics in the context of global warming segura 2021 yang et al 2021 the mean transit time mtt has been globally used as an effective metric for describing the water storage and release mechanisms within a catchment many previous studies have focused on determining the relationships between mtt and spatially intrinsic watershed characteristics such as topographic metrics soil characteristics and geology freyberg et al 2018 hrachowitz et al 2009 hu et al 2020 mcguire et al 2005 mosquera et al 2016 tetzlaff et al 2009 however mtt estimates have large numerical errors due to the disadvantages of aggregation bias in heterogeneous and nonstationary catchments kirchner 2016 proposed the metric of fraction of young water fyw as an alternative descriptor of transit time without aggregation bias in heterogeneous and nonstationary catchments which is defined as the proportion of water in a stream that is younger than a specific threshold age 2 3 0 8 months since 2016 the isotope based sine wave method has been increasingly applied to estimate fyw hu et al 2020 a previous study calculated the younger fraction of global streamflow by compiling data from 254 watersheds globally jasechko et al 2016 the combined use of the fyw and mtt provides more accurate and consistent data on water cycling in hydrological systems hu et al 2020 thus these two metrics of water age have been used to explore the impact of anthropogenic activities such as urbanization deforestation and extensive grazing on streamwater age as well as to understand how disturbance affects the water age in watersheds dimitrova petrova et al 2020 hrachowitz et al 2021 morales and oswald 2020 the interaction of climate and landscape characteristics determines the water ages within a catchment zhang et al 2020 thus an understanding of how water age changes is critical to understanding the effects of global warming on alpine hydrology although water age has been estimated in many regions around the world few studies have applied these metrics of water age to alpine catchments characteristically underlain by glaciers and permafrost and experiencing less anthropogenic activities long term isotope monitoring data are rare because of the difficulty of sampling in the tp song et al 2017 yang et al 2021 thus the characteristics and mechanisms of change of streamwater age in alpine regions remain largely unclear especially in the context of global warming the existing studies on water age in alpine catchment focused on investigating the impacts of topography vegetation and snow on water age using short term isotope data and did not consider the effects of glacier and permafrost changes on hydrological processes ceperley et al 2020 song et al 2017 yang et al 2021 in this study we conducted long term continuous sampling of streamwater in the dongkemadi catchment dkmd a well observed alpine catchment in the central tp 5000 m a s l and applied the sine wave approach and gamma distribution to assess the water age of the streamflow the main objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the spatio temporal variability of water age in the dkmd 2 explore the impacts of climate and cryospheric changes glacier retreat and permafrost degradation on the variability of water age thereby revealing the change of hydrological process in the alpine catchment under global warming this study provides insight for a better understanding of the potential effects of climate change on the hydrological processes in alpine catchment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the dkmb 33 00 33 06 n 91 58 92 06 e is located in the source region of the yangtze river in the central tp with an area of 50 01 km2 and an average altitude of 5418 m a s l fig 1 glaciers and permafrost are widely distributed throughout this region the dongkemadi glacier in this region for example is a continental compound valley glacier that covers an area of 15 86 km2 accounting for 32 of the total area of dkmb fujita et al 2000 table 1 with the elevations range from 5926 and 5380 m a s l respectively according to field observation data the dongkemadi glacier has been rapidly shrinking over the last decade the ds04 catchment a sub catchment of the dkmd is a typical permafrost area without and glacier this catchment has a drainage area of 2 17 km2 and an average altitude of 5 300 m a s l table 1 the climate of the dkmd features a cold season from october to may under the influence of westerlies whereas the warm season which spans from june to september is controlled by the indian monsoon li et al 2016 the mean annual precipitation 2014 2021 was 508 mm most of which occurred during may to october 90 fig 2 the maximum average annual precipitation was 674 mm in 2014 whereas the lowest was 307 mm in 2015 followed by 319 mm in 2018 the latter years were classified as typical dry years the average annual air temperature was 5 3 c and only exceeded 0 c during the warm season fig 2 given the cold climate the water in the stream network is generally frozen thus the stream network generates flowing water in the warm season only the vegetation type consists predominantly of alpine steppe and meadow accounting for 21 and 44 of the entire catchment area respectively table 1 apart from the glacier and vegetation bare land debris accounts for 3 of the dkmd 2 2 field sampling and water isotope analysis in this study we conducted long term and high frequency water sampling at five sampling sites in the dkmd the distribution and detailed information of the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 and table 2 respectively

bottles that had been rinsed thrice before sampling using water from the source the bottles were immediately sealed and stored under cool conditions 10 to prevent external contamination and fractionation the four streamwater sampling sites were classified into two groups according to the different characteristics of the underlying surface permafrost ds04 and glacier permafrost catchment

analyze the seasonal variation of isotopes and the relationship between δ 18o and δd in precipitation and streamwater the goodness of fit r2 was used to evaluate efficiency of regression analysis results 2 4 metrics of water age we calculated two metrics of water age fyw and mtt for each sampling site following the methodology developed by kirchner 2016 in this study long term water isotope data were collected to estimate water age metrics mathematically the movement of a conservative tracer through a catchment can be expressed by the convolution integral which indicates that the streamwater at any given time δ out t consists of an input tracer δ in t τ that entered uniformly into the catchment in the past t τ which is subsequently lagged by its transit time distribution g τ the common transit time distributions ttd used in hydrologic systems include exponential exponential piston flow dispersion and gamma distributions mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 simin et al 2013 in our study we assumed that transit time follow a gamma distribution g τ with two parameters shape parameter α and scale parameter β which has been proven effective in a variety of environments for estimating fyw and mtt δ out t 0 g τ δ in t τ d τ 1 g τ τ α 1 β α γ α e α β 2 where τ is the transit time t is the time of the tracer exit from the catchment outlet and t τ represents the time at which the tracer enters the catchment we used a sine wave approach to fit the precipitation and streamwater isotope time series to obtain the cosine and sine coefficients δ p t k p a p cos 2 π f t φ p 3 δ s t k s a s cos 2 π f t φ s where f is the frequency of the cycle the subscripts p and s refer to precipitation and streamwater respectively δ is the modelled isotope value k is the observed isotope value a is the amplitude of the observed δ 18o and φ is the phase lag of the modelled isotope value in radians in this study given the lack of runoff generation and less precipitation in the cold season we used the sampling period as the fitting cycle seasonal cycles amplitude and phase shift are phenomenologically objective descriptions of input output behavior within catchments yang et al 2021 the amplitude ratio a s a p and the phase shift φ s φ p can be expressed as a function of the shape parameter α and scale parameter β respectively eqs 4 and 5 kirchner 2016 4 a s a p 1 2 π f β

τyw of fyw can be determined using shape parameter α eq 7 finally we used the regularized lower incomplete gamma distribution to calculate the fraction of streamwater younger than τyw eq 8 the mtt can be calculated directly from the product of α and β eq 9 kirchner 2016 7 τ yw 0 0949 0 1065 α 0 0126 α 2 8 f yw γ τ yw α β τ 0 τ yw τ α 1 β α γ α e τ β d τ 9 mtt α β α 2 π f a s a p 2 α 1 numerical experiments showed that fyw is nearly equivalent to the amplitude ratio as ap fyw kirchner 2016 because kirchner 2016 verified that convolving the tracer cycle with the ttd will yield amplitude ratios as ap that are functions of f τ τ m t t the uncertainties of the estimated fyw and mtt results were quantified by feeding the 95 confidence bounds for the fitted amplitude as and ap and other known parameters into eqs 8 and 9 bansah and ali 2019 yang et al 2021 only δ18o was used in the estimation of mtt and fyw in this study because of the strong correlation between δ18o and δd which are likely to yield similar assessments of the water age fig 3 3 results 3 1 isotopic composition in precipitation and streamwater and its sine wave fitting to identify differences in water isotope compositions across all streamwater sampling sites the data were plotted in dual isotope space fig 3 the isotopic values for precipitation were slightly above the global meteoric water line gmwl resulting in the local meteoric water line lmwl having a higher slope 8 27 than that of the gmwl which might reflect the complex moisture sources and local recycling processes occurring on the tp fig 3 yao et al 2013 in contrast the streamwater isotope data diverged considerably from and were below the lmwl with a mean slope of 7 41 fig 3 which is indicative of evaporation induced isotope fractionation and long transit time meanwhile significant differences in the waterline slope between glacier permafrost ds01 03 7 49 and permafrost sub catchment ds04 7 18 were observed the lower slope of streamwater at ds04 reflect that the streamwater in the permafrost catchment was largely influenced by the thawing and freezing of the active soil layer song et al 2017 the variability of the isotopic composition in precipitation during the observational period was larger than that of the streamwater figs 3 and 4 on a monthly scale the isotopic composition in precipitation followed a seasonal pattern being isotopically enriched in june δ 18o 8 6 and october δ 18o 12 6 but depleted from july to september δ 18o 16 3 reflecting the shifting moisture source between the bay of bengal and the southern indian ocean yao et al 2013 a similar seasonal pattern was also found in streamwater isotopes at ds01 ds02 ds03 and ds04 however these were less variable than that of precipitation on a monthly scale to a certain extent this suggests that the variation in streamwater isotopes was largely dependent on precipitation even in glacier covered catchments meanwhile we observed that precipitation isotopes have greater monthly variability than streamwater isotopes and this variability for streamwater isotopes decreased over time fig 4 indicative of the weakening of the impact of precipitation on streamwater at the end of the indian summer monsoon season interestingly the isotope compositions in stream water from ds01 03 showed different patterns of altitude effects during different time periods as the altitude increased the streamwater was enriched with heavy isotopes in july however the opposite occurred in september and october isotope variation was relatively constant from upstream to downstream in june these phenomena reflect changes in the replenishment sources for streamwater during different seasonal periods in july the streamwater was replenished by large amounts of precipitation thus heavy isotopes depleted from upstream to downstream however in september and october more supra permafrost water might recharge the streamwater from upstream to downstream due to the thicker permafrost active layer storing a larger amount of water enriched heavy isotopes which is supported by the findings that the isotopic values of the outlet water ds03 are close to those of the permafrost catchment ds04 the lack of altitude effects in august indicates more complex mixing processes among precipitation supra permafrost water and glacier meltwater previous studies found that the altitude effect mainly appeared during ablation in glacier permafrost areas and attributed it to the comprehensive influence of different recharge sources li et al 2020 in terms of daily variations stable isotopic signals for streamwater also follow variations in precipitation δ 18o both of which show sine wave variability thus we fitted the seasonal variations to the daily δ 18o in precipitation and streamwater using sine wave model fig 5 and the results showed the model was a good fit for simulating water isotope variations based on daily data with an r 2 of 0 25 for precipitation 0 51 for streamwater at ds01 0 47 for streamwater at ds02 0 31 for streamwater at ds03 and 0 28 for streamwater at ds04 all the fits passed the significance test p 0 001 the δ 18o seasonal variations of streamwater exhibited relatively weak amplitudes mean amplitude 1 70 compared with the precipitation mean 5 41 which indicates that the isotope values in streamwater represent a mixture of precipitation within the catchment thereby smoothing the variability of isotopic values in rivers this phenomenon further provides a prerequisite for the estimation of water age mtt and fyw using sine wave and gamma distribution the mean amplitude of streamwater in our study is consistent with previous results from a study in the zuomaokong watershed of the central tp 1 76 song et al 2017 the low amplitude of stream water at ds04 1 36 is associated with a long transit time in the streamflow stewart et al 2010 these differences in seasonal isotopic signals suggest contrasting hydrological processes between catchments covered by different landscape glacier vs permafrost 3 2 assessment of streamwater age the usefulness of the amplitude ratio as ap method for estimating the young water fraction in alpine catchments covered by glaciers and permafrost regions is not well understood therefore we applied two approaches gamma distribution and amplitude ratio as ap for fyw estimation using precipitation as the input signal to the hydrological system table s2 the results showed that the estimated fyw values based on the gamma distribution are nearly equivalent to the amplitude ratio as ap fyw fig 6 which is consistent with previous results kirchner 2016 therefore the amplitude ratio as ap can be used to estimate the fyw it may comprise a useful reference for future fyw estimates in alpine catchments given the strong relationship between the estimates of fyw and fyw the analysis of young water fractions using any of these estimates would be similar to each other the analysis below is based on the fyw results estimated by the gamma distribution the estimated fyw values for the streamwater at all four sampling sites ranged from 0 03 to 0 54 during the study periods with an average fyw of 0 30 the threshold ages τyw ranged from 25 to 49 days with an average of 41 days table s2 and fig 7 these results indicate that 30 of streamwater was less than 41 days old on average the tributary water ds04 had the lowest fraction of young water with 25 of the streamwater being less than 43 days old ds01 had the largest fraction of young water with 39 of the streamwater being less than 36 days old the fractions of young water were 33 for ds02 and 0 28 for ds03 our calculations imply that 28 of precipitation reached the catchment outlet ds03 within the average 41 days in the mainstream ds01 03 the smallest value of fyw was observed at ds03 in 2015 0 12 and the largest value was observed in 2020 0 54 for the permafrost catchment the lowest value of fyw was observed at ds04 in 2018 0 03 the second was in 2015 0 19 and the largest value was in 2020 0 47 the mtt for all sampling sites ranged from 37 to 153 days with a mean of 77 days table s2 and fig s1 the range of mtt at ds01 was 39 87 days with a mean of 60 days the mtt at ds02 ranged from 49 to 101 days with a mean of 70 days the mtt at ds03 ranged from 37 to 114 days with a mean of 80 days finally the mtt at ds04 ranged from 51 to 153 days with a mean of 86 days across sampling sites in the mainstream ds01 03 the highest mtt value was observed at ds03 in 2015 113 days and the lowest value was observed at ds03 in 2020 37 days for the permafrost catchment the highest mtt value was observed at ds04 in 2018 153 days followed by 2015 97 days and the lowest value was also observed in 2020 51 days overall the estimated water age showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneities the water age in ds04 represented older water in this catchment and that at ds01 represented the youngest water moreover the water age variability at ds04 was consistent with that at sites ds01 03 except in 2018 fig 8 and s2 the average water age of the outlet water ds03 was between the oldest water and the youngest water and was closest to the average water age of all sampling sites which is thus taken to represent the water age of the entire dkmd catchment 3 3 influencing factors of water age variability the regression analysis showed that fyw values were inversely related to mtt for all sampling sites fig 9 r 2 0 94 p 0 001 indicating that the estimated mtt in this study may have a low aggregation bias considering the strong relationship between fyw and mtt the results of the controlling factor analysis for mtt may be similar to those of fyw thus this study only reports the analysis results of the influencing factors of fyw using the fyw values of all the sampling sites the relationships between fyw permafrost change and climatic factors were evaluated fig 10 the fyw values were positively correlated with precipitation fig 10d r 0 36 p 0 07 and relative humidity fig 10e r 0 46 p 0 02 whereas the active layer thickness soil temperature and air temperature were slightly correlated with fyw values fig 10 notably there was a strong positive correlation between the fyw values of ds01 03 and glacier mass balance fig 10f r 0 63 p 0 02 in contrast the fyw values of ds04 had a stronger relationship with precipitation r 0 60 p 0 12 than that of ds01 03 r 0 27 p 0 3 fig 10d we used the average fyw value for each sampling site to investigate the correlation between the landscape characteristics and water age fig 11 and results showed that the relationships between the average fyw and both elevation r 0 95 p 0 04 and slope r 0 89 p 0 11 were positive the fyw was negatively correlated with the percentage of permafrost cover r 0 92 p 0 08 and positively correlated with the percentage of glacier cover r 0 93 p 0 07 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with water age estimates in other studies in this study long term water isotope data were used to estimate water age in a typical alpine catchment covered by glaciers and permafrost the estimated fraction of young water was comparable to global results reported by jasechko et al 2016 who compiled a global precipitation and streamwater isotope dataset of samples from 254 rivers and found that on average 26 of global streamwater is less than three months old meanwhile the water age evaluated at the outlet of the dkmd mtt 73 days fyw 0 32 was close to that of the pian venezia overlain by glaciers mtt 200 days fyw 0 34 ceperley et al 2020 overall we found that streamwater at all sampling sites had a relatively short water age compared with the water age of specific watersheds in other regions such as forests and grasslands in low altitude natural catchments table 3 these results indicate that glaciers and permafrost as special aquicludes have a relatively quicker hydrological response of surface water to precipitation input or faster drainage processes ceperley et al 2020 mechanically this response is related to the short flow paths and lack of mixing with groundwater old water due to the presence of glaciers and permafrost similar studies have found that the short water age in the elsick catchment are associated with relatively shallow soil and impermeable glacial drift dimitrova petrova et al 2020 these impermeable layers not only shorten the water flow path but also block the interaction between surface water and groundwater thereby inhibiting mixing and shortening the water transit time however the estimated water ages were relatively younger in glacier and permafrost catchments in the dkmd compared with the similar studies in alpine permafrost regions song et al 2017 yang et al 2021 table 3 both sites have lower elevations than our study area this is because the permafrost active layer is thick in the relatively low altitude catchments result in more water in the active layer or deep groundwater old water contributes to the streamwater in particular the nagqu river basin despite its high altitude is a transitional zone between permafrost and seasonal frozen ground resulting in an older water age due to the contribution of deep groundwater water to the river wang et al 2021 yang et al 2021 interestingly the artificial impacted catchments such as agricultural area bansah and ali 2019 stevenson et al 2022 stockinger et al 2016 artificial ponds and drains dimitrova petrova et al 2020 morales and oswald 2020 also have a young water age often in a similar range or of a younger age when compared to the findings of this study table 3 indicating that anthropogenic activities on the land surface might modify water flow and storage by increasing impervious surface coverage although our study area is located in a remote area far from the disturbance of urban and agricultural management extensive grazing in this region may result in soil compaction thereby increasing overland flow resulting in faster delivery of water to the stream network and thus shortened water age dimitrova petrova et al 2020 o connell et al 2007 additionally it is worth noting that the water age of the arctic permafrost catchment 1 5 y was longer than that of our results possibly revealing differences in hydrological processes between the alpine permafrost and the arctic catchment tetzlaff et al 2018 overall the estimated water age was lower in the dkmd than in other regions which is likely a unique phenomenon in alpine catchment covered by glaciers and permafrost 4 2 climate controls on water age variability glaciers and permafrost are sensitive to climate change therefore it is necessary to probe the influence of climate factors on water age in alpine catchments and further analyze the consequent changes in hydrological processes in the alpine region correlation analysis showed that permafrost change had slight influence on water age in both tributaries and main streams in the dkmd this finding indicates that air and soil temperature may affect water transport and storage by changing the thickness of active layer because the deepening of the active layer thickness can increase the length of water flow pathway and slow the transport velocities due to a shift in flow direction from horizontal flow to vertical flow thereby increasing water age frampton and destouni 2015 additionally it is worth noting that the strong correlation between water age and glacier mass balance demonstrates that glacier shrinkage appears to have led to a high streamwater age the water age in dkmd varied greatly between the dry and wet years especially the estimated water ages in 2015 and 2018 were older than in the other years at all streamflow sampling sites which may be due to less precipitation during these dry years correlation analysis also confirmed that precipitation and relative humidity were the dominant climatic factors controlling the water age in this catchment fig 10 and s4 this finding is consistent with previous studies on mountainous watersheds in pennsylvania mcguire et al 2002 swiss catchments freyberg et al 2018 cold prairie watersheds in north america bansah and ali 2019 and humid systems in scotland birkel et al 2012 however a negative correlation between precipitation and fyw found in the bode catchment is contrary to our findings this negative correlation in the bode catchment was spurious because of the combined effects of several landscape characteristics in the mountainous region lutz et al 2018 the water age was positively correlated with precipitation in seven small mountainous watersheds in the western cascade range of oregon likely owing to the absence of snowpack ultimately resulting in lower connectivity between surface water in the streams older subsurface water and shorter active flow paths segura 2021 in our study on the one hand a dry climate less precipitation accelerated the melting of glaciers and permafrost releasing previously stored old water on the other hand the increase of precipitation thinned the thickness of active layer by decreasing soil heat flux and cooling the soil luo et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 thus climate variables affected the water age of streamwater mainly by changing the thickness of permafrost active layer even within a catchment covered by glaciers 4 3 landscape and topography controls on water age variability the estimated water ages for each sampling site showed great spatial variability fig 7 the water derived from the permafrost catchment ds04 was older than that from the catchment covered by both glaciers and permafrost ds01 03 especially for ds01 which is consistent with previous findings whereby the water age in glacier dominated catchments was younger than that in two adjacent catchments without glacier cover ceperley et al 2020 the distribution of permafrost and glaciers within the catchment area might play a role in the variability in water age this hypothesis is supported by the positive negative correlation of mtt fyw with the proportion of permafrost area and negative positive correlation with the proportion of glacier area fig 11 and s3 acting as a solid reservoir the glacier can not only release new water by melting new water from solid precipitation but can also release old water by melting glacier ice from the glacier ablation area that enters the stream network thus glacier ablation areas are strongly affected by climate change and the new precipitation on the glacier surface is less likely to reside for a long time the permafrost active layer acts as a water storage layer and the maximum active layer depth in our study area can reach 3 m and provide a source of water and nutrients for vegetation growth xu et al 2019 active layer evolution recharges the stream network quickly with more old water and replenishes it with new water song et al 2017 a previous study highlighted the influence of permafrost thawing on the activation of deeper flow paths smith et al 2007 walvoord et al 2012 which suggests that the existence of a permafrost active layer may result in vertical drainage and deeper flow paths than those of glaciers in fact this difference in landscape drainage characteristics explains the differences in runoff coefficients between permafrost and glacier areas generally the runoff coefficient of the glacier area 0 85 as an impervious surface area is higher than that of the vegetation covered permafrost area 0 26 li and zhu 2016 wang et al 2009 moreover related studies have found strong correlations between water age and runoff coefficients cartwright et al 2020 therefore the landscape differences between permafrost and glacier areas might drive the variability of water ages in alpine catchment topography may also be a key factor for the spatial variation of water age according to the catchment characteristic statistics table 1 we found that areas with higher glacial proportions corresponded to higher elevation and slope the results of the correlation analysis showed that the high elevation sampling sites had a shorter water age than sites located at low elevations fig 11a and s3a we also found that like elevation slope was also related to water age fig 11b and s3b catchment slope is a better index for comparing catchment functioning because it integrates the hydrologic connectivity of the hillslope riparian and stream areas mosquera et al 2016 therefore from a topographical perspective we suggest that landscape features play an important role in determining water age in alpine catchment similar to our study site a significant control of slopes on water age in the zhurucay basin is attributed to the higher proportion of wetlands mosquera et al 2016 however our findings are not consistent with a global analysis reported by jasechko et al 2016 who found that steeper watersheds tend to have older streamflow higher water age because steeper landscapes tend to favor deeper vertical infiltration rather than shallow lateral flow in our study owing to the existence of glaciers the path of water vertical infiltration was reduced which was not conducive to water retention because in the dkmd glaciers were mainly distributed in high altitude regions which have relatively steep slopes thus our results indicate that topography and landscape characteristics jointly contribute to the spatial heterogeneity of water age in alpine catchment in the context of global warming glacial shrinkage can positively influence precipitation in the short term however further shrinkage of glaciers will lead to less precipitation zhang et al 2012 furthermore glacier shrinkage might indirectly lead to an increase in the permafrost area additionally the rapid and extensive permafrost degradation in the tp results in increases in soil temperature permafrost layer thaw rates and greater active layer thickness cheng et al 2019 wu et al 2021 these phenomena eventually lengthen the water age slowing the rate of water circulation in alpine catchments as a result overall the variability in water age in alpine catchment can be ascribed to the combined effects of climate and landscape 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the variability of water age and discussed its contributing factors in an alpine catchment in the central tp using long term stable isotope data our results revealed that the isotope composition in streamwater is influenced by precipitation even in glacier covered catchment the water age was 77 days and 30 of the streamwater was less than 41 days old on average which suggests that the streamwater was younger than that in low elevation natural regions the obvious spatial variability of water age was related to the landscape features of the catchment temporally water ages were significantly controlled by precipitation relative humidity and glacier mass balance and were slightly influenced by permafrost change glacier shrinkage and permafrost change driven by global warming may prolong water age by increasing the length of the vertical flow path eventually slowing the rate of water circulation in alpine catchments the findings of this study enhance our understanding of hydrological processes and provide insight into how hydrological dynamics are changing in the face of climate change as the hydrological investigation at high altitude regions was extremely challenging we only conducted long term isotope monitoring at four sites within a single catchment during the warm season which may have resulted in sampling biases and a lack of the data representativeness meanwhile such a short sampling period and the lack of precipitation samples in the cold season may underestimate the water age when comparing our results with other studies where sampling was conducted throughout the year thus in future water age studies should be performed in various catchments and with precipitation samples collected in the cold season additionally to further improve our understanding of hydrological processes in alpine catchments future research should focus more on the sampling of glacier and permafrost meltwater and attempt to quantify the components of streamwater particularly the contribution of glacier and permafrost meltwater

2198,six rocks one granodiorite one limestone two chalks one mudstone and one dolostone with different extents of heterogeneity at six different particle sizes from 75 to 8000 μm were studied to

along with a solid quartz method at these six particle sizes being developed to identify the contribution of intraparticle diffusion and iii batch sorption tests of multiple ions anions and cations

al 2012 the effective porosity e i e the portion of total porosity t wherein solute transport occurs can be less than the overall pore space of the medium because of the presence of isolated and dead end pores that do not contribute to the overall transport or sometimes because of size exclusion of solute molecules in sub nm sized pore space hu 2022 various studies pointed out a larger effective porosity from a better connectivity aspect of pore structure may occur in smaller sized samples due to the opening of isolated pores in heterogeneous and tight rocks hu et al 2012 wu et al 2018 davudov moghanloo 2018 fu et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 it has also been widely reported that porous media with various pore structure characteristics usually display different mass transfer behaviors hu et al 2002 kosuge et al 2007 sun et al 2017 yang et al 2018 li et al 2019a the determination of the effects of pore connectivity on transport processes has been improved by applying both physically

only by the pore network parameters e g porosity pore size distribution and tortuosity fick s second law of diffusion has been employed to evaluate the non steady state diffusion fluxes in previous research the gas diffusion coefficient has been measured in soils using the method described by currie 1960 peng et al 2012 first investigated the effect of pore structure on diffusivity using currie s method to conduct gas diffusion tests in 11 intact rocks and reported that the intact samples with smaller mean pore size and wider pore size distribution exhibited lower gas diffusivities in granular and aggregated media such as fine grained rocks like shale diffusion can occur through both intra particle and inter particle pathways and their respective contributions to transport in such packed granular samples have not been thoroughly investigated hu and wang 2003 phounglamcheik et al 2022 attempted to evaluate the effect of intra particle and inter particle diffusion on the reaction rate of char gasification using thermogravimetric analysis based on various particle size distributions of samples and they found that the intra particle diffusion can be roughly estimated from the mean of the particle size distribution to summarize previous studies have mainly focused on intra particle diffusion affected either by mean pore size or particle size distribution without considering the effect of crushed granular sizes furthermore the influence of pore connectivity related to rock type heterogeneity and resultant particle size dependent effective porosity hu 2022 on intra particle diffusion has not been examined in this work we used the two chamber diffusion method originated by currie 1960 and later developed by rolston and moldrup 2002 with oxygen as the gas tracer to examine the effects of particle size and pore connectivity on intra particle diffusion in six different particle sizes of six rocks with different extents of heterogeneity ionic sorption and transport in natural rocks is linked to their pore connectivity via sample size dependent effective porosity and accessible pore surface hu et al 2015 the sorption capacity of ions onto adsorbents owing to their ability of selective binding has been well documented for both geological and industrial materials he et al 2011 chemical characteristics surface area pore structure and initial concentration of adsorbate have long been indicated as parameters in controlling ionic sorption and transport in various engineering and geological materials chang lenhoff 1998 li et al 2012 punyapalakul et al 2013 wang et al 2015 hong et al 2019 for example the importance of pore connectivity was suggested by chang and lenhoff 1998 as it influences the upper limit of adsorptive uptake particles with larger sizes are correlated with reduced adsorption wang et al 2015 nonetheless many geological media such as sedimentary and igneous rocks being made up of various minerals are different from industrial man made materials involved in previous studies mohammed et al 2021 moreover due to the specific physical structure and chemical properties mineral compositions vary in their sorption capacities for binding different ions for instance the presence of layered clay minerals increases the sorption properties corresponding to the presence of interlayer surface area zhuang and yu 2002 and also exhibits higher adsorption affinities for heavy metals such as cs and ba2 yao et al 2020 musso et al 2022 accordingly the combined effects of pore connectivity and component minerals on mass transport in natural rocks have been insufficiently investigated the adsorption capacity is strongly correlated with the accessible inner and external surface area influenced by pore connectivity and particle sizes and intrinsic adsorption affinity controlled by component minerals therefore in this work six geologically different rocks with six different particle sizes were chosen to present various extents of pore connectivities particle sizes and component minerals in natural rocks that are important for energy and environmental geosciences the pore connectivity was investigated by grain size distribution mercury intrusion porosimetry mip size dependent effective porosity with the measurement of both particle and bulk densities and intra particle and inter particle gas diffusion a series of batch adsorption experiments were then conducted with a suite of tracer chemicals both anions and cations with non sorbing and sorbing nature to assess the sorption capacity of the six rock samples with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms analyses a robust and sensitive technique used to detect multiple elements of both tracers and intrinsic elements hu et al 2005 hu and mao 2012 in summary the objectives of this work are to investigate the impacts of pore connectivity and particle sizes on the mass transport behaviors of several natural rocks based on complementary approaches of pore structure characterization gas diffusion and batch adsorption experiments six rocks including one limestone one granodiorite two israel chalks white and gray one mudstone and one dolostone were crushed and sieved into six particle sizes to investigate the particle size effect and associated pore connectivity basic properties were analyzed for mineralogy and pore types with x ray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem grain size distribution and pore structure were evaluated using laser diffraction and mip the porosity of each crushed rock with a specific particle size was measured to analyze the scale dependent effective porosities of these natural rocks the intra particle diffusivity was quantified using the solid quartz method developed in this work in addition the sorption capacity of each granular specimen for various tracers was obtained from batch sorption tests the particle size and sorption capability of rocks and associated mineral components were analyzed based on adsorption results finally the relationships among the particle sizes pore connectivity intra particle diffusivity and ionic sorption capabilities of these six natural rocks were discussed the results and findings in this study will provide valuable information for the mass transport assessment in various porous media with a coupled perspective of pore structure and physical chemical processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample selection six natural rock samples with different extents of heterogeneity at different observational scales were selected for this work including sedimentary limestone white chalk gray chalk mudstone and dolostone and igneous granodiorite types table 1 complex component particles from biological and non biological origins associated with post depositional evolution result in a tremendously heterogeneous distribution of pores and a high value of tortuosity in limestone choquette and pray 1970

network in granodiorite by coupled broad ion beam sem observations 2 2 sample preparation the six samples included both heterogeneous and relatively homogeneous rock types these intact rocks from either outcrops or cores were first crushed and sieved under one passing according to astm c136 01 2017 using a stack of stainless sieves with mesh sizes of 0 075 10 18 0 5 0 85 1 7 and 2 36 mm therefore particle sizes of crushed samples range in the sequence of 2360 8000 1700 2360 841 1700 500 841 177 500 and 75 177 μm moreover other pieces of intact samples were also ball milled to powder for xrd and grain size distribution analyses and cut into 1 cm cube for mip measurement consequently the effects of heterogeneity and particle size on pore structure and mass transport both gas diffusion and liquid sorption behaviors could be evaluated by using these six rock samples at different particle sizes table 2 2 3 methods 2 3 1 xrd for mineralogy xrd analyses were performed to provide the mineralogical composition of these samples the diffraction spectrum was recorded for each powder sized less than75 μm sample by x ray diffractometer shimadzu maxima x xrd 7000 with cukα radiation at a speed of 2 min and the variation of diffraction angle was from 2 to 70 the xrd data were then analyzed with jade 9 software using the whole pattern empirical peak profile fitting method to determine the average mass of minerals 2 3 2 sem imaging the use of sem can help to effectively evaluate the pore structure characteristics such as intra and inter particle pores organic matter hosted pores micro fractures as well as the correlation between pore space and minerals klaver et al 2015b fandrich et al 2007 two fossil rich white and gray chalk samples were examined by sem samples were sandpaper polished argon ion milled with torr crc 100 sputtering system pt coated and observed using field emission sem hitachi s 4800 with a working current of 10 kv 2 3 3 grain size distribution measurement of finest fraction after ball milling previous studies of effect of grain size distribution on rock heterogeneity revealed that natural rock with a uniform grain size distribution may appear homogeneous otherwise the heterogeneity will be much more obvious khasainov et al 1997 fitch et al 2015 in our work each intact sample was ball milled to separate the minerals and then grain size distributions of the produced granular powders were obtained using a shimadzu sald 7101 grain size analyzer several parameters were obtained from grain size analyses for heterogeneity evaluation including the characteristic grain diameter dx where dx is the characteristic grain size where x of the mass is finer than dx the uniformity coefficient cu cu d60 d10 the curvature coefficient cc cc d30 2 d10 d60 the material is classified as well graded namely heterogeneous when the cu values are 5 and the cc falls between 1 and 3 jia et al 2016 2 3 4 mip measurement pore structure characteristics of natural rocks have long been investigated by mip analyses porcheron et al 2004 kaufmann et al 2009 schmitt et al 2013 gao and hu 2018 oven dried 1 cm cubic samples were subjected to mip analyses at pressures from 0 034 mpa to 413 mpa with micromeritics autopore 9520 the corresponding detectable pore throat diameter ranged from 45 000 to 2 8 nm based on the washburn equation katz and thompson 1986 gao and hu 2018 the fractal dimension of pore structure based on mip is helpful for the heterogeneity evaluation of natural rocks specifically the mip test derived fractal dimension for the entire range of pores the total dimension d can be applied as a key parameter to quantify the rock heterogeneity according to fractal theory mandelbrot 1982 katz and thompson 1985 it was generally believed that larger values of the total fractal dimension correlate to higher heterogeneity of pore structure li et al 2017 wang et al 2021 1 log s w log 1 s hg 3 d log r 3 d log r max where s w is the cumulative pore volume fraction s hg is the mercury saturation d is the fractal dimension r max is the maximum of the pore radius μm as the natural rocks have a wide spectrum of nm µm pore sizes the fractal dimensions of mesopores d 1 transitional pores d 2 and micropores d 3 were calculated according to eq 1 in three pore size intervals the total fractal dimension d of the entire pore space was obtained by the weighted average of porosity of mesopores transitional pores and micropores 2 d d 1 1 d 2 2 d 3 3 1 2 3 where 1 2 and 3 are the porosities corresponding to pore throat diameters in the 100 1000 nm 10 100 nm and 2 5 10 nm ranges 2 3 5 porosity measurements of crushed rock samples a measurement of accessible porosity can be obtained by a combination of bulk density and true particle density measurements of both intact and crushed rocks api rp40 1998 zhao et al 2021 the bulk density of an oven dried granular sample was determined with micromeritics geopyc 1365 a displacement measurement equipment tiny 127 40 µm solid materials namely dryflotm were used to envelop the samples for bulk volume measurements the volume of sample and the total volume of sample and dryflotm particles were calculated under rotating movement and desired pressure the sample bulk density was calculated by dividing sample mass by the difference between two calculated volumes a modified geopyc method zhao et al 2021 using solid quartz powder less than 75 μm in dia to substitute dryflotm particles was applied for the bulk density analyses of small sized granular samples typically 75 1000 μm in dia in addition true skeletal or grain density of porous media was measured using a helium pycnometer density technique with micromeritics accupyc 1340 the working principle of this apparatus is to perform cycles of cell filling expulsion of helium and it is applicable for a wide range of μm cm sized samples the volume of the sample was determined by measuring the pressure change of helium and the volume of helium into the expansion cell after sample filling the volume of the sample cell was regularly calibrated using calibration standards e g steel balls to ensure a reproducibility of 0 01 with the specified sample weight true density was easily calculated more details of the helium pycnometer density measurement are presented elsewhere viana et al 2002 2 3 6 gas diffusion chamber method the diffusion coefficient is governed by the pore structure geometry and connectivity of the diffusive pathways the gas diffusion process and diffusivity measurement through packed non consolidated samples using two cell diffusion chamber apparatus was well described by rolston and moldrup 2002 all six rock samples with six different particle sizes were used in this work to achieve the research objectives the samples were first placed into a core holder on top of the diffusion chamber fig 1 the core holder and diffusion chamber were isolated from each other by a sliding metal plate and the diffusion chamber was purged with nitrogen gas to remove all oxygen then the metal slide was opened allowing the oxygen in the sample holder to diffuse into the diffusion chamber from both internal pores within particles and the space between particles fig 2 the oxygen concentration inside the chamber is monitored by an oxygen sensor connected to a campbell cr1000 data logger following the procedures reported by peng et al 2012 the oxygen diffusion coefficient was then analyzed based on the unsteady state method of currie 1960 and rolston and moldrup 2002 the relative oxygen concentration in the diffusion chamber c r can be calculated as 3 c r c t c s c 0 c s n 1 2 h e x p d p α n 2 t l α n 2 h 2 h where c 0 is the initial oxygen concentration c t is the concentration at time t c s is the atmospheric oxygen concentration l is the length of the sample h α where and α are air filled pore space both inter and intra granular pores percentage and the volume of the chamber per area respectively and α n is the positive root of α n l tan α n l hl the terms for n 2 are considered negligible with respect to the first term when the time is greater than zero and eq 3 is then reduced to 4 c r 2 h e x p d p α 1 2 t l α 1 2 h 2 h take the natural logarithm of both sides of eq 4 to obtain 5 lnc r l n 2 h l α 1 2 h 2 h d p α 1 2 t thus a negative linear relationship between lnc r and t with the slope of d p α 1 2 t is obtained in which pore or effective diffusion coefficient d p can be calculated with known α 1 and a penetration of oxygen into the diffusion chamber was caused by the oxygen concentration difference between the higher oxygen containing atmosphere both above and within the sample and the oxygen free diffusion chamber crushed rocks with both intra and inter particle pore space instead of non aggregated soils with negligible intra particle porosity were used in our study to evaluate the contribution of intra particle diffusivity implicated by pore connectivity since a molecule diffusing through the packed granular rocks could travel via the complex geometries both within the intra particle pore network and the void space between particles the diffusion process is controlled by the combination of inter and intra particle diffusion unlike inter particle diffusion intra particle diffusion is slower with tortuous pathways inside the particles therefore the prediction of the intra particle diffusion coefficient will shed light on the internal geometries of crushed rock samples assuming that the experimentally observed data are the sum of diffusion from two separate inter and intra particle pathways the c t is the sum of c t i n t e r and c t i n t r a eq 6 then according to eq 3 the relative intra particle oxygen concentration c r i n t r a at each time can be represented with eq 7 6 c t c t i n t e r c t i n t r a 7 c r i n t r a c t i n t r a c s c 0 c s c t c t i n t e r c s c 0 c s c t c s c 0 c s c t i n t e r c s c 0 c s c s c 0 c s where c t i n t e r and c t i n t r a are the oxygen concentrations from inter particle and intra particle diffusion at time t respectively when c 0 for oxygen concentration is close to 0 as the diffusion chamber initially was purged with nitrogen c s c 0 c s can be reduced to 1 thus at time t the c r i n t r a is 8 c r i n t r a c t c s c 0 c s c t i n t e r c s c 0 c s c s c 0 c s c r c r i n t e r 1 where c r i n t e r and c r i n t r a are the relative concentrations from inter particle and intra particle diffusion at time t respectively since granular samples involved in this study contain both inter and intra particle pathways an independent and experimental analysis of inter or intra particle diffusion of those samples is difficult a crushed solid quartz method was then utilized in this study to quantify the inter particle diffusion of crushed porous rock samples with intra particle pore space and diffusion this single crystal solid quartz sample is independently shown to contain no inner pore space with a measured porosity 0 011 0 009 by water immersion porosimetry with the same size fractions of crushed particles as rock samples being utilized to obtain inter particle diffusivity thus if the oxygen concentration is measured at two times δt apart eq 8 can be transformed into eq 9 at a time fig 3 9 δ c r i n t r a δ c r δ c r q u a r t z where δ c r δ c r i n t r a and δ c r q u a r t z are the relative oxygen concentrations increment from total intra particle and inter quartz particle diffusion at a unit time respectively to obtain δ c r we differentiate the variables on both sides of eq 5 10 1 c r d c r d p α 1 2 d t 11 δ c r d c r d p α 1 2 c r d t similarly δ c r q u a r t z can be calculated 12 δ c r q u a r t z d c r q u a r t z d p q u a r t z α 1 2 qtz c r q u a r t z d t where qtz is the air filled pore space percentage in packed bed of quartz grains consequently the sum of δ c r i n t r a can provide us with the intra particle diffusion profile of oxygen tracer for the granular rock sample 13 c r i n t r a δ c r i n t r a d t once c r i n t r a is obtained the intra particle oxygen diffusion coefficient can be calculated based on eq 5 currie 1960 rolston and moldrup 2002 in this study six rock samples with six different particle sizes were oven dried at 60 c for two days and packed in a pvc cylindrical sample holder 3 5 cm in inner diameter and 4 0 cm in length for gas diffusion analyses to limit the heterogeneous compaction effect a packing method with multiple layers was used and samples were shaken well at each layer when the sample was poured into the holder 2 3 7 batch sorption method the batch sorption experiments were carried out using air dried crushed rock samples under atmospheric conditions and room temperature of 22 0 2 c astm d4646 16 2016 a range of anionic and cationic tracers e g br and cs at 0 01 mm concentrations were used as tracer solution and 1 mm calcium nitrate as an electrolyte solution to represent a dilute groundwater system three tracer solution controls no solid samples were prepared to allow the assessment of any interaction of tracers with the apparatus e g centrifuge tubes and caps for each rock specimen triplicate samples were conducted with tracer solution and duplicate samples with electrolyte solution no spiked tracer for assessing the background levels of these tracers the amount of rock and solution was accurately weighted out to be 0 5 g and 2 ml respectively with a relatively large solid volume ratio being 250 g l batch sorption experiments were carried out by following procedures similar to methods commonly used in the literature astm d4646 16 2016 hu et al 2005 karickhoff 1980 briefly both solid and solution were mixed in 15 ml polyethylene centrifuge tubes for sorption with a reaction time of 24 h irrespective of reaching sorption equilibrium or not astm d4646 16 2016 the mixtures were centrifuged at 4 000 revolutions per minute for 10 min and then further filtered using 0 25 μm supor membrane under a gentle vacuum and 0 5 ml filtrate was then mixed with 2 5 ml 1 high purity nitric acid for icp ms analyses the sorption ability of each sample for each tracer was calculated from the differences between initial and final concentrations using the following equation 14 k d c c e c e v m where k d is the adsorption coefficient ml g c and c e are the initial and equilibrium or final concentrations of each tracer mg l respectively v is the volume ml of solution m is the mass g of adsorbent used on a dry basis with the moisture content of air dry samples obtained from oven drying at 105 c for two days a high k d value suggests higher tracer retention by the crushed rock through sorption and chemical reaction on the contrary a low k d value indicates that a larger amount of the tracer remains in the solution for a higher tracer mobility in the aqueous phase veeresh et al 2003 shaheen et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 mineralogy as shown in table 3 israel white chalk israel gray chalk and japan mudstone samples contain significant amounts of clay minerals while edwards limestone wyoming dolostone and grimsel granodiorite are low clay content samples specifically similar clay contents at around 30 40 by weight are found in israel gray chalk and israel white chalk containing 4 4 and 37 9 of illite respectively in japan mudstone clay minerals are dominated by illite and kaolinite at 12 3 each no clay minerals were detected in edwards limestone or grimsel granodiorite and few are in wyoming dolostone three carbonate rocks are composed of high calcite concentrations 99 6 in edwards limestone 61 5 in israel white chalk and 65 8 in israel gray chalk in addition grimsel granodiorite exhibits high feldspar content with 49 5 weight percent albite and 12 5 anorthite 3 2 grain size distribution and pore structure characteristics the measured grain size distribution after ball milling for each sample is plotted in fig 4 the results illustrate that edwards limestone and grimsel granodiorite can be classified as being well graded with uniformity coefficients cu of 27 2 and 14 6 respectively this also indicates that the pore structures of these two samples the heterogeneous group could be likely heterogeneous on the other hand the relatively homogeneous pore structure of israel gray chalk israel white chalk wyoming dolostone and japan mudstone the homogeneous group can be related to their poorly graded grain sizes curvature coefficients cc of these four rock samples are equal to or less than 1 and the cu values are 6 4 7 86 6 4 and 1 51 respectively table 4 fig 5 shows the capillary pressure curves obtained from the mip tests for 1 cm cubes of five rocks data are not available for wyoming dolostone the hysteresis loop in the intrusion extrusion cycles of our samples indicated that mercury entrapment occurred and pore systems in these natural rocks were heterogeneously distributed kaufmann et al 2009 plötze and niemz 2011 fractal dimensions obtained from mip table 5 show that edwards limestone and grimsel granodiorite display higher entire fractal dimension values 2 37 and 2 34 respectively indicating that the pore throat structure for these two samples of heterogeneous group are complex and heterogeneous which is also consistent with the grain size distribution analyses compared to edwards limestone and grimsel granodiorite israel white chalk israel gray chalk and japan mudstone the heterogeneous group have lower fractal dimension values of 2 23 1 82 and 1 89 correspondingly suggesting relatively homogeneous pore throat structure for these four samples 3 3 effective porosities for rock samples at different particle sizes consistent with grain size distribution and mip analyses in the heterogeneous group edwards limestone and grimsel granodiorite a noticeable increase in intra particle porosity from coupled bulk particle densities is observed as the particle size decreases however the four other rocks in the homogeneous group israel gray chalk israel white chalk wyoming dolostone and japan mudstone exhibit a much smaller porosity change with crushed particle size fractions fig 6 a the edwards limestone sample used in this study was reported to have a highly heterogeneous pore geometry johannesen et al 2007 the mineral and structural heterogeneity of grimsel granodiorite also has been reported in previous works sammaljärvi et al 2012 voutilainen et al 2017 the increase in effective porosity reflects the increase in accessibility to various regions of the pore space as a result of particle size reduction resulting in the liberation of isolated pores and better connectivity zhao et al 2021 due to the strong heterogeneity and poorly connected pore space such sample size dependent effect of effective internal porosity is apparent from the different crushed particle size fractions used in this study on the other hand samples including white chalk gray chalk and dolostone are more related to the homogeneous group and have relatively uniform pore structures for these homogeneous samples the crushed rock has already reached a critical value of representative elementary volume rev in a smaller volume shah et al 2017 which is below the least tested length of 75 µm in this work the smaller relative porosity change in the chalk samples is in agreement with the results reported by vik et al 2013 and zhao et al 2021 as a result the petrophysical property of israel chalks varies much less with the particle size range and even can be treated as homogeneous at these observational scales normally an increase in helium porosity of crushed organic rich and deep mudstone has been observed in previous particle size effect studies tinni et al 2012 ma et al 2014 however in our work the japan mudstone sample came from the wakkanai formation which is composed of typically homogeneous siliceous mudstone at a depth of 358 m ishii et al 2011 aoyagi ishii 2019 and therefore the resultant particle porosities are relatively constant in the range of 75 8000 µm hu et al 2021 reported the dramatic difference in pore connectivity between shallow and deep mudstone as the organic matter rich and deep mudstones are subjected to additional maturation process to alter the pore structure and exhibit poor pore connectivity as compared to the compaction and diagenesis of shallow mudstones the wyoming dolostone sample is also homogeneous with mostly the presence of intercrystalline pore space westphal et al 2004 and displays stable physical properties across the particle size fractions to summarize at the observational scales of 75 8000 µm edwards limestone and grimsel granodiorite the heterogeneous group are heterogeneous porous media showing scale dependent porosities whereas white chalk gray chalk dolostone and shallow mudstone are more of a homogeneous type and the particle size has less effect on the crushed internal porosities of these four rocks 3 4 intra particle gas diffusion the gas diffusion test is a compelling physical transfer approach to understanding pore connectivity and tortuous pathways of natural rocks diffusion results show a notable tendency of increasing intra particle diffusion coefficient and its proportion with the decrease of particle size in heterogeneous edwards limestone and grimsel granodiorite fig 6b c table 6 the proportion of intra particle diffusion in the whole diffusion process of these two samples increases from 3 28 to 27 01 and 1 21 to 20 91 respectively from large 2380 8000 μm to small 75 177 μm particle size fractions it is reported that the heterogeneous edwards limestone commonly contains intercrystalline pores and micropores as well as larger pores johannesen et al 2007 yoo et al 2019 the larger diffusion coefficients in smaller sized particles are attributed to the opening of intercrystalline pathways in edwards limestone since the granodiorite sample came from the grimsel test site in switzerland which has been used as low permeability and heterogeneous material david et al 2018 schneeberger et al 2019 the diffusivity of grimsel granodiorite is the lowest table 6 due to its low matrix permeability and poor pore connectivity kc et al 2019 israel white chalk and israel gray chalk whitthueser et al 2000 have similar porosities across the whole range of particle sizes and the intra particle diffusion coefficients increase with the decreasing particle sizes notably the gray chalk particles exhibit a higher diffusivity than the white chalk nearly twice as great table 6 fig 6b therefore greater pore connectivity is expected within gray chalk the intrafossil pore space 3 μm observed from the sem images in white chalk is mainly within chalk coccoliths rings which could provide limited connected pore space fig 7 a b however abundant hollow internal chambers 30 μm in foraminifera were widely present in gray chalk fig 7c d these foraminifera shells could provide ideal effective and connected pore space for mass transfer the median pore throat size of white chalk obtained from mip tests is 0 42 µm which is slightly larger than that of gray chalk 0 39 µm these two chalk samples with similar porosity but displaying different gas diffusion behavior illustrate the importance of the pore structure effect on mass transport this observation also implies that a more rapid mass transfer behavior can be achieved with better pore connectivity the topological attribute of pore structure even though those samples exhibit similar values of porosities in contrast the intra particle diffusion coefficients of crushed japan mudstone and wyoming dolostone remain roughly constant over the tested ranges of particle sizes fig 6b the gas diffusion run on a monolithic japan mudstone sample 1 cm3 cube exhibits a smaller 3 11 10 7 m2 s by a factor of 4 diffusion coefficient than the intra particle diffusion coefficient of crushed japan mudstone table 6 this indirectly verifies the versatile approach of using solid quartz grains to experimentally and theoretically obtain the intra particle diffusivity for a wide range of natural rocks with different pore structure characteristics these homogeneous within the observational scales of 75 8000 µm samples reach the rev quickly at smaller sample size and the crushed particle sizes in our work are regarded to be already above the length scale of rev in other words the pore structure of these samples would likely be similar for six particle sizes and then the diffusion contribution from the intra particle pathways is constant for the effective intra particle diffusivity to be similar in the same magnitude of 10 6 m2 s in addition pore connectivity may dominate intra particle diffusion behavior grimsel granodiorite has similar porosity to wyoming dolostone but with its poor pore connectivity it has lower intra particle diffusivity than wyoming dolostone 3 5 batch sorption results for anionic and cationic tracers both anions and cations are widely applied as tracers in studying chemical sorption onto porous media the batch sorption tests using six natural rocks in six particle sizes ranges interacting with various inorganic anionic and cationic tracers were used to assess the magnitude of sorption and identify governing parameters including the mineral composition surface area and pore structure analyses of the variance for bromide br results show that no noticeable sorption is observed between different samples fig 8 this indicates that anionic bromide is a conservative tracer under the experimental conditions for these samples with a negligible amount of metal hydro oxides in accordance with results presented by many researchers such as levy and chambers 1987 fig 8 also presents varying extents of sorption of other anionic tracers some sorption of seo4 2 is related to plagioclase li et al 2018 which consists of albite and anorthite grimsel granodiorite with plagioclase as the dominant mineral barnes 1988 li et al 2018 table 3 also has a relatively higher seo4 2 sorption amount with k d values ranging from 2 to 4 ml g by comparison the seo4 2 k d values of other five rocks are close to 0 ml g with no measurable sorption fig 8 also shows that the kaolinite rich japan mudstone particles demonstrate a strong sorption capacity for anionic cro4 2 as compared to other five rocks specifically k d values of cro4 2 for japan mudstone particles 104 ml g is one order of magnitude higher than those of other rocks 103 ml g which is in good agreement with the high sorption capacity of kaolinite clay reported by helios rybicka and wójcik 2012 similar to cro4 2 the anionic but larger sized sb2 complex is quite sorptive in japan mudstone as well our results show the sorption capacities of sb2 complex on the japan mudstone particles 105 ml g were much higher several orders of magnitude than those on the other five rock samples 10 ml g the high sorption capacity of sb2 complex on japan mudstone is due to its rich content of amorphous iron principally opal a fan et al 2013 sasamoto et al 2018 nishimura et al 2022 high sorption of heavy metals monovalent cs and divalent ba2 cations have been observed for high clay content samples israel chalks and japan mudstone with k d values around 100 ml g and 10000 ml g for ba2 and cs respectively fig 9 b with a predominant presence of k in the interlayer space illite has been known to strongly sorb cs from its displacement of k bradbury and baeyens 2000 zachara et al 2002 for low clay content samples edwards limestone wyoming dolostone and grimsel granodiorite a smaller but still appreciable sorption of cs with k d values ranging from 50 to 100 ml g was observed fig 9a overall the batch sorption tests provide a cost effective and broad perspective for the sorption extent of a wide range of chemicals at different forms molecular sizes and reactivities which are related to mineral components of natural rocks notably batch sorption coefficients in some tracers may have been detected to a level close to the error bars especially for anionic tracer bromide br in fig 8 these results are considered within experimental errors considering the low average batch sorption coefficients values smaller than 1 for those tracers while column transport studies can be conducted for low kd chemical fluid solid systems hu 2022 in addition the associated error bars are much lower compared to the observed values for tracers of ba2 and cs since the batch sorption coefficients are around several hundred figs 9 10 3 6 effect of adsorbent particle sizes on chemical sorption investigating the performance of natural rocks in relation to their particle size has been an important aspect of sorption process as arbitrarily used particle sizes are used to describe the sorption contribution of intact rocks giammar et al 2007 venegas et al 2007 li et al 2019b tachi et al 2021 which lead to uncertainty in evaluating the in situ contribution of sorption in waste containment hu 2019 a relationship between the particle size and the sorptive capacity has been established the extent of sorption increases with decreasing particle size and powder form contains the highest adsorptive capacity kara et al 2007 raposo et al 2009 ikenyiri ukpaka 2016 our experimental results fig 10 also indicate that sample particle size has an effect on the sorption capacities of several tracers as the particle size decreases the sorption capacity of sm3 and eu3 increases among grimsel granodiorite japan mudstone and wyoming dolostone for homogeneous rocks stronger sorption capacity in smaller sized particles stems from the increase of specific external surface area surface area per unit mass available for tracer s adsorption matsui et al 2011 therefore the external surface areas in smaller sized japan mudstone and wyoming dolostone particles are larger compared to larger sized particles with increasing sorption of sm3 and eu3 in contrast for heterogeneous rocks like grimsel granodiorite the increasing sorption can be attributed to both the better connectivity and higher external surface area resulting from the decrease in particle sizes sepulveda et al 2001 hou et al 2017 mastalerz et al 2017 both grimsel granodiorite and edwards limestone exhibit poor pore connectivity and sample size dependent accessibility to sorptive pore space from independent analyses of grain size distribution mip and effective porosity by densities methods sections 3 2 3 3 however for a tracer fluid rock system with either very strong or weak sorption this difference in pore accessibility can be overshadowed by the overwhelming chemical effect the results also show negligible effects of particle size on the tracer sorption of edwards limestone and israel chalks within a particle size ranging from 75 to 8000 µm this was probably due to the similar maximum sorption capacity of these three rocks furthermore literature results stipp et al 2003 zavarin et al 2005 show that sm3 and eu3 are adsorbed to calcite which is the main mineral of edwards limestone and israel chalks table 3 in general particles with smaller sizes experience higher surface area resulting in a higher sorption capacity notwithstanding the sorption capacities of particles from limestone and israel chalks probably reach the peak when the particle size ranges from 2380 to 8000 µm the upper range of our size sizes meaning that the strongly sorbed sm3 and eu3 in the solution were completely absorbed hence smaller size particles less than 2380 µm with a higher surface area can easily reach the same maximum capacity and the particle size effect was negligible 4 conclusions through integrated pore structure studies with gas diffusion and aqueous phase chemical sorption for six natural rocks with six different sample sizes we conclude that a smaller sample scale could have positive effects on pore connectivity for relatively heterogeneous rocks as well as on mass transport properties for comparatively homogeneous geological media the change of pore connectivity in various sample sizes is relatively small indicating relative independence of physical and chemical transport properties on particle sizes furthermore the nontrivial contributions of clay minerals and particle size effect on the ionic sorption capacity of natural rock samples were also confirmed in this study future studies will include dynamic column transport with a range of sample sizes and water saturation as the equilibrium type batch sorption tests while being practical and cost effective to produce a broad brush understanding of the relative magnitude of various chemicals in a fluid tracer rock system indicates a maximum interaction which is not representative of the field conditions where fluid rock interactions are momentary and kinetics controlled in addition the unique gas diffusion approach with oxygen gas tracer will need to verify the chemical interactions with a wide range of natural rocks to separate the potential diffusive flux from both physical and chemical process using a newly custom designed apparatus of multiple gas tracers hu 2022 credit authorship contribution statement xiaoqing yuan investigation formal analysis visualization writing original draft qinhong hu

2198,six rocks one granodiorite one limestone two chalks one mudstone and one dolostone with different extents of heterogeneity at six different particle sizes from 75 to 8000 μm were studied to describe the effects of pore connectivity on mass transport the methods applied were i porosity measurement of granular rocks ii analyses of gas phase diffusive transport in a bed of packed particles along with a solid quartz method at these six particle sizes being developed to identify the contribution of intraparticle diffusion and iii batch sorption tests of multiple ions anions and cations with subsequent analyses of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry granular porosity measurement results reveal that with decreasing particle sizes the effective porosities for the heterogenous group of rocks grimsel granodiorite and edwards limestone increase whereas the porosities of another homogeneous group two israel chalk samples japan mudstone and wyoming dolostone remain constant gas diffusion results show that the intraparticle gas diffusion coefficient among these two sample groups varying in the magnitude of 10 8 to 10 6 m2 s are not directly correlated to the porosity differences moreover the batch sorption work displays a different affinity of rocks for various tracers for grimsel granodiorite japan mudstone and wyoming dolostone the adsorption capacity of sm3 and eu3 increases as the particle size decreases in general this integrated research of grain size distribution granular rock porosity intraparticle diffusivity and ionic sorption capacity gives insights

within porous rocks is influenced by pore structure which combines geometry e g pore shape pore size pore size distribution and pore surface area and topology e g pore connectivity dullien 1979 hu et al 2012 the effective porosity e i e the portion of total porosity t wherein solute transport occurs can be less than the overall pore space of the medium because of the presence of isolated and dead end pores that do not contribute to the overall transport or sometimes because of size exclusion of solute molecules in sub nm sized pore space hu 2022 various studies pointed out a larger effective porosity from a better connectivity aspect of pore structure may occur in smaller sized samples due to the opening of isolated pores in heterogeneous and tight rocks hu et al 2012 wu et al 2018 davudov moghanloo 2018 fu et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 it has also been widely reported that porous media with various pore structure characteristics usually display different mass transfer behaviors hu et al 2002 kosuge et al 2007 sun et al 2017 yang et al 2018 li et al 2019a the determination of the effects of pore connectivity on transport processes has been improved by applying both physically based fluid flow and chemically related reactive transport experiments as well as associated theoretical analyses e g tachi et al 1998 ewing horton 2002 hu et al 2012 peng et al 2012 hu et al 2015 yan et al 2018 measurement of gas diffusion with non reactive and conservative gas tracers is an efficient approach to probing the pore structure of and mass transport through various natural rocks moldrup et al 2005 peng et al 2012 it is generally believed that for non reactive tracers the ratio of the pore diffusion coefficient d p in porous geomaterials to that in free air d 0 is governed only by the pore network parameters e g porosity pore size distribution and tortuosity fick s second law of diffusion has been employed to evaluate the non steady state diffusion fluxes in previous research the gas diffusion coefficient has been measured in soils using the method described by currie 1960 peng et al 2012 first investigated the effect of pore structure on diffusivity using currie s method to conduct gas diffusion tests in 11 intact rocks and reported that the intact samples with smaller mean pore size and wider pore size distribution exhibited lower gas diffusivities in granular and aggregated media such as fine grained rocks like shale diffusion can occur through both intra particle and inter particle pathways and their respective contributions to transport in such packed granular samples have not been thoroughly investigated hu and wang 2003 phounglamcheik et al 2022 attempted to evaluate the effect of intra particle and inter particle diffusion on the reaction rate of char gasification using thermogravimetric analysis based on various particle size distributions of samples and they found that the intra particle diffusion can be roughly estimated from the mean of the particle size distribution to summarize previous studies have mainly focused on intra particle diffusion affected either by mean pore size or particle size distribution without considering the effect of crushed granular sizes furthermore the influence of pore connectivity related to rock type heterogeneity and resultant particle size dependent effective porosity hu 2022 on intra particle diffusion has not been examined in this work we used the two chamber diffusion method originated by currie 1960 and later developed by rolston and moldrup 2002 with oxygen as the gas tracer to examine the effects of particle size and pore connectivity on intra particle diffusion in six different particle sizes of six rocks with different extents of heterogeneity ionic sorption and transport in natural rocks is linked to their pore connectivity via sample size dependent effective porosity and accessible pore surface hu et al 2015 the sorption capacity of ions onto adsorbents owing to their ability of selective binding has been well documented for both geological and industrial materials he et al 2011 chemical characteristics surface area pore structure and initial concentration of adsorbate have long been indicated as parameters in controlling ionic sorption and transport in various engineering and geological materials chang lenhoff 1998 li et al 2012 punyapalakul et al 2013 wang et al 2015 hong et al 2019 for example the importance of pore connectivity was suggested by chang and lenhoff 1998 as it influences the upper limit of adsorptive uptake particles with larger sizes are correlated with reduced adsorption wang et al 2015 nonetheless many geological media such as sedimentary and igneous rocks being made up of various minerals are different from industrial man made materials involved in previous studies mohammed et al 2021 moreover due to the specific physical structure and chemical properties mineral compositions vary in their sorption capacities for binding different ions for instance the presence of layered clay minerals increases the sorption properties corresponding to the presence of interlayer surface area zhuang and yu 2002 and also exhibits higher adsorption affinities for heavy metals such as cs and ba2 yao et al 2020 musso et al 2022 accordingly the combined effects of pore connectivity and component minerals on mass transport in natural rocks have been insufficiently investigated the adsorption capacity is strongly correlated with the accessible inner and external surface area influenced by pore connectivity and particle sizes and intrinsic adsorption affinity controlled by component minerals therefore in this work six geologically different rocks with six different particle sizes were chosen to present various extents of pore connectivities particle sizes and component minerals in natural rocks that are important for energy and environmental geosciences the pore connectivity was investigated by grain size distribution mercury intrusion porosimetry mip size dependent effective porosity with the measurement of both particle and bulk densities and intra particle and inter particle gas diffusion a series of batch adsorption experiments were then conducted with a suite of tracer chemicals both anions and cations with non sorbing and sorbing nature to assess the sorption capacity of the six rock samples with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms analyses a robust and sensitive technique used to detect multiple elements of both tracers and intrinsic elements hu et al 2005 hu and mao 2012 in summary the objectives of this work are to investigate the impacts of pore connectivity and particle sizes on the mass transport behaviors of several natural rocks based on complementary approaches of pore structure characterization gas diffusion and batch adsorption experiments six rocks including one limestone one granodiorite two israel chalks white and gray one mudstone and one dolostone were crushed and sieved into six particle sizes to investigate the particle size effect and associated pore connectivity basic properties were analyzed for mineralogy and pore types with x ray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem grain size distribution and pore structure were evaluated using laser diffraction and mip the porosity of each crushed rock with a specific particle size was measured to analyze the scale dependent effective porosities of these natural rocks the intra particle diffusivity was quantified using the solid quartz method developed in this work in addition the sorption capacity of each granular specimen for various tracers was obtained from batch sorption tests the particle size and sorption capability of rocks and associated mineral components were analyzed based on adsorption results finally the relationships among the particle sizes pore connectivity intra particle diffusivity and ionic sorption capabilities of these six natural rocks were discussed the results and findings in this study will provide valuable information for the mass transport assessment in various porous media with a coupled perspective of pore structure and physical chemical processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample selection six natural rock samples with different extents of heterogeneity at different observational scales were selected for this work including sedimentary limestone white chalk gray chalk mudstone and dolostone and igneous granodiorite types table 1 complex component particles from biological and non biological origins associated with post depositional evolution result in a tremendously heterogeneous distribution of pores and a high value of tortuosity in limestone choquette and pray 1970 regnet et al 2019 chalk is commonly regarded as a sedimentary rock that is homogeneous at the measurement scales of the physical properties siemers et al 1994 mitchell et al 1997 fabricius 2007 however microfossils e g foraminifera and chalk coccolith have been observed in chalk matrix schlanger and douglas 1974 mitchell et al 1997 two chalk samples white and gray were used in this work most shallow and organic matter poor mudstones are lithologically homogeneous but with very fine pores and large tortuosity as excellent caprocks hu et al 2015 klaver et al 2015a yang et al 2019 hu et al 2021 the dolostone is homogeneous with respect to its constituent dolomite crystals jones et al 2001 allen et al 2002 jones and luth 2003 in addition granodiorite is generally composed of feldspars quartz and micas with various grain sizes on the order of mm scales the heterogeneity of minerals and pore structure of natural granodiorite has been studied extensively mostly from the perspective of a geological repository for high level nuclear waste voutilainen et al 2017 david et al 2018 regnet et al 2019 david et al 2018 discussed the presence of tiny pores isolated from the interconnected network in granodiorite by coupled broad ion beam sem observations 2 2 sample preparation the six samples included both heterogeneous and relatively homogeneous rock types these intact rocks from either outcrops or cores were first crushed and sieved under one passing according to astm c136 01 2017 using a stack of stainless sieves with mesh sizes of 0 075 10 18 0 5 0 85 1 7 and 2 36 mm therefore particle sizes of crushed samples range in the sequence of 2360 8000 1700 2360 841 1700 500 841 177 500 and 75 177 μm moreover other pieces of intact samples were also ball milled to powder for xrd and grain size distribution analyses and cut into 1 cm cube for mip measurement consequently the effects of heterogeneity and particle size on pore structure and mass transport both gas diffusion and liquid sorption behaviors could be evaluated by using these six rock samples at different particle sizes table 2 2 3 methods 2 3 1 xrd for mineralogy xrd analyses were performed to provide the mineralogical composition of these samples the diffraction spectrum was recorded for each powder sized less than75 μm sample by x ray diffractometer shimadzu maxima x xrd 7000 with cukα radiation at a speed of 2 min and the variation of diffraction angle was from 2 to 70 the xrd data were then analyzed with jade 9 software using the whole pattern empirical peak profile fitting method to determine the average mass of minerals 2 3 2 sem imaging the use of sem can help to effectively evaluate the pore structure characteristics such as intra and inter particle pores organic matter hosted pores micro fractures as well as the correlation between pore space and minerals klaver et al 2015b fandrich et al 2007 two fossil rich white and gray chalk samples were examined by sem samples were sandpaper polished argon ion milled with torr crc 100 sputtering system pt coated and observed using field emission sem hitachi s 4800 with a working current of 10 kv 2 3 3 grain size distribution measurement of finest fraction after ball milling previous studies of effect of grain size distribution on rock heterogeneity revealed that natural rock with a uniform grain size distribution may appear homogeneous otherwise the heterogeneity will be much more obvious khasainov et al 1997 fitch et al 2015 in our work each intact sample was ball milled to separate the minerals and then grain size distributions of the produced granular powders were obtained using a shimadzu sald 7101 grain size analyzer several parameters were obtained from grain size analyses for heterogeneity evaluation including the characteristic grain diameter dx where dx is the characteristic grain size where x of the mass is finer than dx the uniformity coefficient cu cu d60 d10 the curvature coefficient cc cc d30 2 d10 d60 the material is classified as well graded namely heterogeneous when the cu values are 5 and the cc falls between 1 and 3 jia et al 2016 2 3 4 mip measurement pore structure characteristics of natural rocks have long been investigated by mip analyses porcheron et al 2004 kaufmann et al 2009 schmitt et al 2013 gao and hu 2018 oven dried 1 cm cubic samples were subjected to mip analyses at pressures from 0 034 mpa to 413 mpa with micromeritics autopore 9520 the corresponding detectable pore throat diameter ranged from 45 000 to 2 8 nm based on the washburn equation katz and thompson 1986 gao and hu 2018 the fractal dimension of pore structure based on mip is helpful for the heterogeneity evaluation of natural rocks specifically the mip test derived fractal dimension for the entire range of pores the total dimension d can be applied as a key parameter to quantify the rock heterogeneity according to fractal theory mandelbrot 1982 katz and thompson 1985 it was generally believed that larger values of the total fractal dimension correlate to higher heterogeneity of pore structure li et al 2017 wang et al 2021 1 log s w log 1 s hg 3 d log r 3 d log r max where s w is the cumulative pore volume fraction s hg is the mercury saturation d is the fractal dimension r max is the maximum of the pore radius μm as the natural rocks have a wide spectrum of nm µm pore sizes the fractal dimensions of mesopores d 1 transitional pores d 2 and micropores d 3 were calculated according to eq 1 in three pore size intervals the total fractal dimension d of the entire pore space was obtained by the weighted average of porosity of mesopores transitional pores and micropores 2 d d 1 1 d 2 2 d 3 3 1 2 3 where 1 2 and 3 are the porosities corresponding to pore throat diameters in the 100 1000 nm 10 100 nm and 2 5 10 nm ranges 2 3 5 porosity measurements of crushed rock samples a measurement of accessible porosity can be obtained by a combination of bulk density and true particle density measurements of both intact and crushed rocks api rp40 1998 zhao et al 2021 the bulk density of an oven dried granular sample was determined with micromeritics geopyc 1365 a displacement measurement equipment tiny 127 40 µm solid materials namely dryflotm were used to envelop the samples for bulk volume measurements the volume of sample and the total volume of sample and dryflotm particles were calculated under rotating movement and desired pressure the sample bulk density was calculated by dividing sample mass by the difference between two calculated volumes a modified geopyc method zhao et al 2021 using solid quartz powder less than 75 μm in dia to substitute dryflotm particles was applied for the bulk density analyses of small sized granular samples typically 75 1000 μm in dia in addition true skeletal or grain density of porous media was measured using a helium pycnometer density technique with micromeritics accupyc 1340 the working principle of this apparatus is to perform cycles of cell filling expulsion of helium and it is applicable for a wide range of μm cm sized samples the volume of the sample was determined by measuring the pressure change of helium and the volume of helium into the expansion cell after sample filling the volume of the sample cell was regularly calibrated using calibration standards e g steel balls to ensure a reproducibility of 0 01 with the specified sample weight true density was easily calculated more details of the helium pycnometer density measurement are presented elsewhere viana et al 2002 2 3 6 gas diffusion chamber method the diffusion coefficient is governed by the pore structure geometry and connectivity of the diffusive pathways the gas diffusion process and diffusivity measurement through packed non consolidated samples using two cell diffusion chamber apparatus was well described by rolston and moldrup 2002 all six rock samples with six different particle sizes were used in this work to achieve the research objectives the samples were first placed into a core holder on top of the diffusion chamber fig 1 the core holder and diffusion chamber were isolated from each other by a sliding metal plate and the diffusion chamber was purged with nitrogen gas to remove all oxygen then the metal slide was opened allowing the oxygen in the sample holder to diffuse into the diffusion chamber from both internal pores within particles and the space between particles fig 2 the oxygen concentration inside the chamber is monitored by an oxygen sensor connected to a campbell cr1000 data logger following the procedures reported by peng et al 2012 the oxygen diffusion coefficient was then analyzed based on the unsteady state method of currie 1960 and rolston and moldrup 2002 the relative oxygen concentration in the diffusion chamber c r can be calculated as 3 c r c t c s c 0 c s n 1 2 h e x p d p α n 2 t l α n 2 h 2 h where c 0 is the initial oxygen concentration c t is the concentration at time t c s is the atmospheric oxygen concentration l is the length of the sample h α where and α are air filled pore space both inter and intra granular pores percentage and the volume of the chamber per area respectively and α n is the positive root of α n l tan α n l hl the terms for n 2 are considered negligible with respect to the first term when the time is greater than zero and eq 3 is then reduced to 4 c r 2 h e x p d p α 1 2 t l α 1 2 h 2 h take the natural logarithm of both sides of eq 4 to obtain 5 lnc r l n 2 h l α 1 2 h 2 h d p α 1 2 t thus a negative linear relationship between lnc r and t with the slope of d p α 1 2 t is obtained in which pore or effective diffusion coefficient d p can be calculated with known α 1 and a penetration of oxygen into the diffusion chamber was caused by the oxygen concentration difference between the higher oxygen containing atmosphere both above and within the sample and the oxygen free diffusion chamber crushed rocks with both intra and inter particle pore space instead of non aggregated soils with negligible intra particle porosity were used in our study to evaluate the contribution of intra particle diffusivity implicated by pore connectivity since a molecule diffusing through the packed granular rocks could travel via the complex geometries both within the intra particle pore network and the void space between particles the diffusion process is controlled by the combination of inter and intra particle diffusion unlike inter particle diffusion intra particle diffusion is slower with tortuous pathways inside the particles therefore the prediction of the intra particle diffusion coefficient will shed light on the internal geometries of crushed rock samples assuming that the experimentally observed data are the sum of diffusion from two separate inter and intra particle pathways the c t is the sum of c t i n t e r and c t i n t r a eq 6 then according to eq 3 the relative intra particle oxygen concentration c r i n t r a at each time can be represented with eq 7 6 c t c t i n t e r c t i n t r a 7 c r i n t r a c t i n t r a c s c 0 c s c t c t i n t e r c s c 0 c s c t c s c 0 c s c t i n t e r c s c 0 c s c s c 0 c s where c t i n t e r and c t i n t r a are the oxygen concentrations from inter particle and intra particle diffusion at time t respectively when c 0 for oxygen concentration is close to 0 as the diffusion chamber initially was purged with nitrogen c s c 0 c s can be reduced to 1 thus at time t the c r i n t r a is 8 c r i n t r a c t c s c 0 c s c t i n t e r c s c 0 c s c s c 0 c s c r c r i n t e r 1 where c r i n t e r and c r i n t r a are the relative concentrations from inter particle and intra particle diffusion at time t respectively since granular samples involved in this study contain both inter and intra particle pathways an independent and experimental analysis of inter or intra particle diffusion of those samples is difficult a crushed solid quartz method was then utilized in this study to quantify the inter particle diffusion of crushed porous rock samples with intra particle pore space and diffusion this single crystal solid quartz sample is independently shown to contain no inner pore space with a measured porosity 0 011 0 009 by water immersion porosimetry with the same size fractions of crushed particles as rock samples being utilized to obtain inter particle diffusivity thus if the oxygen concentration is measured at two times δt apart eq 8 can be transformed into eq 9 at a time fig 3 9 δ c r i n t r a δ c r δ c r q u a r t z where δ c r δ c r i n t r a and δ c r q u a r t z are the relative oxygen concentrations increment from total intra particle and inter quartz particle diffusion at a unit time respectively to obtain δ c r we differentiate the variables on both sides of eq 5 10 1 c r d c r d p α 1 2 d t 11 δ c r d c r d p α 1 2 c r d t similarly δ c r q u a r t z can be calculated 12 δ c r q u a r t z d c r q u a r t z d p q u a r t z α 1 2 qtz c r q u a r t z d t where qtz is the air filled pore space percentage in packed bed of quartz grains consequently the sum of δ c r i n t r a can provide us with the intra particle diffusion profile of oxygen tracer for the granular rock sample 13 c r i n t r a δ c r i n t r a d t once c r i n t r a is obtained the intra particle oxygen diffusion coefficient can be calculated based on eq 5 currie 1960 rolston and moldrup 2002 in this study six rock samples with six different particle sizes were oven dried at 60 c for two days and packed in a pvc cylindrical sample holder 3 5 cm in inner diameter and 4 0 cm in length for gas diffusion analyses to limit the heterogeneous compaction effect a packing method with multiple layers was used and samples were shaken well at each layer when the sample was poured into the holder 2 3 7 batch sorption method the batch sorption experiments were carried out using air dried crushed rock samples under atmospheric conditions and room temperature of 22 0 2 c astm d4646 16 2016 a range of anionic and cationic tracers e g br and cs at 0 01 mm concentrations were used as tracer solution and 1 mm calcium nitrate as an electrolyte solution to represent a dilute groundwater system three tracer solution controls no solid samples were prepared to allow the assessment of any interaction of tracers with the apparatus e g centrifuge tubes and caps for each rock specimen triplicate samples were conducted with tracer solution and duplicate samples with electrolyte solution no spiked tracer for assessing the background levels of these tracers the amount of rock and solution was accurately weighted out to be 0 5 g and 2 ml respectively with a relatively large solid volume ratio being 250 g l batch sorption experiments were carried out by following procedures similar to methods commonly used in the literature astm d4646 16 2016 hu et al 2005 karickhoff 1980 briefly both solid and solution were mixed in 15 ml polyethylene centrifuge tubes for sorption with a reaction time of 24 h irrespective of reaching sorption equilibrium or not astm d4646 16 2016 the mixtures were centrifuged at 4 000 revolutions per minute for 10 min and then further filtered using 0 25 μm supor membrane under a gentle vacuum and 0 5 ml filtrate was then mixed with 2 5 ml 1 high purity nitric acid for icp ms analyses the sorption ability of each sample for each tracer was calculated from the differences between initial and final concentrations using the following equation 14 k d c c e c e v m where k d is the adsorption coefficient ml g c and c e are the initial and equilibrium or final concentrations of each tracer mg l respectively v is the volume ml of solution m is the mass g of adsorbent used on a dry basis with the moisture content of air dry samples obtained from oven drying at 105 c for two days a high k d value suggests higher tracer retention by the crushed rock through sorption and chemical reaction on the contrary a low k d value indicates that a larger amount of the tracer remains in the solution for a higher tracer mobility in the aqueous phase veeresh et al 2003 shaheen et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 mineralogy as shown in table 3 israel white chalk israel gray chalk and japan mudstone samples contain significant amounts of clay minerals while edwards limestone wyoming dolostone and grimsel granodiorite are low clay content samples specifically similar clay contents at around 30 40 by weight are found in israel gray chalk and israel white chalk containing 4 4 and 37 9 of illite respectively in japan mudstone clay minerals are dominated by illite and kaolinite at 12 3 each no clay minerals were detected in edwards limestone or grimsel granodiorite and few are in wyoming dolostone three carbonate rocks are composed of high calcite concentrations 99 6 in edwards limestone 61 5 in israel white chalk and 65 8 in israel gray chalk in addition grimsel granodiorite exhibits high feldspar content with 49 5 weight percent albite and 12 5 anorthite 3 2 grain size distribution and pore structure characteristics the measured grain size distribution after ball milling for each sample is plotted in fig 4 the results illustrate that edwards limestone and grimsel granodiorite can be classified as being well graded with uniformity coefficients cu of 27 2 and 14 6 respectively this also indicates that the pore structures of these two samples the heterogeneous group could be likely heterogeneous on the other hand the relatively homogeneous pore structure of israel gray chalk israel white chalk wyoming dolostone and japan mudstone the homogeneous group can be related to their poorly graded grain sizes curvature coefficients cc of these four rock samples are equal to or less than 1 and the cu values are 6 4 7 86 6 4 and 1 51 respectively table 4 fig 5 shows the capillary pressure curves obtained from the mip tests for 1 cm cubes of five rocks data are not available for wyoming dolostone the hysteresis loop in the intrusion extrusion cycles of our samples indicated that mercury entrapment occurred and pore systems in these natural rocks were heterogeneously distributed kaufmann et al 2009 plötze and niemz 2011 fractal dimensions obtained from mip table 5 show that edwards limestone and grimsel granodiorite display higher entire fractal dimension values 2 37 and 2 34 respectively indicating that the pore throat structure for these two samples of heterogeneous group are complex and heterogeneous which is also consistent with the grain size distribution analyses compared to edwards limestone and grimsel granodiorite israel white chalk israel gray chalk and japan mudstone the heterogeneous group have lower fractal dimension values of 2 23 1 82 and 1 89 correspondingly suggesting relatively homogeneous pore throat structure for these four samples 3 3 effective porosities for rock samples at different particle sizes consistent with grain size distribution and mip analyses in the heterogeneous group edwards limestone and grimsel granodiorite a noticeable increase in intra particle porosity from coupled bulk particle densities is observed as the particle size decreases however the four other rocks in the homogeneous group israel gray chalk israel white chalk wyoming dolostone and japan mudstone exhibit a much smaller porosity change with crushed particle size fractions fig 6 a the edwards limestone sample used in this study was reported to have a highly heterogeneous pore geometry johannesen et al 2007 the mineral and structural heterogeneity of grimsel granodiorite also has been reported in previous works sammaljärvi et al 2012 voutilainen et al 2017 the increase in effective porosity reflects the increase in accessibility to various regions of the pore space as a result of particle size reduction resulting in the liberation of isolated pores and better connectivity zhao et al 2021 due to the strong heterogeneity and poorly connected pore space such sample size dependent effect of effective internal porosity is apparent from the different crushed particle size fractions used in this study on the other hand samples including white chalk gray chalk and dolostone are more related to the homogeneous group and have relatively uniform pore structures for these homogeneous samples the crushed rock has already reached a critical value of representative elementary volume rev in a smaller volume shah et al 2017 which is below the least tested length of 75 µm in this work the smaller relative porosity change in the chalk samples is in agreement with the results reported by vik et al 2013 and zhao et al 2021 as a result the petrophysical property of israel chalks varies much less with the particle size range and even can be treated as homogeneous at these observational scales normally an increase in helium porosity of crushed organic rich and deep mudstone has been observed in previous particle size effect studies tinni et al 2012 ma et al 2014 however in our work the japan mudstone sample came from the wakkanai formation which is composed of typically homogeneous siliceous mudstone at a depth of 358 m ishii et al 2011 aoyagi ishii 2019 and therefore the resultant particle porosities are relatively constant in the range of 75 8000 µm hu et al 2021 reported the dramatic difference in pore connectivity between shallow and deep mudstone as the organic matter rich and deep mudstones are subjected to additional maturation process to alter the pore structure and exhibit poor pore connectivity as compared to the compaction and diagenesis of shallow mudstones the wyoming dolostone sample is also homogeneous with mostly the presence of intercrystalline pore space westphal et al 2004 and displays stable physical properties across the particle size fractions to summarize at the observational scales of 75 8000 µm edwards limestone and grimsel granodiorite the heterogeneous group are heterogeneous porous media showing scale dependent porosities whereas white chalk gray chalk dolostone and shallow mudstone are more of a homogeneous type and the particle size has less effect on the crushed internal porosities of these four rocks 3 4 intra particle gas diffusion the gas diffusion test is a compelling physical transfer approach to understanding pore connectivity and tortuous pathways of natural rocks diffusion results show a notable tendency of increasing intra particle diffusion coefficient and its proportion with the decrease of particle size in heterogeneous edwards limestone and grimsel granodiorite fig 6b c table 6 the proportion of intra particle diffusion in the whole diffusion process of these two samples increases from 3 28 to 27 01 and 1 21 to 20 91 respectively from large 2380 8000 μm to small 75 177 μm particle size fractions it is reported that the heterogeneous edwards limestone commonly contains intercrystalline pores and micropores as well as larger pores johannesen et al 2007 yoo et al 2019 the larger diffusion coefficients in smaller sized particles are attributed to the opening of intercrystalline pathways in edwards limestone since the granodiorite sample came from the grimsel test site in switzerland which has been used as low permeability and heterogeneous material david et al 2018 schneeberger et al 2019 the diffusivity of grimsel granodiorite is the lowest table 6 due to its low matrix permeability and poor pore connectivity kc et al 2019 israel white chalk and israel gray chalk whitthueser et al 2000 have similar porosities across the whole range of particle sizes and the intra particle diffusion coefficients increase with the decreasing particle sizes notably the gray chalk particles exhibit a higher diffusivity than the white chalk nearly twice as great table 6 fig 6b therefore greater pore connectivity is expected within gray chalk the intrafossil pore space 3 μm observed from the sem images in white chalk is mainly within chalk coccoliths rings which could provide limited connected pore space fig 7 a b however abundant hollow internal chambers 30 μm in foraminifera were widely present in gray chalk fig 7c d these foraminifera shells could provide ideal effective and connected pore space for mass transfer the median pore throat size of white chalk obtained from mip tests is 0 42 µm which is slightly larger than that of gray chalk 0 39 µm these two chalk samples with similar porosity but displaying different gas diffusion behavior illustrate the importance of the pore structure effect on mass transport this observation also implies that a more rapid mass transfer behavior can be achieved with better pore connectivity the topological attribute of pore structure even though those samples exhibit similar values of porosities in contrast the intra particle diffusion coefficients of crushed japan mudstone and wyoming dolostone remain roughly constant over the tested ranges of particle sizes fig 6b the gas diffusion run on a monolithic japan mudstone sample 1 cm3 cube exhibits a smaller 3 11 10 7 m2 s by a factor of 4 diffusion coefficient than the intra particle diffusion coefficient of crushed japan mudstone table 6 this indirectly verifies the versatile approach of using solid quartz grains to experimentally and theoretically obtain the intra particle diffusivity for a wide range of natural rocks with different pore structure characteristics these homogeneous within the observational scales of 75 8000 µm samples reach the rev quickly at smaller sample size and the crushed particle sizes in our work are regarded to be already above the length scale of rev in other words the pore structure of these samples would likely be similar for six particle sizes and then the diffusion contribution from the intra particle pathways is constant for the effective intra particle diffusivity to be similar in the same magnitude of 10 6 m2 s in addition pore connectivity may dominate intra particle diffusion behavior grimsel granodiorite has similar porosity to wyoming dolostone but with its poor pore connectivity it has lower intra particle diffusivity than wyoming dolostone 3 5 batch sorption results for anionic and cationic tracers both anions and cations are widely applied as tracers in studying chemical sorption onto porous media the batch sorption tests using six natural rocks in six particle sizes ranges interacting with various inorganic anionic and cationic tracers were used to assess the magnitude of sorption and identify governing parameters including the mineral composition surface area and pore structure analyses of the variance for bromide br results show that no noticeable sorption is observed between different samples fig 8 this indicates that anionic bromide is a conservative tracer under the experimental conditions for these samples with a negligible amount of metal hydro oxides in accordance with results presented by many researchers such as levy and chambers 1987 fig 8 also presents varying extents of sorption of other anionic tracers some sorption of seo4 2 is related to plagioclase li et al 2018 which consists of albite and anorthite grimsel granodiorite with plagioclase as the dominant mineral barnes 1988 li et al 2018 table 3 also has a relatively higher seo4 2 sorption amount with k d values ranging from 2 to 4 ml g by comparison the seo4 2 k d values of other five rocks are close to 0 ml g with no measurable sorption fig 8 also shows that the kaolinite rich japan mudstone particles demonstrate a strong sorption capacity for anionic cro4 2 as compared to other five rocks specifically k d values of cro4 2 for japan mudstone particles 104 ml g is one order of magnitude higher than those of other rocks 103 ml g which is in good agreement with the high sorption capacity of kaolinite clay reported by helios rybicka and wójcik 2012 similar to cro4 2 the anionic but larger sized sb2 complex is quite sorptive in japan mudstone as well our results show the sorption capacities of sb2 complex on the japan mudstone particles 105 ml g were much higher several orders of magnitude than those on the other five rock samples 10 ml g the high sorption capacity of sb2 complex on japan mudstone is due to its rich content of amorphous iron principally opal a fan et al 2013 sasamoto et al 2018 nishimura et al 2022 high sorption of heavy metals monovalent cs and divalent ba2 cations have been observed for high clay content samples israel chalks and japan mudstone with k d values around 100 ml g and 10000 ml g for ba2 and cs respectively fig 9 b with a predominant presence of k in the interlayer space illite has been known to strongly sorb cs from its displacement of k bradbury and baeyens 2000 zachara et al 2002 for low clay content samples edwards limestone wyoming dolostone and grimsel granodiorite a smaller but still appreciable sorption of cs with k d values ranging from 50 to 100 ml g was observed fig 9a overall the batch sorption tests provide a cost effective and broad perspective for the sorption extent of a wide range of chemicals at different forms molecular sizes and reactivities which are related to mineral components of natural rocks notably batch sorption coefficients in some tracers may have been detected to a level close to the error bars especially for anionic tracer bromide br in fig 8 these results are considered within experimental errors considering the low average batch sorption coefficients values smaller than 1 for those tracers while column transport studies can be conducted for low kd chemical fluid solid systems hu 2022 in addition the associated error bars are much lower compared to the observed values for tracers of ba2 and cs since the batch sorption coefficients are around several hundred figs 9 10 3 6 effect of adsorbent particle sizes on chemical sorption investigating the performance of natural rocks in relation to their particle size has been an important aspect of sorption process as arbitrarily used particle sizes are used to describe the sorption contribution of intact rocks giammar et al 2007 venegas et al 2007 li et al 2019b tachi et al 2021 which lead to uncertainty in evaluating the in situ contribution of sorption in waste containment hu 2019 a relationship between the particle size and the sorptive capacity has been established the extent of sorption increases with decreasing particle size and powder form contains the highest adsorptive capacity kara et al 2007 raposo et al 2009 ikenyiri ukpaka 2016 our experimental results fig 10 also indicate that sample particle size has an effect on the sorption capacities of several tracers as the particle size decreases the sorption capacity of sm3 and eu3 increases among grimsel granodiorite japan mudstone and wyoming dolostone for homogeneous rocks stronger sorption capacity in smaller sized particles stems from the increase of specific external surface area surface area per unit mass available for tracer s adsorption matsui et al 2011 therefore the external surface areas in smaller sized japan mudstone and wyoming dolostone particles are larger compared to larger sized particles with increasing sorption of sm3 and eu3 in contrast for heterogeneous rocks like grimsel granodiorite the increasing sorption can be attributed to both the better connectivity and higher external surface area resulting from the decrease in particle sizes sepulveda et al 2001 hou et al 2017 mastalerz et al 2017 both grimsel granodiorite and edwards limestone exhibit poor pore connectivity and sample size dependent accessibility to sorptive pore space from independent analyses of grain size distribution mip and effective porosity by densities methods sections 3 2 3 3 however for a tracer fluid rock system with either very strong or weak sorption this difference in pore accessibility can be overshadowed by the overwhelming chemical effect the results also show negligible effects of particle size on the tracer sorption of edwards limestone and israel chalks within a particle size ranging from 75 to 8000 µm this was probably due to the similar maximum sorption capacity of these three rocks furthermore literature results stipp et al 2003 zavarin et al 2005 show that sm3 and eu3 are adsorbed to calcite which is the main mineral of edwards limestone and israel chalks table 3 in general particles with smaller sizes experience higher surface area resulting in a higher sorption capacity notwithstanding the sorption capacities of particles from limestone and israel chalks probably reach the peak when the particle size ranges from 2380 to 8000 µm the upper range of our size sizes meaning that the strongly sorbed sm3 and eu3 in the solution were completely absorbed hence smaller size particles less than 2380 µm with a higher surface area can easily reach the same maximum capacity and the particle size effect was negligible 4 conclusions through integrated pore structure studies with gas diffusion and aqueous phase chemical sorption for six natural rocks with six different sample sizes we conclude that a smaller sample scale could have positive effects on pore connectivity for relatively heterogeneous rocks as well as on mass transport properties for comparatively homogeneous geological media the change of pore connectivity in various sample sizes is relatively small indicating relative independence of physical and chemical transport properties on particle sizes furthermore the nontrivial contributions of clay minerals and particle size effect on the ionic sorption capacity of natural rock samples were also confirmed in this study future studies will include dynamic column transport with a range of sample sizes and water saturation as the equilibrium type batch sorption tests while being practical and cost effective to produce a broad brush understanding of the relative magnitude of various chemicals in a fluid tracer rock system indicates a maximum interaction which is not representative of the field conditions where fluid rock interactions are momentary and kinetics controlled in addition the unique gas diffusion approach with oxygen gas tracer will need to verify the chemical interactions with a wide range of natural rocks to separate the potential diffusive flux from both physical and chemical process using a newly custom designed apparatus of multiple gas tracers hu 2022 credit authorship contribution statement xiaoqing yuan investigation formal analysis visualization writing original draft qinhong hu

2199,this paper presents a procedure based on high resolution shallow water modelling for assessing dam failure hypothetical scenarios that can be useful for designing emergency action plans the capability of accurately predicting the areas flooded by these catastrophic events both in terms of timing and magnitude represents indeed a key task for emergency planning the proposed procedure relies on the adoption of a parallel two dimensional shallow water numerical model capable of both preventing large computational times and enabling the use of high resolution meshes without introducing approximations in the set of the governing equations criteria for selecting the numerical model the input data such as bathymetry and the initial conditions are analysed in detail the procedure is adopted to model the flooding scenarios induced by the failure of two dams in northern italy built for irrigation and flood mitigation purposes respectively keywords dam failure induced floods dam break dam breach shallow water modelling hazard assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dams and reservoirs have been constructed with multiple purposes e g irrigation hydropower water supply for domestic and industrial use navigation and flood control and often in correlation with the socio economic development of their respective countries chen et al 2016 the icold world register of dams counted around 58 700 dams worldwide widespread at april 2020 but this number is estimated to grow in the future e g as a response to the renewable energy requirements of an increasing population zarfl et al 2015 despite the benefits on society prosperity dams might be subject to accidents causing rapid and uncontrolled water releases in the past

eaps with the aim of minimizing damage to life and properties in case of partial or total dam failure e g by implementing early warning procedures and evacuation planning and by identifying critical infrastructures and population at risk meanwhile researchers have developed numerical models capable of reconstructing historical dam failures such as the ones of gleno pilotti et al 2011 bouzey smith 2017 st francis begnudelli and sanders 2007 sella zerbino petaccia et al 2016 niedow kostecki and banasiak 2021 and dam overtopping such as the vajont disaster vacondio et al 2013 despite the modelling of historical floods generated by dam breaks has been widely discussed in the literature aureli et al 2021 the assessment of inundation maps for the redaction of eaps still represents a challenging task for example due to the uncertainties in the definition of the initial conditions of the reservoir and of the dam failure mechanisms and to the complexity of the downstream topography sometimes with very steep slopes within this context dam failure induced floods have been recently simulated by means of simplified or one dimensional 1d schemes among the others zhou et al 2015 gaagai et al 2022 verma patra 2022 also for evaluating cascade dam risk zhou et al 2020 even if two dimensional 2d applications have been presented among the others azeez et al 2020 urzică et al 2021 marangoz anilan 2022 sarchani koutroulis 2022 this paper aims at presenting a procedure based on numerical modelling for predicting flooding scenarios due to dam failures overcoming some critical points of existing approaches which are currently adopted in different countries to assess the hydraulic hazard and or risk related to these events the degree of detail of national legislations about this topic is actually slightly variable and a review of some guidelines is here carried out in order to highlight differences and similarities of the approaches mentioned there starting from this the integrated procedure here proposed focuses on the adoption of 2d shallow water models capable of accurately describing the propagation of a dam break induced flood on real bathymetries high resolution digital terrain models dtms are required in order to account for the presence of terrain elements that may affect the flood dynamic such as road channel embankments and urban areas focusing on the flooding scenarios the procedure assumes a failure occurring when the water level in the reservoir equals the maximum admissible one as upstream condition an inflow discharge hydrograph is considered when its volume is not negligible compared to the reservoir one as often occurs dealing with small flood mitigations dam as failure mode the procedure assumes a sudden collapse for concrete dams and a gradual breach evolution for earthen dams the formation of breaches along the earthen embankments of flood detention reservoirs located in lowland is also evaluated the assumptions related to the dam failure mechanisms and the initial hydraulic conditions of the reservoir are discussed the proposed procedure is applied to two reservoirs in northern italy a concrete dam located in the mountain mignano dam and a flood mitigation dam located in lowland parma flood mitigation dam the outline of the paper is as follows the proposed procedure is presented in sect 2 applied to real cases in sect 3 and 4 and extensively discussed in sect 5 finally concluding remarks are drawn in sect 6 and some of the existing legislations and guidelines to cope with dam failure scenarios are described in appendix a 2 a procedure for modelling and mapping dam failure hazard a possible integrated procedure for the assessment of dam failure hazard is summarized in fig 1 the proposed approach requires i the choice of topographic data i e terrain description and roughness estimation ii the assumption on the dam failure mechanism and the related initial hydraulic and eventually boundary conditions iii the numerical modelling of the flooding scenarios and iv the post processing of the output data all these key aspects are discussed in the following sections 2 1 topographic data with the aim of describing the relevant terrain elements that may interact with a dam failure induced flood the procedure requires the adoption of high resolution dtms the use of adequate topographic information is indeed one of the key elements to obtain accurate inundation maps casas et al 2006 mason et al 2007 2015 and both low cost high resolution remotely sensed data néelz et al 2006 and lidar light detection and ranging based dtms kakoulaki et al 2021 are nowadays accessible the chosen dtm has to fulfil some properties firstly it has to accurately describe the reservoir area in order to avoid over or under predictions of the flooded areas due to over or under estimations of the storage water volume e g the topography of the submerged zones has to be integrated e g with bathymetric surveys if the lidar survey is carried out when the reservoir is not completely empty moreover the dtm has to adequately include all the relevant elements that may interact with the flood propagation such as buildings in urban areas schubert and sanders 2012 roads channels and embankments filtering algorithms often manage to remove vegetation and false structures potentially obstructing the flow but they are unable to reconstruct hidden small urban features meesuk et al 2015 therefore it is important to integrate the missing small scale urban features in the dtm e g with ground view data néelz et al 2006 meesuk et al 2015 within topographic data it is also necessary to define the roughness parameter that quantifies the flow resistance due to e g surface irregularities and vegetation calibration procedures are best suited for estimating the roughness values characterizing the river located downstream of the dam e g by reconstructing the water level time series recorded at gauging instruments in the absence of data concerning historical flooding events and outside of the riverbed roughness can be inferred from literature based on land use maps 2 2 hydraulic conditions and failure mechanisms the initial conditions and the failure mechanisms sketched in fig 1 are herein assumed in accordance with many of the existing legislations recalled in appendix a with regard to the initial conditions the methodology considers that just before the dam failure the water level in the reservoir equals the maximum admissible one which normally corresponds to the spillway crest an inflow discharge hydrograph e g a synthetic design hydrograph sdh with assigned return period should be considered as upstream boundary condition when its volume is not negligible compared to the reservoir one in this case the maximum water level is reached at the arrival of the inflow peak to achieve this goal the simulation starts before the beginning of the failure in such a way that the volume of the inflow hydrograph rising limb is equal to the reservoir one at the considered water level as a result the peak of the inflow hydrograph superimposes the one induced by the sudden water release this worst scenario might be quite realistic especially for relatively small flood detention reservoirs otherwise if the inflow volume is negligible compared to the reservoir one as often occurs in large mountain reservoirs with relatively small upstream watersheds no upstream condition is imposed for both the hydraulic conditions the bottom outlets are assumed inoperative to increase the severity of the scenario as regards the failure mechanisms the methodology assumes a sudden collapse for concrete dams and a gradual breach evolution for earthen dams in accordance with many of the existing legislations recalled in appendix a moreover in the presence of flood control reservoirs located in lowland which are usually bounded by horizontal earthen embankments the procedure assumes the formation of a breach in the levee portion that presents the higher elevation above the surrounding terrain the breach which is here assumed to evolve gradually is modelled following a geometric approach and using the parameters e g the final length and the evolution time resulting from an empirical formulation froehlich 2008 based on the data collected after historical events empirical approaches froehlich 2008 xu and zhang 2009 asce ewri task committee on dam levee breaching 2011 define simple formulations for evaluating e g the formation time of the breach and its average width based on some geometric characteristics height of the earthen dam volume retained in the lake etc 2 3 numerical model the numerical model used within the procedure should satisfy some requirements firstly it should adopt a 2d schematization since 1d or quasi 2d schemes which are faster and easier to implement are not adequate to describe flows with no predefined directions such as dam break induced floods moreover it should solve the complete 2d shallow water equations swes in order to accurately reproduce transitions between sub and supercritical flows and vice versa since these phenomena which are not rare dealing with a dam break flow cannot be adequately simulated by diffusive schemes costabile et al 2017 with regard to the numerical approximation of the 2d swes the choice of appropriate explicit finite volume fv schemes allows reproducing without any special treatment transcritical flows shock type discontinuities and a robust treatment of wet and dry fronts over irregular topographies liang and marche 2009 the numerical model can solve the governing equations on non uniform meshes either unstructured liang et al 2008 sætra et al 2015 or structured vacondio et al 2017 in order to discretize the domain with different resolution levels thus keeping high resolution only for relevant terrain features and reduce the runtimes local time step methods may also be considered when dealing with small cells in order to avoid excessive restrictions on the time step due to the stability condition sanders 2008 dazzi et al 2018 hu et al 2019a hu et al 2019b finally the shallow water model may also take advantage of parallelization sanders et al 2010 to further reduce the computational burden as an example the exploitation of graphics processing units gpus ensured a reduction of the runtimes sometimes of two orders of magnitude with respect to cpu based models castro et al 2011 brodtkorb et al 2012 vacondio et al 2014 lacasta et al 2015 juez et al 2016 vacondio et al 2017 a non exhaustive list of 2d hydrodynamic models commonly used for flood simulations is reported in table 1 together with their main characteristics 2 4 output data most of the measures contained in eaps such as the identification of the areas that can temporarily host people and the definition of roads at risk tightly depend on the results of the numerical modelling therefore the procedure suggests processing a few maps representing some useful indicators fig 1 such as the maximum water depth and velocity which enable identifying e g populated areas requiring evacuation interruptions to infrastructures erosion phenomena along overtopped embankments and stability reductions of cars and pedestrians milanesi et al 2015 arrighi et al 2017 water depth and velocity information can also be combined in order to assess hazard aureli et al 2008 ferrari et al 2019 lazzarin et al 2022 finally the flood dynamic may be summarized by mapping the arrival time of the wetting front beyond the contents the output maps have to preserve a resolution similar to the one adopted in the computational grid i e the high level of detail of the simulations should not be significantly downgraded by the results post processing and they should be provided in a format supported by gis environment to be used for planning operations e g by overlapping other layers 3 the case of the mignano dam the mignano dam is a concrete gravity dam located in northern italy on the arda river a small right tributary of the po river aureli et al 2014 fig 2 at the maximum storage level the lake created by the dam is around 2 8 km long with an average water depth of 16 3 m maranzoni and mignosa 2019 at the elevation of the spillway crest the maximum water depth behind the dam is around 38 m and the stored water volume is about 15 106 m3 the dam break scenario was simulated using the parflood model vacondio et al 2014 vacondio et al 2017 which satisfies the requirements outlined in sect 2 3 in fact the model solves the well balanced set of complete 2d swes liang and borthwick 2009 1 u t f x g y s 0 s f where the vectors of the conserved variables u and of the fluxes f and g in the x and y directions respectively and the bed slope s 0 and friction s f source terms are defined as 2 u η u h v h f uh u 2 h 1 2 g η 2 2 η z u v h g vh u v h v 2 h 1 2 g η 2 2 η z s 0 0 g η z x g η z y s f 0 g h n f 2 u u 2 v 2 h 4 3 g h n f 2 v u 2 v 2 h 4 3 with h the water depth z the bed elevation η h z the water surface elevation u and v the velocity components along the x and y directions respectively g the gravitational acceleration and nf the manning s roughness coefficient the model integrates the equations through an explicit finite volume scheme and computes the numerical fluxes with the hllc approximate riemann solver toro 2001 to avoid non physical velocities at wet dry fronts the correction proposed by kurganov and petrova 2007 is adopted the model achieves both first and second order of accuracy in space and time adopting for the latter case a depth positive muscl extrapolation of the conserved variables values at the cell boundaries and a second order runge kutta time integration the code is written in compute unified device architecture cuda language a framework introduced by nvidia to exploit both the gpu the device and the cpu the host ensuring speedups of two orders if compared with the cpu version the model discretizes the computational domain with a block uniform quadtree grid that allows adopting variable resolutions while preserving the gpu efficiency for more details about the model which was efficiently adopted also within inverse procedures ferrari et al 2018 the reader can refer to vacondio et al 2014 2017 3 1 model setup the dtm adopted in the simulation derived from a lidar survey carried out upon the arda valley in 2017 it presents a resolution of 1 m 1 m and it covers an area of about 200 km2 following the items described in sect 2 1 the bathymetry of the lake was firstly integrated using a survey carried out in 2015 when the reservoir was empty for maintenance purposes then some levee crests of the downstream reach of the arda river which were not adequately described in the dtm due to the presence of dense vegetation along the banks were corrected based on a classical topographic survey finally the buildings of fiorenzuola d arda village were explicitly described in the computational mesh following the building hole method in order to reproduce local variations of the flow field schubert and sanders 2012 it is worth mentioning that other approaches can be adopted when simulating the effects exerted by urban areas on the flood propagation such as the one based on the solution of the shallow water equations with porosity e g ferrari et al 2019 ferrari viero 2020 ayoub et al 2022 among the others the domain was discretized through a buq multi resolution grid vacondio et al 2017 the highest resolution 2 m was imposed in the reservoir along the river and in urban areas whereas road railway embankments and rural zones were described with 4 m and 8 m respectively the computational grid entailed about 13 9 106 cells 3 2 model calibration the roughness coefficient characterizing the river region was calibrated by reproducing the arrival times of some flood waves which were artificially generated through the opening of the dam s bottom outlets at several gauging stations fig 2 conversely the roughness parameter of rural areas was estimated based on literature values by modelling the flooding time evolution of historical dam breaks in fact some authors assumed coefficients in the range of 0 025 0 1 m 1 3s e g valiani et al 2002 pilotti et al 2011 petaccia et al 2016 moreover vacondio et al 2016 adopted a value of 0 05 m 1 3s to reproduce the arrival times of a levee breach induced flooding occurred in a nearby river in 2014 since the area here involved presents quite similar characteristics the same value was assumed in this work a sensitivity analysis was however performed see sect 5 in order to evaluate the influence of the roughness parameter on the water depths and arrival times of the simulated scenario 3 3 dam break flooding scenario following the procedure described in sect 2 2 the instantaneous collapse of the concrete gravity dam was assumed to occur with an initial water level in the reservoir equal to the spillway crest no inflow hydrograph was imposed since the upstream catchment is only 70 km2 wide and the volume of the 200 year return period sdh does not significantly over exceed the reservoir one as downstream boundary condition a stage discharge relationship was imposed at the confluence between the arda river and the po river the map of the maximum non simultaneous simulated water depths is shown in fig 3 a where the inset depicts the flooding of the fiorenzuola d arda village the most inhabited and affected one the peak discharge at the dam site fig 4 a is around 31000 m3 s oscillations around the peak are due to 2d effects of water converging toward the dam section about two orders of magnitude greater than the peak of the 200 year return period hydrological event estimated at the entrance of the lake 450 m3 s in 20 min a halved flood peak reaches the nearest village of lugagnano val d arda fig 4b potentially causing the demolition of bridges and buildings 10 min later the reservoir is completely emptied moving downstream the fiorenzuola d arda village is flooded in 1 h fig 3b whereas the northernmost areas are reached in 6 to 9 h the peak discharge at villanova sull arda is similar to the conveyable capacity of the river fig 4c with the purpose of considering the simultaneous effect of water depth and velocity for flood hazard assessment the maximum total depth d is adopted aureli et al 2008 ferrari et al 2019 3 d h 1 2 fr 2 where h represents the water depth and fr the froude number values of d equal to 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m were assumed to bound low medium high and very high hazard fig 5 the focus on fiorenzuola d arda fig 5 shows that more than half of this area presents high and very high hazard values thus highlighting the importance of defining adequate flood management strategies to avoid human life losses 4 the case of the parma flood mitigation dam the parma flood mitigation dam is located in northern italy on the parma river a right tributary of the po river fig 6 the reservoir which is bounded by earthen levees is usually empty and used to mitigate floods potentially threating the town of parma the storage volume at the spillway crest level is about 10 106 m3 when a flood wave occurs the three movable gates at the bottom outlets of the concrete dam are progressively lowered in order to release a discharge conveyable by the river the stored water volume is then released at the end of the event 4 1 model setup the dtm adopted in the simulations presents a resolution of 1 m 1 m and it derived from recent lidar surveys carried out when the reservoir was empty the studied domain was discretized through a buq multi resolution grid vacondio et al 2017 the highest resolution 2 m was imposed in the reservoir in urban areas buildings in the town of parma were modelled following the building hole method schubert and sanders 2012 along the river and road channel embankments whereas the lowest resolution 8 m was assigned to rural zones the computational grid entailed about 20 106 cells 4 2 model calibration the river roughness was defined by reconstructing recent flood hydrographs i e by reproducing the maximum water surface elevation profiles along the river and the water level time series recorded in a downstream gauging station fig 6 for the floodable areas outside the riverbed the value of 0 05 m 1 3s was assumed sect 3 2 4 3 dam break flooding scenario following the procedure described in sect 2 2 the concrete gravity dam was assumed to collapse when the initial water level in the reservoir reached the spillway crest a 200 year return period inflow hydrograph was imposed as upstream condition since its volume 73 106 m3 is almost an order of magnitude greater than the reservoir one 10 106 m3 the bottom gates were considered closed before the failure and the reservoir was progressively filled by the incoming flood wave when the water level in the reservoir reached the spillway crest i e when the inflow peak occurred the concrete dam was assumed to collapse as downstream boundary condition a stage discharge relationship was imposed at the confluence between the parma and the po rivers as for the mignano scenario the influence of this condition on the flood is substantially negligible the resulting flood wave at the dam site presents the same volume of the inflow hydrograph the reservoir was initially empty but the peak discharge is 8 times higher due to the overlapping between the hydrological peak and the dam break induced one fig 7 the discharge hydrographs reached in sections s1 and s2 exceed both the conveyable capacity of the river and the peaks of a 200 years hydrological event even in section s3 although the discharge has significantly reduced the flood is not yet completely contained in the river due to the presence of a bottleneck in correspondence of an ancient bridge more than half of the town of parma is flooded in less than 1 h fig 8 reaching medium high velocity values and high very high hazard total depth ones fig 9 whereas the northernmost lowland areas are flooded in 5 to 10 h 4 4 dam breach flooding scenarios since the parma flood mitigation dam presents earthen embankments flooding scenarios induced by the formation of breaches were also simulated sect 2 2 by assuming a 1000 year sdh entering the reservoir closed dam bottom gates and clogged spillway this latter assumption was introduced since wooden debris carried by the incoming flood might partially or totally hit the piers located along the spillway crest to support roads e g the palagnedra dam overtopping case bruschin et al 1982 the breach was assumed to develop when the water level in the reservoir reached the levee crest elevation simultaneously with the inflow peak as the levee crest is horizontal two breach locations were independently simulated in the northernmost portion of the levee close to the dam on the right and on the left side respectively where the embankments reach the maximum elevation of around 12 m above the surrounding terrain fig 10 the breaches were modelled with a geometric approach ferrari et al 2020 adopting the froehlich formula froehlich 2008 4 b 0 27 k 0 v w 0 32 h b 0 04 5 t f 63 2 v w g h b 2 where b represents the final average width side slope 1 1 is assumed for overtopping failures k 0 is a factor accounting for the failure mode e g k 0 1 3 for overtopping vw denotes the water volume above the breach bottom at the beginning of the failure hb is the final height of the breach and tf the breach formation time the breach reached a final averaged width of 78 m in 2 1 h slightly different values result by adopting other empirical formulas such as the one proposed in xu and zhang 2009 in this case the breach would open in about 2 8 h reaching the maximum width of 63 m the maps of the maximum water depths resulting from the left and right breach openings which are shown in fig 10 highlight the macroscopic difference between the two flooding scenarios at the occurrence of the left levee failure the discharge flowing through the breach partially propagates west of the parma river and partially flows back into the unleeved riverbed just downstream the dam even if the outflow peak discharge fig 11 is less than half of that caused by the instantaneous collapse of the dam fig 7 both the parma downtown and lowlands are flooded conversely the wave flowing out from the right breach mostly propagates northeast probably in an ancient paleochannel of the parma river and only a small part flows back into the current riverbed fig 10b in this scenario the parma downtown is preserved from flooding but other small villages in lowlands at east are instead heavily involved 5 discussion in this section the main assumptions of the proposed procedure are critically analysed regarding recent literature in order to outline the reliability of the results model topography was derived by selectively downsampling a high resolution 1 m 1 m dtm obtained from a lidar scan in such a way that the main characteristics influencing the flooding dynamics are kept unchanged uncertainty may rely on the roughness values assumed for the floodable areas since the discharge conveyed in the river is a small fraction of the one caused by the failure a sensitivity analysis was then performed for the mignano case by considering roughness variations in the range of 25 the resulting flooded areas are compared in fig 12 for the northernmost part of the domain where the wetting front fragments on lowlands and roughness plays a more relevant role given a total flooded area of 69 km2 resulting from the reference simulation the adoption of 25 higher and lower roughness values determines the flooding of around 67 and 70 km2 respectively the differences are less than 3 even the arrival times show moderate variations which cannot substantially affect the planning of safety interventions the adoption of a 2d shallow water model has proved to be fundamental for modelling the impacts of dam failures since the flooding dynamic of these events cannot be defined a priori e g when paleochannels are reactivated during the flood propagation fig 10b even the shallow water approximations may in some cases do not strictly hold e g near the dam soon after the collapse but despite some studies overcame this issue solving for example vertically averaged and moment vam equations cantero chinchilla et al 2020 or fully 3d equations through lagrangian approaches e g smoothed particle hydrodynamics vacondio et al 2013 their use in real cases is still limited by the high computational burden the adopted numerical model solves the complete 2d swes since diffusive schemes which neglect inertial terms are not suitable for modelling these rapidly varying flows mainly due to their inability to manage the transitions between sub and supercritical flows and vice versa and to the fact that inertial terms play an important role mignosa et al 2018 costabile et al 2020 2017 dazzi et al 2021 in order to better clarify this latter issue the momentum equations of the swes are written in 2d non conservative form 6 1 g u t u g u x v g u y u g v y η x s fx 0 1 g v t v g u x u g v x v g v y η y s fy 0 where the first term denotes the local acceleration slope the second one the whole square brackets the convective acceleration slopes the third one the water surface slope and the last one the friction slope as shown in fig 13 for a selected time after the mignano dam break the values of the inertial terms sum of the local and the convective acceleration slopes are of the same order of magnitude of the water surface slope neglecting these terms would thus lead to unacceptable approximations in the numerical results a high return period sdh t 200 or t 1000 years was imposed as upstream boundary condition in the case of the parma flood mitigation dam since its volume was significant with respect to the reservoir one moreover the dam levee failure was assumed to occur at the arrival of the inflow peak since dealing with a flood control reservoir that is usually empty the failure is expected to be correlated with a flood event as shown in fig 14 for the dam break scenario the absence of an inflow hydrograph would largely underestimate the downstream flooded areas with reference to the failure mode concrete dams were assumed to collapse also considering that similar events were already experienced in the past e g malpasset dam valiani et al 2002 as regards the modelling of embankment breaches coupled hydrodynamic erosion models inherently account for both the hydrodynamic conditions and the levee characteristics however they require the knowledge of some parameters characterizing the levee material such as the porosity p the critical shear stress τ c and the erodibility coefficient k d even if the first one can be easily assessed with local surveys and the others retrieved in the literature there is still some uncertainty in the values to be adopted since during a breach evolution the effective shear stresses τ are usually one or more frequently two orders of magnitude higher than the critical ones a sensitivity analysis was here carried out with reference to the erodibility parameter by adopting a physically based approach that couples the 2d swes with an erosion model dazzi et al 2019 7 z x y t k d m a x τ τ c 0 1 p in the analysis three values of the erodibility coefficient were tested the one calibrated in dazzi et al 2019 to simulate a real breach occurred in a nearby river k d 2 a 50 lower value k d 1 and a 25 higher one k d 3 as shown in fig 15 the breaches resulting by adopting the geometric approach and the erosion model are quite similar the latter ones evolve in 2 to 3 h reaching average widths from 70 to 105 m and the outflow hydrographs although presenting different shapes have quite similar peak values the peak discharge resulting from the geometric model is about 30 higher than that obtained with the erosion model this causes the heaviest effects at least near the breach whereas far away the differences progressively reduce but this aspect deserves further investigation finally other physical phenomena that might locally influence the propagation of the dam failure induced floods are the potential collapse of buildings or infrastructures the transport of solid material rocks wooden debris remnants of buildings and of the dam itself and soil erosion for the two considered test cases these phenomena were considered negligible the collapse of buildings and infrastructures might affect only the narrow valley downstream the mignano dam where the flood wave still has enough energy to destroy buildings whereas elsewhere and for the parma mitigation dam only bridges in the river which are almost all overtopped by the flow may be damaged this aspect might be considered when modelling dams with large reservoirs located in valleys with steeper slopes e g milanesi and pilotti 2021 as regards solid material which in some cases may play a relevant role recent studies investigated the blockage of reservoir spillways due to large wood furlan et al 2021 and the transport of floating wooden material in rivers persi et al 2022 but their extension to dam break induced floods is still challenging focusing on the bed erosion deposition mechanisms which are often studied through laboratory investigations e g khosravi et al 2021 despite some 2d models adopting different sediment transport formulations well reproduced laboratory experimental data among the others xia et al 2010 soares frazão et al 2012 their application to prototype scale on complex topographies and with huge discharges deserve further investigation 6 conclusions and future work floods induced by dam failures are by far less frequent than that generated by hydrological events but their catastrophic consequences require an enhancement of the management strategies with the aim of improving hazard mapping this paper proposed a procedure based on shallow water modelling the application of the procedure to two reservoirs in northern italy characterized by different purposes volume and location allowed assessing the following items the flooding scenarios have to be simulated using a fully 2d shallow water model since inertial contributions play a relevant role in the mignano case inertial terms and water surface slope have the same order of magnitude and no preferential flow directions can be assumed a priori in the parma test an ancient paleochannel in rural areas was reactivated the flooding dynamic is only marginally influenced by the roughness coefficient used to describe the rural areas the sensitivity analysis on the mignano dam case highlighted only moderate variations of the flooded areas and of the arrival times an inflow discharge hydrograph has to be imposed as upstream condition e g when dealing with flood mitigation dams which are usually empty before a flood wave occurs the results for the parma flood mitigation dam which unlike the mignano dam is usually empty and with a non negligible inflow hydrograph confirmed the importance of considering an inflow condition multiple breach locations should be considered when dealing with reservoirs bounded by horizontal earthen embankments the modelling of two bank failures along the embankments of the parma reservoir one at the left and one at right of the dam was fundamental to capture flooded areas far from the dam that otherwise would erroneously be considered safe the procedure can be extended to other similar dams when dealing with emergency planning the dynamic modelling of building collapse due to flood impact is left to future work credit authorship contribution statement alessia ferrari methodology

parts of these legislations are described with reference to some countries in europe italy switzerland england and finland north america usa and asia india table a 1 a 1 italy the directive indirizzi operativi inerenti l attività di protezione civile nell ambito dei bacini in cui siano presenti grandi dighe promulgated in 2014 provides instructions for the management of emergency situations e g by demanding flood propagation studies for the redaction of eaps for large dams details regarding these studies which have to define the areas flooded by a dam collapse or the full opening of the dam outlets are contained in the circular letter n dstn 2 22806 of 1995 disposizioni attuative ed integrative in materia di dighe these dispositions prescribe that a dam break scenario has to evaluate the consequences of the worst failure mechanism among those suggested for the different dam types and that the initial conditions depend on the dam structure as an example the collapse of concrete dams is assumed to be sudden and complete apart some special cases with the water level in the reservoir at the spillway crest neglecting both the upstream inflow and the outflow at the bottom outlets and considering the river downstream of the dam in dry conditions as regards the flood propagation modelling the adoption of a numerical model that has been previously validated against real cases is prescribed despite no remarks regarding the choice of 1d or 2d models are explicitly provided the result representation strictly refers to a 1d approach beyond the redaction of an inundation map representing the floodable areas indeed information regarding e g the maximum water depth velocity total head and arrival time of the flood peak has to be provided for the river reach in addition tables concerning the principal variables of interest are demanded a 2 switzerland the ordonnance sur les ouvrages d accumulation osoa 721 101 1 2012 provides dispositions concerning the safety of water storage structures https www fedlex admin ch and with regard to emergency plans it specifies that inundation maps have to represent the zones potentially flooded in case of sudden collapse of water retaining structures flooding arrival times are also required to properly alert the population in case of a total and instantaneous failure the activation of sirens is indeed required for people living in areas that would be flooded in less than two hours whereas a general alarm system invites the population living in far areas to listen the evacuation instructions icold 2020 more details regarding dam break analyses can be found in the 2015 directive sur les ouvrages d accumulation https www bfe admin ch whose part e focuses on the redaction of emergency plans as regards the initial conditions of the dam break scenario the water level in the reservoir should be equivalent to the corresponding level for determining the height of the dam while different break mechanisms can be considered depending on the dam structure e g the sudden break for gravity and arch dams and in the presence of dams in series with respect to the result disclosure water depth and velocity resulting

england as amended by the flood and water management act 2010 the reservoirs act 1975 regulates reservoirs in this framework detailed flood maps are used by the environment agency to assess the reservoir risk as well as by local authorities to prepare emergency plans in order to mitigate the effects of flooding resulting from any reservoir water escape icold 2020 according to the guidance for drawing reservoir flood maps https www gov uk guidance reservoir flood maps when and how to use them preparing a flood risk assessment each map actually accounts for two flooding scenarios induced by the dam reservoir failure the first scenario dry day assumes as initial conditions a water level in the reservoir corresponding to the spillway level and a normal level in the rivers reaches upstream and downstream of the reservoir conversely the second scenario wet day assumes that just before the failure the water level in the reservoir is higher than the top water level and that the river downstream of the reservoir is already experiencing an extreme natural flood with an annual probability of 0 1 adept environment agency 2019 as regards the failure mechanism both scenarios assume a void occurring from the top to the base of the dam e g the bed of the watercourse just downstream moreover the guide to risk assessment for reservoir safety management provided by the environment agency 2013 outlines a procedure for dams in england and wales consisting in three principal steps i e identification analysis and evaluation of the risk and based on three tiers that allow assessing the risk at i qualitative ii simplified quantitative and iii detailed quantitative manner as regards the modelling tool the third tier iii points out that only rigorous 2d flow models are capable of simulating extreme and rapidly varying flows a 4 finland with the aim of reducing the hazard related to dams the dam safety act dsa 494 2009 https www finlex fi en laki kaannokset 2009 en20090494 pdf and the government decree on dam safety dds 319 2010 https www finlex fi en laki kaannokset 2010 en20100319 pdf contain provisions concerning dam break hazard analyses icold 2020 details about the contents of these norms and general guidelines to assess the impacts of dam breaches are also outlined in the dam safety guide dsg https www environment fi en us waters use of water resources dams and dam safety dam safety guide whose publication was updated in 2018 the dsg affirms that the hazard analysis should compare different possible dam breach scenarios depending on the dam structure and its resistance to erosion and considering both normal and flood conditions for example the sudden collapse of an embankment dam is assumed to occur both due to internal erosion and overflow with regard to the computational model the dsg specifies that extensive data computations are not always necessary to define the flood hazard of a dam failure however for the modelling of channel flows one or two dimensional dynamic flow equations shall be used as regards the resulting scenarios the guidelines affirm that they shall be represented using maps at a convenient scale and tables the maps should draw the maximum flood coverage the flood evolution at relevant times e g 0 5 1 2 and 3 h after the breach occurs the maximum water depth the location of the computed cross sections the arrival times of the wetting front and of the maximum water level at each cross section when dealing with 2d models additional maps concerning the maximum flow velocity and a damage parameter product of water depth and velocity are required the values of these variables of interest reached in each cross section should also be listed in summary tables a 5 usa federal guidelines for dam safety were introduced in 1979 in order to address issues concerning among the others dam safety dam failure studies and inundation mapping the federal guidelines for inundation mapping of flood risks associated with dam incidents and failures fema 2013 provide operational instructions to model and represent a dam breach i e an opening through the dam usually associated with its total or partial failure that causes the sudden rapid and uncontrolled empting of the reservoir focusing on the hydrological conditions two types of breaches are identified hydrological breaches occurring with extreme precipitation and runoff and sunny day breaches which are originated during fair weather in the absence of an inflow due to storm events if the flow generated by the dam breach is at least two times larger than the base flow the latter can be neglected as regards the initial water level in the reservoir different values may be considered for the fair weather failure e g normal pool elevation usually recommended as the default volume invert of auxiliary spillway and top of the dam the guidelines also provide criteria for the definition of the downstream extent of the scenario for the sunny day failures the limit should be established so that the flood breach does not pose a risk to life and properties e g no more habitable structures are involved or the flow is contained in the downstream channel conversely the downstream limit of hydrological failures is located where the rise in the water level is negligible or the difference between the water surface elevations resulting from the basin runoff in the absence and in the presence of a dam failure is below a given threshold the breach parameters have to be selected according to some characteristics of the dam such as the dimension the type the materials of construction and the historical records e g foundation problems and a sensitivity analysis should be performed for example the average width of earth fill dam breaches is 0 5 5 times the dam height the side slope is between 0 1 and 1 1 and the formation time is between 0 1 and 4 h recommendations concerning the choice of the routing model e g simplified methods 1d and 2d models with reference to the hazard potential are also provided the selection of the computational model indeed depends on the damage potentially caused by the failure according to a balanced tiered approach for example a tier level 3 which is applicable to a high hazard potential due to the presence of large dams and sufficient population at risk requires unsteady one dimensional models or two dimensional ones for the downstream routing of the breach hydrograph to properly fit the end use e g emergency response and mitigation planning the features of the inundation maps are finally described the adoption of base maps e g orthophotographic or planimetric over which representing the inundation information and the delineation of inundation polygons are some of the recommended elements to provide easy to use hardcopy inundation maps a 6 india under the dam rehabilitation and improvement project the government of india established in 2018 guidelines for mapping flood risks associated with dams central water commission 2018 in order to facilitate the preparation of emergency action plans for dams focusing on the redaction of inundation maps the guidelines analyse the types of possible dam failures and summarize the formulas and the methods for computing the breach parameters since the dam breach inundation mapping relies on a tiered approach with three levels of analysis basic intermediate and advanced the selection of these parameters and of the routing model mainly depends on the hazard and the population at risk as regards the study area it is pointed out that it should reach downstream the point where the analysed river debouches either into the sea larger river large reservoir within a few tens of kilometres or the flow velocities reduce to values of 0 3 m s or the flow area is inside the normal river boundary with reference to the numerical modelling the guide specifies that simplified methods which require less runtimes cannot be applied to all cases whereas full dynamic wave equations e g shallow water equations fit almost all hydraulic problems and hence should be used for dam breach analyses the choice of the terrain data and of the roughness coefficient are further analysed in order to assess hazard to downstream populations and properties the flood hazard mapping has to represent the maximum water depth velocity and the inundation duration 
2199,this paper presents a procedure based on high resolution shallow water modelling for assessing dam failure hypothetical scenarios that can be useful for designing emergency action plans the capability of accurately predicting the areas flooded by these catastrophic events both in terms of timing and magnitude represents indeed a key task for emergency planning the proposed procedure relies on the adoption of a parallel two dimensional shallow water numerical model capable of both preventing large computational times and enabling the use of high resolution meshes without introducing approximations in the set of the governing equations criteria for selecting the numerical model the input data such as bathymetry and the initial conditions are analysed in detail the procedure is adopted to model the flooding scenarios induced by the failure of two dams in northern italy built for irrigation and flood mitigation purposes respectively keywords dam failure induced floods dam break dam breach shallow water modelling hazard assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dams and reservoirs have been constructed with multiple purposes e g irrigation hydropower water supply for domestic and industrial use navigation and flood control and often in correlation with the socio economic development of their respective countries chen et al 2016 the icold world register of dams counted around 58 700 dams worldwide widespread at april 2020 but this number is estimated to grow in the future e g as a response to the renewable energy requirements of an increasing population zarfl et al 2015 despite the benefits on society prosperity dams might be subject to accidents causing rapid and uncontrolled water releases in the past

g shihgang in 1999 design errors e g gleno in 1923 and war acts e g eder in 1943 in other cases even if the dam did not collapse the fall of a rockslide into the lake caused huge releases of water with dramatic consequences for the downstream territories and human lives e g vajont in 1963 a useful instrument to mitigate the risk caused by these catastrophic events relies on the capability of reliably predicting the consequences that a dam failure induced inundation may exert on the downstream populated areas for this reason many national laws prescribe to draw up emergency action plans eaps with the aim of minimizing damage to life and properties in case of partial or total dam failure e g by implementing early warning procedures and evacuation planning and by identifying critical infrastructures and population at risk meanwhile researchers have developed numerical models capable of reconstructing historical dam failures such as the ones of gleno pilotti et al 2011 bouzey smith 2017 st francis begnudelli and sanders 2007 sella zerbino petaccia et al 2016 niedow kostecki and banasiak 2021 and dam overtopping such as the vajont disaster vacondio et al 2013 despite the modelling of historical floods generated by dam breaks has been widely discussed in the literature aureli et al 2021 the assessment of inundation maps for the redaction of eaps still represents a challenging task for example due to the uncertainties in the definition of the initial conditions of the reservoir and of the dam failure mechanisms and to the complexity of the downstream topography sometimes with very steep slopes within this context dam failure induced floods have been recently simulated by means of simplified or one dimensional 1d schemes among the others zhou et al 2015 gaagai et al 2022 verma patra 2022 also for evaluating cascade dam risk zhou et al 2020 even if two dimensional 2d applications have been presented among the others azeez et al 2020 urzică et al 2021 marangoz anilan 2022 sarchani koutroulis 2022 this paper aims at presenting a procedure based on numerical modelling for predicting flooding scenarios due to dam failures overcoming some critical points of existing approaches which are currently adopted in different countries to assess the hydraulic hazard and or risk related to these events the degree of detail of national legislations about this topic is actually slightly variable and a review of some guidelines is here carried out in order to highlight differences and similarities of the approaches mentioned there starting from this the integrated procedure here proposed focuses on the adoption of 2d shallow water models capable of accurately describing the propagation of a dam break induced flood on real bathymetries high resolution digital terrain models dtms are required in order to account for the presence of terrain elements that may affect the flood dynamic such as road channel embankments and urban areas focusing on the flooding scenarios the procedure assumes a failure occurring when the water level in the reservoir equals the maximum admissible one as upstream condition an inflow discharge hydrograph is considered when its volume is not negligible compared to the reservoir one as often occurs dealing with small flood mitigations dam as failure mode the procedure assumes a sudden collapse for concrete dams and a gradual breach evolution for earthen dams the formation of breaches along the earthen embankments of flood detention reservoirs located in lowland is also evaluated the assumptions related to the dam failure mechanisms and the initial hydraulic conditions of the reservoir are discussed the proposed procedure is applied to two reservoirs in northern italy a concrete dam located in the mountain mignano dam and a flood mitigation dam located in lowland parma flood mitigation dam the outline of the paper is as follows the proposed procedure is presented in sect 2 applied to real cases in sect 3 and 4 and extensively discussed in sect 5 finally concluding remarks are drawn in sect 6 and some of the existing legislations and guidelines to cope with dam failure scenarios are described in appendix a 2 a procedure for modelling and mapping dam failure hazard a possible integrated procedure for the assessment of dam failure hazard is summarized in fig 1 the proposed approach requires i the choice of topographic data i e terrain description and roughness estimation ii the assumption on the dam failure mechanism and the related initial hydraulic and eventually boundary conditions iii the numerical modelling of the flooding scenarios and iv the post processing of the output data all these key aspects are discussed in the following sections 2 1 topographic data with the aim of describing the relevant terrain elements that may interact with a dam failure induced flood the procedure requires the adoption of high resolution dtms the use of adequate topographic information is indeed one of the key elements to obtain accurate inundation maps casas et al 2006 mason et al 2007 2015 and both low cost high resolution remotely sensed data néelz et al 2006 and lidar light detection and ranging based dtms kakoulaki et al 2021 are nowadays accessible the chosen dtm has to fulfil some properties firstly it has to accurately describe the reservoir area in order to avoid over or under predictions of the flooded areas due to over or under estimations of the storage water volume e g the topography of the submerged zones has to be integrated e g with bathymetric surveys if the lidar survey is carried out when the reservoir is not completely empty moreover the dtm has to adequately include all the relevant elements that may interact with the flood propagation such as buildings in urban areas schubert and sanders 2012 roads channels and embankments filtering algorithms often manage to remove vegetation and false structures potentially obstructing the flow but they are unable to reconstruct hidden small urban features meesuk et al 2015 therefore it is important to integrate the missing small scale urban features in the dtm e g with ground view data néelz et al 2006 meesuk et al 2015 within topographic data it is also necessary to define the roughness parameter that quantifies the flow resistance due to e g surface irregularities and vegetation calibration procedures are best suited for estimating the roughness values characterizing the river located downstream of the dam e g by reconstructing the water level time series recorded at gauging instruments in the absence of data concerning historical flooding events and outside of the riverbed roughness can be inferred from literature based on land use maps 2 2 hydraulic conditions and failure mechanisms the initial conditions and the failure mechanisms sketched in fig 1 are herein assumed in accordance with many of the existing legislations recalled in appendix a with regard to the initial conditions the methodology considers that just before the dam failure the water level in the reservoir equals the maximum admissible one which normally corresponds to the spillway crest an inflow discharge hydrograph e g a synthetic design hydrograph sdh with assigned return period should be considered as upstream boundary condition when its volume is not negligible compared to the reservoir one in this case the maximum water level is reached at the arrival of the inflow peak to achieve this goal the simulation starts before the beginning of the failure in such a way that the volume of the inflow hydrograph rising limb is equal to the reservoir one at the considered water level as a result the peak of the inflow hydrograph superimposes the one induced by the sudden water release this worst scenario might be quite realistic especially for relatively small flood detention reservoirs otherwise if the inflow volume is negligible compared to the reservoir one as often occurs in large mountain reservoirs with relatively small upstream watersheds no upstream condition is imposed for both the hydraulic conditions the bottom outlets are assumed inoperative to increase the severity of the scenario as regards the failure mechanisms the methodology assumes a sudden collapse for concrete dams and a gradual breach evolution for earthen dams in accordance with many of the existing legislations recalled in appendix a moreover in the presence of flood control reservoirs located in lowland which are usually bounded by horizontal earthen embankments the procedure assumes the formation of a breach in the levee portion that presents the higher elevation above the surrounding terrain the breach which is here assumed to evolve gradually is modelled following a geometric approach and using the parameters e g the final length and the evolution time resulting from an empirical formulation froehlich 2008 based on the data collected after historical events empirical approaches froehlich 2008 xu and zhang 2009 asce ewri task committee on dam levee breaching 2011 define simple formulations for evaluating e g the formation time of the breach and its average width based on some geometric characteristics height of the earthen dam volume retained in the lake etc 2 3 numerical model the numerical model used within the procedure should satisfy some requirements firstly it should adopt a 2d schematization since 1d or quasi 2d schemes which are faster and easier to implement are not adequate to describe flows with no predefined directions such as dam break induced floods moreover it should solve the complete 2d shallow water equations swes in order to accurately reproduce transitions between sub and supercritical flows and vice versa since these phenomena which are not rare dealing with a dam break flow cannot be adequately simulated by diffusive schemes costabile et al 2017 with regard to the numerical approximation of the 2d swes the choice of appropriate explicit finite volume fv schemes allows reproducing without any special treatment transcritical flows shock type discontinuities and a robust treatment of wet and dry fronts over irregular topographies liang and marche 2009 the numerical model can solve the governing equations on non uniform meshes either unstructured liang et al 2008 sætra et al 2015 or structured vacondio et al 2017 in order to discretize the domain with different resolution levels thus keeping high resolution only for relevant terrain features and reduce the runtimes local time step methods may also be considered when dealing with small cells in order to avoid excessive restrictions on the time step due to the stability condition sanders 2008 dazzi et al 2018 hu et al 2019a hu et al 2019b finally the shallow water model may also take advantage of parallelization sanders et al 2010 to further reduce the computational burden as an example the exploitation of graphics processing units gpus ensured a reduction of the runtimes sometimes of two orders of magnitude with respect to cpu based models castro et al 2011 brodtkorb et al 2012 vacondio et al 2014 lacasta et al 2015 juez et al 2016 vacondio et al 2017 a non exhaustive list of 2d hydrodynamic models commonly used for flood simulations is reported in table 1 together with their main characteristics 2 4 output data most of the measures contained in eaps such as the identification of the areas that can temporarily host people and the definition of roads at risk tightly depend on the results of the numerical modelling therefore the procedure suggests processing a few maps representing some useful indicators fig 1 such as the maximum water depth and velocity which enable identifying e g populated areas requiring evacuation interruptions to infrastructures erosion phenomena along overtopped embankments and stability reductions of cars and pedestrians milanesi et al 2015 arrighi et al 2017 water depth and velocity information can also be combined in order to assess hazard aureli et al 2008 ferrari et al 2019 lazzarin et al 2022 finally the flood dynamic may be summarized by mapping the arrival time of the wetting front beyond the contents the output maps have to preserve a resolution similar to the one adopted in the computational grid i e the high level of detail of the simulations should not be significantly downgraded by the results post processing and they should be provided in a format supported by gis environment to be used for planning operations e g by overlapping other layers 3 the case of the mignano dam the mignano dam is a concrete gravity dam located in northern italy on the arda river a small right tributary of the po river aureli et al 2014 fig 2 at the maximum storage level the lake created by the dam is around 2 8 km long with an average water depth of 16 3 m maranzoni and mignosa 2019 at the elevation of the spillway crest the maximum water depth behind the dam is around 38 m and the stored water volume is about 15 106 m3 the dam break scenario was simulated using the parflood model vacondio et al 2014 vacondio et al 2017 which satisfies the requirements outlined in sect 2 3 in fact the model solves the well balanced set of complete 2d swes liang and borthwick 2009 1 u t f x g y s 0 s f where the vectors of the conserved variables u and of the fluxes f and g in the x and y directions respectively and the bed slope s 0 and friction s f source terms are defined as 2 u η u h v h f uh u 2 h 1 2 g η 2 2 η z u v h g vh u v h v 2 h 1 2 g η 2 2 η z s 0 0

directions respectively g the gravitational acceleration and nf the manning s roughness coefficient the model integrates the equations through an explicit finite volume scheme and computes the numerical fluxes with the hllc approximate riemann solver toro 2001 to avoid non physical velocities at wet dry fronts the correction proposed by kurganov and petrova 2007 is adopted the model achieves both first and second order of accuracy in space and time adopting for the latter case a depth positive muscl extrapolation of the conserved variables values at the cell boundaries and a second order runge kutta time integration the code is written in compute unified device architecture cuda language a framework introduced by nvidia to exploit both the gpu the device and the cpu the host ensuring speedups of two orders if compared with the cpu version the model discretizes the computational domain with a block uniform quadtree grid that allows adopting variable resolutions while preserving the gpu efficiency for more details about the model which was efficiently adopted also within inverse procedures ferrari et al 2018 the reader can refer to vacondio et al 2014 2017 3 1 model setup the dtm adopted in the simulation derived from a lidar survey carried out upon the arda valley in 2017 it presents a resolution of 1 m 1 m and it covers an area of about 200 km2 following the items described in sect 2 1 the bathymetry of the lake was firstly integrated using a survey carried out in 2015 when the reservoir was empty for maintenance purposes then some levee crests of the downstream reach of the arda river which were not adequately described in the dtm due to the presence of dense vegetation along the banks were corrected based on a classical topographic survey finally the buildings of fiorenzuola d arda village were explicitly described in the computational mesh following the building hole method in order to reproduce local variations of the flow field schubert and sanders 2012 it is worth mentioning that other approaches can be adopted when simulating the effects exerted by urban areas on the flood propagation such as the one based on the solution of the shallow water equations with porosity e g ferrari et al 2019 ferrari viero 2020 ayoub et al 2022 among the others the domain was discretized through a buq multi resolution grid vacondio et al 2017 the highest resolution 2 m was imposed in the reservoir along the river and in urban areas whereas road railway embankments and rural zones were described with 4 m and 8 m respectively the computational grid entailed about 13 9 106 cells 3 2 model calibration the roughness coefficient characterizing the river region was calibrated by reproducing the arrival times of some flood waves which were artificially generated through the opening of the dam s bottom outlets at several gauging stations fig 2 conversely the roughness parameter of rural areas was estimated based on literature values by modelling the flooding time evolution of historical dam breaks in fact some authors assumed coefficients in the range of 0 025 0 1 m 1 3s e g valiani et al 2002 pilotti et al 2011 petaccia et al 2016 moreover vacondio et al 2016 adopted a value of 0 05 m 1 3s to reproduce the arrival times of a levee breach induced flooding occurred in a nearby river in 2014 since the area here involved presents quite similar characteristics the same value was assumed in this work a sensitivity analysis was however performed see sect 5 in order to evaluate the influence of the roughness parameter on the water depths and arrival times of the simulated scenario 3 3 dam break flooding scenario following the procedure described in sect 2 2 the instantaneous collapse of the concrete gravity dam was assumed to occur with an initial water level in the reservoir equal to the spillway crest no inflow hydrograph was imposed since the upstream catchment is only 70 km2 wide and the volume of the 200 year return period sdh does not significantly over exceed the reservoir one as downstream boundary condition a stage discharge relationship was imposed at the confluence between the arda river and the po river the map of the maximum non simultaneous simulated water depths is shown in fig 3 a where the inset depicts the flooding of the fiorenzuola d arda village the most inhabited and affected one the peak discharge at the dam site fig 4 a is around 31000 m3 s oscillations around the peak are due to 2d effects of water converging toward the dam section about two orders of magnitude greater than the peak of the 200 year return period hydrological event estimated at the entrance of the lake 450 m3 s in 20 min a halved flood peak reaches the nearest village of lugagnano val d arda fig 4b potentially causing the demolition of bridges and buildings 10 min later the reservoir is completely emptied moving downstream the fiorenzuola d arda village is flooded in 1 h fig 3b whereas the northernmost areas are reached in 6 to 9 h the peak discharge at villanova sull arda is similar to the conveyable capacity of the river fig 4c with the purpose of considering the simultaneous effect of water depth and velocity for flood hazard assessment the maximum total depth d is adopted aureli et al 2008 ferrari et al 2019 3 d h 1 2 fr 2 where h represents the water depth and fr the froude number values of d equal to 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 m were assumed to bound low medium high and very high hazard fig 5 the focus on fiorenzuola d arda fig 5 shows that more than half of this area presents high and very high hazard values thus highlighting the importance of defining adequate flood management strategies to avoid human life losses 4 the case of the parma flood mitigation dam the parma flood mitigation dam is located in northern italy on the parma river a right tributary of the po river fig 6 the reservoir which is bounded by earthen levees is usually empty and used to mitigate floods potentially threating the town of parma the storage volume at the spillway crest level is about 10 106 m3 when a flood wave occurs the three movable gates at the bottom outlets of the concrete dam are progressively lowered in order to release a discharge conveyable by the river the stored water volume is then released at the end of the event 4 1 model setup the dtm adopted in the simulations presents a resolution of 1 m 1 m and it derived from recent lidar surveys carried out when the reservoir was empty the studied domain was discretized through a buq multi resolution grid vacondio et al 2017 the highest resolution 2 m was imposed in the reservoir in urban areas buildings in the town of parma were modelled following the building hole method schubert and sanders 2012 along the river and road channel embankments whereas the lowest resolution 8 m was assigned to rural zones the computational grid entailed about 20 106 cells 4 2 model calibration the river roughness was defined by reconstructing recent flood hydrographs i e by reproducing the maximum water surface elevation profiles along the river and the water level time series recorded in a downstream gauging station fig 6 for the floodable areas outside the riverbed the value of 0 05 m 1 3s was assumed sect 3 2 4 3 dam break flooding scenario following the procedure described in sect 2 2 the concrete gravity dam was assumed to collapse when the initial water level in the reservoir reached the spillway crest a 200 year return period inflow hydrograph was imposed as upstream condition since its volume 73 106 m3 is almost an order of magnitude greater than the reservoir one 10 106 m3 the bottom gates were considered closed before the failure and the reservoir was progressively filled by the incoming flood wave when the water level in the reservoir reached the spillway crest i e when the inflow peak occurred the concrete dam was assumed to collapse as downstream boundary condition a stage discharge relationship was imposed at the confluence between the parma and the po rivers as for the mignano scenario the influence of this condition on the flood is substantially negligible the resulting flood wave at the dam site presents the same volume of the inflow hydrograph the reservoir was initially empty but the peak discharge is 8 times higher due to the overlapping between the hydrological peak and the dam break induced one fig 7 the discharge hydrographs reached in sections s1 and s2 exceed both the conveyable capacity of the river and the peaks of a 200 years hydrological event even in section s3 although the discharge has significantly reduced the flood is not yet completely contained in the river due to the presence of a bottleneck in correspondence of an ancient bridge more than half of the town of parma is flooded in less than 1 h fig 8 reaching medium high velocity values and high very high hazard total depth ones fig 9 whereas the northernmost lowland areas are flooded in 5 to 10 h 4 4 dam breach flooding scenarios since the parma flood mitigation dam presents earthen embankments flooding scenarios induced by the formation of breaches were also simulated sect 2 2 by assuming a 1000 year sdh entering the reservoir closed dam bottom gates and clogged spillway this latter assumption was introduced since wooden debris carried by the incoming flood might partially or totally hit the piers located along the spillway crest to support roads e g the palagnedra dam overtopping case bruschin et al 1982 the breach was assumed to develop when the water level in the reservoir reached the levee crest elevation simultaneously with the inflow peak as the levee crest is horizontal two breach locations were independently simulated in the northernmost portion of the levee close to the dam on the right and on the left side respectively where the embankments reach the maximum elevation of around 12 m above the surrounding terrain fig 10 the breaches were modelled with a geometric approach ferrari et al 2020 adopting the froehlich formula froehlich 2008 4 b 0 27 k 0 v w 0 32 h b 0 04 5 t f 63 2 v w g h b 2 where b represents the final average width side slope 1 1 is assumed for overtopping failures k 0 is a factor accounting for the failure mode e g k 0 1 3 for overtopping vw denotes the water volume above the breach bottom at the beginning of the failure hb is the final height of the breach and tf the breach formation time the breach reached a final averaged width of 78 m in 2 1 h slightly different values result by adopting other empirical formulas such as the one proposed in xu and zhang 2009 in this case the breach would open in about 2 8 h reaching the maximum width of 63 m the maps of the maximum water depths resulting from the left and right breach openings which are shown in fig 10 highlight the macroscopic difference between the two flooding scenarios at the occurrence of the left levee failure the discharge flowing through the breach partially propagates west of the parma river and partially flows back into the unleeved riverbed just downstream the dam even if the outflow peak discharge fig 11 is less than half of that caused by the instantaneous collapse of the dam fig 7 both the parma downtown and lowlands are flooded conversely the wave flowing out from the right breach mostly propagates northeast probably in an ancient paleochannel of the parma river and only a small part flows back into the current riverbed fig 10b in this scenario the parma downtown is preserved from flooding but other small villages in lowlands at east are instead heavily involved 5 discussion in this section the main assumptions of the proposed procedure are critically analysed regarding recent literature in order to outline the reliability of the results model topography was derived by selectively downsampling a high resolution 1 m 1 m dtm obtained from a lidar scan in such a way that the main characteristics influencing the flooding dynamics are kept unchanged uncertainty may rely on the roughness values assumed for the floodable areas since the discharge conveyed in the river is a small fraction of the one caused by the failure a sensitivity analysis was then performed for the mignano case by considering roughness variations in the range of 25 the resulting flooded areas are compared in fig 12 for the northernmost part of the domain where the wetting front fragments on lowlands and roughness plays a more relevant role given a total flooded area of 69 km2 resulting from the reference simulation the adoption of 25 higher and lower roughness values determines the flooding of around 67 and 70 km2 respectively the differences are less than 3 even the arrival times show moderate variations which cannot substantially affect the planning of safety interventions the adoption of a 2d shallow water model has proved to be fundamental for modelling the impacts of dam failures since the flooding dynamic of these events cannot be defined a priori e g when paleochannels are reactivated during the flood propagation fig 10b even the shallow water approximations may in some cases do not strictly hold e g near the dam soon after the collapse but despite some studies overcame this issue solving for example vertically averaged and moment vam equations cantero chinchilla et al 2020 or fully 3d equations through lagrangian approaches e g smoothed particle hydrodynamics vacondio et al 2013 their use in real cases is still limited by the high computational burden the adopted numerical model solves the complete 2d swes since diffusive schemes which neglect inertial terms are not suitable for modelling these rapidly varying flows mainly due to their inability to manage the transitions between sub and supercritical flows and vice versa and to the fact that inertial terms play an important role mignosa et al 2018 costabile et al 2020 2017 dazzi et al 2021 in order to better clarify this latter issue the momentum equations of the swes are written in 2d non conservative form 6 1 g u t u g u x v g u y u g v y η x s fx 0 1 g v t v g u x u g v x v g v y η y s fy 0 where the first term denotes the local acceleration slope the second one the whole square brackets the convective acceleration slopes the third one the water surface slope and the last one the friction slope as shown in fig 13 for a selected time after the mignano dam break the values of the inertial terms sum of the local and the convective acceleration slopes are of the same order of magnitude of the water surface slope neglecting these terms would thus lead to unacceptable approximations in the numerical results a high return period sdh t 200 or t 1000 years was imposed as upstream boundary condition in the case of the parma flood mitigation dam since its volume was significant with respect to the reservoir one moreover the dam levee failure was assumed to occur at the arrival of the inflow peak since dealing with a flood control reservoir that is usually empty the failure is expected to be correlated with a flood event as shown in fig 14 for the dam break scenario the absence of an inflow hydrograph would largely underestimate the downstream flooded areas with reference to the failure mode concrete dams were assumed to collapse also considering that similar events were already experienced in the past e g malpasset dam valiani et al 2002 as regards the modelling of embankment breaches coupled hydrodynamic erosion models inherently account for both the hydrodynamic conditions and the levee characteristics however they require the knowledge of some parameters characterizing the levee material such as the porosity p the critical shear stress τ c and the erodibility coefficient k d even if the first one can be easily assessed with local surveys and the others retrieved in the literature there is still some uncertainty in the values to be adopted since during a breach evolution the effective shear stresses τ are usually one or more frequently two orders of magnitude higher than the critical ones a sensitivity analysis was here carried out with reference to the erodibility parameter by adopting a physically based approach that couples the 2d swes with an erosion model dazzi et al 2019 7 z x y t k d m a x τ τ c 0 1 p in the analysis three values of the erodibility coefficient were tested the one calibrated in dazzi et al 2019 to simulate a real breach occurred in a nearby river k d 2 a 50 lower value k d 1 and a 25 higher one k d 3 as shown in fig 15 the breaches resulting by adopting the geometric approach and the erosion model are quite similar the latter ones evolve in 2 to 3 h reaching average widths from 70 to 105 m and the outflow hydrographs although presenting different shapes have quite similar peak values the peak discharge resulting from the geometric model is about 30 higher than that obtained with the erosion model this causes the heaviest effects at least near the breach whereas far away the differences progressively reduce but this aspect deserves further investigation finally other physical phenomena that might locally influence the propagation of the dam failure induced floods are the potential collapse of buildings or infrastructures the transport of solid material rocks wooden debris remnants of buildings and of the dam itself and soil erosion for the two considered test cases these phenomena were considered negligible the collapse of buildings and infrastructures might affect only the narrow valley downstream the mignano dam where the flood wave still has enough energy to destroy buildings whereas elsewhere and for the parma mitigation dam only bridges in the river which are almost all overtopped by the flow may be damaged this aspect might be considered when modelling dams with large reservoirs located in valleys with steeper slopes e g milanesi and pilotti 2021 as regards solid material which in some cases may play a relevant role recent studies investigated the blockage of reservoir spillways due to large wood furlan et al 2021 and the transport of floating wooden material in rivers persi et al 2022 but their extension to dam break induced floods is still challenging focusing on the bed erosion deposition mechanisms which are often studied through laboratory investigations e g khosravi et al 2021 despite some 2d models adopting different sediment transport formulations well reproduced laboratory experimental data among the others xia et al 2010 soares frazão et al 2012 their application to prototype scale on complex topographies and with huge discharges deserve further investigation 6 conclusions and future work floods induced by dam failures are by far less frequent than that generated by hydrological events but their catastrophic consequences require an enhancement of the management strategies with the aim of improving hazard mapping this paper proposed a procedure based on shallow water modelling the application of the procedure to two reservoirs in northern italy characterized by different purposes volume and location allowed assessing the following items the flooding scenarios have to be simulated using a fully 2d shallow water model since inertial contributions play a relevant role in the mignano case inertial terms and water surface slope have the same order of magnitude and no preferential flow directions can be assumed a priori in the parma test an ancient paleochannel in rural areas was reactivated the flooding dynamic is only marginally influenced by the roughness coefficient used to describe the rural areas the sensitivity analysis on the mignano dam case highlighted only moderate variations of the flooded areas and of the arrival times an inflow discharge hydrograph has to be imposed as upstream condition e g when dealing with flood mitigation dams which are usually empty before a flood wave occurs the results for the parma flood mitigation dam which unlike the mignano dam is usually empty and with a non negligible inflow hydrograph confirmed the importance of considering an inflow condition multiple breach locations should be considered when dealing with reservoirs bounded by horizontal earthen embankments the modelling of two bank failures along the embankments of the parma reservoir one at the left and one at right of the dam was fundamental to capture flooded areas far from the dam that otherwise would erroneously be considered safe the procedure can be extended to other similar dams when dealing with emergency planning the dynamic modelling of building collapse due to flood impact is left to future work credit authorship contribution statement alessia ferrari methodology

outlets are contained in the circular letter n dstn 2 22806 of 1995 disposizioni attuative ed integrative in materia di dighe these dispositions prescribe that a dam break scenario has to evaluate the consequences of the worst failure mechanism among those suggested for the different dam types and that the initial conditions depend on the dam structure as an example the collapse of concrete dams is assumed to be sudden and complete apart some special cases with the water level in the reservoir at the spillway crest neglecting both the upstream inflow and the outflow at the bottom outlets and considering the river downstream of the dam in dry conditions as regards the flood propagation modelling the adoption of a numerical model that has been previously validated against real cases is prescribed despite no remarks regarding the choice of 1d or 2d models are explicitly provided the result representation strictly refers to a 1d approach beyond the redaction of an inundation map

water storage structures https www fedlex admin ch and with regard to emergency plans it specifies that inundation maps have to represent the zones potentially flooded in case of sudden collapse of water retaining structures flooding arrival times are also required to properly alert the population in case of a total and instantaneous failure the activation of sirens is indeed required for people living in areas that would be flooded in less than two hours whereas a general alarm system invites the population living in far areas to listen the evacuation instructions icold 2020 more details

england as amended by the flood and water management act 2010 the reservoirs act 1975 regulates reservoirs in this framework detailed flood maps are used by the environment agency to assess the reservoir risk as well as by local authorities to prepare emergency plans in order to mitigate the effects of flooding resulting from any reservoir water escape icold 2020 according to the guidance for drawing reservoir flood maps https www gov uk guidance reservoir flood maps when and how to use them preparing a flood risk assessment each map actually accounts for two flooding scenarios induced by the dam reservoir failure the first scenario dry day assumes as initial conditions a water level in the reservoir corresponding to the spillway level and a normal level in the rivers reaches upstream and downstream of the reservoir conversely the second scenario wet day assumes that just before the failure the water level in the reservoir is higher than the top water level and that the river downstream of the reservoir is already experiencing an extreme natural flood with an annual probability of 0 1 adept environment agency 2019 as regards the failure mechanism both scenarios assume a void occurring from the top to the base of the dam e g the bed of the watercourse just downstream moreover the guide to risk assessment for reservoir safety management provided by the environment agency 2013 outlines a procedure for dams in england and wales consisting in three principal steps i e identification analysis and evaluation of the risk and based on three tiers that allow assessing the risk at i qualitative ii simplified quantitative and iii detailed quantitative manner as regards the modelling tool the third tier iii points out that only rigorous 2d flow models are capable of simulating extreme and rapidly varying flows a 4 finland with the aim of reducing the hazard related to dams the dam safety act dsa 494 2009 https www finlex fi en laki kaannokset 2009

details about the contents of these norms and general guidelines to assess the impacts of dam breaches are also outlined in the dam safety guide dsg https www environment fi en us waters use of water resources dams and dam safety dam safety guide whose publication was updated in 2018 the dsg affirms that the hazard analysis should compare different possible dam breach scenarios depending on the dam structure and its resistance to erosion and considering both normal and flood conditions for example the sudden collapse of an embankment dam is assumed to occur both due to internal erosion and overflow with regard to the computational model the dsg specifies that extensive data computations are not always necessary to define the flood hazard of a dam failure however for the modelling of channel flows one or two dimensional dynamic flow equations shall be used as regards the resulting scenarios the guidelines affirm that they shall be represented using maps at a convenient scale and tables the maps should draw the maximum flood coverage the flood evolution at relevant times e g 0 5 1 2 and 3 h after the breach occurs the maximum water depth the location of the computed cross sections the arrival times of the wetting front and of the maximum water level at each cross section when dealing with 2d models additional maps concerning the maximum flow velocity and a damage parameter product of water depth and velocity are required the values of these variables of interest reached in each cross section should also be listed in summary tables a 5 usa federal guidelines for dam safety were introduced in 1979 in order to address issues concerning among the others dam safety dam failure studies and inundation mapping the federal guidelines for inundation mapping of flood risks associated with dam incidents and failures fema 2013 provide operational instructions to model and represent a dam breach i e an opening through the dam usually associated with its total or partial failure that causes the sudden rapid and uncontrolled empting of the reservoir focusing on the hydrological conditions two types of breaches are identified hydrological breaches occurring with extreme precipitation and runoff and sunny day breaches which are originated during fair weather in the absence of an inflow due to storm events if the flow generated by the dam breach is at least two times larger than the base flow the latter can be neglected as regards the initial water level in the reservoir different values may be considered for the fair weather failure e g normal pool elevation usually recommended as the default volume invert of auxiliary spillway and top of the dam the guidelines also provide criteria for the definition of the downstream extent of the scenario for the sunny day failures the limit should be established so that the flood breach does not pose a risk to life and properties e g no more habitable structures are involved or the flow is contained in the downstream channel conversely the downstream limit of hydrological failures is located where the rise in the water level is negligible or the difference between the water surface elevations resulting from the basin runoff in the absence and in the presence of a dam failure is below a given threshold the breach parameters have to be selected according to some characteristics of the dam such as the dimension the type the materials of construction and the historical records e g foundation problems and a sensitivity analysis should be performed for example the average width of earth fill dam breaches is 0 5 5 times the dam height the side slope is between 0 1 and 1 1 and the formation time is between 0 1 and 4 h recommendations concerning the choice of the routing model e g simplified methods 1d and 2d models with reference to the hazard potential are also provided the selection of the computational model indeed depends on the damage potentially caused by the failure according to a balanced tiered approach for example a tier level 3 which is applicable to a high hazard potential due to the presence of large dams and sufficient population at risk requires unsteady one dimensional models or two dimensional ones for the downstream routing of the breach hydrograph to properly fit the end use e g emergency response and mitigation planning the features of the inundation maps are finally described the adoption of base maps e g orthophotographic or planimetric over which representing the inundation information and the delineation of inundation polygons are some of the recommended elements to provide easy to use hardcopy inundation maps a 6 india under the dam rehabilitation and improvement project the government of india established in 2018 guidelines for mapping flood risks associated with dams central water commission 2018 in order to facilitate the preparation of emergency action plans for dams focusing on the redaction of inundation maps the guidelines analyse the types of possible dam failures and summarize the formulas and the methods for computing the breach parameters since the dam breach inundation mapping relies on a tiered approach with three levels of analysis basic intermediate and advanced the selection of these parameters and of the routing model mainly depends on the hazard and the population at risk as regards the study area it is pointed out that it should reach downstream the point where the analysed river debouches either into the sea larger river large reservoir within a few tens of kilometres or the flow velocities reduce to values of 0 3 m s or the flow area is inside the normal river boundary with reference to the numerical modelling the guide specifies that simplified methods which require less runtimes cannot be applied to all cases whereas full dynamic wave equations e g shallow water equations fit almost all hydraulic problems and hence should be used for dam breach analyses the choice of the terrain data and of the roughness coefficient are further analysed in order to assess hazard to downstream populations and properties the flood hazard mapping has to represent the maximum water depth velocity and the inundation duration
