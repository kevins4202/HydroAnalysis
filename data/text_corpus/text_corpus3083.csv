15415,denitrification is one of the major sources of n2o in freshwaters diverse forms of organic compounds act as the electron donors for microbial denitrification however the influences of carbon sources on n2o production n2o reduction isotope fractionation and functional microbes during denitrification were largely unknown in this study five forms of carbon sources i e acetate citrate glucose cellobiose and leucine were used to enrich denitrifiers in freshwater sediments n2o conversion in the enrichments was investigated by a combination of inhibition technique natural stable isotope method and metagenomics acetylene was effective in inhibiting n2o reduction without influencing the isotopic characteristics during n2o production glucose led to the least n2o production and reduction in accordance with the lowest abundance of both no and n2o reductases in this enrichment δ18o and site preference value sp δ15nα δ15nβ of n2o were sensitive to discriminate the five carbon sources except when comparing acetate and leucine isotopic values of n2o were not significantly different in these two enrichments due to the similarity of no reductases pseudomonas type cnorb specifically the enrichment with cellobiose produced n2o with the lowest δ18o values 39 4 1 1 due to alicycliphilus with both cnorb and qnorb the enrichment with glucose led to the highest sp values 8 9 8 6 caused by thiobacillus type cnorb our results demonstrated the link between carbon sources n2o production and reduction isotopic signatures microbial populations and enzymes during denitrification in

fuel combustion nitrogen fertilizer application and waste discharge from animal agriculture the availability of fixed nitrogen in the biosphere has doubled fowler et al 2013 robertson and vitousek 2009 thanks to denitrifying bacteria who undertake the greatest part of nitrogen removal seitzinger 2008 large quantity of bioavailable nitrogen is sequentially converted to nitrite nitric oxide no nitrous oxide n2o and dinitrogen n2 and released to the atmosphere however the intermediate product n2o is a potent and long lived greenhouse gas contributing a great part to climate change and ozone depletion ravishankara et al 2009 denitrification is a major source of n2o production in many freshwater systems beaulieu et al 2015 2011 freymond et al 2013 therefore monitoring and mediating n2o production during denitrification in freshwaters become an important task for greenhouse gas emission control and freshwater management n2o emissions during denitrification approximately accounted for 1 of total nitrate loads davis et al 2019 garrido et al 1998 jiang et al 2020 lu and chandran 2010 pan et al 2012 wisniewski et al 2018 due to the co occurrence of n2o production and consumption the last two steps of denitrification the no reductase norb controlled the activity of n2o production hendriks et al 2000 whereas n2o reduction is governed by the n2o reductase nosz suenaga et al 2018 for heterotrophic denitrification diverse forms of organic compounds can act as the electron donors some previous studies have showed the effects of carbon sources on n2o emissions glucose and acetate induced higher n2o emissions whereas little to no n2o formed when methanol and ethanol were used adouani et al 2010 lee et al 2019 lyu et al 2017 however n2o production and reduction were not separately discussed acetylene was observed to be capable of inhibiting n2o reduction abed et al 2013 klemedtsson et al 1988 which could be a potential method to discriminate n2o production and reduction processes during denitrification with selective carbon sources previous studies tried to elucidate n2o flux and dynamics on the ecosystem level based on the 15n isotope tracer technique baggs et al 2003 mathieu et al 2006 and model simulation chen et al 2008 davidson 2009 stable isotope fractionation is another powerful tool to monitor n2o production hu et al 2015 fractionation of the nitrogen and oxygen isotopes provides qualitative and quantitative evidence to track n2o source hu et al 2015 toyoda et al 2017 especially site preference sp value of n2o δ15nα δ15nβ is characteristic to distinguish n2o production pathways duan et al 2017 toyoda et al 2017 previous pure culture studies showed sp of n2o produced by bacterial ammonia oxidation was around 36 frame and casciotti 2010 whereas sp of n2o produced by archaeal ammonia oxidation had similar values santoro et al 2011 löscher et al 2012 in contrast nitrifier denitrification produces n2o with much lower sp about 11 frame and casciotti 2010 whereas chemodenitrification showed sp values varying from 0 to 27 influenced by substrate forms and environmental conditions buchwarld et al 2016 grabb et al 2017 jones et al 2015 for heterotrophic denitrification sp values range from 5 to 5 haslun et al 2018 rohe et al 2017 sutka et al 2006 toyoda et al 2005 winther et al 2018 yamazaki et al 2014 but large variation exists among different strains such as pseudomonas fluorescens and bradyrhizobium japonicum rohe et al 2017 toyoda et al 2005 on the other hand n2o isotopes are influenced by both production and consumption processes n2o reduction misleads n2o source tracing results by increasing δ15n δ18o and sp values ostrom et al 2007 vieten et al 2007 the simultaneous processes make it hard to capture isotope fractionation characteristics for only n2o production pathways acetylene inhibition could be a solution abed et al 2013 klemedtsson et al 1988 however problems still exist in whether the inhibitor also influences isotopic signatures during n2o production additionally how carbon sources influence n2o isotopes is unknown but it is important to understand n2o isotope records on a global scale on the other side the apparent nitrogen flux is mediated by a variety of microbes great efforts have been made in probing denitrifying bacteria and genes involved in n2o transformation bakken et al 2012 morales et al 2010 philippot et al 2011 different microbes specialize in the oxidation of different substrates which may lead to variation in n2o emissions and isotopes previous research has observed some patterns of how carbon sources shaped microbial community assembly and community compositions flynn et al 2017 goldfarb et al 2011 goldford et al 2018 wawrik et al 2005 but the correlation between carbon sources and the populations enzymes dedicated to n2o conversion has not been demonstrated above all a basic challenge is to fill the gap between these two kinds of data biogeochemistry patterns and molecular findings how n2o isotopes are explained by functional microbes has rarely been considered let alone the influence of carbon sources on n2o concentrations and isotopes by influencing microbial community the lack of the correlation between microbes and isotopes limits our knowledge on n2o dynamics which highlighted the demand for a high resolution study to investigate the genetic controls on field data in this study freshwater lake sediments were collected and used for enrichment culture inoculation previous research has showed how to analyze contributions of different processes including nitrification and denitrification to n2o emissions with environmental samples wankel et al 2017 here we only focused on denitrification regardless of other processes five enrichments were set up with different organic compounds as the carbon and energy sources we aimed to 1 compare n2o production and reduction with different carbon sources 2 reveal n2o isotopic signatures during n2o production with different carbon sources and 3 build a link between substrates gene content microbes n2o production and isotopes to achieve them acetylene was used to investigate the activities of n2o production and reduction separately and isotope characteristics only during n2o production for 3 genome and enzyme centered metagenomic analysis was combined with stable isotope technique to provide a comprehensive characterization of n2o production during denitrification the findings revealed the mechanistic basis of environmental observations and guided interpretation of n2o isotope records by cellular data the approaches could be extrapolated to study other important biochemical processes and other aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1

hidden markov models hmms v3 3 2 eddy 2008 were used to examine the presence of the two no reductases and the two n2o reductases in the metagenomes and the genomes according to a previously described method li et al 2021 briefly hmms of the cytochrome c dependent nitric oxide reductase cnorb and the quinol dependent nitric oxide reductase qnorb were built with reference sequences downloaded from the ncbi database table s3 s4 mainly experimentally verified proteins either through gene cloning enzyme assays protein purification or mutant experiment were included as the reference sequences hmms

genes were normalized by average sequencing depth of all genes present in the metagenomes the identified genes were searched against the non redundant protein sequence nr database in ncbi phylogenetic analysis was conducted for cnorb and qnorb to minimize errors and biases introduced by the fragmentary and non overlapping nature of metagenomes a multi step approach with reference alignments and

discriminate n2o production and reduction processes in the enrichment with acetate as the carbon source without acetylene 18 0 3 9 mm nitrate was reduced within 42 h and 0 07 0 08 mm n2o accumulated fig 1 a s1a with acetylene 19 6 0 3 mm nitrate was consumed and 1 1 0 1 mm n2o accumulated fig 1a s1a in the enrichment with citrate within 53 h 28 5 1 2 mm nitrate was reduced and maximumly 3 8 0 2 mm n2o accumulated without acetylene fig 1b s1b with acetylene addition 25 4 1 2 mm nitrate was reduced and maximumly 5 4 0 1 mm n2o accumulated fig 1b s1b in the glucose amended enrichment 21 1 1 1 mm nitrate was reduced without acetylene and 17 9 0 2 mm nitrate was reduced with acetylene within 53 h figure s1c maximumly 0 1 0 04 mm and 0 1 0 02 mm n2o accumulated after 53 h without and with acetylene respectively fig 1c in the enrichment with cellobiose 24 0 1 3 mm nitrate was reduced without acetylene and 24 4 1 8 mm nitrate was reduced with acetylene within 65 h figure s1d while 0 8 0 7 mm and 3 9 0 2 mm n2o accumulated without and with acetylene respectively fig 1d with leucine as the carbon source in the treatment without acetylene 24 1 0 3 mm nitrate was reduced and 2 8 0 4 mm n2o accumulated within 51 h fig 1e s1e in the treatment with acetylene 20 2 0 4 mm nitrate was reduced with 4 4 0 1 mm n2o accumulated fig 1e s1e after 42 h of incubation the difference of accumulated n2o amount between the two treatments with and without acetylene was significant in the enrichments with acetate citrate cellobiose and leucine p 0 01 indicating significant amount of n2o was reduced however there was no significant difference in the enrichment with glucose p 0 74 indicating no n2o reduction happened based on n2o concentrations with and without acetylene n2o concentration change for n2o production and n2o reduction was calculated figure s2 n2o production amount in the five enrichments was obtained directly by the change in n2o concentrations in the treatment with acetylene figure s2a n2o production amount was the highest in the enrichment with citrate throughout the incubations n2o reduction amount was resolved by subtracting n2o concentrations in the treatment without acetylene from those with acetylene figure s2b mostly the enrichment with citrate showed the highest n2o reduction amount in the previous 42 h while the enrichment with acetate showed slightly higher n2o reduction than the others around the 30th hour after the 50th hour the highest n2o reduction amount was observed in the enrichment with cellobiose to investigate microbial activities for n2o production and reduction a mathematical calculation was developed to remove the influence of substrate concentrations method s1 the results confirmed that n2o production was most active in the enrichment with citrate throughout the incubations figure s3a for n2o reduction microbes showed the highest activity at the first sampling point for this timepoint the enrichment with acetate had the highest activity whereas the second highest showed in the enrichment with citrate figure s3b both n2o production and reduction showed the lowest activities in the enrichment with glucose compared to previous observations of how carbon substrates influence n2o emissions during heterotrophic denitrification adouani et al 2010 lee et al 2019 lyu et al 2017 our study provided the first separate profile of n2o production and reduction processes with the use of acetylene 3 2 n2o isotopic signatures with and without acetylene addition the treatment with acetylene showed significantly lower δ15n n2o δ18o n2o δ15nα n2o and sp values compared to the treatment without acetylene fig 2 a b c e however there was no significant difference in δ15nβ n2o between the two treatments fig 2d during n2o reduction the bond cleavage happens at nα o rather than nα nβ therefore n2o reduction does not influence the isotopic compositions of nβ but it increases the values of δ15nα and δ18o ostrom et al 2007 well and flessa 2009 wu et al 2019 the results indicated acetylene inhibited n2o reduction without disturbing n2o production this pattern generally applied to the enrichments with acetate citrate cellobiose and leucine figure s4 s5 s6 s7 the enrichment with glucose showed no difference in any isotopic values of n2o between the treatments with and without acetylene figure s6 this corresponded to the results of n2o concentrations fig 1c and indicated that there was no n2o reduction happening within 42 h in the enrichment with glucose n2o reduction significantly influenced isotopic signatures of n2o research aimed at revealing n2o isotopic characteristic values for specific process is better to remove the influence of n2o reduction haslun et al 2018 rohe et al 2014 sutka et al 2008 2006 toyoda et al 2005 3 3 n2o isotopic signatures with different carbon sources n2o isotopes were compared among the five enrichments with only samples collected in the treatment with acetylene fig 3 table s5 s6 if the treatment without acetylene were included isotope values varied in larger ranges and it was hard to differentiate n2o production driven by the five carbon sources figure s9 table s7 after removing the effect of n2o reduction δ15n n2o and δ15nβ n2o values showed less variations fig 3a 3d the enrichment with glucose showed larger variations in δ15n n2o δ15nα n2o and δ15nβ n2o than the other enrichments the enrichments with citrate and glucose led to significantly higher δ15nα n2o than the enrichments with cellobiose and leucine fig 3c table s5 s6 as for the oxygen isotopes the enrichment with cellobiose produced n2o with the lowest δ18o values 39 4 1 1 than the other enrichments fig 3b table s5 s6 the enrichments with citrate and glucose showed higher δ18o 49 3 3 6 and 47 9 5 2 respectively while the enrichments with acetate and leucine showed lower δ18o 43 5 3 4 and 44 4 1 8 respectively fig 3b table s5 the enrichment with glucose generated the highest sp values 8 9 8 6 whereas the enrichment with acetate led to the lowest 5 8 2 4 fig 3 table s5 the sp values generally fell into the range of previously reported values obtained from heterotrophic denitrifying pure cultures haslun et al 2018 rohe et al 2017 sutka et al 2006 toyoda et al 2005 winther et al 2018 yamazaki et al 2014 for most enrichments except the citrate amended enrichment δ15n n2o δ15nα n2o and δ15nβ n2o varied in larger ranges than δ18o n2o and sp table s5 based on t test results isotopic differences between every two of the five enrichments could be seen from the combination of δ18o n2o and sp values except when the enrichments with acetate and leucine were compared table s6 even with other isotope values δ15n n2o δ15nα n2o and δ15nβ n2o no significant difference was shown between the enrichments with acetate and leucine in this case δ18o n2o was even more sensitive to detect carbon sources than the commonly used indicator sp only when comparing citrate and glucose did no difference show in δ18o n2o table s6 for sp there were more pairs of enrichments acetate and cellobiose citrate and leucine cellobiose and leucine exhibited no significant difference in addition we did not observe any relationship between the chemical class of organic compounds and n2o isotopic signatures the two kinds of organic acids acetate and citrate or the two sugars glucose and cellobiose did not produce n2o with closer isotopic values fig 3 table s5 in contrast one of the organic acids acetate shared more similarity in isotopic values with the amino acid leucine this was unexpected but might be explained by the similarity of the enzymes in the two enrichments see below in general carbon sources not only influence n2o emissions but also change the isotopic signatures of n2o this challenges the interpretation of n2o isotope records and should be considered in future environmental studies 3 4 microbes and enzymes involved in n2o transformation metagenomes were collected from the five enrichments metagenome of the initial sample collected from the freshwater lake was reported previously li et al 2022 for the enrichments 15 mags were obtained in total table s8 and they accounted for more than 92 of the whole community this enabled us to explore 1 how enzymes were associated with genomes and 2 how they influenced n2o emissions and isotopes all mags encoded at least one nitrate reductase fig 4 a the assembled genomes of atlantibacter citrobacter and enterobacter did not contain nitrite no and n2o reductases pseudomonas 3 did not encode any nitrite reductase whereas stenotrophomonas did not contain n2o reductase other genomes contained the full set of genes encoding the complete denitrification process pseudomonas 1 relative abundance 83 was the most abundant organism in the enrichment with acetate while diaphorobacter 1 39 enterobacter 36 and rhodocyclaceae 12 were abundant in the enrichment with citrate glucose addition enriched enterobacter 70 and atlantibacter 24 both of which lacked nitrite and no reductases surprisingly thiobacillus which was commonly assumed as an autotrophic bacterium stefess et al 1996 was the third most abundant population 5 in the enrichment with glucose it might partner with enterobacter and atlantibacter consuming nitrite and no released by them to avoid toxic metabolite accumulation with cellobiose enterobacter 32 and atlantibacter 22 were also enriched together with another population citrobacter 18 leucine addition enriched burkholderiaceae 1 24 pseudomonas 2 23 and pseudomonas 3 23 the two main types of nitric oxide reductases cnorb and qnorb were identified and quatified with hmms fig 4b cnorb receives electrons from cytochrome c whereas qnorb receives electrons from quinols hendriks et al 2000 all mags able to reduce no contained cnorb whereas burkholderiaceae 2 stenotrophomonas and the two populations of diaphorobacter also encoded qnorb table s8 for all enrichments cnorb was more abundant than qnorb which was expected because cnorb was mainly encoded by classical denitrifiers and qnorb was mainly encoded by pathogenic bacteria for no detoxification braker and tiedje 2003 hendriks et al 2000 the enrichment with glucose showed the least abundance of both cnorb and qnorb this was consistent with n2o concentrations fig 1c s2a the enrichment with glucose showed the lowest activity of n2o production this was also consistent with genome analysis the most abundant two populations in the enrichment with glucose did not encode any norb while only the third most abundant population thiobacillus contained cnorb fig 4a the enrichments with acetate and leucine showed more similarity in regard with norb abundance of cnorb was more than 100 times of average abundance while abundance of qnorb was less than 5 times of average abundance in both enrichments fig 4b this likely explained why the five isotopic values of n2o showed no significant difference between the two enrichments fig 3 there were also two types of n2o reductases nosz one uses twin arginine tat translocation pathway whereas the other uses the secretory sec translocation pathway jones et al 2013 apart from the enrichment with citrate the other enrichments showed higher abundance of noszi than noszii still the enrichment with glucose had the least abundance of both noszi and noszii among all enrichments which was the reason for its lowest n2o reduction activity fig 1c s2b phylogenetic trees of the two no reductases were built with reference sequences downloaded from the database and the identified genes from the five metagenomes fig 5 table s9 for both the enrichments with acetate and leucine the most abundant reductase was cnorb carried by pseudomonas fig 5a table s9 in the enrichment with citrate diaphorobacter was the most abundant organism carrying both cnorb and qnorb the result was in line with the genome centered analysis diaphorobacter was the most abundant population and it encoded both cnorb and qnorb table s8 in the enrichment with cellobiose the most abundant cnorb and qnorb were both carried by alicycliphilus denitrificans which might be the reason for the lowest δ18o values 39 4 1 1 fig 3b the most abundant norb in the enrichment with glucose was carried by thiobacillus consistent with genome analysis the thiobacillus type norb could explain the highest sp values 8 9 8 6 in the enrichment with glucose fig 3e the abundance of all norb reductases was below 0 4 times of average abundance of all proteins in this enrichment in accordance with the lowest n2o production fig 1c s2a based on the abundance of all nitric oxide reductases in phylogenetic trees non metric multidimensional scaling nmds showed that the enrichments with acetate and leucine shared more similarity figure s10 this explained why these two enrichments could not be differentiated based on isotopic values table s3 because of the similarity of the functional enzymes 3 5 implications for freshwaters heterotrophic denitrification is an important juncture for the nitrogen and carbon cycles in freshwater ecosystems it is also a great source for n2o emissions carbon sources played an important role in mediating n2o emissions during heterotrophic denitrification according to previous results compared to long carbon chain compounds casein and meat extracts and alcohols methanol and ethanol glucose and acetate induced higher n2o emissions during denitrification in enrichments bioreactors or constructed wetlands adouani et al 2010 lee et al 2019 lyu et al 2017 here we included two organic acids two sugars and an amino acid when comparing the five carbon sources for pollution remediation purpose glucose led to the least n2o emissions with comparable amount of reduced nitrate this should be considered in nitrate remediation research as the availability of organic carbon is often the rate limiting factor for heterotrophic denitrification in situ and adding external carbon sources is one of the solutions jahangir et al 2012 newcomer et al 2012 natural stable isotope budgets could be used to predict n2o pattern on landscape scale sp is considered as the most robust index to distinguish n2o production pathways duan et al 2017 hu et al 2015 toyoda et al 2017 when the five carbon sources were taken into consideration sp was less sensitive than δ18o n2o table s6 under such circumstance sp could identify which is the main n2o production pathway whereas δ18o n2o could be used as an auxiliary indicator to differentiate carbon sources for denitrification process some previous studies have showed the potential function of δ18o n2o for example δ18o n2o ordinarily varied in narrower ranges than δ15n n2o hu et al 2015 there was less variance in δ18o n2o than δ15n n2o among several strains performing nitrifier nh2oh oxidation sutka et al 2006 yamazaki et al 2014 and fungal denitrification sutka et al 2008 δ18o was sensitive enough to track n2o produced either by fungi or bacteria rohe et al 2017 together with our results δ18o n2o was proved to be a powerful tool which could be combined with sp to achieve more accurate results for future source tracing research microbe enzyme is the key factor directly shaping isotope data in parallel a variety of environmental parameters exert influences on microbial community compositions and enzymes studies have shown how environmental parameters drive landscape patterns of n2o groffman et al 2000 kortelainen et al 2020 li et al 1996 but the mechanistic basis remained elusive from this point we saw an ambiguous link between environmental factors enzymes and isotopic signatures thus we came up with the approach combining stable isotope on natural abundance and genetic tools which might be able to interpret biogeochemistry records using environmental parameters with molecular evidence our study provided such an example the lowest δ18o originated from alicycliphilus type cnorb and qnorb which was enriched by cellobiose the highest sp was resulted from thiobacillus type cnorb which was selected by glucose though this was unexpected as thiobacillus was not observed in any of previous glucose amended incubations the role of thiobacillus in removing toxic effects of the intermediates made the results reasonable the link between carbon sources n2o isotopes enzymes and microbial populations was successfully established for n2o production during heterotrophic denitrification in freshwaters for several pure cultures fed with glucose they showed lower δ18o n2o 29 39 and sp 7 3 values than what we observed in the enrichment with glucose rohe et al 2017 the enrichment with citrate showed consistent sp values with previously reported denitrifying strains growing with citrate sutka et al 2006 toyoda et al 2005 this indicated that the direct influential factor on n2o isotopes is enzyme microbe while carbon source influences microbe however our work was based on denitrifying enrichment systems limited by high concentrations of organic carbon and change of microbial community structure future study could do research with more environmentally relevant conditions and investigate if the regularities could be extrapolated metagenomics only represent functional potential and could not show microbial activities future work could do better representation on microbial activity with transcriptomics and proteomics as stable isotope technique and metagenomics are increasingly used to probe n2o flux butterbach bahl et al 2013 as well as other biochemical processes breitbart et al 2009 li et al 2022 this is an important step forward to extend beyond what we know from pure culture studies the link between enzymes and isotopes may also be an interesting point to consider in the design of future studies similar approaches could be extended to evaluate other microbially mediated processes in aquatic environments such as dissimilatory sulfate reduction colangelo lillis et al 2019 and methane oxidation feisthauer et al 2011 rasigraf et al 2012 future modeling work should also include the refined parameters for better simulation results chen et al 2008 louca et al 2016 our study provided a blueprint for aquatic environmental research which aimed to characterize how selective environmental parameters shaped complex landscape patterns 4 conclusions in this study five forms of organic compounds were used as the electron donors for denitrifying enrichments inoculated with freshwater sediments the main findings include 1 the inhibitor acetylene did not influence isotopic signatures of n2o production and helped to elucidate n2o production and reduction processes 2 among the five isotopic values δ18o and sp were most sensitive to discriminate carbon sources 3 most importantly a link between carbon sources n2o emissions isotopes enzymes and microbial populations was established glucose led to the lowest activity of both n2o production and reduction due to its lowest abundance of norb and nosz glucose also resulted in the highest sp values which was resulted from an unexpected type of reductase cnorb carried by thiobacillus cellobiose produced n2o with the lowest δ18o due to cnorb and qnorb carried by alicycliphilus the combination of inhibition technique stable isotope approach and metagenomics advanced our understanding of n2o production during microbial denitrification in freshwaters future study could use similar approaches to study other biochemical processes for important pollutants in

15415,denitrification is one of the major sources of n2o in freshwaters diverse forms of organic compounds act as the electron donors for microbial denitrification however the influences of carbon sources on n2o production n2o reduction isotope fractionation and functional microbes during denitrification were largely unknown in this study five forms of carbon sources i e acetate citrate glucose cellobiose and leucine were used to enrich denitrifiers in freshwater sediments n2o conversion in the enrichments was investigated by a combination of inhibition technique natural stable isotope method and metagenomics acetylene was effective in inhibiting n2o reduction without influencing the isotopic characteristics during n2o production glucose led to the least n2o production and reduction in accordance with the lowest abundance of both no and n2o reductases in this enrichment δ18o and site preference value sp δ15nα δ15nβ of n2o were sensitive to discriminate the five carbon sources except when comparing acetate and leucine isotopic values of n2o were not significantly different in these two enrichments due to the similarity of no reductases pseudomonas type cnorb specifically the enrichment with cellobiose produced n2o with the lowest δ18o values 39 4 1 1 due to alicycliphilus with both cnorb and qnorb the enrichment with glucose led to the highest sp values 8 9 8 6 caused by thiobacillus type cnorb our results demonstrated the link between carbon sources n2o production and reduction isotopic signatures microbial populations and enzymes during denitrification in

2009 thanks to denitrifying bacteria who undertake the greatest part of nitrogen removal seitzinger 2008 large quantity of bioavailable nitrogen is sequentially converted to nitrite nitric oxide no nitrous oxide n2o and dinitrogen n2 and released to the atmosphere however the intermediate product n2o is a potent and long lived greenhouse gas contributing a great part to climate change and ozone depletion ravishankara et al 2009 denitrification is a major source of n2o production in many freshwater systems beaulieu et al 2015 2011 freymond et al 2013 therefore monitoring and mediating n2o production during denitrification in freshwaters become an important task for greenhouse gas emission control and freshwater management n2o emissions during denitrification approximately accounted for 1 of total nitrate loads davis et al 2019 garrido et al 1998 jiang et al 2020 lu and chandran 2010 pan et al 2012 wisniewski et al 2018 due to the co occurrence of n2o production and consumption the last two steps of denitrification the no reductase norb controlled the activity of n2o production hendriks et al 2000 whereas n2o reduction is governed by the n2o reductase nosz suenaga et al 2018 for heterotrophic denitrification diverse forms of organic compounds can act as the electron donors some previous studies have showed the effects of carbon sources on n2o emissions glucose and acetate induced higher n2o emissions whereas little to no n2o formed when methanol and ethanol were used adouani et al 2010 lee et al 2019 lyu et al 2017 however n2o production and reduction were not separately discussed acetylene was observed to be capable of inhibiting n2o reduction abed et al 2013 klemedtsson et al 1988 which could be a potential method to discriminate n2o production and reduction processes during denitrification with selective carbon sources previous studies tried to elucidate n2o flux and dynamics on the ecosystem level based on the 15n isotope tracer technique baggs et al 2003 mathieu et al 2006 and model simulation chen et al 2008 davidson 2009 stable isotope fractionation is another powerful tool to monitor n2o production hu et al 2015 fractionation of the nitrogen and oxygen isotopes provides qualitative and quantitative evidence to track n2o source hu et al 2015 toyoda et al 2017 especially site preference sp value of n2o δ15nα δ15nβ is characteristic to distinguish n2o production pathways duan et al 2017 toyoda et al 2017 previous pure culture studies showed sp of n2o produced by bacterial ammonia oxidation was around 36 frame and casciotti 2010 whereas sp of n2o produced by archaeal ammonia oxidation had similar values santoro et al 2011 löscher et al 2012 in contrast nitrifier denitrification produces n2o with much lower sp about 11 frame and casciotti 2010 whereas chemodenitrification showed sp values varying from 0 to 27 influenced by substrate forms and environmental conditions buchwarld et al 2016 grabb et al 2017 jones et al 2015 for heterotrophic denitrification sp values range from 5 to 5 haslun et al 2018 rohe et al 2017 sutka et al 2006 toyoda et al 2005 winther et al 2018 yamazaki et al 2014 but large variation exists among different strains such as pseudomonas fluorescens and bradyrhizobium japonicum rohe et al 2017 toyoda et al 2005 on the other hand n2o isotopes are influenced by both production and consumption processes n2o reduction misleads n2o source tracing results by increasing δ15n δ18o and sp values ostrom et al 2007 vieten et al 2007 the simultaneous processes make it hard to capture isotope fractionation characteristics for only n2o production pathways acetylene inhibition could be a solution abed et al 2013 klemedtsson et al 1988 however problems still exist in whether the inhibitor also influences isotopic signatures during n2o production additionally how carbon sources influence n2o isotopes is unknown but it is important to understand n2o isotope records on a global scale on the other side the apparent nitrogen flux is mediated by a variety of microbes great efforts have been made in probing denitrifying bacteria and genes involved in n2o transformation bakken et al 2012 morales et al 2010 philippot et al 2011 different microbes specialize in the oxidation of different substrates which may lead to variation in n2o emissions and isotopes previous research has observed some patterns of how carbon sources shaped microbial community assembly and community compositions flynn et al 2017 goldfarb et al 2011 goldford et al 2018 wawrik et al 2005 but the correlation between carbon sources and the populations enzymes dedicated to n2o conversion has not been demonstrated above all a basic challenge is to fill the gap between these two kinds of data biogeochemistry patterns and molecular findings how n2o isotopes are explained by functional microbes has rarely been considered let alone the influence of carbon sources on n2o concentrations and isotopes by influencing microbial community the lack of the correlation between microbes and isotopes limits our knowledge on n2o dynamics which highlighted the demand for a high resolution study to investigate the genetic controls on field data in this study freshwater lake sediments were collected and used for enrichment culture inoculation previous research has showed how to analyze contributions of different processes including nitrification and denitrification to n2o emissions with environmental samples wankel et al 2017 here we only focused on denitrification regardless of other processes five enrichments were set up with different organic compounds as the carbon and energy sources we aimed to 1 compare n2o production and reduction with different carbon sources 2 reveal n2o isotopic signatures during n2o production with different carbon sources and 3 build a link between substrates gene content microbes n2o production and isotopes to achieve them acetylene was used to investigate the activities of n2o production and reduction separately and isotope characteristics only during n2o production for 3 genome and enzyme centered metagenomic analysis was combined with stable isotope technique to provide a comprehensive characterization of n2o production during denitrification the findings revealed the mechanistic basis of environmental observations and guided interpretation of n2o isotope records by cellular data the approaches could be extrapolated to study other important biochemical processes and other aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1

hidden markov models hmms v3 3 2 eddy 2008 were used to examine the presence of the two no reductases and the two n2o reductases in the metagenomes and the genomes according to a previously described method li et al 2021 briefly hmms of the cytochrome c dependent nitric oxide reductase cnorb and the quinol dependent nitric oxide reductase qnorb were built with reference sequences downloaded from

genes were normalized by average sequencing depth of all genes present in the metagenomes the identified genes were searched against the non redundant protein sequence nr database in ncbi phylogenetic analysis was conducted for cnorb and qnorb to minimize errors and biases introduced by the fragmentary and non overlapping nature of metagenomes a multi step approach with reference alignments and

discriminate n2o production and reduction processes in the enrichment with acetate as the carbon source without acetylene 18 0 3 9 mm nitrate was reduced within 42 h and 0 07 0 08 mm n2o accumulated fig 1 a s1a with acetylene 19 6 0 3 mm nitrate was consumed and 1 1 0 1 mm n2o accumulated fig 1a s1a in the enrichment with citrate within 53 h 28 5 1 2 mm nitrate was reduced and maximumly 3 8 0 2 mm n2o accumulated without acetylene fig 1b s1b with acetylene addition 25 4 1 2 mm nitrate was reduced and maximumly 5 4 0 1 mm n2o accumulated fig 1b s1b in the glucose amended enrichment 21 1 1 1 mm nitrate was reduced without acetylene and 17 9 0 2 mm nitrate was reduced with acetylene within 53 h figure s1c maximumly 0 1 0 04 mm and 0 1 0 02 mm n2o accumulated after 53 h without and with acetylene respectively fig 1c in the enrichment with cellobiose 24 0 1 3 mm nitrate was reduced without acetylene and 24 4 1 8 mm nitrate was reduced with acetylene within 65 h figure s1d while 0 8 0 7 mm and 3 9 0 2 mm n2o accumulated without and with acetylene respectively fig 1d with leucine as the carbon source in the treatment without acetylene 24 1 0 3 mm nitrate was reduced and 2 8 0 4 mm n2o accumulated within 51 h fig 1e s1e in the treatment with acetylene 20 2 0 4 mm nitrate was reduced with 4 4 0 1 mm n2o accumulated fig 1e s1e after 42 h of incubation the difference of accumulated n2o amount between the two treatments with and without acetylene was significant in the enrichments with acetate citrate cellobiose and leucine p 0 01 indicating significant amount of n2o was reduced however there was no significant difference in the enrichment with glucose p 0 74 indicating no n2o reduction happened based on n2o concentrations with and without acetylene n2o concentration change for n2o production and n2o reduction was calculated figure s2 n2o production amount in the five enrichments was obtained directly by the change in n2o concentrations in the treatment with acetylene figure s2a n2o production amount was the highest in the enrichment with citrate throughout the incubations n2o reduction amount was resolved by subtracting n2o concentrations in the treatment without acetylene from those with acetylene figure s2b mostly the enrichment with citrate showed the highest n2o reduction amount in the previous 42 h while the enrichment with acetate showed slightly higher n2o reduction than the others around the 30th hour after the 50th hour the highest n2o reduction amount was observed in the enrichment with cellobiose to investigate microbial activities for n2o production and reduction a mathematical calculation was developed to remove the influence of substrate concentrations method s1 the results confirmed that n2o production was most active in the enrichment with citrate throughout the incubations figure s3a for n2o reduction microbes showed the highest activity at the first sampling point for this timepoint the enrichment with acetate had the highest activity whereas the second highest showed in the enrichment with citrate figure s3b both n2o production and reduction showed the lowest activities in the enrichment with glucose compared to previous observations of how carbon substrates influence n2o emissions during heterotrophic denitrification adouani et al 2010 lee et al 2019 lyu et al 2017 our study provided the first separate profile of n2o production and reduction processes with the use of acetylene 3 2 n2o isotopic signatures with and without acetylene addition the treatment with acetylene showed significantly lower δ15n n2o δ18o n2o δ15nα n2o and sp values compared to the treatment without acetylene fig 2 a b c e however there was no significant difference in δ15nβ n2o between the two treatments fig 2d during n2o reduction the bond cleavage happens at nα o rather than nα nβ therefore n2o reduction does not influence the isotopic compositions of nβ but it increases the values of δ15nα and δ18o ostrom et al 2007 well and flessa 2009 wu et al 2019 the results indicated acetylene inhibited n2o reduction without disturbing n2o production this pattern generally applied to the enrichments with acetate citrate cellobiose and leucine figure s4 s5 s6 s7 the enrichment with glucose showed no difference in any isotopic values of n2o between the treatments with and without acetylene figure s6 this corresponded to the results of n2o concentrations fig 1c and indicated that there was no n2o reduction happening within 42 h in the enrichment with glucose n2o reduction significantly influenced isotopic signatures of n2o research aimed at revealing n2o isotopic characteristic values for specific process is better to remove the influence of n2o reduction haslun et al 2018 rohe et al 2014 sutka et al 2008 2006 toyoda et al 2005 3 3 n2o isotopic signatures with different carbon sources n2o isotopes were compared among the five enrichments with only samples collected in the treatment with acetylene fig 3 table s5 s6 if the treatment without acetylene were included isotope values varied in larger ranges and it was hard to differentiate n2o production driven by the five carbon sources figure s9 table s7 after removing the effect of n2o reduction δ15n n2o and δ15nβ n2o values showed less variations fig 3a 3d the enrichment with glucose showed larger variations in δ15n n2o δ15nα n2o and δ15nβ n2o than the other enrichments the enrichments with citrate and glucose led to significantly higher δ15nα n2o than the enrichments with cellobiose and leucine fig 3c table s5 s6 as for the oxygen isotopes the enrichment with cellobiose produced n2o with the lowest δ18o values 39 4 1 1 than the other enrichments fig 3b table s5 s6 the enrichments with citrate and glucose showed higher δ18o 49 3 3 6 and 47 9 5 2 respectively while the enrichments with acetate and leucine showed lower δ18o 43 5 3 4 and 44 4 1 8 respectively fig 3b table s5 the enrichment with glucose generated the highest sp values 8 9 8 6 whereas the enrichment with acetate led to the lowest 5 8 2 4 fig 3 table s5 the sp values generally fell into the range of previously reported values obtained from heterotrophic denitrifying pure cultures haslun et al 2018 rohe et al 2017 sutka et al 2006 toyoda et al 2005 winther et al 2018 yamazaki et al 2014 for most enrichments except the citrate amended enrichment δ15n n2o δ15nα n2o and δ15nβ n2o varied in larger ranges than δ18o n2o and sp table s5 based on t test results isotopic differences between every two of the five enrichments could be seen from the combination of δ18o n2o and sp values except when the enrichments with acetate and leucine were compared table s6 even with other isotope values δ15n n2o δ15nα n2o and δ15nβ n2o no significant difference was shown between the enrichments with acetate and leucine in this case δ18o n2o was even more sensitive to detect carbon sources than the commonly used indicator sp only when comparing citrate and glucose did no difference show in δ18o n2o table s6 for sp there were more pairs of enrichments acetate and cellobiose citrate and leucine cellobiose and leucine exhibited no significant difference in addition we did not observe any relationship between the chemical class of organic compounds and n2o isotopic signatures the two kinds of organic acids acetate and citrate or the two sugars glucose and cellobiose did not produce n2o with closer isotopic values fig 3 table s5 in contrast one of the organic acids acetate shared more similarity in isotopic values with the amino acid leucine this was unexpected but might be explained by the similarity of the enzymes in the two enrichments see below in general carbon sources not only influence n2o emissions but also change the isotopic signatures of n2o this challenges the interpretation of n2o isotope records and should be considered in future environmental studies 3 4 microbes and enzymes involved in n2o transformation metagenomes were collected from the five enrichments metagenome of the initial sample collected from the freshwater lake was reported previously li et al 2022 for the enrichments 15 mags were obtained in total table s8 and they accounted for more than 92 of the whole community this enabled us to explore 1 how enzymes were associated with genomes and 2 how they influenced n2o emissions and isotopes all mags encoded at least one nitrate reductase fig 4 a the assembled genomes of atlantibacter citrobacter and enterobacter did not contain nitrite no and n2o reductases pseudomonas 3 did not encode any nitrite reductase whereas stenotrophomonas did not contain n2o reductase other genomes contained the full set of genes encoding the complete denitrification process pseudomonas 1 relative abundance 83 was the most abundant organism in the enrichment with acetate while diaphorobacter 1 39 enterobacter 36 and rhodocyclaceae 12 were abundant in the enrichment with citrate glucose addition enriched enterobacter 70 and atlantibacter 24 both of which lacked nitrite and no reductases surprisingly thiobacillus which was commonly assumed as an autotrophic bacterium stefess et al 1996 was the third most abundant population 5 in the enrichment with glucose it might partner with enterobacter and atlantibacter consuming nitrite and no released by them to avoid toxic metabolite accumulation with cellobiose enterobacter 32 and atlantibacter 22 were also enriched together with another population citrobacter 18 leucine addition enriched burkholderiaceae 1 24 pseudomonas 2 23 and pseudomonas 3 23 the two main types of nitric oxide reductases cnorb and qnorb were identified and quatified with hmms fig 4b cnorb receives electrons from cytochrome c whereas qnorb receives electrons from quinols hendriks et al 2000 all mags able to reduce no contained cnorb whereas burkholderiaceae 2 stenotrophomonas and the two populations of diaphorobacter also encoded qnorb table s8 for all enrichments cnorb was more abundant than qnorb which was expected because cnorb was mainly encoded by classical denitrifiers and qnorb was mainly encoded by pathogenic bacteria for no detoxification braker and tiedje 2003 hendriks et al 2000 the enrichment with glucose showed the least abundance of both cnorb and qnorb this was consistent with n2o concentrations fig 1c s2a the enrichment with glucose showed the lowest activity of n2o production this was also consistent with genome analysis the most abundant two populations in the enrichment with glucose did not encode any norb while only the third most abundant population thiobacillus contained cnorb fig 4a the enrichments with acetate and leucine showed more similarity in regard with norb abundance of cnorb was more than 100 times of average abundance while abundance of qnorb was less than 5 times of average abundance in both enrichments fig 4b this likely explained why the five isotopic values of n2o showed no significant difference between the two enrichments fig 3 there were also two types of n2o reductases nosz one uses twin arginine tat translocation pathway whereas the other uses the secretory sec translocation pathway jones et al 2013 apart from the enrichment with citrate the other enrichments showed higher abundance of noszi than noszii still the enrichment with glucose had the least abundance of both noszi and noszii among all enrichments which was the reason for its lowest n2o reduction activity fig 1c s2b phylogenetic trees of the two no reductases were built with reference sequences downloaded from the database and the identified genes from the five metagenomes fig 5 table s9 for both the enrichments with acetate and leucine the most abundant reductase was cnorb carried by pseudomonas fig 5a table s9 in the enrichment with citrate diaphorobacter was the most abundant organism carrying both cnorb and qnorb the result was in line with the genome centered analysis diaphorobacter was the most abundant population and it encoded both cnorb and qnorb table s8 in the enrichment with cellobiose the most abundant cnorb and qnorb were both carried by alicycliphilus denitrificans which might be the reason for the lowest δ18o values 39 4 1 1 fig 3b the most abundant norb in the enrichment with glucose was carried by thiobacillus consistent with genome analysis the thiobacillus type norb could explain the highest sp values 8 9 8 6 in the enrichment with glucose fig 3e the abundance of all norb reductases was below 0 4 times of average abundance of all proteins in this enrichment in accordance with the lowest n2o production fig 1c s2a based on the abundance of all nitric oxide reductases in phylogenetic trees non metric multidimensional scaling nmds showed that the enrichments with acetate and leucine shared more similarity figure s10 this explained why these two enrichments could not be differentiated based on isotopic values table s3 because of the similarity of the functional enzymes 3 5 implications for freshwaters heterotrophic denitrification is an important juncture for the nitrogen and carbon cycles in freshwater ecosystems it is also a great source for n2o emissions carbon sources played an important role in mediating n2o emissions during heterotrophic denitrification according to previous results compared to long carbon chain compounds casein and meat extracts and alcohols methanol and ethanol glucose and acetate induced higher n2o emissions during denitrification in enrichments bioreactors or constructed wetlands adouani et al 2010 lee et al 2019 lyu et al 2017 here we included two organic acids two sugars and an amino acid when comparing the five carbon sources for pollution remediation purpose glucose led to the least n2o emissions with comparable amount of reduced nitrate this should be considered in nitrate remediation research as the availability of organic carbon is often the rate limiting factor for heterotrophic denitrification in situ and adding external carbon sources is one of the solutions jahangir et al 2012 newcomer et al 2012 natural stable isotope budgets could be used to predict n2o pattern on landscape scale sp is considered as the most robust index to distinguish n2o production pathways duan et al 2017 hu et al 2015 toyoda et al 2017 when the five carbon sources were taken into consideration sp was less sensitive than δ18o n2o table s6 under such circumstance sp could identify which is the main n2o production pathway whereas δ18o n2o could be used as an auxiliary indicator to differentiate carbon sources for denitrification process some previous studies have showed the potential function of δ18o n2o for example δ18o n2o ordinarily varied in narrower ranges than δ15n n2o hu et al 2015 there was less variance in δ18o n2o than δ15n n2o among several strains performing nitrifier nh2oh oxidation sutka et al 2006 yamazaki et al 2014 and fungal denitrification sutka et al 2008 δ18o was sensitive enough to track n2o produced either by fungi or bacteria rohe et al 2017 together with our results δ18o n2o was proved to be a powerful tool which could be combined with sp to achieve more accurate results for future source tracing research microbe enzyme is the key factor directly shaping isotope data in parallel a variety of environmental parameters exert influences on microbial community compositions and enzymes studies have shown how environmental parameters drive landscape patterns of n2o groffman et al 2000 kortelainen et al 2020 li et al 1996 but the mechanistic basis remained elusive from this point we saw an ambiguous link between environmental factors enzymes and isotopic signatures thus we came up with the approach combining stable isotope on natural abundance and genetic tools which might be able to interpret biogeochemistry records using environmental parameters with molecular evidence our study provided such an example the lowest δ18o originated from alicycliphilus type cnorb and qnorb which was enriched by cellobiose the highest sp was resulted from thiobacillus type cnorb which was selected by glucose though this was unexpected as thiobacillus was not observed in any of previous glucose amended incubations the role of thiobacillus in removing toxic effects of the intermediates made the results reasonable the link between carbon sources n2o isotopes enzymes and microbial populations was successfully established for n2o production during heterotrophic denitrification in freshwaters for several pure cultures fed with glucose they showed lower δ18o n2o 29 39 and sp 7 3 values than what we observed in the enrichment with glucose rohe et al 2017 the enrichment with citrate showed consistent sp values with previously reported denitrifying strains growing with citrate sutka et al 2006 toyoda et al 2005 this indicated that the direct influential factor on n2o isotopes is enzyme microbe while carbon source influences microbe however our work was based on denitrifying enrichment systems limited by high concentrations of organic carbon and change of microbial community structure future study could do research with more environmentally relevant conditions and investigate if the regularities could be extrapolated metagenomics only represent functional potential and could not show microbial activities future work could do better representation on microbial activity with transcriptomics and proteomics as stable isotope technique and metagenomics are increasingly used to probe n2o flux butterbach bahl et al 2013 as well as other biochemical processes breitbart et al 2009 li et al 2022 this is an important step forward to extend beyond what we know from pure culture studies the link between enzymes and isotopes may also be an interesting point to consider in the design of future studies similar approaches could be extended to evaluate other microbially mediated processes in aquatic environments such as dissimilatory sulfate reduction colangelo lillis et al 2019 and methane oxidation feisthauer et al 2011 rasigraf et al 2012 future modeling work should also include the refined parameters for better simulation results chen et al 2008 louca et al 2016 our study provided a blueprint for aquatic environmental research which aimed to characterize how selective environmental parameters shaped complex landscape patterns 4 conclusions in this study five forms of organic compounds were used as the electron donors for denitrifying enrichments inoculated with freshwater sediments the main findings include 1 the inhibitor acetylene did not influence isotopic signatures of n2o production and helped to elucidate n2o production and reduction processes 2 among the five isotopic values δ18o and sp were most sensitive to discriminate carbon sources 3 most importantly a link between carbon sources n2o emissions isotopes enzymes and microbial populations was established glucose led to the lowest activity of both n2o production and reduction due to its lowest abundance of norb and nosz glucose also resulted in the highest sp values which was resulted from an unexpected type of reductase cnorb carried by thiobacillus cellobiose produced n2o with the lowest δ18o due to cnorb and qnorb carried by alicycliphilus the combination of inhibition technique stable isotope approach and metagenomics advanced our understanding of n2o production during microbial denitrification in freshwaters future study could use similar approaches to study other biochemical processes for important pollutants in

15416,treatment of wastewater with high levels of fat oil and grease fog produced by the growing number annually 2 of food service establishments fses is a major concern for water utilities about 30 40 of sewer blockages are caused primarily by the formation of fog deposits in sewer pipes and an annual additional maintenance cost is required for sewer management to manage fog deposition fses are required to recover the fog at the point of generation by installing grease interceptors gis before release to the sewer system the successful control of fog deposition is largely dependent on clear understanding of its complex properties pre treatment processes deposition mechanism and public awareness the objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the physicochemical properties of fog including particle size distribution and their removal efficiencies by existing gis nowadays generation of fog particles of 45 µm is increasing because of the increasing use of automatic dishwashers current hybrid processes which comprise pre treatment prior to gi use are ineffective since they are unable to completely remove particle sizes of 45 µm hence there is potential for these particles to be released into the sewer system and eventually cause blockages this critical review discusses the characteristics of effluents including the particle size distributions generated from automatic dishwashers and handwash sinks it concludes by providing some case studies and a perspective of the future opportunities to develop a novel gi process integrated with pre treatment to remove particles of all sizes including colloidal particles graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fat oil and grease food service establishment grease interceptor particle size pre treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction fog is a by product of food processing facilities catering establishments and household kitchens which contains lipids made up of fatty acids triacylglycerols and fat soluble hydrocarbons husain et al 2014 lipids originate from scraps of baked and fried food items gravy dressings margarine butter and cheeses but largely from cooking oil and animal fats lesikar et al 2004 fog lipids are transformed via hydrolysis and saponification usually with calcium to form solids which start to adhere to the top inner surface of sewer pipes keener et al 2008 the growing deposition and solidification of fog may incorporate other suspended solid particles which are flushed down the sewer over time this creates clogging inside the sewer and results in sanitary sewer overflows ssos in australia there was 21 of sewer blockage were caused by fog during 1996 to 2004 marlow et al 2011 later wsaa 2009 reported that the average blockage rate was 44 per 100 km of sewer during 2006 to 2007 however the contribution of fog to these blockage formations was not revealed in the usa despite the potential use and maintenance of gis the fog contribution varies from 350 to 7700 kg year restaurant to approximately 30 million gallons 114 million liters of greasy wastewater disposed into sewers and accounts for 40 50 of sewer blockages keener et al 2008 the proportion of some internationally reported sewer blockages attributable to fog are 50 in ireland gibbons and curran 2015 55 in scotland scottish water 2012 60 in the uk williams et al 2012 60 in hong kong chan et al 2010 and 70 in malaysia hussain et al 2014 some examples of the annual cost of clearing these blockages are 1 2 million in brisbane and four other local councils australia stein and miller 2019 100 million in the uk oakes 2019 and 25 billion in the usa del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 the deposition and detrimental effect of fog mostly depends on its physicochemical properties keener et al 2008 he et al 2017 proposed a three step solution to manage the detrimental effects of fog identification of the sources of the chemical components that are involved in the formation of fog sediments their mechanisms of formation and development of sustainable solutions to alleviate the problem or upgrade existing processes the deposition of fog is influenced by several factors including type of calcium sources and free fatty acids ffas ph and temperature iasmin et al 2014 in particular ph and temperature affect the solubility of the calcium source and so affect the rate of production of saponified solid the color texture and strength of produced solid may vary with the type of calcium source iasmin et al 2014 of the ffas involved palmitic acid is the most prevalent saturated fat consequently the concentration present significantly influences the pace of saponification and solid formation iasmin et al 2016 gis have been used at source for years to prevent the entrance of fog into the sewer system small scale gis can be installed inside the home kitchen and large scale gis can be located outside food service establishments fses and below ground a typical large scale gi is made of concrete usually consists of two compartments a baffle wall and inlet outlet and baffle pipe gravity separation is the primary effective mechanism of any gi and plays a vital role in their design and determining an appropriate hydraulic retention time hrt the efficiency of a gi largely depends on the temperature incoming flow rate particle sizes of fog emulsion strength and retention time ducoste et al 2008 gallimore et al 2011 a particle size of 150 µm or larger can be efficiently removed by the typical gi system through gravity separation wang et al 2007 non emulsified free fog is also easy to separate using the gi system as it floats and clumps on the surface of the wastewater therefore an additional pre treatment measure is required for the efficient removal of small particles colloidal and emulsified fog either via use of a biological agent or a chemical to react with and coagulate the fog so that it falls to the bottom of the separation chamber biological methods such as the addition of commercial microbial supplements and immobilized bacterial populations have demonstrated a range of removal efficiencies brooksbank et al 2007 iasmin et al 2014 nisola et al 2009 tang et al 2012 chemical methods including the use of electrocoagulation ec and surfactants showed promising results for fog pre treatment chen et al 2000 pirooz et al 2018 however removal can be decreased with high influent flows and high emulsion strength gallimore et al 2011 this article highlights some of the scientific understanding associated with fog management strategies such as understanding of the i physical and chemical makeup of fog deposits ii transport modeling and kinetics of fog formation in the sewer system and iii the fundamental science underpinning the removal mechanism of fog using a gi system this review also aims to deliver greater insight into the existing particle size distribution of fog from both dishwasher and handwash sink effluents and their removal trends as well as the treatment technologies therefore the result of this study may contribute to generating a hybrid gi process for future use 2 mechanism of fog solidification in sewers the common fog solidification mechanism in sewers involves producing ffas through the reaction of hydrolysis in which a triglyceride molecule is split into its constituent fatty acids and glycerol along with the accumulation of hydrogen cation and hydroxide anion bruice 2003 some of the ffas react with na and ca2 present in the sewer pipes followed by the saponification process to form saponified solids that result in the accumulation of fog deposits on inner sewer walls he et al 2013 otsuka et al 2020 this proceeds to form larger particles if pre formed deposits or non reacting ffas act as a binder that attract ca2 ions as well as solid particles he et al 2013 the alkaline detergents degreasers or sanitizers used in fses are likely to further promote saponification and deposition rates because these effluents have a relatively high ph ph 10 2 1 formation of fog deposits the mechanism of fog deposit formation involves four mandatory components ca2 ffas fog and water he et al 2013 fog solidification in the sewer starts at the inner upper surface of the sewer pipe he 2012 fog on the wastewater surface is pushed against the inner pipe surface by the wastewater flow and calcium sulfate leached from the concrete sewer may accumulate and stick to the inner walls where un reacted ffas may also be presented iasmin et al 2014 gradually this leads to blocking the pipe and restriction of wastewater flow ssos are eventually caused by excessive accumulation of other suspended solid materials that are disposed to the sewer on and within the fog deposit otsuka et al 2020 the size strength and composition of this fog solid may vary with the characteristics of its source keener et al 2008 conducted a study on field samples and found distinct layers of concentrated fog deposits and debris resulting from their periodic release they also found that the thickness of the layers varied from 0 25 to 0 5 cm and the possible solidification rate was 0 1 cm d on the other hand franke et al 2011 found a high rate approximately 7 cm d of fog formation in a pumping pit this was due to the high rate of incoming fog waste from several farms including residential buildings to the pump station it is likely that the rapid fog accumulation rate in pump stations may lead to higher rates of fog deposition in sewers however no recent study has been found regarding the current trend of solidification rate therefore further study is required to develop a realistic approach to tracking fog deposition rates solid formation is a complex process which includes the transformation of ffas from unsaturated to saturated forms in the sewer williams et al 2012 the proportion of saturated sfa or unsaturated fatty acid ufa may vary depending on the location of the fog solid williams et al 2012 found oleic acid higher than palmitic acid content at pumping stations compared to sewer networks due to the fresher condition of fog in pump stations in the sewer fog wastes age and an in sewer transformation process takes place to transform oleic to palmitic acid williams et al 2012 stated that microbial assemblages are required for the hydrolysis and hydrogenation of oleic to palmitic acid they suggested that enzymes released by anaerobic bacteria in the assemblages may have a significant role in the hydrolysis and hydrogenation of oleic acid c18 1 to form palmitic acid c16 0 later iasmin et al 2014 found a higher concentration of palmitic than oleic acid in the sewer they also suggested that this is possibly because of microbial transformations by anaerobes rhead et al 1971 over time in the sewer system this mechanism of biological transformation was termed beta oxidation by keener et al 2008 however that process does not account for hydrogenation the transformation of oleic to palmitic acid would contribute to increasing the melting point of deposited solid and could cause faster solidification he et al 2013 in a laboratory study gross et al 2017 found that fog deposits with a high level of sfas generated structurally stronger fog deposits whereas ufas produced comparatively weaker deposits this result is inconsistent with the findings of he et al 2013 who noticed that the deposits containing palmitic acid were soft and sticky and oleic acid produced more viscous solids compared to palmitic acid however gross et al 2017 were able to mimic real sewer fog deposits and suggested that greater use of ufas in cooking and preventing sfas from entering the sewer may decrease the strength of the fog deposit which may ultimately reduce ssos the source of ca2 plays a significant role in saponification and deposit formation he et al 2011 stated that deposition does not occur unless ffas form through hydrolysis followed by saponification with ca2 which means oils will not produce a solid if they do not react with ca2 the constituents obtained from fog deposits showed that they were simply fatty acid metal salts resulting from saponification reactions he et al 2011 however other solids were also found which were hypothesized as resulting from aggregation of unreacted ffas and other metals by van der waals attraction and electrostatic repulsion dlvo theory he et al 2011 this hypothesis was later depicted by he et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 extraction with dichloromethane dcm was used to examine the proportions of fatty acids fas and fatty acid salts in fog deposits based on their solubility benecke et al 2017 the fas that are completely soluble in dcm were found to be comparatively dense and tended to settle in contrast fa salts including minerals that are insoluble in dcm had lower density and tended to float and thus were easy to isolate benecke et al 2017 also observed that solids formed from fas are waxy cohesive in nature and act as a glue and so accumulate faster while the solids from fa salts are powdery and non cohesive thus strongly suggesting that the deposition of fa salts contributes to increasing the tensile strength of the deposit the results are consistent with previously reported fog deposit characteristics del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 iasmin et al 2014 the presence of suspended solids ss significantly enhances fog solidification in sewers recently otsuka et al 2020 determined the effects of ss in an artificial sewer system they found that ss were the precursor of fog deposition they emphasized the requirements of mandatory co existence of fa and ss for fog deposition since no blockage was observed in the absence of ss this simulated experimental mechanism was able to mimic the mechanisms developed by he et al 2013 in addition the formation of fog deposits in the absence of ca2 or any metal is possible through a crystallization process gross et al 2017 keener et al 2008 as shown in fig 1 however further detailed study of the fog crystallization process is required to better understand the process of fog settling 2 2 kinetics of fog depositions and identifying hotspots the kinetics of fog solid deposition depend on several factors such as rate of saponification the hydrolysis process the source and type of calcium the source of ffas and the presence of other metal ions and environmental conditions i e solution ph and temperature saponification is the final stage of reaction between ffas and free metal ions mainly ca2 in sewers to form solids the rate of saponification may vary with the type of ffa typically palmitic oleic or linoleic del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 investigated the fog saponification process and properties of produced solids for different ffa sources such as chicken and pork fat olive palm soybean and coconut oils they found that fats and oils with a higher oleic to palmitic acid ratio underwent a greater degree of saponification and produced a larger amount of solids a similar observation was made earlier by he et al 2013 who noted that the amount of solid produced from oleic acid was much higher than from palmitic acid this was possibly because of the higher molecular weight of the ufas oleic 282 and linoleic 280 5 than the sfas palmitic 256 therefore oleic acid is identified as one of the critical influencers in fog formation kinetics thus suggesting that it can be used as a tracer of hotspots where rapid fog deposition may occur notably sewers which are constantly exposed to high levels of fat and oils can lead to fog deposits with high apparent viscosity and consistency index del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 resulting in greater flow resistance in the sewer on the other hand sewers with high levels of calcium can lead to coarse grained deposits which have higher melting points and more resistance to heat because of their lower void area in addition del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 also found chicken and pork fat solids had the highest melting points 57 to 60 c this is due to their long carbon chains of oleic linoleic and palmitic acid on the contrary coconut oil solids had lower melting points 32 to 44 c because it contains a large proportion of lauric acid which has a shorter carbon chain c12 0 i e no double bonds inspite of having double bond solids produced from soybean olive and palm oil which have significant contents of unsaturated c18 fas although palm oil has a significant palmitic content showed a similar high range of melting points 56 to 60 c for the fat like pork and chicken in spite of their high unsaturated fa content this was possible because chicken and pork fat also contains significant proportions of oleic and linoleic acid with palmitic acid determining the rate of hydrolysis the kinetics of saponified solid formation and predicting the spatial formation of fog deposits in municipal sewers are important in preventing ssos ph temperature and palmitic content have significant impact on spatial formations and fog depositions iasmin et al 2016 notably high ph usually 7 leads to rapid saponification the ph may change the solubility of calcium in aqueous solution and therefore change the amount of free ca2 as well as hydroxyl ions to participate fat hydrolysis and the saponification reaction iasmin et al 2014 to have a better understanding iasmin et al 2016 used two different sources of calcium calcium chloride and calcium sulfate with canola oil and beef tallow to produce saponified solids an average of 15 35 and 15 80 of fat underwent a rapid hydrolysis for calcium chloride and calcium sulfate solutions respectively for both fats and at all ph 7 10 and 14 and temperature 22 and 45 c conditions the resultant ffas react with calcium to form saponified solids iasmin et al 2016 a maximum of 60 saponified solid was formed for calcium chloride at high ph 10 and at 45 ⁰c on the other hand the highest percentage of saponified solid 90 was found for calcium sulfate solutions at neutral to alkaline ph 10 and at 45 ⁰c like high ph elevated temperature 45 ⁰c plays a key role in the saponification reaction consistent with most chemical reactions having higher rate at higher temperature the higher temperature would also lead to faster melting of the fat and facilitate its hydrolysis and then participation in the saponification reaction however higher temperature may lead to the discharge of un reacted melted fat into the sewer iasmin et al 2014 hence variation of solution properties and environmental conditions plays a key role in hydrolysis as well as in the saponification process several models have been developed to describe the kinetics of saponified solids and fat crystallization for predicting sewer hotspots for example cotte et al 2006 developed an empirical saponification model and foubert et al 2002 developed a fat crystallization model to predict the kinetics of saponified solid formation their models were able to predict the kinetics of calcium based saponification of fog sediments however these models are limited in that they are unable to predict the rate of fat hydrolysis the fat crystallization model was also unable to predict the rate of solid production under slow saponification conditions therefore a mass action based mechanistic model masm was developed by iasmin et al 2016 for predicting the rate of formation of saponified solids and to track the changes in reactants i e triglyceride ffa and ca2 the masm includes a fundamental process of alkali driven hydrolysis by which ffas are released by hydrolysis of triglyceride followed by saponification eqs 1 and 2 however limitations of the masm model include lower efficiency in quantifying the fog deposits at a specific sewer section and the accumulation of un reacted ffa and ca2 he et al 2017 to overcome the masm model limitations another sewer collection system model was developed by yousefelahiyeh et al 2017 which considered urban landscapes background wastewater flow variations and the number and location of fses to enable prediction of the spots more prone to accumulating fog solids this model can determine the fate and transport of fog sediments and is able to detect around 65 of hotspots however the predictive performance of the model may be affected by pipe faults i e weak joints breaks sags low flow rates or debris intrusion 1 t r i g l y c e r i d e 3 w a t e r k t 3 f r e e f a t t y a c i d f f a g l y c e r o l 2 2 f f a c a 2 k d k s c a f f a 2 where kt reaction rate constant for the hydrolysis of triglyceride l3mol 3h 1 ks reaction rate constant for saponification of ffa and ca2 l2mol 3h 1 kd reaction rate constant for breakdown and or dissolution solid to liquid phase of the saponified solids h 1 the accumulation of fog may also largely depend on the kinetic energy density of incoming flow population income and fse density a generalized linear mixed model glmm developed by nieuwenhuis et al 2018 demonstrated that the location of inlet pipes at a pumping station plays a key role in developing kinetic energy submerged inlet pipes cause a decrease in flow velocity as well as in the kinetic energy on the contrary inlets located over the level of dry weather flow have the potential to increase kinetic energy density which may reduce the fog accumulation in the pump sumps they also showed the probability of fog accumulation increases with decrease in average personal income and fog accumulation is directly proportionally correlated with the number and density of fses nieuwenhuis et al 2018 yousefelahiyeh et al 2017 the glmm is able to track the probability of fog accumulation particularly in pump sumps whereas the previous masm model was able to predict hotspots in sewer networks but was unable to quantify fog at those hotspots therefore developing an advanced model considering detailed physicochemical properties e g fog particle size discussed in section 3 4 hydraulic properties e g geometry of sewer pipes and demographic aspects e g personal diet and cleaning habits is important to obtain greater insight in tracking fog accumulations 2 3 spatial formation and effect of debris accumulation fog deposition is a continuous process of formation and accumulation to form solids increasingly larger in size the process may vary with the hydraulic properties and configurations of the sewer networks which include bends slopes joints deformations manholes and wet wells therefore the network causes dissimilarities in hydraulic conditions as well as spatial deposition within the sewer dominic et al 2013 futhermore weak joints and cracks in old sewer pipes may lead to the intrusion of roots and other debris lu et al 2000 initially intrusion of tree roots was identified as a great influence in spatial deposition desilva et al 2011 ducoste et al 2008 and marlow et al 2011 showed that blockages due to tree root intrusion can be of 75 for some utility areas in australia since then other solids such as disposable face masks wet wipes tampons cotton buds plastics sanitary absorbents grit and dirt have also been found in sewer networks notably around 93 of solids are non biodegradable wet wipes which cause negative impacts on sewer flow by increasing the volume of fog deposits oakes 2019 dominic et al 2013 demonstrated that the greatest solid accumulation can occur in a manhole or near a pipe sag or bend due to the low flow velocity in that section resulting in high retention time solids may appear even in straight pipe sections of an older pipe due to its roughness dominic et al 2013 in a new pipe section fog particles may adhere to the pipe due to the viscous sublayer of flow near the wall which can stay there until deposition caused by friction husain et al 2017 marlow et al 2011 noted that the consequences of climate change such as prolonged droughts or floods as well as illegal discharges into sewers may also be contributing factors other factors such as poor performance of gis the high density of fses and high rise buildings within an area can play a significant role in spatial formation which eventually leads to the formation of fatbergs mattsson et al 2014 enormous deposits of debris congealed with fog are termed fatbergs in australia stein and miller 2019 reported the presence of solid particles which created monstruous fatbergs which eventually caused infrastructural damage as well as deterioration of conveyed water quality it is not only the fact that the intrusion of solid materials causes fatbergs but also that they affect the biophysical and hydraulic properties of sewers for example material composition buoyancy viscosity specific gravity rate of settlement and disintegration may have an impact on the rapid accumulation of fog and blockage creation alda vidal et al 2020 however as a preventive measure kamali et al 2017 suggested a cleaning frequency of 1 6 months for hotspot deposits and 3 5 years for other spots in sewer networks therefore proper management of debris at the source of generation to prevent intrusion change in personal practices and proper sewer maintenance are suggested to improve sewer performance 3 characterization of fog wastes fog can have a wide range of physical and chemical properties depending on the source of generation fog can be either liquid or solid and may have no color odor or taste while in the pure state husain et al 2014 the specific gravity of fog is less than 1 0 and so it can float it has a high viscosity and is insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents firestone 2006 the physicochemical properties of fog as well as their influence on sewer performance are described in the following section 3 1 physical properties of fog the physical appearance texture and yield strength of fog varies with the source of calcium the types of ffas and the impurities incorporated during solidification in sewers iasmin et al 2014 a wide range of moisture content 6 95 has been found in fog samples collected from the field kamali et al 2017 keener et al 2008 williams et al 2012 as shown in table 1 on the other hand gross et al 2017 noted a significantly lower moisture content 0 45 13 4 in synthetic fog samples this was possibly because of the controlled heating and cooling environment in the laboratory during experiments they also reported the significant role of calcium in increasing moisture content this is likely due to the metals i e calcium sodium being able to create pores which can hold water within fog deposits notably there is no evidence of the impact of the level of moisture content on solidification yield strength and melting points are important properties of fog keener et al 2008 found fog solids had a low density 0 66 to 1 23 g cm3 limited open pore content and high yield strength maximum 34 25 kpa gross et al 2017 demonstrated higher yield strength in synthetic fog deposits than in real sewer samples they also found that sfas especially palmitic are more likely to have 2 1 times higher yield strength than ufas due to the presence of the double bonds in ufas which reduce the strength of fog solids williams et al 2012 reported that fog solids with high yield strength and melting points are closely associated with the level of water hardness ca and mg more specifically with calcium contents this finding was later verified by gross et al 2017 who found melting points varied from 15 to 300 ⁰c table 1 demonstrating that crystallization of fatty acids occurs through a deposition mechanism of fog in the presence of high concentrations of calcium ions the yield strength and melting point are important parameters as the cost and effort involved with fog management are related to these parameters hence a pragmatic solution involving introducing an effective gi system is required to reduce the level of fog reaching the sewer and of reducing the yield strength and melting point of that which does 3 2 chemical properties of fog a better understanding of the chemical properties of fog could provide an appropriate insight into sewer clogging control strategy the strength of fog deposits mostly depends on their chemical composition i e their main constituent fas and metals as shown in table 2 the ph values of fog usually vary from moderately acidic to markedly basic with a few exceptions a moderately acidic ph range of 4 1 to 4 7 was detected in gi and household kitchen effluent barton 2012 mohamed et al 2013 this was possibly due to microbial activity on the organic food compounds present in the kitchen wastewater on the other hand effluents collected from the dishwasher and mixed samples dishwasher and hand wash sink produced moderately to very alkaline ph 10 5 to 12 0 wastewater chung and young 2013 gurd et al 2019 which was attributed the use of alkaline cleaning agents therefore control of the types and amounts of cleaning agents is strongly suggested to mitigate the strength of fog the range of bod and cod values was often extremely wide depending on the source of fog effluents chen et al 2000 chung and young 2013 nisola et al 2009 and reflected the presence of soluble organic matter present in fog wastes barton 2012 the level of dissolved oxygen was low which indicated the potential occurrence of anaerobic microbial activity of fog within gis he et al 2012 a wide range of fog concentration was found in different fse samples 5 to 4600 mg l and in many cases these exceeded the desirable limit of 50 to 150 mg l for fse effluent metcalf et al 1991 thus a realistic approach is required to reduce fog concentration to within acceptable limits before disposing the waste to the sewer the concentrations of metal ions differed for each sample table 3 and large differences were observed between samples collected from the sewer and kitchen wastewater for example the big difference in calcium content for sewer and kitchen wastewater was because the major portion of ca2 can be leached from concrete sewers through a microbially induced concrete corrosion process he et al 2013 iasmin et al 2014 much higher values for metals including ca2 were reported in samples collected in the uk williams et al 2012 than in the usa keener et al 2008 this was because the usa south east water samples were naturally very soft compared with those of the uk which is reflected in the calcium concentrations in fog deposits uk 10 940 mg kg and usa 4255 mg l apart from water hardness ca mg and sewer concrete calcium can also come from the human metabolism a person s calcium intake can vary from 1000 to 1500 mg d depending on age peacock 2010 therefore calcium disposal through human faeces and urine excretion can vary from 0 1 to 3 6 and 0 057 to 0 5 gm cap day respectively rose et al 2015 however the contribution of calcium generated from human metabolism in the fog solidification process is yet to be determined thus controlling the total concentration of ca2 is as important as controlling of ffa production to reduce fog solidification inside the sewer kusum et al 2020 introduced fly ash as a replacement for cement to control calcium leaching from the sewer they showed that a maximum reduction of 86 calcium leaching was achieved with 75 fly ash replacement thereby reducing fog solidification in some cases the concentration of na detected was higher than other metals such as k ca mg fe and al eriksson et al 2002 gurd et al 2019 this was possibly due to the extensive use of monosodium glutamate msg as a food additive in daily food products niaz et al 2018 and using high sodium hydroxide contents in detergents and sodium chloride as a softener in hard water areas gurd et al 2019 as the sodium salt of glutamic acid msg contains high proportion of sodium which may release na in the kitchen wastewater therefore it is important to control these less significant metal ions to efficiently reduce fog deposition in sewers 3 3 fatty acid fa profile of fog waste fas are one of the most important components of fog wastes the number of fa types may vary greatly when the gi or sewer system receives a wide range of types and amounts of different fats for example used cooking oil may produce 15 or less of ffas however it can be greater than 15 for restaurant effluents depending on the number of types of food offered and this can eventually reduce the ph of wastewater husain et al 2014 a wide range of short chain fatty acids scfa and long chain fatty acids lcfa are present in fog wastes calcium salts of lcfas have been identified as key components of sewer fog deposits he and yan 2016 found a similar profile of lcfas in the laboratory gi and in real fog deposits table 4 therefore it is required to ensure more effective separation of lcfas in the gi system so that they can be retained and removed from the gi before releasing the wastewater to the sewer and so reduce the formation of fog deposits unsaturated lcfas have greater impact than saturated lcfas on downstream sewer pipelines he et al 2013 he and yan 2016 this is because calcium salts of ufa such as oleic and linoleic acids are more adhesive and soap productive due to their double bonds and this may lead to more corrosion of concrete sewer pipes he et al 2013 therefore further study is required to determine the current trend of lcfa removal from existing gi systems palmitic acid is the most abundant and dominant ffa in terms of concentration in both fse effluents and fog deposits followed by stearic oleic and linoleic acid benecke et al 2017 del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 he et al 2011 keener et al 2008 shin et al 2015 he et al 2011 found an exception in their field samples which showed the concentrations of primary monounsaturated fas were significantly higher 2 to 4 times than those of laboratory samples table 4 this may have occurred due to the extensive use of cooking oil or vegetable oil by the source s of the fog samples later gross et al 2017 were able to mimic the fa compositions for both laboratory and field fog samples furthermore field samples contained 1 16 6 1 of myristic acid benecke et al 2017 gross et al 2017 henriksson et al 2016 montefrio et al 2010 wang et al 2008 and a notable amount of other ffas 6 4 20 2 this complexity of sewer sample compositions due to diversified fog components and their reactions has been noted by gross et al 2017 3 4 fog particle size fog particle size can be influenced by a wide variety of factors such as washing process detergents used by restaurants sanitisers and different types of oil thus influencing the emulsification characteristics of fog and separation efficiency aziz et al 2011 an emulsion is formed when two immiscible liquids are mixed because they are not soluble in each other smaller 20 µm oil droplets are more stable in emulsified form and temperature plays a significant role in the viscosity and interfacial tension and thus affects the adsorption capacity of emulsifier and emulsion stability abdel raouf 2012 particle sizes greater than 150 µm are classified as free oil and have weaker stability these can be separated easily using a gravity separation system within 10 min api 1990 particles with diameter ranges of 20 150 µm are called mechanically emulsified oils have moderate stability and may need several hours for separation emulsions with particles between 1 and 20 µm are defined as chemically emulsified micro emulsions with strong stability and require multiple days for separation or alternatively can be stabilized by surfactants api 1990 bande et al 2008 colloidal particles 1 µm have strong stability and are difficult to remove by a gravity separation process particle size distribution of fog in wastewater in gi influent and effluent has rarely been investigated barton 2012 investigated the median particle diameter d50 for the gi compartments of four fses and obtained a wide range of particle sizes from 4 to 274 µm a narrower particle size range 4 100 µm was noted in both compartments of the gis compared with fse samples 9 274 µm particularly in the second compartment where they ranged over 4 10 µm which demonstrated the easy gravity separation of larger particles in the first compartment through either sedimentation or creaming at the top on investigating particle sizes from different sources of fse effluents barton 2012 found a consistent range of 48 56 µm from a cafeteria mixed range of 9 123 µm from a restaurant and larger particles of 23 274 µm from a dining hall this wide range of diameter may represent the heterogeneity of source samples they also noted that comparatively smaller 4 10 µm particles remained in a cafeteria effluent even after passing though the gi however they did not differentiate whether the different particle sizes came from hand wash sinks or automatic dishwashers in a recent study gurd et al 2019 examined particle sizes from dishwasher and handwash sinks separately and showed an average particle diameter of 18 µm and 27 µm respectively table 5 it can be concluded that automatic dishwashers are more likely to produce smaller particles than those from handwash sinks this is attributed to the mechanical agitation of the wash water and the use of cleaning agents over an hour or so at elevated temperature being likely to produce more stable and smaller particles gurd et al 2019 concluded that an average of 94 and 76 of emulsified fog with particle size less than 45 µm was produced from dishwashers and handwash sinks respectively it is therefore suggested that separation by gravity requires enhancement possibly by additional treatment barton 2012 also indicated particles 20 µm may not fall into the gravity separating zone however to date no study has measured the fraction of colloidal 1 µm and suspended particles along with their fate and transport mechanism according to api 1990 these particles are potentially hard to settle in conventional gi systems and require additional treatment apart from fog particle sizes other properties including fog concentration table 5 and the amount of free oil and emulsified oil may vary with the respective cleaning modes the range of fog concentration in dishwasher effluents was 89 850 mg l gurd et al 2019 which aligns with the findings of chung and young 2013 and were considerably lower than those for handwash sinks which were 253 1067 mg l in addition gurd et al 2019 discriminated between the free and emulsified fraction of fog they showed that the concentration of emulsified fog had nearly the same values of 291 and 309 mg l for dishwasher and sink effluent respectively however the concentration of free oil was significantly higher 570 mg l in sink samples than in dishwasher samples 22 mg l a narrow range of high ph values 10 5 11 8 was detected for dishwasher effluents chung and young 2013 gurd et al 2019 therefore more study is required to verify the amount of free and emulsified fog fractions that are produced nowadays and their impacts on fog solidification the number of fses are growing approximately 2 per year with the increasing population growth aaron allen and associates 2018 additionally the use of automated appliances is rapidly increasing in both households and fses due to the technological advancement however dishwashers may strongly influence on fog characteristics as well as the efficiency of gis this is because they are more likely producing chemically emulsified or colloidal particles and thus discharge a high volume of fog particles of less than 45 µm diameter to the sewer system therefore it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive study of existing gi systems to understand the effective removal of particles of all sizes in particular the removal of particles of 45 µm and colloidal particles needs to be examined otherwise these particles may pose serious threats to sewer networks if not removed effectively before entering the sewer 4 treatment of fog gi systems are commonly used for the treatment of fog this allows the accumulation of fog sludge at the surface and settling of the large fog particles along with food solids at the bottom fig 2 the sludge and food solids are then removed from the gi and clarified water is disposed to the sewer pre treatment can enhance the efficiency of gravity separation in gis a range of pre treatments such as bioaugmentation chemical coagulation cc and electrocoagulation ec has been implemented to improve gi performance by removing fog from fse wastewater before entering the sewer system the treatment and pre treatment processes are discussed in the following sections 4 1 gi process passive or internal flow based gis and external retention based gis are known as fgis and rgis respectively gallimore et al 2011 due to the variability of influent characteristics and flow rate gis usually experience extremely dynamic intermittent flow conditions which may sometimes include short circuiting inside the gi regardless of its size or hrt aziz et al 2011 evaluated the effectiveness of a precast concrete gi with two different hrts 20 and 60 min for removing fog from fse wastewater they found that the maximum removal of fog was 90 at 60 min hrt this aligns with the suggestion given by chu and ng 2000 who stated that 30 min or greater hrt is required for effective fog removal gallimore et al 2011 compared the performance of fgis and rgis at three different emulsion strengths weak medium and strong they reported approximately 80 of fog removal for the rgi which was significantly higher than for the fgi 50 under all laboratory conditions one exception was approximately 82 removal of fog with weak emulsion strength for the fgi this was likely due to the production of large fog particles by the relatively weak agitation process another contradictory result was obtained by moore and dang 2009 who observed a maximum of 30 7 removal efficiency of a field gi with an average wastewater temperature of 30 ⁰c indicating that the gravity separation process may not work properly if not designed and maintained properly to improve the removal performance aziz et al 2012 suggested the use of a distributive inlet and two compartment gi system gallimore et al 2011 reported that gi performance is greatly influenced by the temperature and emulsion strength of the wastewater as fog particle size decreases with rising temperature and emulsion strength this is the possible reason for the increased breakdown of fog particles into smaller colloidal particles thus reducing the fog removal efficiency they used two one and no static mixers to produce strong medium strength and weak emulsions respectively they found that the removal efficiency and average particle size dropped from 38 to 8 and 289 to 151 µm respectively when the emulsion strength varied from weak to strong overall removal efficiency decreased by 10 on increasing the temperature from 21 ⁰c to 38 ⁰c for all the conditions therefore the control of temperature and the optimization of emulsion strength are required to achieve highest removal performance multi compartmented gis can be used for efficient removal of fog al gheethi 2019 improved the gravity separation process by using a multi compartment trap consisting of a screen a primary and a secondary sedimentation tank a fog separation chamber and a hair filter the hair filter acted as an adsorbent filter medium and was attached before the effluent discharge point to trap the remaining trace components of fog the optimum removal efficiency was 93 suggesting the multi compartment gi was an efficient and reliable gi system which did not require any pre treatment al gheethi 2019 this was possibly due to long residence time in the multiple compartments however the fog concentration at the discharge point was 50 mg l and did not meet the standard of 10 mg l required by the malaysian environmental act 1974 it is therefore necessary to consider the wide variability of influent and effluent characteristics sizing and internal configuration particle size distribution type of food solid rate of accumulation of food solid and residence time when upgrading the design of gis 4 2 effects of pre treatment process for improving gi performance various pre treatment processes have been applied to improve the fog removal efficiency from fse and household kitchen wastewater the commonly used method is bioaugmentation which refers to the introduction of suitable microbial additives that are potentially capable of degrading fog in the wastewater some other methods including ec cc use of tube settlers and surfactants have also been shown to increase removal efficiency 4 2 1 bioaugmentation bioaugmentation is the most widely studied method of treating fog biologically and is used as a baseline to verify the effectiveness of adding other external products the process includes breaking down the lipids eventually to fas and glycerol by the activity of specific enzymes called lipases lipases catalyze the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols to diacylglycerols monoacylglycerols glycerol and fas under suitable conditions sharma et al 2001 the change in waste characteristics due to the addition of external microorganisms depends on the species used the characteristics of the specific gi and food wastes and some unidentified factors he et al 2012 they reported that bacillus spp showed inconsistent results for fog removal for individual and combined restaurant and community home kitchen gi wastewater addition of these bacteria significantly lowered the fog depth for individual restaurant gi samples but made no contribution to lowering fog depth for combined gi samples this was possibly due to the inclusion of greywater from bathroom and laundries which contains detergent degreaser or softener this may increase the ph of wastewater and thus inhibit the reproduction and activity of bacteria to contribute to lowering fog depth he and yan 2016 observed that microbial products are capable of producing five times greater lcfa within gis this higher production of lcfa in the gi could lead to the release of less lcfa to the sewer system by retaining them in the gi as a result the rate of saponification would be lower and thus fog solids production would be lower a further study conducted by he et al 2016 found that the residence time of the biological product has a significant influence on fog removal the sudden entrance of a large volume of wastewater may cause shortening of the time of exposure to the microorganisms and also may lead to flushing them out of the gi and so becoming less effective in the gi system the inflow rate to the gi and dose of added microorganisms are important parameters in the effectiveness of bioaugmentation for fog removal nisola et al 2009 used immobilized bacteria in the gi and showed no significant change in fog removal when the inflow concentration was 1000 mg l in contrast the highest fog removal of 97 99 occurred when the influent was 5000 mg l and remained effective up to 10 000 mg l where the immobilized bacteria led to 93 removal brooksbank et al 2007 showed substantial fog degradation of 37 62 using a recommended dose of a multi species supplement named f69 which includes bacillus spp pseudomonas spp lactobacillus sporogenes and micrococcus sp fan 2014 observed the fog removal efficiency of a commercial biological product containing surfactants enzymes colorants and bacillus spp with respect to increasing temperature and product concentration he reported 18 additional fog removal when the temperature was increased from 15 to 32 c and suggested that 30 c is beneficial for bacterial metabolism and lipase activity this is comparable with the range of temperature 28 to 60 c at which bacillus spp remains competent gupta et al 2004 on the other hand a drastic increase in bacteria concentration from 0 12 to 120 mg l showed only 5 6 increase in fog removal fan 2014 which indicated that microbes have optimal range of reproduction for a certain dose of bacteria concentration further study is required to optimize the microbe concentration to be more effective for the specific commercial microbial products recently single species mixed double species and commercial multiple species additives were compared to investigate the efficacy of different microbial species for the different fat types it was found that bacteria from a single genus bacillus spp were able to degrade fat from olive oil ufa but not from butter sfa the addition of pseudomonas putida strain cp1 to the bacillus showed 94 and 97 of fat removal from olive oil and butter respectively after 13 days of incubation tzirita et al 2019 it was shown that bacillus spp were only able to hydrolyze the fat and the breakdown products were later metabolized by the ps putida cp1 which preferentially utilized the unsaturated fas thus the addition of pseudomonas sp greatly contributed to the removal of saturated and unsaturated fat tzirita et al 2021 investigated the effectiveness of three different commercial biological products bfl gnz and ff with respect to two different nutrient n p ratios 1 5 and 12 2 bfl and gnz were in powder and liquid forms respectively both contained mostly bacillus species ff was in tablet form containing ps putida aeromonas hydrophila a fungus mucor circinelloides van tieghem and bacillus species among the three bioaugmentation products ff showed highest degradability for both sfas and ufas followed by bfl and gnz showed no degradation of any fat ff showed 92 and 94 degradation for ufas and sfas respectively in enriched n p 12 2 medium bfl showed no degradation of sfas however bfl was able to remove 94 ufas when the enriched n p 12 2 ratio was used therefore it is obvious that saturated fats are a greater challenge for the bioaugmentation products and the presence of nutrient sources greatly affects their biodegradability performance tzirita et al 2018 2021 they also found that bacillus spp have the highest lipolytic activity and produce a wide range of hydrolytic enzymes which is important for the biodegradation of fog hence this suggests that the selection of microbes with appropriate enzyme activity to hydrolyse the ufas and sfas and the resultant products providing an appropriate nutrient n and p level and ratio ph and temperature to promote microbial reproduction and enzyme activity need to be taken into consideration when selecting biological products for treatment 4 2 2 coagulation the chemical treatment process of coagulation has been widely used in water and wastewater treatment it involves destabilization of lighter suspended dissolved or colloidal particles to generate larger flocs followed by their agglomeration which then settle by gravity nowadays ec an electrochemical process of using electrical charge to produce flocs is a widely used method for removing oil and grease from wastewater tahreen et al 2020 chen et al 2000 showed a maximum of 94 fog removal using an electrochemical reactor this high removal of oil and grease was possible because of high charge loading of the reactor up to 9 95 f m3 despite its theoretically high removal capability there is limited practical application of ec for treating fse wastewater this is due to the effectiveness of ec being decreased by the significant amount of dissolved organic compounds in real field samples chen et al 2000 recently changmai et al 2019 obtained 71 removal of oil and grease from oily wastewater from a drilling site and priya and jeyanthi 2019 showed 92 5 removal from automobile wash effluents using the ec process a combined ec flocculation method showed removals of 84 cod and 95 tss from urban wastewater elazzouzi et al 2017 however elazzouzi et al did not determine fog removal by the ec flocculation method and no recent study has been found on fog removal from fses using the ec process it is suggested that further study be conducted on treating water containing animal fat or vegetable oil beef tallow chicken fat or canola oil with ec or ec membrane technology integrated with a gi system surfactants are used to increase the surface area of particles and to destabilize their ability to float pirooz et al 2018 investigated fog removal by adding surfactants such as monoethyl amine sulfonated lauryl alcohol and nonylphenol ethoxylate table 6 they obtained 80 fog removal by optimizing the concentration of these surfactants to be 12 5 this removal rate is far better than that obtained in the study conducted by livingston et al 2007 who got 32 removal of fog by combined dosing of bacteria bacillus spp and surfactants they used 1 2 anionic and 2 2 nonionic surfactants in addition to bacterial addition the lower fog removal was possibly due to using too low a concentration of surfactants livingston et al 2007 did not differentiate between the contribution of bacteria and surfactants to the removal instead they argued that no negative influence was observed in wastewater quality due to adding surfactants 4 3 ozonation ozone is recognized as a strong oxidant disinfectant and decontamination agent ozone is also used to control and eliminate microorganisms in food products and from water and wastewater rodríguez et al 2008 ozonation for the treatment of fog and reducing solidification of fog wastes has rarely been investigated kishimoto et al 2018 noted that inclusion of ozonated water helped to prevent fog solidification in drainpipes however the efficiency of removing unsaturated or complex fats was not investigated more recently khalifa et al 2021 developed a hybrid ec reactor consisting of a ceramic microfiltration membrane to treat oily wastewater collected from an oil and gas field they demonstrated a significant increase in cod removal from 17 to 53 due to the addition of ozone to the reactor in other words the enhancement of the ec process was due to introduction of ozone for providing more oxidative power which consequently increased the membrane performance by improving the size exclusion process as a result the reactor was covered with high intensity flocs and a more viscous solution was formed to aid size exclusion by the membrane following this process the ceramic membrane was able to retain more cod to increase removal efficiency which was attributed to the increase in oxidation and mineralization of organics in the reactor it was suggested that further studies are required for optimization and modification of reactor design through studying the solubility and residence time of ozone in oily wastewater khalifa et al 2021 under laboratory conditions various treatment processes showed a wide range of fog removal efficiencies table 6 however in real field applications there can be some deficiencies as the composition of real fog is complex unpredictable and highly variable hence future study is required to understand the performance of ozonation ec with membrane technology surfactants and cc for removal of fog along with other contaminants 4 4 case studies fog management and awareness campaigns have been conducted by local city water authorities the use of commercial gis or pre treatment processes cannot solve the problem alone therefore a strict management policy and legislation with a regulatory and monitoring body public awareness standardization of gi design and maintenance frequency may significantly reduce the detrimental effects of fog case studies from various countries taking part in fog management are discussed below 4 5 usa the cease the grease program was operated by dallas water utilities in 2005 to reduce fog associated blockages gis were installed in addition to identifying hotspots and running an educational program approximately 96 blockage reduction was noted over five years of the cease the grease program and 13 5 million gallons of grease trap waste was recovered which potentially could save around 1 3 million per year dwu 2013 the best way of dealing with the collected grease trap waste was as feedstock for anaerobic co digestion currently dallas water utilities proactively educate people through their defend your drain website to save residences businesses shops and surrounding environment from the detrimental effects of ssos california s put a lid on it campaign was led by a fog work group calfog to decrease the ssos caused by fog deposition tupper and skoda 2008 the campaign involved educating the community in addition to plumbers and plumbing associations in many ways by informing the public about fog associated problems during blockage clearing or overflows in their premises a survey showed public awareness increased by 19 after this campaign harris 2009 needless to say education and outreach campaigns are necessary to endorse fog preventive measures wallace et al 2017 4 6 united kingdom in the uk fatbergs are still threatening the sewer systems despite initiating strict management policies and the application of treatment measures the formation of fatbergs caused by fog deposition continued thames water 2013 mills 2010 initiated a campaign named stop and think not down the sink and distributed a do s and don ts card as a result of the campaign householders prevented 3000 tons of fog from entering the sewer in one year installation of gi in addition to the campaign program resulted no fog related blockage in the town of stourport during the six months of the campaign mills 2010 this was due to removing 40 liters of fog waste from each gi every two weeks which eventually contributed to lessening the number of blockages in 2017 the largest blockage of 250 m length was found in whitechapel in east london of all the solid particles found in sewer blockages about 93 were wet wipes which raised concern about what people are really flushing down the toilet oakes 2019 a survey conducted on 103 restaurants in the uk showed that 70 of the restaurants had inefficient grease management systems oakes 2019 to improve this thames water launched an awareness campaign bin it don t block it to educate people on how not to contribute to fatberg formation the campaign encouraged people to store used cooking oil in a container to put in a bin rather than pour it down the sink they also advised them not to flush more than the three ps namely pee poo and toilet paper additionally the uk water utilities launched a fine to flush label for products that could be flushed water 2019 as a result of this program the number of sewer blockages gradually went down from 85 000 to 75 000 per year however it still remains an immense problem oakes 2019 4 7 australia in 1995 solidified fat was recognized by south east water as one of the key causes of sewer spills in the south east region of melbourne south east water introduced a three phase program called greasy waste to control the level of fog disposal and so reduce sewer blockages scoble and day 2002 the program included a trade waste agreement for fog disposal installation of adequately sized gi and maintaining appropriate cleaning frequency of gi eventually by 2001 south east water had enabled a 50 reduction in sewer blockages because of the program alam 2003 recently queensland urban utilities quu recorded 360 blockages in sewers due to fatbergs in the greater brisbane area stein and miller 2019 the largest fatberg was 7 m long and 60 cm wide another 80 m long pipe was seen partially occupied by a fatberg in brisbane these incidents clearly suggest that fog is a growing problem in australia quu announced a public awareness strategy titled think at the sink and suggested that people pour fat oil and food scraps into the bin instead of washing them down the sink to reduce household plumbing costs stein and miller 2019 they emphasized a few management practices for kitchen wastes in place of flushing them down the sink these included cooling of fats wiping fat from pans using paper towels as well as putting food scraps tea leaves coffee grinds and used cooking oil into a bin people were also encouraged not to use harsh chemicals and to reduce the volume of detergents moreover quu noticed that the presence of so called flushable wipes in the sewers causes severe blockage problems 4 8 ireland sewer blockages are under control in dublin city ireland the city council has been implementing a fog prevention program for controlling fog at the source since 2008 the program includes trade licences for effluent discharge installation of appropriately sized grease traps and their proper maintenance as a result the number of blockages dropped from 1000 to 50 per year and the program has significantly prevented major blockages in this city curran 2015 under dublin s fog program over 2000 inspections were performed from 2008 to 2014 preventing the entry of 200 103 liters of fog to the sewer networks in 2014 gibbons and curran 2015 the collected grease trap waste was categorized into three grades i grade 1 containing fog layers recovered from automatic grease traps ii grade 2 waste collected from passive flow gravity separation systems and iii grade 3 the remaining wastes from both wallace et al 2016 the majority of grade 1 grease trap waste has been used as feedstock for biodiesel production and the waste from grade 2 has been used in anaerobic co digestion to date dublin s fog program has been extremely effective and successful in achieving control over fog related ssos wallace et al 2017 5 perspectives fog is considered to be accountable for 50 70 of sewer blockages around the world being strategically successful in controlling sewer blockages is not only dependent on efficient fog removal with properly designed gi systems pre treatment and sewer modification but also on regulation systematic management and particularly on public awareness and involvement both the physical and chemical properties of fog need to be clearly understood fog droplet sizes may have a significant impact on the performance of gis because dishwashers are now commonly used by fses and household kitchens they use several detergents degreasers and softeners which have a strong potential to produce particles less than 45 µm gurd et al 2019 which are implicated in increasing the proportion of emulsified fog a limited number of studies have focused on the detailed physicochemical characteristics and impacts of the different particle sizes of fog most of the previous studies have shown biological pre treatment integrated with a gi system can effectively remove fog at the source of generation however there is concern about the effectiveness of the available pre treatment methods in practice since the problem associated with fog solidification is growing with time it can be said that the existing fog removal methods are not very effective therefore further study is required to efficiently eliminate the particle sizes of 45 µm including colloidal particles it is proposed that advanced approaches such as coagulation based technology integrated with gi be investigated the system could include a dual chambered gi with a mixer in the second compartment to ensure proper agitation of coagulation agent the efficacy of this system could be compared with ec membrane technology since the latter technology led to high removal of oily flocs from oily wastewater changmai et al 2019 prevention of fog entering the sewer and solidifying is not only dependent on technological aspects but also on management practices water utilities may be able to identify the locations that are more prone to fog deposition and debris accumulation by the use of models models have the potential to recognize hotspots and can be adjusted to changing conditions in the urban landscape research is also required to further develop models which take hydraulic and demographic parameters of sewer networks into account finally successful fog control could also be achieved by changing household practices of food waste disposal waste classification proper labeling of flushable and non flushable materials changes in food preparation habits and educating people at an early age a community campaign can also help the community to realize that the release of every single drop of fog to the sewer or flushing of non biodegradable solids matters 6 conclusions and recommendations fog is a major factor influencing deteriorating sewer performance this paper explains how the fog particles in wastewater disposed to the sewer can react with metal ions especially with calcium to solidify and accumulate with other solids to create a blockage although grease interceptors are generally employed by fses to remove fog by gravity separation prior to wastewater discharge to the sewer they are becoming less effective for fog removal this is due to their not successfully removing small 45 µm fog particles the production of which is significantly increasing up to 94 of emulsified fog due to increased use of acidic or alkaline cleaning agents at high temperatures in dishwashers therefore further treatment combined with grease interception is required to remove fog particles of all sizes of the pre treatments discussed in this study bioaugmentation electrocoagulation chemical coagulation and use of surfactants bioaugmentation has the greatest potential to improve the performance of grease interceptors however bioaugmentation performance can be reduced by factors such as lack of proper selection of microbes and inappropriate environmental conditions for microbial reproduction which need to be taken into account when used in practice overall to obtain a pragmatic solution for fog removal some further studies are suggested below ø development of a comprehensive fog deposition mechanism model incorporating solidification and reaction rates for small and colloidal particles to enable detection of possible fog deposition hotspots in sewer systems ø disconnecting dishwashers from fses has the potential to improve the fog removal efficiency of existing gis therefore the impact of disconnecting dishwashers on fog characteristics before and after the gi needs examination ø identification and determination of the concentration of major metal ions in fog wastewater before and after gis and the contribution of metal ions such as na mg2 and fe2 to fog solidification in sewer needs to be explored ø modification of the gi system by the addition of treatment would enable the removal of fog particles of all sizes the application of a suitable chemical coagulant in the gi could enhance the sedimentation process by increasing the size and density of particles of 45 µm diameter and so improve the gravimetric separation of fog declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
15416,treatment of wastewater with high levels of fat oil and grease fog produced by the growing number annually 2 of food service establishments fses is a major concern for water utilities about 30 40 of sewer blockages are caused primarily by the formation of fog deposits in sewer pipes and an annual additional maintenance cost is required for sewer management to manage fog deposition fses are required to recover the fog at the point of generation by installing grease interceptors gis before release to the sewer system the successful control of fog deposition is largely dependent on clear understanding of its complex properties pre treatment processes deposition mechanism and public awareness the objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the physicochemical properties of fog including particle size distribution and their removal efficiencies by existing gis nowadays generation of fog particles of 45 µm is increasing because of the increasing use of automatic dishwashers current hybrid processes which comprise pre treatment prior to gi use are ineffective since they are unable to completely remove particle sizes of 45 µm hence there is potential for these particles to be released into the sewer system and eventually cause blockages this critical review discusses the characteristics of effluents including the particle size distributions generated from automatic dishwashers and handwash sinks it concludes by providing some case studies and a perspective of the future opportunities to develop a novel gi process integrated with pre treatment to remove particles of all sizes including colloidal particles graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fat oil and grease food service establishment grease interceptor particle

kitchens which contains lipids made up of fatty acids triacylglycerols and fat soluble hydrocarbons husain et al 2014 lipids originate from scraps of baked and fried food items gravy dressings margarine butter and cheeses but largely from cooking oil and animal fats lesikar et al 2004 fog lipids are transformed via hydrolysis and saponification usually with calcium to form solids which start to adhere to the top inner surface of sewer pipes keener et al 2008 the growing deposition and solidification of fog may incorporate other suspended solid particles which are flushed down the sewer over time this creates clogging inside the sewer and results in sanitary sewer overflows ssos in australia there was 21 of sewer blockage were caused by fog during 1996 to 2004 marlow et al 2011 later wsaa 2009 reported that the average blockage rate was 44 per 100 km of sewer during 2006 to 2007 however the contribution of fog to these blockage formations was not revealed in the usa despite the potential use and maintenance of gis the fog contribution varies from 350 to 7700 kg year restaurant to approximately 30 million gallons 114 million liters of greasy wastewater disposed into sewers and accounts for 40 50 of sewer blockages keener et al 2008 the proportion of some internationally reported sewer blockages attributable to fog are 50 in ireland gibbons and curran 2015 55 in scotland scottish water 2012 60 in the uk williams et al 2012 60 in hong kong chan et al 2010 and 70 in malaysia hussain et al 2014 some examples of the annual cost of clearing these blockages are 1 2 million in brisbane and four other local councils australia stein and miller 2019 100 million in the uk oakes 2019 and 25 billion in the usa del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 the deposition and detrimental effect of fog mostly depends on its physicochemical properties keener et al 2008 he et al 2017 proposed a three step solution to manage the detrimental effects of fog identification of the sources of the chemical components that are involved in the formation of fog sediments their mechanisms of formation and development of sustainable solutions to alleviate the problem or upgrade existing processes the deposition of fog is influenced by several factors including type of calcium sources and free fatty acids ffas ph and temperature iasmin et al 2014 in particular ph and temperature affect the solubility of the calcium source and so affect the rate of production of saponified solid the color texture and strength of produced solid may vary with the type of calcium source iasmin et al 2014 of the ffas involved palmitic acid is the most prevalent saturated fat consequently the concentration present significantly influences the pace of saponification and solid formation iasmin et al 2016 gis have been used at source for years to prevent the entrance of fog into the sewer system small scale gis can be installed inside the home kitchen and large scale gis can be located outside food service establishments fses and below ground a typical large scale gi is made of concrete usually consists of two compartments a baffle wall and inlet outlet and baffle pipe gravity separation is the primary effective mechanism of any gi and plays a vital role in their design and determining an appropriate hydraulic retention time hrt the efficiency of a gi largely depends on the temperature incoming flow rate particle sizes of fog emulsion strength and retention time ducoste et al 2008 gallimore et al 2011 a particle size of 150 µm or larger can be efficiently removed by the typical gi system through gravity separation wang et al 2007 non emulsified free fog is also easy to separate using the gi system as it floats and clumps on the surface of the wastewater therefore an additional pre treatment measure is required for the efficient removal of small particles colloidal and emulsified fog either via use of a biological agent or a chemical to react with and coagulate the fog so that it falls to the bottom of the separation chamber biological methods such as the addition of commercial microbial supplements and immobilized bacterial populations have demonstrated a range of removal efficiencies brooksbank et al 2007 iasmin et al 2014 nisola et al 2009 tang et al 2012 chemical methods including the use of electrocoagulation ec and surfactants showed promising results for fog pre treatment chen et al 2000 pirooz et al 2018 however removal can be decreased with high influent flows and high emulsion strength gallimore et al 2011 this article highlights some of the scientific understanding associated with fog management strategies such as understanding of the i physical and chemical makeup of fog deposits ii transport modeling and kinetics of fog formation in the sewer system and iii the fundamental science underpinning the removal mechanism of fog using a gi system this review also aims to deliver greater insight into the existing particle size distribution of fog from both dishwasher and handwash sink effluents and their removal trends as well as the treatment technologies therefore the result of this study may contribute to generating a hybrid gi process for future use 2 mechanism of fog solidification in sewers the common fog solidification mechanism in sewers involves producing ffas through the reaction of hydrolysis in which a triglyceride molecule is split into its constituent fatty acids and glycerol along with the accumulation of hydrogen cation and hydroxide anion bruice 2003 some of the ffas react with na and ca2 present in the sewer pipes followed by the saponification process to form saponified solids that result in the accumulation of fog deposits on inner sewer walls he et al 2013 otsuka et al 2020 this proceeds to form larger particles if pre formed deposits or non reacting ffas act as a binder that attract ca2 ions as well as solid particles he et al 2013 the alkaline detergents degreasers or sanitizers used in fses are likely to further promote saponification and deposition rates because these effluents have a relatively high ph ph 10 2 1 formation of fog deposits the mechanism of fog deposit formation involves four mandatory components ca2 ffas fog and water he et al 2013 fog solidification in the sewer starts at the inner upper surface of the sewer pipe he 2012 fog on the wastewater surface is pushed against the inner pipe surface by the wastewater flow and calcium sulfate leached from the concrete sewer may accumulate and stick to the inner walls where un reacted ffas may also be presented iasmin et al 2014 gradually this leads to blocking the pipe and restriction of wastewater flow ssos are eventually caused by excessive accumulation of other suspended solid materials that are disposed to the sewer on and within the fog deposit otsuka et al 2020 the size strength and composition of this fog solid may vary with the characteristics of its source keener et al 2008 conducted a study on field samples and found distinct layers of concentrated fog deposits and debris resulting from their periodic release they also found that the thickness of the layers varied from 0 25 to 0 5 cm and the possible solidification rate was 0 1 cm d on the other hand franke et al 2011 found a high rate approximately 7 cm d of fog formation in a pumping pit this was due to the high rate of incoming fog waste from several farms including residential buildings to the pump station it is likely that the rapid fog accumulation rate in pump stations may lead to higher rates of fog deposition in sewers however no recent study has been found regarding the current trend of solidification rate therefore further study is required to develop a realistic approach to tracking fog deposition rates solid formation is a complex process which includes the transformation of ffas from unsaturated to saturated forms in the sewer williams et al 2012 the proportion of saturated sfa or unsaturated fatty acid ufa may vary depending on the location of the fog solid williams et al 2012 found oleic acid higher than palmitic acid content at pumping stations compared to sewer networks due to the fresher condition of fog in pump stations in the sewer fog wastes age and an in sewer transformation process takes place to transform oleic to palmitic acid williams et al 2012 stated that microbial assemblages are required for the hydrolysis and hydrogenation of oleic to palmitic acid they suggested that enzymes released by anaerobic bacteria in the assemblages may have a significant role in the hydrolysis and hydrogenation of oleic acid c18 1 to form palmitic acid c16 0 later iasmin et al 2014 found a higher concentration of palmitic than oleic acid in the sewer they also suggested that this is possibly because of microbial transformations by anaerobes rhead et al 1971 over time in the sewer system this mechanism of biological transformation was termed beta oxidation by keener et al 2008 however that process does not account for hydrogenation the transformation of oleic to palmitic acid would contribute to increasing the melting point of deposited solid and could cause faster solidification he et al 2013 in a laboratory study gross et al 2017 found that fog deposits with a high level of sfas generated structurally stronger fog deposits whereas ufas produced comparatively weaker deposits this result is inconsistent with the findings of he et al 2013 who noticed that the deposits containing palmitic acid were soft and sticky and oleic acid produced more viscous solids compared to palmitic acid however gross et al 2017 were able to mimic real sewer fog deposits and suggested that greater use of ufas in cooking and preventing sfas from entering the sewer may decrease the strength of the fog deposit which may ultimately reduce ssos the source of ca2 plays a significant role in saponification and deposit formation he et al 2011 stated that deposition does not occur unless ffas form through hydrolysis followed by saponification with ca2 which means oils will not produce a solid if they do not react with ca2 the constituents obtained from fog deposits showed that they were simply fatty acid metal salts resulting from saponification reactions he et al 2011 however other solids were also found which were hypothesized as resulting from aggregation of unreacted ffas and other metals by van der waals attraction and electrostatic repulsion dlvo theory he et al 2011 this hypothesis was later depicted by he et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 extraction with dichloromethane dcm was used to examine the proportions of fatty acids fas and fatty acid salts in fog deposits based on their solubility benecke et al 2017 the fas that are completely soluble in dcm were found to be comparatively dense and tended to settle in contrast fa salts including minerals that are insoluble in dcm had lower density and tended to float and thus were easy to isolate benecke et al 2017 also observed that solids formed from fas are waxy cohesive in nature and act as a glue and so accumulate faster while the solids from fa salts are powdery and non cohesive thus strongly suggesting that the deposition of fa salts contributes to increasing the tensile strength of the deposit the results are consistent with previously reported fog deposit characteristics del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 iasmin et al 2014 the presence of suspended solids ss significantly enhances fog solidification in sewers recently otsuka et al 2020 determined the effects of ss in an artificial sewer system they found that ss were the precursor of fog deposition they emphasized the requirements of mandatory co existence of fa and ss for fog deposition since no blockage was observed in the absence of ss this simulated experimental mechanism was able to mimic the mechanisms developed by he et al 2013 in addition the formation of fog deposits in the absence of ca2 or any metal is possible through a crystallization process gross et al 2017 keener et al 2008 as shown in fig 1 however further detailed study of the fog crystallization process is required to better understand the process of fog settling 2 2 kinetics of fog depositions and identifying hotspots the kinetics of fog solid deposition depend on several factors such as rate of saponification the hydrolysis process the source and type of calcium the source of ffas and the presence of other metal ions and environmental conditions i e solution ph and temperature saponification is the final stage of reaction between ffas and free metal ions mainly ca2 in sewers to form solids the rate of saponification may vary with the type of ffa typically palmitic oleic or linoleic del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 investigated the fog saponification process and properties of produced solids for different ffa sources such as chicken and pork fat olive palm soybean and coconut oils they found that fats and oils with a higher oleic to palmitic acid ratio underwent a greater degree of saponification and produced a larger amount of solids a similar observation was made earlier by he et al 2013 who noted that the amount of solid produced from oleic acid was much higher than from palmitic acid this was possibly because of the higher molecular weight of the ufas oleic 282 and linoleic 280 5 than the sfas palmitic 256 therefore oleic acid is identified as one of the critical influencers in fog formation kinetics thus suggesting that it can be used as a tracer of hotspots where rapid fog deposition may occur notably sewers which are constantly exposed to high levels of fat and oils can lead to fog deposits with high apparent viscosity and consistency index del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 resulting in greater flow resistance in the sewer on the other hand sewers with high levels of calcium can lead to coarse grained deposits which have higher melting points and more resistance to heat because of their lower void area in addition del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 also found chicken and pork fat solids had the highest melting points 57 to 60 c this is due to their long carbon chains of oleic linoleic and palmitic acid on the contrary coconut oil solids had lower melting points 32 to 44 c because it contains a large proportion of lauric acid which has a shorter carbon chain c12 0 i e no double bonds inspite of having double bond solids produced from soybean olive and palm oil which have significant contents of unsaturated c18 fas although palm oil has a significant palmitic content showed a similar high range of melting points 56 to 60 c for the fat like pork and chicken in spite of their high unsaturated fa content this was possible because chicken and pork fat also contains significant proportions of oleic and linoleic acid with palmitic acid determining the rate of hydrolysis the kinetics of saponified solid formation and predicting the spatial formation of fog deposits in municipal sewers are important in preventing ssos ph temperature and palmitic content have significant impact on spatial formations and fog depositions iasmin et al 2016 notably high ph usually 7 leads to rapid saponification the ph may change the solubility of calcium in aqueous solution and therefore change the amount of free ca2 as well as hydroxyl ions to participate fat hydrolysis and the saponification reaction iasmin et al 2014 to have a better understanding iasmin et al 2016 used two different sources of calcium calcium chloride and calcium sulfate with canola oil and beef tallow to produce saponified solids an average of 15 35 and 15 80 of fat underwent a rapid hydrolysis for calcium chloride and calcium sulfate solutions respectively for both fats and at all ph 7 10 and 14 and temperature 22 and 45 c conditions the resultant ffas react with calcium to form saponified solids iasmin et al 2016 a maximum of 60 saponified solid was formed for calcium chloride at high ph 10 and at 45 ⁰c on the other hand the highest percentage of saponified solid 90 was found for calcium sulfate solutions at neutral to alkaline ph 10 and at 45 ⁰c like high ph elevated temperature 45 ⁰c plays a key role in the saponification reaction consistent with most chemical reactions having higher rate at higher temperature the higher temperature would also lead to faster melting of the fat and facilitate its hydrolysis and then participation in the saponification reaction however higher temperature may lead to the discharge of un reacted melted fat into the sewer iasmin et al 2014 hence variation of solution properties and environmental conditions plays a key role in hydrolysis as well as in the saponification process several models have been developed to describe the kinetics of saponified solids and fat crystallization for predicting sewer hotspots for example cotte et al 2006 developed an empirical saponification model and foubert et al 2002 developed a fat crystallization model to predict the kinetics of saponified solid formation their models were able to predict the kinetics of calcium based saponification of fog sediments however these models are limited in that they are unable to predict the rate of fat hydrolysis the fat crystallization model was also unable to predict the rate of solid production under slow saponification conditions therefore a mass action based mechanistic model masm was developed by iasmin et al 2016 for predicting the rate of formation of saponified solids and to track the changes in reactants i e triglyceride ffa and ca2 the masm includes a fundamental process of alkali driven hydrolysis by which ffas are released by hydrolysis of triglyceride followed by saponification eqs 1 and 2 however limitations of the masm model include lower efficiency in quantifying the fog deposits at a specific sewer section and the accumulation of un reacted ffa and ca2 he et al 2017 to overcome the masm model limitations another sewer collection system model was developed by yousefelahiyeh et al 2017 which considered urban landscapes background wastewater flow variations and the number and location of fses to enable prediction of the spots more prone to accumulating fog solids this model can determine the fate and transport of fog sediments and is able to detect around 65 of hotspots however the predictive performance of the model may be affected by pipe faults i e weak joints breaks sags low flow rates or debris intrusion 1 t r i g l y c e r i d e 3 w a t e r k t 3 f r e e f a t t y a c i d f f a g l y c e r o l 2 2 f f a c a 2 k d k s c a f f a 2 where kt reaction rate constant for the hydrolysis of triglyceride l3mol 3h 1 ks reaction rate constant for saponification of ffa and ca2 l2mol 3h 1 kd reaction rate constant for breakdown and or dissolution solid to liquid phase of the saponified solids h 1 the accumulation of fog may also largely depend on the kinetic energy density of incoming flow population income and fse density a generalized linear mixed model glmm developed by nieuwenhuis et al 2018 demonstrated that the location of inlet pipes at a pumping station plays a key role in developing kinetic energy submerged inlet pipes cause a decrease in flow velocity as well as in the kinetic energy on the contrary inlets located over the level of dry weather flow have the potential to increase kinetic energy density which may reduce the fog accumulation in the pump sumps they also showed the probability of fog accumulation increases with decrease in average personal income and fog accumulation is directly proportionally correlated with the number and density of fses nieuwenhuis et al 2018 yousefelahiyeh et al 2017 the glmm is able to track the probability of fog accumulation particularly in pump sumps whereas the previous masm model was able to predict hotspots in sewer networks but was unable to quantify fog at those hotspots therefore developing an advanced model considering detailed physicochemical properties e g fog particle size discussed in section 3 4 hydraulic properties e g geometry of sewer pipes and demographic aspects e g personal diet and cleaning habits is important to obtain greater insight in tracking fog accumulations 2 3 spatial formation and effect of debris accumulation fog deposition is a continuous process of formation and accumulation to form solids increasingly larger in size the process may vary with the hydraulic properties and configurations of the sewer networks which include bends slopes joints deformations manholes and wet wells therefore the network causes dissimilarities in hydraulic conditions as well as spatial deposition within the sewer dominic et al 2013 futhermore weak joints and cracks in old sewer pipes may lead to the intrusion of roots and other debris lu et al 2000 initially intrusion of tree roots was identified as a great influence in spatial deposition desilva et al 2011 ducoste et al 2008 and marlow et al 2011 showed that blockages due to tree root intrusion can be of 75 for some utility areas in australia since then other solids such as disposable face masks wet wipes tampons cotton buds plastics sanitary absorbents grit and dirt have also been found in sewer networks notably around 93 of solids are non biodegradable wet wipes which cause negative impacts on sewer flow by increasing the volume of fog deposits oakes 2019 dominic et al 2013 demonstrated that the greatest solid accumulation can occur in a manhole or near a pipe sag or bend due to the low flow velocity in that section resulting in high retention time solids may appear even in straight pipe sections of an older pipe due to its roughness dominic et al 2013 in a new pipe section fog particles may adhere to the pipe due to the viscous sublayer of flow near the wall which can stay there until deposition caused by friction husain et al 2017 marlow et al 2011 noted that the consequences of climate change such as prolonged droughts or floods as well as illegal discharges into sewers may also be contributing factors other factors such as poor performance of gis the high density of fses and high rise buildings within an area can play a significant role in spatial formation which eventually leads to the formation of fatbergs mattsson et al 2014 enormous deposits of debris congealed with fog are termed fatbergs in australia stein and miller 2019 reported the presence of solid particles which created monstruous fatbergs which eventually caused infrastructural damage as well as deterioration of conveyed water quality it is not only the fact that the intrusion of solid materials causes fatbergs but also that they affect the biophysical and hydraulic properties of sewers for example material composition buoyancy viscosity specific gravity rate of settlement and disintegration may have an impact on the rapid accumulation of fog and blockage creation alda vidal et al 2020 however as a preventive measure kamali et al 2017 suggested a cleaning frequency of 1 6 months for hotspot deposits and 3 5 years for other spots in sewer networks therefore proper management of debris at the source of generation to prevent intrusion change in personal practices and proper sewer maintenance are suggested to improve sewer performance 3 characterization of fog wastes fog can have a wide range of physical and chemical properties depending on the source of generation fog can be either liquid or solid and may have no color odor or taste while in the pure state husain et al 2014 the specific gravity of fog is less than 1 0 and so it can float it has a high viscosity and is insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents firestone 2006 the physicochemical properties of fog as well as their influence on sewer performance are described in the following section 3 1 physical properties of fog the physical appearance texture and yield strength of fog varies with the source of calcium the types of ffas and the impurities incorporated during solidification in sewers iasmin et al 2014 a wide range of moisture content 6 95 has been found in fog samples collected from the field kamali et al 2017 keener et al 2008 williams et al 2012 as shown in table 1 on the other hand gross et al 2017 noted a significantly lower moisture content 0 45 13 4 in synthetic fog samples this was possibly because of the controlled heating and cooling environment in the laboratory during experiments they also reported the significant role of calcium in increasing moisture content this is likely due to the metals i e calcium sodium being able to create pores which can hold water within fog deposits notably there is no evidence of the impact of the level of moisture content on solidification yield strength and melting points are important properties of fog keener et al 2008 found fog solids had a low density 0 66 to 1 23 g cm3 limited open pore content and high yield strength maximum 34 25 kpa gross et al 2017 demonstrated higher yield strength in synthetic fog deposits than in real sewer samples they also found that sfas especially palmitic are more likely to have 2 1 times higher yield strength than ufas due to the presence of the double bonds in ufas which reduce the strength of fog solids williams et al 2012 reported that fog solids with high yield strength and melting points are closely associated with the level of water hardness ca and mg more specifically with calcium contents this finding was later verified by gross et al 2017 who found melting points varied from 15 to 300 ⁰c table 1 demonstrating that crystallization of fatty acids occurs through a deposition mechanism of fog in the presence of high concentrations of calcium ions the yield strength and melting point are important parameters as the cost and effort involved with fog management are related to these parameters hence a pragmatic solution involving introducing an effective gi system is required to reduce the level of fog reaching the sewer and of reducing the yield strength and melting point of that which does 3 2 chemical properties of fog a better understanding of the chemical properties of fog could provide an appropriate insight into sewer clogging control strategy the strength of fog deposits mostly depends on their chemical composition i e their main constituent fas and metals as shown in table 2 the ph values of fog usually vary from moderately acidic to markedly basic with a few exceptions a moderately acidic ph range of 4 1 to 4 7 was detected in gi and household kitchen effluent barton 2012 mohamed et al 2013 this was possibly due to microbial activity on the organic food compounds present in the kitchen wastewater on the other hand effluents collected from the dishwasher and mixed samples dishwasher and hand wash sink produced moderately to very alkaline ph 10 5 to 12 0 wastewater chung and young 2013 gurd et al 2019 which was attributed the use of alkaline cleaning agents therefore control of the types and amounts of cleaning agents is strongly suggested to mitigate the strength of fog the range of bod and cod values was often extremely wide depending on the source of fog effluents chen et al 2000 chung and young 2013 nisola et al 2009 and reflected the presence of soluble organic matter present in fog wastes barton 2012 the level of dissolved oxygen was low which indicated the potential occurrence of anaerobic microbial activity of fog within gis he et al 2012 a wide range of fog concentration was found in different fse samples 5 to 4600 mg l and in many cases these exceeded the desirable limit of 50 to 150 mg l for fse effluent metcalf et al 1991 thus a realistic approach is required to reduce fog concentration to within acceptable limits before disposing the waste to the sewer the concentrations of metal ions differed for each sample table 3 and large differences were observed between samples collected from the sewer and kitchen wastewater for example the big difference in calcium content for sewer and kitchen wastewater was because the major portion of ca2 can be leached from concrete sewers through a microbially induced concrete corrosion process he et al 2013 iasmin et al 2014 much higher values for metals including ca2 were reported in samples collected in the uk williams et al 2012 than in the usa keener et al 2008 this was because the usa south east water samples were naturally very soft compared with those of the uk which is reflected in the calcium concentrations in fog deposits uk 10 940 mg kg and usa 4255 mg l apart from water hardness ca mg and sewer concrete calcium can also come from the human metabolism a person s calcium intake can vary from 1000 to 1500 mg d depending on age peacock 2010 therefore calcium disposal through human faeces and urine excretion can vary from 0 1 to 3 6 and 0 057 to 0 5 gm cap day respectively rose et al 2015 however the contribution of calcium generated from human metabolism in the fog solidification process is yet to be determined thus controlling the total concentration of ca2 is as important as controlling of ffa production to reduce fog solidification inside the sewer kusum et al 2020 introduced fly ash as a replacement for cement to control calcium leaching from the sewer they showed that a maximum reduction of 86 calcium leaching was achieved with 75 fly ash replacement thereby reducing fog solidification in some cases the concentration of na detected was higher than other metals such as k ca mg fe and al eriksson et al 2002 gurd et al 2019 this was possibly due to the extensive use of monosodium glutamate msg as a food additive in daily food products niaz et al 2018 and using high sodium hydroxide contents in detergents and sodium chloride as a softener in hard water areas gurd et al 2019 as the sodium salt of glutamic acid msg contains high proportion of sodium which may release na in the kitchen wastewater therefore it is important to control these less significant metal ions to efficiently reduce fog deposition in sewers 3 3 fatty acid fa profile of fog waste fas are one of the most important components of fog wastes the number of fa types may vary greatly when the gi or sewer system receives a wide range of types and amounts of different fats for example used cooking oil may produce 15 or less of ffas however it can be greater than 15 for restaurant effluents depending on the number of types of food offered and this can eventually reduce the ph of wastewater husain et al 2014 a wide range of short chain fatty acids scfa and long chain fatty acids lcfa are present in fog wastes calcium salts of lcfas have been identified as key components of sewer fog deposits he and yan 2016 found a similar profile of lcfas in the laboratory gi and in real fog deposits table 4 therefore it is required to ensure more effective separation of lcfas in the gi system so that they can be retained and removed from the gi before releasing the wastewater to the sewer and so reduce the formation of fog deposits unsaturated lcfas have greater impact than saturated lcfas on downstream sewer pipelines he et al 2013 he and yan 2016 this is because calcium salts of ufa such as oleic and linoleic acids are more adhesive and soap productive due to their double bonds and this may lead to more corrosion of concrete sewer pipes he et al 2013 therefore further study is required to determine the current trend of lcfa removal from existing gi systems palmitic acid is the most abundant and dominant ffa in terms of concentration in both fse effluents and fog deposits followed by stearic oleic and linoleic acid benecke et al 2017 del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 he et al 2011 keener et al 2008 shin et al 2015 he et al 2011 found an exception in their field samples which showed the concentrations of primary monounsaturated fas were significantly higher 2 to 4 times than those of laboratory samples table 4 this may have occurred due to the extensive use of cooking oil or vegetable oil by the source s of the fog samples later gross et al 2017 were able to mimic the fa compositions for both laboratory and field fog samples furthermore field samples contained 1 16 6 1 of myristic acid benecke et al 2017 gross et al 2017 henriksson et al 2016 montefrio et al 2010 wang et al 2008 and a notable amount of other ffas 6 4 20 2 this complexity of sewer sample compositions due to diversified fog components and their reactions has been noted by gross et al 2017 3 4 fog particle size fog particle size can be influenced by a wide variety of factors such as washing process detergents used by restaurants sanitisers and different types of oil thus influencing the emulsification characteristics of fog and separation efficiency aziz et al 2011 an emulsion is formed when two immiscible liquids are mixed because they are not soluble in each other smaller 20 µm oil droplets are more stable in emulsified form and temperature plays a significant role in the viscosity and interfacial tension and thus affects the adsorption capacity of emulsifier and emulsion stability abdel raouf 2012 particle sizes greater than 150 µm are classified as free oil and have weaker stability these can be separated easily using a gravity separation system within 10 min api 1990 particles with diameter ranges of 20 150 µm are called mechanically emulsified oils have moderate stability and may need several hours for separation emulsions with particles between 1 and 20 µm are defined as chemically emulsified micro emulsions with strong stability and require multiple days for separation or alternatively can be stabilized by surfactants api 1990 bande et al 2008 colloidal particles 1 µm have strong stability and are difficult to remove by a gravity separation process particle size distribution of fog in wastewater in gi influent and effluent has rarely been investigated barton 2012 investigated the median particle diameter d50 for the gi compartments of four fses and obtained a wide range of particle sizes from 4 to 274 µm a narrower particle size range 4 100 µm was noted in both compartments of the gis compared with fse samples 9 274 µm particularly in the second compartment where they ranged over 4 10 µm which demonstrated the easy gravity separation of larger particles in the first compartment through either sedimentation or creaming at the top on investigating particle sizes from different sources of fse effluents barton 2012 found a consistent range of 48 56 µm from a cafeteria mixed range of 9 123 µm from a restaurant and larger particles of 23 274 µm from a dining hall this wide range of diameter may represent the heterogeneity of source samples they also noted that comparatively smaller 4 10 µm particles remained in a cafeteria effluent even after passing though the gi however they did not differentiate whether the different particle sizes came from hand wash sinks or automatic dishwashers in a recent study gurd et al 2019 examined particle sizes from dishwasher and handwash sinks separately and showed an average particle diameter of 18 µm and 27 µm respectively table 5 it can be concluded that automatic dishwashers are more likely to produce smaller particles than those from handwash sinks this is attributed to the mechanical agitation of the wash water and the use of cleaning agents over an hour or so at elevated temperature being likely to produce more stable and smaller particles gurd et al 2019 concluded that an average of 94 and 76 of emulsified fog with particle size less than 45 µm was produced from dishwashers and handwash sinks respectively it is therefore suggested that separation by gravity requires enhancement possibly by additional treatment barton 2012 also indicated particles 20 µm may not fall into the gravity separating zone however to date no study has measured the fraction of colloidal 1 µm and suspended particles along with their fate and transport mechanism according to api 1990 these particles are potentially hard to settle in conventional gi systems and require additional treatment apart from fog particle sizes other properties including fog concentration table 5 and the amount of free oil and emulsified oil may vary with the respective cleaning modes the range of fog concentration in dishwasher effluents was 89 850 mg l gurd et al 2019 which aligns with the findings of chung and young 2013 and were considerably lower than those for handwash sinks which were 253 1067 mg l in addition gurd et al 2019 discriminated between the free and emulsified fraction of fog they showed that the concentration of emulsified fog had nearly the same values of 291 and 309 mg l for dishwasher and sink effluent respectively however the concentration of free oil was significantly higher 570 mg l in sink samples than in dishwasher samples 22 mg l a narrow range of high ph values 10 5 11 8 was detected for dishwasher effluents chung and young 2013 gurd et al 2019 therefore more study is required to verify the amount of free and emulsified fog fractions that are produced nowadays and their impacts on fog solidification the number of fses are growing approximately 2 per year with the increasing population growth aaron allen and associates 2018 additionally the use of automated appliances is rapidly increasing in both households and fses due to the technological advancement however dishwashers may strongly influence on fog characteristics as well as the efficiency of gis this is because they are more likely producing chemically emulsified or colloidal particles and thus discharge a high volume of fog particles of less than 45 µm diameter to the sewer system therefore it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive study of existing gi systems to understand the effective removal of particles of all sizes in particular the removal of particles of 45 µm and colloidal particles needs to be examined otherwise these particles may pose serious threats to sewer networks if not removed effectively before entering the sewer 4 treatment of fog gi systems are commonly used for the treatment of fog this allows the accumulation of fog sludge at the surface and settling of the large fog particles along with food solids at the bottom fig 2 the sludge and food solids are then removed from the gi and clarified water is disposed to the sewer pre treatment can enhance the efficiency of gravity separation in gis a range of pre treatments such as bioaugmentation chemical coagulation cc and electrocoagulation ec has been implemented to improve gi performance by removing fog from fse wastewater before entering the sewer system the treatment and pre treatment processes are discussed in the following sections 4 1 gi process passive or internal flow based gis and external retention based gis are known as fgis and rgis respectively gallimore et al 2011 due to the variability of influent characteristics and flow rate gis usually experience extremely dynamic intermittent flow conditions which may sometimes include short circuiting inside the gi regardless of its size or hrt aziz et al 2011 evaluated the effectiveness of a precast concrete gi with two different hrts 20 and 60 min for removing fog from fse wastewater they found that the maximum removal of fog was 90 at 60 min hrt this aligns with the suggestion given by chu and ng 2000 who stated that 30 min or greater hrt is required for effective fog removal gallimore et al 2011 compared the performance of fgis and rgis at three different emulsion strengths weak medium and strong they reported approximately 80 of fog removal for the rgi which was significantly higher than for the fgi 50 under all laboratory conditions one exception was approximately 82 removal of fog with weak emulsion strength for the fgi this was likely due to the production of large fog particles by the relatively weak agitation process another contradictory result was obtained by moore and dang 2009 who observed a maximum of 30 7 removal efficiency of a field gi with an average wastewater temperature of 30 ⁰c indicating that the gravity separation process may not work properly if not designed and maintained properly to improve the removal performance aziz et al 2012 suggested the use of a distributive inlet and two compartment gi system gallimore et al 2011 reported that gi performance is greatly influenced by the temperature and emulsion strength of the wastewater as fog particle size decreases with rising temperature and emulsion strength this is the possible reason for the increased breakdown of fog particles into smaller colloidal particles thus reducing the fog removal efficiency they used two one and no static mixers to produce strong medium strength and weak emulsions respectively they found that the removal efficiency and average particle size dropped from 38 to 8 and 289 to 151 µm respectively when the emulsion strength varied from weak to strong overall removal efficiency decreased by 10 on increasing the temperature from 21 ⁰c to 38 ⁰c for all the conditions therefore the control of temperature and the optimization of emulsion strength are required to achieve highest removal performance multi compartmented gis can be used for efficient removal of fog al gheethi 2019 improved the gravity separation process by using a multi compartment trap consisting of a screen a primary and a secondary sedimentation tank a fog separation chamber and a hair filter the hair filter acted as an adsorbent filter medium and was attached before the effluent discharge point to trap the remaining trace components of fog the optimum removal efficiency was 93 suggesting the multi compartment gi was an efficient and reliable gi system which did not require any pre treatment al gheethi 2019 this was possibly due to long residence time in the multiple compartments however the fog concentration at the discharge point was 50 mg l and did not meet the standard of 10 mg l required by the malaysian environmental act 1974 it is therefore necessary to consider the wide variability of influent and effluent characteristics sizing and internal configuration particle size distribution type of food solid rate of accumulation of food solid and residence time when upgrading the design of gis 4 2 effects of pre treatment process for improving gi performance various pre treatment processes have been applied to improve the fog removal efficiency from fse and household kitchen wastewater the commonly used method is bioaugmentation which refers to the introduction of suitable microbial additives that are potentially capable of degrading fog in the wastewater some other methods including ec cc use of tube settlers and surfactants have also been shown to increase removal efficiency 4 2 1 bioaugmentation bioaugmentation is the most widely studied method of treating fog biologically and is used as a baseline to verify the effectiveness of adding other external products the process includes breaking down the lipids eventually to fas and glycerol by the activity of specific enzymes called lipases lipases catalyze the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols to diacylglycerols monoacylglycerols glycerol and fas under suitable conditions sharma et al 2001 the change in waste characteristics due to the addition of external microorganisms depends on the species used the characteristics of the specific gi and food wastes and some unidentified factors he et al 2012 they reported that bacillus spp showed inconsistent results for fog removal for individual and combined restaurant and community home kitchen gi wastewater addition of these bacteria significantly lowered the fog depth for individual restaurant gi samples but made no contribution to lowering fog depth for combined gi samples this was possibly due to the inclusion of greywater from bathroom and laundries which contains detergent degreaser or softener this may increase the ph of wastewater and thus inhibit the reproduction and activity of bacteria to contribute to lowering fog depth he and yan 2016 observed that microbial products are capable of producing five times greater lcfa within gis this higher production of lcfa in the gi could lead to the release of less lcfa to the sewer system by retaining them in the gi as a result the rate of saponification would be lower and thus fog solids production would be lower a further study conducted by he et al 2016 found that the residence time of the biological product has a significant influence on fog removal the sudden entrance of a large volume of wastewater may cause shortening of the time of exposure to the microorganisms and also may lead to flushing them out of the gi and so becoming less effective in the gi system the inflow rate to the gi and dose of added microorganisms are important parameters in the effectiveness of bioaugmentation for fog removal nisola et al 2009 used immobilized bacteria in the gi and showed no significant change in fog removal when the inflow concentration was 1000 mg l in contrast the highest fog removal of 97 99 occurred when the influent was 5000 mg l and remained effective up to 10 000 mg l where the immobilized bacteria led to 93 removal brooksbank et al 2007 showed substantial fog degradation of 37 62 using a recommended dose of a multi species supplement named f69 which includes bacillus spp pseudomonas spp lactobacillus sporogenes and micrococcus sp fan 2014 observed the fog removal efficiency of a commercial biological product containing surfactants enzymes colorants and bacillus spp with respect to increasing temperature and product concentration he reported 18 additional fog removal when the temperature was increased from 15 to 32 c and suggested that 30 c is beneficial for bacterial metabolism and lipase activity this is comparable with the range of temperature 28 to 60 c at which bacillus spp remains competent gupta et al 2004 on the other hand a drastic increase in bacteria concentration from 0 12 to 120 mg l showed only 5 6 increase in fog removal fan 2014 which indicated that microbes have optimal range of reproduction for a certain dose of bacteria concentration further study is required to optimize the microbe concentration to be more effective for the specific commercial microbial products recently single species mixed double species and commercial multiple species additives were compared to investigate the efficacy of different microbial species for the different fat types it was found that bacteria from a single genus bacillus spp were able to degrade fat from olive oil ufa but not from butter sfa the addition of pseudomonas putida strain cp1 to the bacillus showed 94 and 97 of fat removal from olive oil and butter respectively after 13 days of incubation tzirita et al 2019 it was shown that bacillus spp were only able to hydrolyze the fat and the breakdown products were later metabolized by the ps putida cp1 which preferentially utilized the unsaturated fas thus the addition of pseudomonas sp greatly contributed to the removal of saturated and unsaturated fat tzirita et al 2021 investigated the effectiveness of three different commercial biological products bfl gnz and ff with respect to two different nutrient n p ratios 1 5 and 12 2 bfl and gnz were in powder and liquid forms respectively both contained mostly bacillus species ff was in tablet form containing ps putida aeromonas hydrophila a fungus mucor circinelloides van tieghem and bacillus species among the three bioaugmentation products ff showed highest degradability for both sfas and ufas followed by bfl and gnz showed no degradation of any fat ff showed 92 and 94 degradation for ufas and sfas respectively in enriched n p 12 2 medium bfl showed no degradation of sfas however bfl was able to remove 94 ufas when the enriched n p 12 2 ratio was used therefore it is obvious that saturated fats are a greater challenge for the bioaugmentation products and the presence of nutrient sources greatly affects their biodegradability performance tzirita et al 2018 2021 they also found that bacillus spp have the highest lipolytic activity and produce a wide range of hydrolytic enzymes which is important for the biodegradation of fog hence this suggests that the selection of microbes with appropriate enzyme activity to hydrolyse the ufas and sfas and the resultant products providing an appropriate nutrient n and p level and ratio ph and temperature to promote microbial reproduction and enzyme activity need to be taken into consideration when selecting biological products for treatment 4 2 2 coagulation the chemical treatment process of coagulation has been widely used in water and wastewater treatment it involves destabilization of lighter suspended dissolved or colloidal particles to generate larger flocs followed by their agglomeration which then settle by gravity nowadays ec an electrochemical process of using electrical charge to produce flocs is a widely used method for removing oil and grease from wastewater tahreen et al 2020 chen et al 2000 showed a maximum of 94 fog removal using an electrochemical reactor this high removal of oil and grease was possible because of high charge loading of the reactor up to 9 95 f m3 despite its theoretically high removal capability there is limited practical application of ec for treating fse wastewater this is due to the effectiveness of ec being decreased by the significant amount of dissolved organic compounds in real field samples chen et al 2000 recently changmai et al 2019 obtained 71 removal of oil and grease from oily wastewater from a drilling site and priya and jeyanthi 2019 showed 92 5 removal from automobile wash effluents using the ec process a combined ec flocculation method showed removals of 84 cod and 95 tss from urban wastewater elazzouzi et al 2017 however elazzouzi et al did not determine fog removal by the ec flocculation method and no recent study has been found on fog removal from fses using the ec process it is suggested that further study be conducted on treating water containing animal fat or vegetable oil beef tallow chicken fat or canola oil with ec or ec membrane technology integrated with a gi system surfactants are used to increase the surface area of particles and to destabilize their ability to float pirooz et al 2018 investigated fog removal by adding surfactants such as monoethyl amine sulfonated lauryl alcohol and nonylphenol ethoxylate table 6 they obtained 80 fog removal by optimizing the concentration of these surfactants to be 12 5 this removal rate is far better than that obtained in the study conducted by livingston et al 2007 who got 32 removal of fog by combined dosing of bacteria bacillus spp and surfactants they used 1 2 anionic and 2 2 nonionic surfactants in addition to bacterial addition the lower fog removal was possibly due to using too low a concentration of surfactants livingston et al 2007 did not differentiate between the contribution of bacteria and surfactants to the removal instead they argued that no negative influence was observed in wastewater quality due to adding surfactants 4 3 ozonation ozone is recognized as a strong oxidant disinfectant and decontamination agent ozone is also used to control and eliminate microorganisms in food products and from water and wastewater rodríguez et al 2008 ozonation for the treatment of fog and reducing solidification of fog wastes has rarely been investigated kishimoto et al 2018 noted that inclusion of ozonated water helped to prevent fog solidification in drainpipes however the efficiency of removing unsaturated or complex fats was not investigated more recently khalifa et al 2021 developed a hybrid ec reactor consisting of a ceramic microfiltration membrane to treat oily wastewater collected from an oil and gas field they demonstrated a significant increase in cod removal from 17 to 53 due to the addition of ozone to the reactor in other words the enhancement of the ec process was due to introduction of ozone for providing more oxidative power which consequently increased the membrane performance by improving the size exclusion process as a result the reactor was covered with high intensity flocs and a more viscous solution was formed to aid size exclusion by the membrane following this process the ceramic membrane was able to retain more cod to increase removal efficiency which was attributed to the increase in oxidation and mineralization of organics in the reactor it was suggested that further studies are required for optimization and modification of reactor design through studying the solubility and residence time of ozone in oily wastewater khalifa et al 2021 under laboratory conditions various treatment processes showed a wide range of fog removal efficiencies table 6 however in real field applications there can be some deficiencies as the composition of real fog is complex unpredictable and highly variable hence future study is required to understand the performance of ozonation ec with membrane technology surfactants and cc for removal of fog along with other contaminants 4 4 case studies fog management and awareness campaigns have been conducted by local city water authorities the use of commercial gis or pre treatment processes cannot solve the problem alone therefore a strict management policy and legislation with a regulatory and monitoring body public awareness standardization of gi design and maintenance frequency may significantly reduce the detrimental effects of fog case studies from various countries taking part in fog management are discussed below 4 5 usa the cease the grease program was operated by dallas water utilities in 2005 to reduce fog associated blockages gis were installed in addition to identifying hotspots and running an educational program approximately 96 blockage reduction was noted over five years of the cease the grease program and 13 5 million gallons of grease trap waste was recovered which potentially could save around 1 3 million per year dwu 2013 the best way of dealing with the collected grease trap waste was as feedstock for anaerobic co digestion currently dallas water utilities proactively educate people through their defend your drain website to save residences businesses shops and surrounding environment from the detrimental effects of ssos california s put a lid on it campaign was led by a fog work group calfog to decrease the ssos caused by fog deposition tupper and skoda 2008 the campaign involved educating the community in addition to plumbers and plumbing associations in many ways by informing the public about fog associated problems during blockage clearing or overflows in their premises a survey showed public awareness increased by 19 after this campaign harris 2009 needless to say education and outreach campaigns are necessary to endorse fog preventive measures wallace et al 2017 4 6 united kingdom in the uk fatbergs are still threatening the sewer systems despite initiating strict management policies and the application of treatment measures the formation of fatbergs caused by fog deposition continued thames water 2013 mills 2010 initiated a campaign named stop and think not down the sink and distributed a do s and don ts card as a result of the campaign householders prevented 3000 tons of fog from entering the sewer in one year installation of gi in addition to the campaign program resulted no fog related blockage in the town of stourport during the six months of the campaign mills 2010 this was due to removing 40 liters of fog waste from each gi every two weeks which eventually contributed to lessening the number of blockages in 2017 the largest blockage of 250 m length was found in whitechapel in east london of all the solid particles found in sewer blockages about 93 were wet wipes which raised concern about what people are really flushing down the toilet oakes 2019 a survey conducted on 103 restaurants in the uk showed that 70 of the restaurants had inefficient grease management systems oakes 2019 to improve this thames water launched an awareness campaign bin it don t block it to educate people on how not to contribute to fatberg formation the campaign encouraged people to store used cooking oil in a container to put in a bin rather than pour it down the sink they also advised them not to flush more than the three ps namely pee poo and toilet paper additionally the uk water utilities launched a fine to flush label for products that could be flushed water 2019 as a result of this program the number of sewer blockages gradually went down from 85 000 to 75 000 per year however it still remains an immense problem oakes 2019 4 7 australia in 1995 solidified fat was recognized by south east water as one of the key causes of sewer spills in the south east region of melbourne south east water introduced a three phase program called greasy waste to control the level of fog disposal and so reduce sewer blockages scoble and day 2002 the program included a trade waste agreement for fog disposal installation of adequately sized gi and maintaining appropriate cleaning frequency of gi eventually by 2001 south east water had enabled a 50 reduction in sewer blockages because of the program alam 2003 recently queensland urban utilities quu recorded 360 blockages in sewers due to fatbergs in the greater brisbane area stein and miller 2019 the largest fatberg was 7 m long and 60 cm wide another 80 m long pipe was seen partially occupied by a fatberg in brisbane these incidents clearly suggest that fog is a growing problem in australia quu announced a public awareness strategy titled think at the sink and suggested that people pour fat oil and food scraps into the bin instead of washing them down the sink to reduce household plumbing costs stein and miller 2019 they emphasized a few management practices for kitchen wastes in place of flushing them down the sink these included cooling of fats wiping fat from pans using paper towels as well as putting food scraps tea leaves coffee grinds and used cooking oil into a bin people were also encouraged not to use harsh chemicals and to reduce the volume of detergents moreover quu noticed that the presence of so called flushable wipes in the sewers causes severe blockage problems 4 8 ireland sewer blockages are under control in dublin city ireland the city council has been implementing a fog prevention program for controlling fog at the source since 2008 the program includes trade licences for effluent discharge installation of appropriately sized grease traps and their proper maintenance as a result the number of blockages dropped from 1000 to 50 per year and the program has significantly prevented major blockages in this city curran 2015 under dublin s fog program over 2000 inspections were performed from 2008 to 2014 preventing the entry of 200 103 liters of fog to the sewer networks in 2014 gibbons and curran 2015 the collected grease trap waste was categorized into three grades i grade 1 containing fog layers recovered from automatic grease traps ii grade 2 waste collected from passive flow gravity separation systems and iii grade 3 the remaining wastes from both wallace et al 2016 the majority of grade 1 grease trap waste has been used as feedstock for biodiesel production and the waste from grade 2 has been used in anaerobic co digestion to date dublin s fog program has been extremely effective and successful in achieving control over fog related ssos wallace et al 2017 5 perspectives fog is considered to be accountable for 50 70 of sewer blockages around the world being strategically successful in controlling sewer blockages is not only dependent on efficient fog removal with properly designed gi systems pre treatment and sewer modification but also on regulation systematic management and particularly on public awareness and involvement both the physical and chemical properties of fog need to be clearly understood fog droplet sizes may have a significant impact on the performance of gis because dishwashers are now commonly used by fses and household kitchens they use several detergents degreasers and softeners which have a strong potential to produce particles less than 45 µm gurd et al 2019 which are implicated in increasing the proportion of emulsified fog a limited number of studies have focused on the detailed physicochemical characteristics and impacts of the different particle sizes of fog most of the previous studies have shown biological pre treatment integrated with a gi system can effectively remove fog at the source of generation however there is concern about the effectiveness of the available pre treatment methods in practice since the problem associated with fog solidification is growing with time it can be said that the existing fog removal methods are not very effective therefore further study is required to efficiently eliminate the particle sizes of 45 µm including colloidal particles it is proposed that advanced approaches such as coagulation based technology integrated with gi be investigated the system could include a dual chambered gi with a mixer in the second compartment to ensure proper agitation of coagulation agent the efficacy of this system could be compared with ec membrane technology since the latter technology led to high removal of oily flocs from oily wastewater changmai et al 2019 prevention of fog entering the sewer and solidifying is not only dependent on technological aspects but also on management practices water utilities may be able to identify the locations that are more prone to fog deposition and debris accumulation by the use of models models have the potential to recognize hotspots and can be adjusted to changing conditions in the urban landscape research is also required to further develop models which take hydraulic and demographic parameters of sewer networks into account finally successful fog control could also be achieved by changing household practices of food waste disposal waste classification proper labeling of flushable and non flushable materials changes in food preparation habits and educating people at an early age a community campaign can also help the community to realize that the release of every single drop of fog to the sewer or flushing of non biodegradable solids matters 6 conclusions and recommendations fog is a major factor influencing deteriorating sewer performance this paper explains how the fog particles in wastewater disposed to the sewer can react with metal ions especially with calcium to solidify and accumulate with other solids to create a blockage although grease interceptors are generally employed by fses to remove fog by gravity separation prior to wastewater discharge to the sewer they are becoming less effective for fog removal this is due to their not successfully removing small 45 µm fog particles the production of which is significantly increasing up to 94 of emulsified fog due to increased use of acidic or alkaline cleaning agents at high temperatures in dishwashers therefore further treatment combined with grease interception is required to remove fog particles of all sizes of the pre treatments discussed in this study bioaugmentation electrocoagulation chemical coagulation and use of surfactants bioaugmentation has the greatest potential to improve the performance of grease interceptors however bioaugmentation performance can be reduced by factors such as lack of proper selection of microbes and inappropriate environmental conditions for microbial reproduction which need to be taken into account when used in practice overall to obtain a pragmatic solution for fog removal some further studies are suggested below ø development of a comprehensive fog deposition mechanism model incorporating solidification and reaction rates for small and colloidal particles to enable detection of possible fog deposition hotspots in sewer systems ø disconnecting dishwashers from fses has the potential to improve the fog removal efficiency of existing gis therefore the impact of disconnecting dishwashers on fog characteristics before and after the gi needs examination ø identification and determination of the concentration of major metal ions in fog wastewater before and after gis and the contribution of metal ions such as na mg2 and fe2 to fog solidification in sewer needs to be explored ø modification of the gi system by the addition of treatment would enable the removal of fog particles of all sizes the application of a suitable chemical coagulant in the gi could enhance the sedimentation process by increasing the size and density of particles of 45 µm diameter and so improve the gravimetric separation of fog declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
15417,the efficient and harmless treatment of hypersaline organic wastes has become an urgent environmental problem compared to traditional thermochemical methods supercritical water oxidation has been proven to be an efficient organic waste treatment technology due to the advantages of low cost high degradation rate no secondary pollutants etc however the solubilities of inorganic salts drop rapidly near the critical point of water and some sticky salts form easily agglomerates and then adhere to internal surfaces of reactor and pipeline causing plugging and inhibition of heat transfer hence the characteristics mechanisms and measurement methods of the dissolution and deposition of inorganic salts in sub supercritical water are summarized and analyzed systematically and comprehensively in this work intending to provide a valuable guide for salt deposition prevention and subsequent research directions firstly a new classification form of inorganic salt is put forward based on melting point the phase equilibriums of brine systems are then analyzed in detail six theories concerning dissolution mechanisms are discussed deeply and various measurement methods of salt solubility are also supplemented furthermore salt deposition characteristics and related measurement technologies are summarized notably a new idea hydrothermal molten salt system is reviewed which may provide a solution for salt deposition in sub supercritical water finally an outlook for the follow up researches is prospected and some suggestions are proposed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sub supercritical water phase behavior of inorganic salt solubility salt deposition measurement method hydrothermal molten salt data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction currently high concentration refractory organic wastewater municipal sewage sludge and toxic and radioactive organic waste are considerable environmental management issues hodes et al 2004a wang and wang 2007 xu et al 2021 traditional thermochemical methods are not applicable due to the defects of high cost low degradation rate and easy derivation of secondary pollutants fortunately supercritical water oxidation scwo a new technology developed in recent years can degrade them efficiently and environmentally friendly voisin et al 2017a scwo refers to that in supercritical water scw t 374 15 c p 22 1 mpa organic compounds are converted completely into co2 h2o n2 and other harmless small molecules which contains many superiorities in degrading organic waste compared to other technologies savage 2000 yang et al 2022a compared to normal water scw has both liquid like dissolution and gas like transport properties li et al 2019 yang et al 2020 and can dissolve organic compounds and gasses such as co2 n2 o2 etc to form a homogeneous mixture without mass transfer resistance xu et al 2015 thus easily achieving a degradation rate of 99 99 in tens of seconds bermejo and cocero 2006 brunner 2009b it enables autothermal during scwo process voisin et al 2017a in addition the secondary pollutants e g so2 nox dioxin fumes ashes etc generated are negligible as temperature is kept low and the reaction system is completely enclosed vadillo et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 hence energy and environment one of the six major areas of national key technology in the united states points out that scwo is one of the most promising organic waste treatment technologies in the 21st century zhang et al 2021 at ambient temperature and pressure liquid water is a strongly polar solvent a very good solvent for inorganic compounds e g inorganic salts but a poor one for organics however the properties of water change markedly near its critical point in particular the dielectric constant and ion dissociation constant drop dramatically kritzer 2004 as shown in fig 1 this makes the polarity of scw as low as that of non polar solvents so scw easily dissolves organic compounds non polar substances but has the disadvantage of inorganic salt precipitation polar substances armellini and tester 1993 bischoff and pitzer 1989 dipippo et al 1999 kritzer and dinjus 2001 wei et al 2021 then the agglomerates formed of viscous precipitated salts e g na2so4 and na2co3 adhere to the inner surfaces of reactor and pipeline thus deteriorating heat transfer príkopský et al 2007 meanwhile a dead zone microenvironment may be formed resulting in a synergistic effect on reactor corrosion marrone and hong 2009 more seriously it may increase pressure drop plug reactor and pipeline and even cause equipment shutdown marrone 2013 the salt deposition is a very noteworthy problem as it may reduce the safety and economics of equipment operation in addition salts can also foul or poison the catalysts in catalytic supercritical water gasification process scwg reimer and vogel 2013 overall an efficient removal of inorganic salts from feed stream is crucial to the successful operation of scwo and scwg plants certainly the deposition problem of inorganic salts can also be converted into a superiority in practical applications such as recovery of nutrients potassium and phosphorus as fertilizers reimer and vogel 2013 supercritical water desalination of seawater odu et al 2015 synthesis of nanomaterials leybros et al 2012 liu et al 2022 etc over the past few decades great efforts have been devoted to mitigating or eliminating these adverse effects on the commercial application of scwo with great success there exist some experimental and review papers concerning scwo process brunner 2009a jiang et al 2020 tang et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 phase equilibrium in brine systems armellini et al 1994 dipippo et al 1999 hodes et al 2004b valyashko 2004 characteristics and mechanisms of dissolution masoodiyeh et al 2014 škerget et al 2011 voisin et al 2019 2017a and deposition hodes et al 2004b xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 2019 of inorganic salts measurement methods of salt solubility voisin et al 2017a zhang et al 2020 and deposition zhang et al 2020 2019 and technologies for prevention and control of salt deposition hodes et al 2004b marrone et al 2004 xu et al 2015 2010 zhang et al 2019 these investigations can provide a guidance for the follow up studies on salt dissolution and deposition in the scwo process however to the best of our knowledge a comprehensive and in depth summary and analysis of the dissolution and deposition characteristics of inorganic salts is still lacking there are also not detailed summaries of the existing dissolution and deposition theories and the interaction of inorganic salts in ternary brine systems in addition with the scwo technology developing rapidly some new measurement technologies and ideas for inhibiting salt deposition have emerged which also requires to further summarize duverger nédellec et al 2020 reimer and vogel 2016 voisin et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 hence the propose of this work is to systematically summarize and update the research status of salt dissolution and deposition in the scwo process particularly a new idea hydrothermal molten salt system is reviewed which may provide a solution for salt deposition in sub supercritical water these findings have important implications for guiding the study of salt deposition in the scwo process 2 salt classifications and phase equilibriums of brine systems 2 1 classifications of inorganic salts the type and phase behavior must be clearly understood and accurately grasped to study the dissolution and deposition characteristics of inorganic salts marshall 1975 has classified most inorganic salts into type 1 and 2 salts based on their solubilities under sub supercritical hydrothermal conditions indicating that the former is more soluble than the latter valyashko 2004 has classified including type 1 and 2 salts according to the behavioral trends which fully fits marshall s classification hodes et al 2004b moreover it is found that the dissolution behaviors of these two salts seem to be roughly correlated to their melting temperatures valyashko 2004 currently most inorganic salts are classified according to the above two criteria it is worth noting that voisin et al 2020 and zhang et al 2021 recently propose a hydrothermal molten salt system consisting of immiscible molten salts and sub supercritical water expressing that the salts with low melting point can dissolve the ones with high melting point thereby avoiding salt deposition during scwo see section 5 therefore the authors subdivide inorganic salts in more detail based on melting points as shown in fig 2 in fig 2 these salts highlighted in yellow are type 2 classified by marshall 1975 and these ones highlighted in both yellow and blue are type 2 divided by valyashko 2004 the melting temperatures of some uncommon salts such as napo3 kbo2 k2b4o7 hg cn 2 cd clo4 2 and kliso4 except for kliso4 others are type 1 salts are unknown so they are not listed in fig 2 in addition na2si2o5 kliso4 caco3 srbr2 srso4 bacl2 baso4 cdso4 mgso4 and coso4 are classified as type 2 salt yang et al 2022b and the melting temperatures of the other salts are obviously higher than 600 c except for coso4 therefore all type 2 salts belong to the salts with high melting point 600 c except for coso4 and na3po4 374 c the new classification based on melting temperature is agreed with the above two ones it can also be found that the melting points of most sulfate and carbonate salts are 800 c whereas 600 c for most nitrate and phosphate salts which may provide a guidance for follow up studies on hydrothermal molten salt system 2 2 phase equilibriums of binary and ternary brine systems so far there have been many investigations concerning the phase equilibrium relationship armellini 1993 dohrn et al 2012 hodes et al 2004b marshall 1975 ravich and borovaya 1964 valyashko 1973 2002 2004 2010 of brine systems especially the binary systems nacl h2o and na2so4 h2o and the ternary system nacl na2so4 h2o which distinctly and thoroughly exhibit the phase transition processes and laws of these brine systems along with temperature and pressure a clear understanding of the phase behaviors and diagrams of brine systems helps to more accurately master the characteristics and mechanisms of dissolution and deposition thereby preventing salt deposition during scwo process hence the features of phase diagrams regarding nacl h2o na2so4 h2o and nacl na2so4 h2o and the corresponding investigations have been summarized in this section 2 2 1 binary nacl h2o and na2so4 h2o systems fig 3 displays the features of p t x p pressure t temperature x composition diagram of binary salt h2o systems armellini 1993 dohrn et al 2012 hodes et al 2004b valyashko 2004 binary salt h2o systems are divided into type 1 and type 2 salts based on whether they exhibit critical behavior in saturated solutions morey 1957 type 1 salts do not exhibit critical behavior thus having a continuous solidus solid liquid vapor or s l v starting at the eutectic point of mixture and ending at the triple point of salt e g halides and nitrates type 1 salts includes type 1a and type 1b the critical curve of type 1a salt is continuous but that of type 1b salt is interrupted by intersection with l l v liquid liquid vapor curve conversely type 2 salts exhibit critical behavior with lower solubility than type 1 salts with discontinuous s l v curve e g sulfates carbonates and silicates type 2 salts contain type 2a and type 2b and the critical curve of type 2a is interrupted by solid precipitation while that of type 2b is broken by l l v curve or solid precipitation nacl h2o is one of the most typical type 1a binary salt h2o systems fig 4 shows the t x projections of binary p t x diagrams of nacl h2o hodes et al 2004b and na2so4 h2o hodes et al 2004b ravich and borovaya 1964 at 25 mpa along with the experimental data from literature voisin et al 2019 as shown in fig 4 a in the subcritical range of 374 15 c the solubility of nacl increases with temperature increasing there is a v l diphasic domain at 374 15 450 c which means that two phases first form instead of a solid precipitation after exceeding the critical point the v phase is a low density water phase with a low salt concentration and the l phase is a high density brine with a higher one voisin et al 2019 as the temperature increases the content of salt in the v phase reduces whereas increases in the l phase but also less dense it forms a v l equilibrium phase until the l phase disappeared at 450 c nacl immediately crystallizes and precipitates through homogeneous nucleation see section 4 1 zhang et al 2020 after exceeding 450 c thereby forming a v s phase v refers to scw armellini and teste 1991 as shown in fig 4 b the experimental data from many literatures are in good agreement with it moreover zhang et al 2021 records the phase transition of 1 wt nacl solution during temperature and pressure rising to 500 c and 25 mpa through a visual static experiment and strongly confirms the above phase transition process notably voisin et al 2019 reveals for the first time that a v l diphasic limit first exists between 390 c and about 415 420 c then the first nacl crystal appears at 420 c owing to a marked change in the v l phase proportions resulting in the existence of a triphasic domain at 420 450 c as shown by the red dotted line in fig 4 b zhang et al zhang et al 2021 speculates that it may be caused by continuous flow but it still required to be confirmed further in subsequent study na2so4 h2o is one of the most typical type 2b binary salt h2o systems as shown in fig 4 c with temperature raising in the subcritical range of 374 15 c its solubility firstly increases 0 40 c then remains at around 35 wt 40 220 c yet much lower than that of nacl and then reduces sharply 220 374 15 c to a negligible value approaching the critical point it crystallizes and precipitates by heterogeneous nucleation see section 4 1 once the salt concentration exceeds solubility zhang et al 2020 unlike nacl h2o system there exist two intersections p h2o rich s l v critical end point located near the critical point of pure water q na2so4 rich s l v critical end point located at about 400 c 114 mpa of solubility and critical curves resulting in a precipitation behavior under subcritical conditions without v l diphasic domain and 3 phase equilibrium voisin et al 2017a hence the saturated fluid continuously transforms from l to v phase with temperature raising 2 2 2 ternary nacl na2so4 h2o system according to the classification of binary salt h2o systems the ternary salt salt h2o systems can be divided into various types khan and rogak 2004 valyashko 1971 for example type 1a 1a ternary system consists of two type 1a salts and type 1a 2b ternary system contains type 1a and type 2b salts similarly the other combinations are also available specifically including type 1a 1a type 1b 1b type 1a 1b type 2a 2a type 2b 2b type 2a 2b type 1a 2a type 1a 2b type 1b 2a type 1b 2b hegde and hicks 2012 khan and rogak 2004 valyashko 1973 valyashko et al 2000 the ternary salt salt h2o systems e g typical nacl na2so4 h2o system armellini et al 1994 hodes et al 2004b urusova and valyashko 2017 zhang et al 2020 and the corresponding phase diagrams have been investigated by armellini et al 1994 dipippo et al 1999 and valyashko 1997 2002 2004 valyashko et al 2000 fig 5 displays the t x diagram of nacl na2so4 h2o at 25 mpa hodes et al 2004b valyashko 2004 zhang et al 2019 it can be found that the eutonic curve highlighted by the red dotted curve begins at the apex of water and ends at the eutectic about 628 c of dry salt mixture nacl and na2so4 the analog of binary solidus in the ternary systems is a constant curve representing a four phase univariate equilibrium among two solid phases saturated liquid and vapor it is worth noting that although na2so4 is a type 2 salt with a discontinuous solidus the eutonic curve of ternary system of nacl type 1 and na2so4 type 2 mixture is continuous it is reported that the isothermal slices phase diagram obtained by fig 5 which of the nacl na2so4 h2o system at 25 and 22 5 mpa can be found in the literatures armellini et al 1994 dipippo et al 1999 hodes et al 2004b can clearly reflect the dissolution crystallization and deposition features of ternary brine system over the whole temperature range nacl has a higher solubility than na2so4 the crystallization area of na2so4 is dramatically larger than that of nacl zhang et al 2014 and the unsaturated l phase always exists the salt content in the v phase is very low at 400 550 c under the supercritical condition of 450 c there is no s phase region of salt crystals and an s v phase equilibrium system appears at 450 c compared to the pure na2so4 h2o system the solubility of na2so4 increases sharply at 300 500 c after adding nacl and has a similar increasing trend to that of nacl h2o with temperature increasing in the subcritical region this may be explained by the effect of type 1 on type 2 salts i e mixing type 1 salts with type 2 salts increases the solubility of type 2 salts valyashko 1973 2002 2004 moreover voisin et al 2019 also quantitatively verifies the influence of type 1 on type 2 salts by an experimental study and attributes this phenomenon to the formation of nacl dense brine phase expressing that the polarity increases owing to a high concentration of nacl in the brine solution thereby increasing the solubility of na2so4 3 dissolution characteristics and measurement methods the great majority of inorganic salts are readily soluble in normal water but under sub supercritical conditions their solubilities decrease significantly solubility largely depends on the dielectric constant and ion product constant of water which decreases significantly when the supercritical state is reached thereby weakening the ionization ability of inorganic salts zhang et al 2019 therefore the solubility of inorganic salts drops sharply resulting in saturated precipitation the formed salt microcrystals then grow further and gradually deposit on the inner surfaces of reactor and pipeline thereby clogging the scwo system salt deposition in sub supercritical water is closely relevant with the solubility of inorganic salts hence the characteristics and mechanisms of dissolution experimental setups and solubility measurement methods under sub supercritical conditions are summarized in this section 3 1 several relevant theories of inorganic salt dissolution table 1 summarizes six related theories about salts dissolution mechanisms in sub supercritical water at present it is generally believed that they ion hydration ion association salting out effect salting in effect common ion effect and the effect of type 1 on type 2 salt should be considered when analyzing the interactions of various salts in multiple brine system ions in electrolyte aqueous solution have positive or negative charges while water molecules are polar molecules thus there exists electrostatic attraction between them the structure of water molecules is destroyed if the interaction energy between ions and water molecules is higher than the hydrogen bond energy among water molecules therefore a hydration film is formed around ion the water molecules in the hydration film then attract other water molecules around them through hydrogen bonds the above phenomenon is called ion hydration at room temperature and pressure the dielectric constant in the electrolyte aqueous solution is high and free ions are relatively abundant ion hydration dominates and ions are surrounded by water molecules so inorganic salts can dissolve well in water however in mixed solutions or under high temperature and pressure conditions the dielectric constant becomes very low ions with opposite charges approach each other to a critical distance under the attraction of coulomb force forming ion pairs hence there are relatively few free ions in aqueous solution which greatly weakens the interaction between ions and water molecules this phenomenon is called ion association at high temperature and pressure the dielectric constant in aqueous solution decreases so there are mainly ion pairs rather than free ions resulting in the insolubility of inorganic salts in water when exploring the solubility of inorganic salts in ternary brine system the salting out effect salting in effect common ion effect and the effect of type 1 on type 2 salt should be comprehensively considered when another salt is added the solubility of one salt decreases known as salting out effect otherwise salting in effect and it should be noted that the two salts do not share the same ions common ion effect is defined as the decrease in solubility of two salts that share a common anion or cation when dissolved in water in addition mixing type 1 salt with type 2 salt increases the solubility of type 2 salt type 2 salt is less soluble in scw than type 1 salt notably the solubility of na2so4 type 2 should be decreased after adding nacl type 1 considering the common ion effect but increases according to the effect of type 1 on type 2 salt hence it is difficult to predict whether the solubility of na2so4 in the ternary nacl na2so4 h2o system increases or decreases voisin et al 2019 which requires further study 3 2 solubility and dissolution characteristics as mentioned above nacl and na2so4 are typical type 1 and 2 salts respectively many researchers have devoted to investigating their solubilities and dissolution characteristics in sub supercritical water but data on other salts are still relatively scarce armellini and tester 1993 first summarizes most of the previous experimental data of nacl and na2so4 solubilities in steam along with the measurement methods and devices voisin et al 2017a reviews the solubility data and measuring devices of inorganic salts in sub supercritical water zhang et al 2019 summarizes the solubility of na2so4 in scwo and scwg processes then zhang et al 2020 again sums up the solubility data of common salts in sub supercritical water and the corresponding measuring methods however a detailed analysis summary and comparison of typical type 1 nacl and type 2 na2so4 solubility data is still lacking especially there is no perfect summary on measurement methods and devices and the interaction of nacl na2so4 and other salt mixtures hence according to the above reviews and recent research status more comprehensive measuring methods and devices the solubility and dissolution characteristics of nacl and na2so4 in binary brine systems and the interaction of inorganic salts in ternary brine systems are summarized in this section 3 2 1 measurement methods of salt solubility originally the measurement of salt solubility is for geological purposes the phase equilibrium of nacl h2o binary system under sub supercritical conditions are studied by vapor pressure measurement and then the lacking solubility data near the critical point is supplemented by experiments to perfect the corresponding phase diagrams benedict 1939 bischoff and rosenbauer 1984 keevil 1942 khaibullin and borisov 1966 ölander et al 1950 parisod and plattner 1981 sourirajan and kennedy 1962 the solubility of nacl in steam at high temperature and pressure 450 500 c 5 10 mpa is studied to better understand the salt deposition that occurs in turbines and steam machines galobardes et al 1981a 1981b water steam is then continuously analyzed using a flame spectroscopy detector to detect the na concentration over time moreover the solubility of inorganic salts can also be measured by chloride titrations martynova and samoilov 1957 1962 styrikovich et al 1955 alekhin and vakulenko 1988 vakulenko et al 1989 titrates na by ion chromatography to measure the concentration of nacl and even 22na radioactive tracers in batch system for in situ analysis meanwhile martynova 1976 morey and hesselgesser 1951 styrikovich et al 1955 studies the solubility of na2so4 in steam using the 35s radioactive tracer in a continuous system the measurement of salt solubility becomes extremely difficult under supercritical conditions of up to 500 c and 30 mpa currently there are two most common methods including salt bed and salt precipitation as shown in fig 6 a pure water is injected pressurized and heated and then passes through a tube filled with salt crystals thereby reaching a maximum saturation concentration by dissolving inorganic salts meanwhile the salt concentration in the effluent is analyzed using icp inductive coupled plasma emission spectrometer or ic ion chromatography and the measured value is the solubility at that temperature and pressure this is called the salt bed method this method can prevent pipeline clogging but only suitable for lower saturation concentrations due to the limited amount of salt in tube armellini and tester 1993 and this method can also be used to study the solubility of other inorganic salts higashi et al 2005 khan and rogak 2004 leusbrock et al 2008 conversely brine solution is introduced pressurized and heated to supercritical state whereby crystallization and precipitation occur the remaining brine solution containing salt is passed through a filter and then the effluent is then analyzed for salt concentration to obtain the solubility of inorganic salt at the corresponding pressure and temperature dell orco et al 1995 as shown in fig 6 c voisin et al 2017b obtains the solubility of na2so4 in the range of 50 500 c by the above method other authors have built similar devices ding et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 notably it works especially well with low melting point salts this method is also used for various salts but not limited to low melting point salts leusbrock et al 2008 see fig 6 b it is worth noting that some researchers combine the salt bed and salt precipitation methods to analyze and obtain their solubilities in sub supercritical water khan and rogak 2004 the introduced brine solution is firstly pressurized and heated to a supercritical state a flow conductivity meter at the end of device can continuously tracks the salt concentration of effluent the conductivity decreases after salt precipitates in tube secondly pure water is passed through the tube to dissolve the precipitated salts when the conductivity reduces to a stable value pure water is saturated to a similar concentration to the previous brine so the conductivity remains constant until there is not enough salt to saturate the water the advantage of this method is that the solubility values can be compared between the dissolution and precipitation methods thereby verifying the reliability of solubility data with only one experiment as shown in fig 6 d several other methods are also applied to measure the solubility of salts in sub supercritical water table 2 summarizes almost all measurement methods of salt solubility available in the literatures ravich and borovaya 1964 1968 ravich et al 1953 obtains the solubilities of nacl na2so4 and k2so4 at elevated temperature and pressure by measuring pressure change in the autoclave hodes et al 2004a 2004b 2003 hodes 1998 hurst et al 2002 measures the solubilities of na2so4 and k2so4 by gradually increasing the temperature of hot finger in a brine solution until precipitation is observed see fig 6 e shvedov and tremaine 2000 and rogak and teshima 2004 measure the na2so4 concentration in the effluent after precipitation at a given pressure and find that its solubility drops sharply at 25 mpa and 385 c armellini 1993 armellini and tester 1993 and dipippo 1998 dipippo et al 1999 obtain the solubility of nacl and na2so4 in an optically accessible flow cell by visual observation or precipitation detection abdulagatov et al 1998 reimer and vogel 2013 2016 uses high pressure differential scanning calorimetry to detect the solid precipitation in various binary and ternary brine systems thereby indirectly obtain the solubilities of inorganic salts 3 2 2 solubility of nacl and na2so4 in binary brine systems over the past several decades numerous experiments have been carried out to measure the solubility of salts under different conditions of high temperature and pressure it must be converted to the same form to obtain a global representation of solubility density takes into account the comprehensive effects of temperature and pressure on salt solubility hence the solubilities of nacl and na2so4 in the previous literatures are expressed as a function of water density as shown in fig 7 obviously the data have a similar trend with a significant drop with decreasing density in sub supercritical zone this may be attributed to the enhanced ion association and the reduced ion hydration effects as water density decreases leading to crystallization and precipitation li and lu 2005 robinson and stokes 1965 zhang et al 2019 it is worth noting that the decreasing trend of na2so4 solubility is more obvious than that of nacl zhang et al 2021 parisod and plattner 1981 concludes that the solubility of nacl decreases to 200 mg l 1 at 500 c and 25 mpa while that of na2so4 is much lower dropping by nearly four orders of magnitude at 300 440 c armellini and tester 1993 points out that the solubility of nacl ranges from 0 9 to 101 ppm at 450 550 c and 10 25 mpa but the solubility of na2so4 is over two orders of magnitude lower than that of nacl under the same conditions notably the data vary widely which may be attributed to different conditions devices and methods table 3 summarizes most of the available solubility data for nacl and na2so4 in sub supercritical water from previous literatures as a typical type 1 nacl has received extensive attention in its solubility studies higashi et al 2005 finds that the isobaric solubility decreases with temperature increasing at 9 0 12 0 mpa liu et al 2020 claims that the solubility of nacl decreases slightly before the phase transition point and decreases significantly afterwards ding et al 2017 points out that the solubility raises insignificantly with increasing water density at low density but dramatically increases at high density leusbrock et al 2008 extends the solubility of nacl to higher densities and obtains 89 5084 mg l 1 within 380 410 c and 17 23 5 mpa in addition the phase diagrams of nacl h2o system have been built according to the dissolution and phase transition behaviors see fig 4 a and b na2so4 as a typical type 2 salt is more likely to cause deposition and reactor clogging than nacl owing to its lower solubility near the critical point and high viscosity príkopský et al 2007 xu et al 2015 thus attracting more extensive attention xiang et al 2001 finds the isobaric solubility of na2so4 is approximately 10 times at 400 c that at 500 c and the isothermal solubility is about 5 times at 30 mpa that at 22 5 mpa rogak and teshima 2004 measures the solubility of na2so4 at 25 mpa in a heated flow system with fully turbulent flow and finds that it decreases by a factor of about 1000 with increasing temperature at 380 400 c armellini 1993 concludes that the solubility of na2so4 at 500 c and 25 mpa is 0 9 0 2 ppm which is two orders of magnitude lower than that of nacl under the same conditions while liu et al 2020 also comes to a similar conclusion under different experimental conditions yan 2011 confirms that the solubility of na2so4 decreases with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure due to the decrease of dielectric constant and it increases with temperature and then decreases slightly and drops significantly after the phase transition temperature ding et al 2019 finds that the isothermal solubility increases with increasing pressure while the isobaric solubility decreases with increasing temperature besides a weak cation hydrolysis effect in na2so4 solution is demonstrated by measuring the ph of samples ding et al 2019 which is also found in other studies armellini and tester 1993 leusbrock et al 2010 and that the hydrolysis of na at higher density is more pronounced than at lower density notably hydrolysis has no significant effect on solubility it is noteworthy that voisin et al 2017b finds that the solubilities of na2so4 at 400 c is very consistent with that in the literatures but at 400 450 c it reaches a stable value of 0 5 mg l 1 differing from those in the literatures in addition khan and rogak 2004 points out that the solubility data derived by shvedov and tremaine 2000 are underestimated for example by a factor of almost 3 at 100 kg m 3 this requires further research to confirm 3 2 3 interaction of inorganic salts in ternary brine systems as mentioned in section 3 1 when exploring the dissolution and deposition characteristics of inorganic salts in ternary brine systems multiple factors should be comprehensively considered including ion hydration ion association common ion effect salting out effect salting in effect and the effect of type 1 on type 2 salt the great majority of existing studies have considered these factors table 4 summarizes various ternary brine systems mixed with nacl or na2so4 from previous literatures temperature and pressure range from normal temperature and pressure to sub supercritical state the main contents and conclusions of previous literatures are summarized in detail it is found that the main work focuses on the establishment of ternary phase diagrams the influence of one salt on the solubility and phase behavior of another salt although the results are slightly different the laws and trends are roughly the same in this section the interaction of various inorganic salts in ternary brine systems is summarized compared and analyzed based on previous investigations thereby providing some suggestions for future research mixed salt of nacl and na2so4 the dissolution behaviors of pure nacl and na2so4 in sub supercritical water have been well studied but little is known about their mixing behaviors and interactions in ternary brine systems armellini and teste 1991 dipippo et al 1999 successfully reconstructs part of nacl na2so4 h2o phase diagram at 550 c and 25 mpa and finds that the solubility of na2so4 increases after adding nacl which is consistent with valyashko s predictions valyashko 1997 2002 2004 valyashko 2002 also discusses various ternary phase diagrams obtained by a transformation of topological types or by changing the location of nonvariant points without a transformation of topological types moreover the solubility and density of equilibrium liquid phase are determined by the isothermal solution saturation method lu et al 2017 and the solubility of stable and metastable phase equilibria are also determined by the isothermal solution saturation and isothermal evaporation methods respectively zhu et al 2020 and then the phase diagrams are drawn based on their experimental data the results on liquid liquid immiscibility solubility critical and tricritical phenomena in sub supercritical water are reviewed by valyashko 1997 a two phase firstly appears for nacl before solid salt while na2so4 nucleates solids directly from supercritical fluid armellini et al 1994 the nacl na2so4 h2o system reaches saturation at 313 15 k when nacl and na2so4 are 22 56 wt and 5 00 wt respectively zhang et al 2014 the system consists of two three phase equilibria regions divided by a two phase fluid region and two types of monovariant critical curves as temperature increases the three phase regions approach each other until the two phase fluid equilibrium disappears and the monovariant critical curves meet at a binary homogeneous critical point around 495 c and 75 mpa urusova and valyashko 2017 it has been proved that the addition of nacl can reduce the fouling caused by na2so4 scaling makaev et al 2011 nucleation of solid phase from the homogeneous liquid phase is observed for na2so4 rich salt mixtures whereas nacl rich salt mixtures exhibit a vapor separation from the homogeneous liquid phase dipippo et al 1999 notably an important study attributes the weakening of plugging in the nacl na2so4 h2o system to the dense phase formed by nacl voisin et al 2019 and the solubility at 380 400 c is 10 times higher than that of pure na2so4 because the dense phase dissolves part of na2so4 solid crystals preventing complete precipitation mixed salt of nacl and other salts ternary systems of nacl and other salts such as type 1 salts na2hpo4 bacl2 kcl licl srcl2 etc and type 2 salts na2co3 have been studied over the past few years nacl has a strong salting out effect on na2co3 at 40 c and ambient pressure cao et al 2019 and the reduce of nacl content decreases the solubility of na2co3 at 425 450 and 475 c urusova and valyashko 2011 implying that type 1 salts have a greater effect on the dissolution properties of na2co3 at supercritical conditions than salting out effect chou 1982 chou et al 1992 determines the isobaric sections of liquidus in the nacl kcl h2o system via differential thermal analysis and obtains the sylvite solubility along the three phase curve in the kcl h2o system by the intersection of sylvite liquidus isopleths and the three phase curve in the p t diagram sterner et al 1987 establishes an equation to describe the vapor saturated solubility relationship in the stability fields of halite sylvite and hydrohalite as a result of repeated depressurization more halite precipitation results in a decrease in na k ratios in both brine and coexisting steam phases thus suggesting that lower pressure favors k over na in vapor fournier and thompson 1993 at 350 400 c the solubilities of nacl and na2hpo4 in the nacl na2hpo4 h2o system are slightly higher than those in the nacl h2o and na2hpo4 h2o systems indicating that the dense phase of nacl h2o can increase the solubility of other salts in high density areas zhang et al 2021 it has also been demonstrated in the nacl na2so4 h2o system armellini and tester 1993 armellini et al 1994 hong et al 1995 notably above 425 c the results are reversed which may be attributed to the common ion effect similar to the solubility law recently reported by voisin et al 2019 urusova et al 2011 finds that the solubilities of nacl and bacl2 in the nacl bacl2 h2o system have the same trend at 385 500 c whereas that of bacl2 drops at 515 and 530 c urusova et al 2011 and the temperature coefficient of solubility converts from negative to positive and the critical behavior is eliminated it is inconsistent with marshall 1975 and valyashko s reports valyashko 1973 that both bacl2 and nacl are type 1 salts without critical behavior this may be due to the lack of research and understanding of binary bacl2 h2o system nacl has a stronger common ion effect than licl but licl has a salting out effect on nacl in the nacl licl h2o system cui 2020 lovera et al 2009 the pitzer model can be well used to predict the solubilities of salts in the nacl srcl2 h2o system gao et al 2020 srcl2 has a higher solubility than nacl in the nacl srcl2 h2o system because srcl2 has a stronger salting out effect than nacl li et al 2015 mixed salt of na2so4 and other salts organic wastewater often causes reactor clogging due to crystallization and precipitation of na2so4 hence it is of great significance to study the solubility characteristics of na2so4 and the interaction with other salts in ternary or higher systems it is found that the crystallization area of na2so4 in the na2so4 nah2po4 h2o system is significantly larger than that in the nah2po4 2h2o system zhang et al 2014 at higher na2hpo4 contents solid precipitation does not occur leading to pseudo type 1d behavior including liquid immiscibility reimer and vogel 2016 after the addition of k3po4 the solubility of na2so4 increases and further increases due to the increase of k3po4 concentration which is consistent with the experimental analysis obtained by peterson et al peterson et al 2009 using neutron photography in the na2so4 na2co3 h2o system the solubility of na2so4 is very close to that in the na2so4 h2o system khan and rogak 2004 whereas at a high density of about 480 g l 1 it decreases due to the common ion effect of na2co3 on na2so4 by comparing the phase diagrams of na2so4 na2co3 h2o at different temperatures it is found that the crystallization area of na2co3 2na2so4 remains basically unchanged with temperature increasing cao et al 2019 and the solubility of na2co3 decreases significantly with increasing na2so4 concentration due to strong salting out effect a slight salting in effect can be observed on na2so4 but a strong one on na2co3 reimer and vogel 2016 salting in effect and liquid liquid immiscibility still exist even with both two type 2 salts in the na2so4 k2so4 h2o system reimer and vogel 2013 2016 because of common ion effect after the addition of k2so4 the solubility of na2so4 decreases and further decreases with increasing k2so4 concentration at low fluid density tang et al 2014 it has a slight salting in effect on na2so4 after adding mgso4 reimer and vogel 2016 moreover in the na2so4 li2so4 h2o system with reducing li2so4 content the solution density changes regularly guo et al 2013 and at 35 c relatively higher than that at 75 c the solubility trends of various salts with different anions and anions are revealed k na m g 2 and hpo 4 2 so 4 2 co 3 2 e g k2so4 na2so4 mg2so4 and na2hpo4 na2so4 na2co3 however zhang et al 2020 summarizes the solubility order of the same cation and anion based on the research results as follows na k mg2 ca2 and no 3 c l h 2 po 4 hpo 4 2 po 4 3 so 4 2 co 3 2 the results are slightly different voisin et al 2017a points out that the radius of na is small and thus has a strong electrostatic interactions with other ions resulting in the formation of clusters and ion association before precipitation the larger the k radius the weaker the electrostatic interaction and the dielectric constant is less affected by the decrease in temperature mg2 has a larger ion radius but its ion radius is smaller than that of k or na because the ion charge is 2 and is very sensitive to changes in dielectric constant notably existing studies mainly focus on the dissolution characteristics of inorganic salts under low temperature and pressure the data under sub supercritical are relatively scarce due to harsh conditions in addition in actual scwo treatment of organic wastes brine solutions contain a variety of inorganic salts and complex mixtures of organics water and oxidants are present chen et al studies the precipitation of na2so4 and na2co3 in a complex scw environment containing c2h5oh and h2o2 chen et al 2022 however the studies on the solubility of other mixed systems are still very lacking or even blank let alone more diverse systems 4 deposition characteristics and measurement methods inorganic salts are highly soluble in water at ambient temperature and pressure but it crystallizes grows and aggregates and then precipitates when rising to near supercritical state some viscous inorganic salts e g na2so4 and k2so4 xu et al 2015 may collide with the reactor walls adhere and deposit on the internal surfaces of reactor and pipeline however with temperature reducing during cooling and depressurization process part of the formed salt powders particles may re dissolve in water owing to the fully reversible crystallization and precipitation processes so collecting salt powder particles for offline analysis is a great challenge recently great efforts have been devoted to the deposition study of inorganic salts in the scwo process various experimental setups and methods for collecting salt powder particles or in situ observation and online detection have been developed in this section the deposition characteristics mechanisms and main measurement technologies of inorganic salts have been summarized 4 1 deposition characteristics of inorganic salts voisin et al 2018 2017b claims that na2so4 hardly has any nucleation or growth mechanism due to the phenomenon of direct precipitation the average size of na2so4 particles is 20 nm and there is no obvious particle growth with temperature and time small aggregates with particle size 1 mm coexist with large aggregates with particle size 10 mm and the shape is not obvious armellini and teste 1991 indicates that most of na2so4 particles are 1 2 mm one of which is quite large due to its higher viscosity granular deposition is beneficial to controlling the thickness of salt deposition due to its instability once a certain thickness is reached part of the deposited salt is removed by bulk fluid and a new deposition cycle begins hodes et al 2004a khan 2005 k2so4 is a granular deposition see fig 8 b which is dendritic and easy to remove while na2so4 is a crystalline deposit with a relatively smooth surface and a dense interior see fig 8 a which must be removed mechanically or by dissolving in normal water hodes et al 2004a similar results are found by khan 2005 with granular crystallization helping to control deposition thickness in addition under the condition of short residence time more fine but uneven crystal particles tend to be generated hodes et al 2004a fig 8 c shows the picture of na2so4 deposition at 1 5 ml min 1 500 c and 25 mpa apparently the na2so4 deposition adheres tightly to the heated inner wall in the actual scwo process it may deteriorate heat transfer and the salt layer inevitably falls off due to gravity after long term operation seriously damaging reactor and causing shutdown and maintenance the salt deposition processes involve mass transfer and adhesion to inner wall and the deposition rate ultimately depends on their combined effects karakama et al 2012 keigo 2011 na2so4 is found to nucleate homogeneously and polymerize and grow in scw armellini et al 1994 homogeneous nucleation in bulk fluid helps to reduce the deposition on the inner wall whereas heterogeneous nucleation tends to occur on the inner wall which is prone to serious salt deposition problems hodes et al 2003 crystallization and deposition mechanisms of salts in scwo environment fall into two categories zhang et al 2020 inorganic salts spontaneously nucleate in bulk fluid in the direction of increasing axial saturation under the limitation of concentration gradient diffusion homogeneous nucleation occurs when a certain saturation is reached in bulk fluid when nuclei collide with each other and undergo secondary nucleation they gradually grow and form larger crystals that are easily deposit by gravity this is called homogeneous crystallization the other is heterogeneous crystallization on reactor surface which refers to the heterogeneous nucleation process of inorganic salt ions then the crystals evolve into a deposited layer through a molecular diffusion convection process induced by intermolecular forces and solid liquid interfacial tension meanwhile the solubility of inorganic salts in the near wall fluid decreases as the wall is heated creating a radial concentration gradient that further promotes nucleation and crystallization on the wall at present the deposition mechanisms of inorganic salts under the supercritical conditions are still lacking hence further explorations are required to solve the salt deposition problem in the scwo process 4 2 measurement methods of salt deposition at present various experimental methods have been developed such as rapid pressure released visual device neutron radiography online diagnosis high pressure differential scanning calorimetry hot finger etc this section summarizes most of the experimental methods reported in the literatures as shown in table 5 online diagnosis as a common technology has been applied to detect salt precipitation and reactor clogging in continuous experimental setups but reactor clogging can only be observed indirectly through pressure and temperature changes and phase transitions cannot be observed visual device neutron radiography and hot finger technologies have the advantage of in situ visualization but are relatively expensive notably experiments can be performed quickly cheaply and safely through a visual experimental technology in quartz capillary without catalytic activity and with good corrosion resistance in recent years high pressure differential scanning calorimetry as a thermal analysis tool can easily distinguish different phase transitions and is an accurate technology for phase behaviors under high temperature and pressure conditions in addition a new technology rapid pressure released has been applied to collect salt powders under supercritical conditions but it may cause damage to reactor with a high risk 4 2 1 rapid pressure released it is of great significance to collect precipitated salt powders under supercritical conditions because the great majority of aggregate analyses such as scanning electron microscopy dynamic light scattering and granulometry cannot be performed in situ generally the salt powders are collected after the system is completely cooled and depressurized but it may re dissolve in water voisin et al 2018 designs an experimental setup dedicated to the recovery of precipitated salt powders which can be collected in a controllable manner as shown in fig 9 a after salt precipitation the water in reactor is removed by introducing pressurized nitrogen under the conditions studied flowing pressurized nitrogen instead of water nitrogen has high compressibility low heat capacity high chemical stability and neutrality can reduce the temperature and pressure of system ensuring that the solid salt powders in reactor is not re dissolved the salt powders are then analyzed by scanning electron microscopy dynamic light scattering and granulometry to obtain the size morphology and particle size distribution of aggregates it is found that na2so4 aggregates have no well definite shape and seemly consist of more small aggregates about 0 5 μ m and some larger ones about 10 μ m furthermore it seems that initial concentration does not affect final aggregate size or distribution wang et al 2020 in their patent invents a test system for the crystallization and deposition of inorganic salt in sub supercritical water moreover the authors design a similar experimental device the difference is that a rapid pressure released bypass for back pressure valve is installed instead of introducing pressurized nitrogen as displayed in fig 9 b through the established experimental device we study the deposition of na2so4 at 25 mpa and 500 c see fig 8 c and find that the collected inorganic salt particles are dry which can be well used for subsequent aggregate analyses 4 2 2 visual device visual analysis is a method that allows in situ observation but few transparent materials can withstand the supercritical conditions of high temperature and pressure fortunately sapphire is an excellent material that can withstand high temperature and pressure and is also a monocrystal material so it has low x ray absorption and is fully compatible with x ray scattering analysis a continuous tube setup is established for visual recording and synchrotron wide angles x ray scattering in situ analysis to track the formation of na2so4 particles in real time and to collect their nucleation and growth rates becker et al 2010 voisin et al 2017b dipippo 1998 dipippo et al 1999 constructs an optically accessible cell device made of inconel 625 and a sapphire window capable of withstanding 30 mpa and 600 c and armellini and teste 1991 armellini et al 1994 designs a similar apparatus to observe phase transitions and locate phase boundaries in the nacl h2o system under isobaric conditions a flow system armellini and teste 1991 armellini et al 1994 is added into the above cell to study the rapid or shock like precipitation in scw the shock crystallization experiments of nacl h2o and na2so4 h2o systems indicate that the equilibrium phase relationship is important for determining the morphology and size of particles formed in the scwo process and 1 μm na2so4 particles form in a very short time of 10 ms while nacl may not form crystals at 385 c hurst et al 2002 constructs a flow cell with a sapphire window for visual observation and raman spectroscopy of salt deposition and nucleation in near critical solutions the direct in situ observation method of salt crystalline phase is confirmed by raman spectroscopy it is found that na2so4 deposited from solution to hot finger at near critical temperature presents an i type crystal structure a stable form of hexagonal phase above 241 c after cooling in a n2 atmosphere the deposited salt shows a v phase structure a thenardite phase that is usually exhibited by crystals grown from aqueous solution at ambient conditions instead of metastable form iii an orthorhombic metastable phase exhibited at room temperature after cycling to high temperature which may be attributed to the presence of residual water vapor brodale and giauque 1972 hapanowicz and sr 1996 although it is feasible to study the precipitation and phase behavior of inorganic salts by building a visual flow cell or a capillary with a sapphire window and it also has the advantage of isobaric experiments it is expensive and not readily available therefore odu et al 2015 develops a visual technology equipped with quartz capillaries to study the phase behavior and precipitation of nacl h2o system and salt nucleation and growth in scw this method is first developed by potic et al 2004 to study the thermochemical conversion of wet biomass in scw experiments can be performed quickly cheaply and safely through this method quartz capillary can also withstand high temperature and pressure up to 60 mpa and 900 c and has no catalytic activity and good corrosion resistance but isobaric measurements are not possible because the pressure in capillary increases with temperature since the water vapor pressure mainly determines the total pressure the pressure in quartz capillary can be controlled by the initial amount of solution in the capillary potic et al 2004 the p t relationship for water in a closed system is used to estimate the pressure in capillary at different recording temperatures wagner et al 2000 two distinct regions are found to exist after the critical point is exceeded the first bubble appears at 380 c forming a vapor liquid v l region the liquid level in capillary decreases with continued heating thereby increasing the salt concentration in the liquid phase at 450 c a vapor liquid solid v l s transition phase appears and the system enters the vapor solid v s region the above observations are consistent with those of armellini and teste 1991 zhang et al 2021 also establishes a similar experimental setup to observe the phase equilibriums of nacl h2o na2hpo4 h2o and nacl na2hpo4 h2o systems 4 2 3 neutron radiography neutron radiography is a technology that can be used for in situ dynamic real time imaging it uses a uniformly collimated neutron beam with a small divergence angle to vertically penetrate the object to be tested for detection it can be used to explore the precipitation of various mixed inorganic salts in scw peterson et al 2008 studies the precipitation clogging and transport behavior of na2b4o7 k3po4 na2b4o7 na2so4 na2b4o7 strongly attenuates neutrons and can be used as a tracer and supercritical heavy water d2o d2o has a weak attenuation effect on neutron in separator by neutron photography no clogging is observed in the na2b4o7 k3po4 d2o system but it occurs in the na2b4o7 na2so4 d2o system however this technology is limited to artificial systems boron containing mixed salts e g na2b4o7 as the precipitation phase and heavy water d2o as the flowing phase it s called reverse phase imaging technology therefore peterson et al 2009 uses normal water 1h2o h2o strongly attenuates neutrons rather than heavy water 2h2o or d2o as a flowing phase and uses na2so4 or k3po4 without boron salts as experimental simulated salts this is called normal phase imaging technology and can be used to observe the precipitation of any salts without boron salts in scw it cannot clearly distinguish the regions of low water density and salt deposition but can provide fluid density changes that reverse phase imaging technology cannot na2so4 and k3po4 are found to have the same precipitation and transport behaviors as in the literature peterson et al 2008 and the clogging of na2so4 significantly reduced after adding k3po4 this is consistent with the results of tang et al 2014 and also with the suggestion by hazlebeck 2001 that adding phosphate during hydrothermal process can prevent clogging in addition peterson et al 2010 also uses neutron radiography to monitor the fluid flow behavior of continuous fluid phase in reactor in real time schubert et al 2012 2010a b systematically investigates the precipitation clogging and separation characteristics of various single and mixed salts in scw by neutron radiography technology in a continuous laboratory device specifically it includes type 1 salt nacl kcl etc type 2 salt na2co3 na2so4 and k2so4 type 1 and 1 salt kh2po4 k2hpo4 and nano3 k2co3 type 1 and 2 salt k3po4 na2so4 type 2 and 2 salt na2co3 k2so4 na3po4 k2so4 na3po4 na2so4 and na2so4 k2so4 type 1 salts can be recovered as concentrated brine without clogging reactor schubert et al 2010a while type 2 salts cannot be recovered and adhere to reactor wall causing reactor clogging schubert et al 2010b the precipitation and separation behaviors of kh2po4 k2hpo4 and nano3 k2co3 are similar to type 1 salts schubert et al 2010b na2co3 and k2so4 can also be recovered as concentrated brine since a certain amount of type 1 salt k2co3 may be formed schubert et al 2010b a k3po4 na2so4 mixture may be formed in a na3po4 k2so4 mixture in scw while the mixtures of na3po4 na2so4 and na2so4 k2so4 are true type 2 salt mixture and do not form a type 1 salt mixture schubert et al 2012 the na3po4 k2so4 mixture shows the same separation performance as k3po4 na2so4 indicating that the type 1 salt k3po4 is formed in the na3po4 k2so4 mixture the na3po4 na2so4 mixture is not recovered as concentrated brine and causes reactor clogging schubert et al 2012 but concentrated brine can be removed from na2so4 k2so4 mixture at 450 460 c which may be explained by the formation of mixed salt naxkyso4 schubert et al 2012 4 2 4 online diagnosis salt deposition experiments are conducted through some continuous devices and at the same time salt deposition and reactor clogging are dynamically detected by online diagnosis technology kawasaki et al 2007 investigates the flow characteristics and precipitation behavior of brine solution in a tube lab scale apparatus with low flow rates 0 8 65 cm s 1 and a tube bench scale apparatus with high flow rates 45 196 cm s 1 at high temperatures 350 600 c and pressures 25 mpa haroldsen et al 1996 studies the deposition characteristics of na2so4 on the inner surface of porous transpiring wall at different flow rates different temperatures and with or without a protective water film by online diagnosis technology and process observation filipovic 1999 studies nacl deposition in the ubc noram scwo pilot plant and finds that the deposition rate does not change with time but phase transitions are still observed filipovic 1999 performs the deposition experiments of na2so4 in a scwo continuous reactor of sandia national laboratory meanwhile the pressure is monitored to detect the pipeline clogging and evaluate the deposition rate the results show that the clogging rate is proportional to the flow rate of salt injected into reactor furthermore it takes longer to clog the pipeline at higher flow rates which is inconsistent with the findings of kawasaki et al 2007 zhang et al 2020 explains that a higher rate may increase the probability of intermolecular collision and salt diffusion to the wall resulting in faster deposition for low viscosity insoluble particles increasing speed improves particle transport capacity and reduces deposition but the conclusions still require discussion xu et al 2013 systematically studies the effects of pressure temperature operation time initial concentration and flow rate on deposition characteristics in scw using a continuous flow setup meanwhile two parameters including deposition rate and deposition speed related to the mass concentration of na2co3 in reactor effluent are defined to evaluate the deposition of na2co3 in reactor their results are basically consistent with those of lajeunesse et al 1993 except that they observes the opposite effect of pressure on deposition speed 4 2 5 high pressure differential scanning calorimetry high pressure differential scanning calorimetry is a thermal analysis tool used to measure the heat flow of a sample versus a reference it can easily distinguish different phase transitions under heating mode such as the precipitation of solid salts or the emergence of a second liquid phase it is an accurate technology for exploring the phase behaviors of brine solution at hydrothermal conditions abdulagatov et al 1998 reimer and vogel 2013 reimer and vogel 2013 obtains some new data on solid phase precipitation of na2so4 h2o k2so4 h2o and k2hpo4 h2o systems at low concentration range 0 14 15 0 wt calorimetric measurement of liquid liquid immiscibility in hydrothermal salt solution is reported for the first time furthermore it is found that liquid liquid immiscibility is observed in the k2so4 na2so4 h2o system and thus it is considered that the phase behavior of this ternary system is similar to that of binary type 1d salt solution although it consists of two type 2 salts then reimer and vogel 2016 again utilizes this technology to study the phase behavior and precipitation of various ternary systems by detecting precipitation immiscibility limit and supercritical homogenization 4 2 6 hot finger hurst et al 2002 and hodes et al 2004a 2004b hodes 1998 insert a heating cylinder heat finger laterally into a micro scwo reactor and then gradually heat the salt solution through heat finger heat finger is kept at a temperature 10 c higher than salt solution to drive salt deposition combined with visual technology the solubility the surface temperature of hot finger is measured when precipitation occur and deposition rate c of na2so4 and k2so4 solutions are studied in scw see fig 8 a and b after a solution of 4 wt na2so4 10 47 g min 1 or k2so4 10 39 g min 1 flows through hot finger for 15 or 10 min the precipitation of k2so4 is dendritic but that of na2so4 is not the thickness of salt layer formed on heat finger is equal to the radius of heat finger after only 10 min the salt deposition rate is about 1 g min 1 as a function of time and salt concentration hodes et al 2003 hodes 1998 however one drawback of hot finger technology is that it must be removed after each operation to measure the mass of deposited salt 5 a new idea inhibiting salt deposition although many institutions and scholars are devoted to weakening the salt deposition during scwo process by the above methods there exist still many problems in practical applications notably molten salt as a reaction medium has high solubility and thermal stability for inorganics frangini and masi 2016 lovering and shrivenham 1982 and has been applied in many aspects wan et al 2015 2017 wang et al 2013 2016b 2016c 2017 conduct extensive studies on molten salt in geochemistry which is of great significance for exploring the melting properties of salts at high temperature especially supercritical conditions mcbrayer et al 1997 1998 first mentions in their patents that after adding the salts with low melting points e g nano3 kno3 naoh and koh the melting point of mixed salts can be lowered thus maintaining a fluid state and avoiding reactor clogging hazlebeck 2001 reports in his patent that the addition of phosphate compounds inhibits the deposition of salts in reactor reimer and vogel 2016 demonstrate the existence of melting phenomenon after mixing sulfate and phosphate many studies have been carried out on the melting properties of various salts under normal conditions but very few under supercritical conditions notably duverger nédellec et al 2020 voisin et al 2020 for the first time reports the application of molten salt in scw and investigates molten naoh in scw and its dissolution effect on deposited na2so4 the results indicate that the concentration of the first effluent sample is 1000 ppm about 5 ppm under the same condition if no naoh is added after injecting naoh into the system at 400 420 c and 25 mpa proving that the salt deposit formed can be dissolved and removed via injecting the salts with low melting point into the system subsequently zhang et al 2021 studies the scwo treatment of glyphosate wastewater nacl is main component but no salt deposition or system clogging is observed after testing and detailed analysis it is found that an amount of na2hpo4 its melting temperature is as low as 250 c is produced during scwo treatment process then the melting phenomenon of na2hpo4 is verified by a visual phase equilibrium apparatus zhang et al 2021 voisin et al 2020 and zhang et al 2021 point out that the melting points of other coexisting salts with high melting points is lowered or melt dissolve in the salts with low melting points if the salts with low melting points e g nano3 kno3 na2hpo4 nah2po4 naoh koh etc are added to the scwo system therefore the molten fluid called hydrothermal molten salt hymos is formed at low temperature and then flows out with feed stream effectively avoiding the clogging of reactor and pipeline in addition zhang et al 2021 finds that na2hpo4 and nacl melt in sub supercritical water with melting points lower than those of pure salt and ambient pressure conditions this can be explained by the arrangement of water molecules and inorganic salt ions after adding other salts to a pure solution due to different properties such as ion size and charge they may alternately arrange among ions and become more disordered further lowering the melting point of mixture the formation and redissolution process of hymos is as follows a homogeneous electrolyte of salt solution is first injected into the scwo system under pressure and heated simultaneously precipitation occurs when a certain temperature is reached as the precipitation temperature is higher than the melting point the precipitated salt immediately melts to form hymos the molten salt returns to the initial homogeneous electrolyte salt solution as it flows to aftercooler system thus avoiding clogging caused by salt deposition fig 10 displays the formation and re dissolution of hymos for typical nano3 with low melting point and na2so4 with high melting point nano3 may first melt in the low temperature region owing to its low melting point and then gradually dissolve melt supersaturated na2so4 with high melting point as temperature increases thus forming a mixed hymos system as shown in fig 10 a the other mechanism is that the melting point of other coexisting salts may be lowered due to the presence of the salts with low melting point then they may melt simultaneously at a certain temperature as displayed in fig 10 b 6 conclusions and prospects the present work summarizes and updates systematically the research status of the characteristics mechanisms and measurement methods of inorganic salt dissolution and deposition in sub supercritical water inorganic salts are reclassified in detail based on the melting points almost all of type 2 salts have higher melting points 600 c except for na3po4 and coso4 374 c and these of most sulfate and carbonate salts are 800 c while 600 c for most nitrate and phosphate salts the phase diagram characteristics of typical binary nacl h2o and na2so4 h2o and ternary nacl na2so4 h2o systems are analyzed the addition of nacl increases the solubility of na2so4 by several orders of magnitude which can be explained by the formation of nacl dense brine phase six related theories about salt dissolution mechanisms in sub supercritical water are introduced and it is generally believed that they should be considered when analyzing the interactions of various salts in multiple brine system more comprehensive measurement methods of salt solubility are reviewed of which salt precipitation and salt bed are the most common ones besides various salt deposition testing methods are summed up in detail among which the rapid pressure released technology has great advantages as a method to obtain the salt particles for off line analyses finally a new idea hydrothermal molten salt system is reviewed which indicates that salts with low melting point can dissolve ones with high melting point and thus avoiding salt deposition during scwo process these findings can provide valuable guidance for solving the salt deposition problem during scwo treatment of organic wastewater currently the fundamental data on the solubility and deposition properties of binary brine solutions let alone ternary or higher systems are still lacking in fact feedstock contains various inorganic salts organic matter water oxidant etc except for a study on the precipitation of na2so4 and na2co3 in the real scw environment containing c2h5oh and h2o2 chen et al 2022 there are few data on the real mixed brine solutions thus the follow up studies should firstly focus on obtaining the data of pure salt solutions in near supercritical and then the influences of other components in addition the hydrothermal molten salt system should attract more attention declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

15417,the efficient and harmless treatment of hypersaline organic wastes has become an urgent environmental problem compared to traditional thermochemical methods supercritical water oxidation has been proven to be an efficient organic waste treatment technology due to the advantages of low cost high degradation rate no secondary pollutants etc however the solubilities of inorganic salts drop rapidly near the critical point of water and some sticky salts form easily agglomerates and then adhere to internal surfaces of reactor and pipeline causing plugging and inhibition of heat transfer hence the characteristics mechanisms and measurement methods of the dissolution and deposition of inorganic salts in sub supercritical water are summarized and analyzed systematically and comprehensively in this work intending to provide a valuable guide for salt deposition prevention and subsequent research directions firstly a new classification form of inorganic salt is put forward based on melting point the phase equilibriums of brine systems are then analyzed in detail six theories concerning dissolution mechanisms are discussed deeply and various measurement methods of salt solubility are also supplemented furthermore salt deposition characteristics and related measurement technologies are summarized notably a new idea hydrothermal molten salt system is reviewed which may provide a solution for salt deposition in sub supercritical water finally an outlook for the follow up researches is prospected and some suggestions are proposed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sub supercritical water phase behavior of inorganic salt solubility salt deposition measurement method hydrothermal molten salt data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction currently high concentration refractory organic wastewater municipal sewage sludge and toxic and radioactive organic waste are considerable environmental management issues hodes et al 2004a wang and wang 2007 xu et al 2021 traditional thermochemical methods are not applicable due to the defects of high cost low degradation rate and easy derivation of secondary pollutants fortunately supercritical water oxidation scwo a new technology developed in recent years can degrade them efficiently and environmentally friendly voisin et al 2017a scwo refers to that in supercritical water scw t 374 15 c p 22 1 mpa organic compounds are converted completely into co2 h2o n2 and other harmless small molecules which contains many superiorities in degrading organic waste compared to other technologies savage 2000 yang et al 2022a compared to normal water scw has both liquid like dissolution and gas like transport properties li et al 2019 yang et al 2020 and can dissolve organic compounds and gasses such as co2 n2 o2 etc to form a homogeneous mixture without mass transfer resistance xu et al 2015 thus easily achieving a degradation rate of 99 99 in tens of seconds bermejo and cocero 2006 brunner 2009b it enables autothermal during scwo process voisin et al 2017a in addition the secondary pollutants e g so2 nox dioxin fumes ashes etc generated are negligible as temperature is kept low and the reaction system is completely enclosed vadillo et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 hence energy and environment one of the six major areas of national key technology in the united states points out that scwo is one of the most promising organic waste treatment technologies in the 21st century zhang et al 2021 at ambient temperature and pressure liquid water is a strongly polar solvent a very good solvent for inorganic compounds e g inorganic salts but a poor one for organics however the properties of water change markedly near its critical point in particular the dielectric constant and ion dissociation constant drop dramatically kritzer 2004 as shown in fig 1 this makes the polarity of scw as low as that of non polar solvents so scw easily dissolves organic compounds non polar substances but has the disadvantage of inorganic salt precipitation polar substances armellini and tester 1993 bischoff and pitzer 1989 dipippo et al 1999 kritzer and dinjus 2001 wei et al 2021 then the agglomerates formed of viscous precipitated salts e g na2so4 and na2co3 adhere to the inner surfaces of reactor and pipeline thus deteriorating heat transfer príkopský et al 2007 meanwhile a dead zone microenvironment may be formed resulting in a synergistic effect on reactor corrosion marrone and hong 2009 more seriously it may increase pressure drop plug reactor and pipeline and even cause equipment shutdown marrone 2013 the salt deposition is a very noteworthy problem as it may reduce the safety and economics of equipment operation in addition salts can also foul or poison the catalysts in catalytic supercritical water gasification process scwg reimer and vogel 2013 overall an efficient removal of inorganic salts from feed stream is crucial to the successful operation of scwo and scwg plants certainly the deposition problem of inorganic salts can also be converted into a superiority in practical applications such as recovery of nutrients potassium and phosphorus as fertilizers reimer and vogel 2013 supercritical water desalination of seawater odu et al 2015 synthesis of nanomaterials leybros et al 2012 liu et al 2022 etc over the past few decades great efforts have been devoted to mitigating or eliminating these adverse effects on the commercial application of scwo with great success there exist some experimental and review papers concerning scwo process brunner 2009a jiang et al 2020 tang et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 phase equilibrium in brine systems armellini et al 1994 dipippo et al 1999 hodes et al 2004b valyashko 2004 characteristics and mechanisms of dissolution masoodiyeh et al 2014 škerget et al 2011 voisin et al 2019 2017a and deposition hodes et al 2004b xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 2019 of inorganic salts measurement methods of salt solubility voisin et al 2017a zhang et al 2020 and deposition zhang et al 2020 2019 and technologies for prevention and control of salt deposition hodes et al 2004b marrone et al 2004 xu et al 2015 2010 zhang et al 2019 these investigations can provide a guidance for the follow up studies on salt dissolution and deposition in the scwo process however to the best of our knowledge a comprehensive and in depth summary and analysis of the dissolution and deposition characteristics of inorganic salts is still lacking there are also not detailed summaries of the existing dissolution and deposition theories and the interaction of inorganic salts in ternary brine systems in addition with the scwo technology developing rapidly some new measurement technologies and ideas for inhibiting salt deposition have emerged which also requires to further summarize duverger nédellec et al 2020 reimer and vogel 2016 voisin et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 hence the propose of this work is to systematically summarize and update the research status of salt dissolution and deposition in the scwo process particularly a new idea hydrothermal molten salt system is reviewed which may provide a solution for salt deposition in sub supercritical water these findings have important implications for guiding the study of salt deposition in the scwo process 2 salt classifications and phase equilibriums of brine systems 2 1 classifications of inorganic salts the type and phase behavior must be clearly understood and accurately grasped to study the dissolution and deposition characteristics of inorganic salts marshall 1975 has classified most inorganic salts into type 1 and 2 salts based on their solubilities under sub supercritical hydrothermal conditions indicating that the former is more soluble than the latter valyashko 2004 has classified including type 1 and 2 salts according to the behavioral trends which fully fits marshall s classification hodes et al 2004b moreover it is found that the dissolution behaviors of these two salts seem to be roughly correlated to their melting temperatures valyashko 2004 currently most inorganic salts are classified according to the above two criteria it is worth noting that voisin et al 2020 and zhang et al 2021 recently propose a hydrothermal molten salt system consisting of immiscible molten salts and sub supercritical water expressing that the salts with low melting point can dissolve the ones with high melting point thereby avoiding salt deposition during scwo see section 5 therefore the authors subdivide inorganic salts in more detail based on melting points as shown in fig 2 in fig 2 these salts highlighted in yellow are type 2 classified by marshall 1975 and these ones highlighted in both yellow and blue are type 2 divided by valyashko 2004 the melting temperatures of some uncommon salts such as napo3 kbo2 k2b4o7 hg cn 2 cd clo4 2 and kliso4 except for kliso4 others are type 1 salts are unknown so they are not listed in fig 2 in addition na2si2o5 kliso4 caco3 srbr2 srso4 bacl2 baso4 cdso4 mgso4 and coso4 are classified as type 2 salt yang et al 2022b and the melting temperatures of the other salts are obviously higher than 600 c except for coso4 therefore all type 2 salts belong to the salts with high melting point 600 c except for coso4 and na3po4 374 c the new classification based on melting temperature is agreed with the above two ones it can also be found that the melting points of most sulfate and carbonate salts are 800 c whereas 600 c for most nitrate and phosphate salts which may provide a guidance for follow up studies on hydrothermal molten salt system 2 2 phase equilibriums of binary and ternary brine systems so far there have been many investigations concerning the phase equilibrium relationship armellini 1993 dohrn et al 2012 hodes et al 2004b marshall 1975 ravich and borovaya 1964 valyashko 1973 2002 2004 2010 of brine systems especially the binary systems nacl h2o and na2so4 h2o and the ternary system nacl na2so4 h2o which distinctly and thoroughly exhibit the phase transition processes and laws of these brine systems along with temperature and pressure a clear understanding of the phase behaviors and diagrams of brine systems helps to more accurately master the characteristics and mechanisms of dissolution and deposition thereby preventing salt deposition during scwo process hence the features of phase diagrams regarding nacl h2o na2so4 h2o and nacl na2so4 h2o and the corresponding investigations have been summarized in this section 2 2 1 binary nacl h2o and na2so4 h2o systems fig 3 displays the features of p t x p pressure t temperature x composition diagram of binary salt h2o systems armellini 1993 dohrn et al 2012 hodes et al 2004b valyashko 2004 binary salt h2o systems are divided into type 1 and type 2 salts based on whether they exhibit critical behavior in saturated solutions morey 1957 type 1 salts do not exhibit critical behavior thus having a continuous solidus solid liquid vapor or s l v starting at the eutectic point of mixture and ending at the triple point of salt e g halides and nitrates type 1 salts includes type 1a and type 1b the critical curve of type 1a salt is continuous but that of type 1b salt is interrupted by intersection with l l v liquid liquid vapor curve conversely type 2 salts exhibit critical behavior with lower solubility than type 1 salts with discontinuous s l v curve e g sulfates carbonates and silicates type 2 salts contain type 2a and type 2b and the critical curve of type 2a is interrupted by solid precipitation while that of type 2b is broken by l l v curve or solid precipitation nacl h2o is one of the most typical type 1a binary salt h2o systems fig 4 shows the t x projections of binary p t x diagrams of nacl h2o hodes et al 2004b and na2so4 h2o hodes et al 2004b ravich and borovaya 1964 at 25 mpa along with the experimental data from literature voisin et al 2019 as shown in fig 4 a in the subcritical range of 374 15 c the solubility of nacl increases with temperature increasing there is a v l diphasic domain at 374 15 450 c which means that two phases first form instead of a solid precipitation after exceeding the critical point the v phase is a low density water phase with a low salt concentration and the l phase is a high density brine with a higher one voisin et al 2019 as the temperature increases the content of salt in the v phase reduces whereas increases in the l phase but also less dense it forms a v l equilibrium phase until the l phase disappeared at 450 c nacl immediately crystallizes and precipitates through homogeneous nucleation see section 4 1 zhang et al 2020 after exceeding 450 c thereby forming a v s phase v refers to scw armellini and teste 1991 as shown in fig 4 b the experimental data from many literatures are in good agreement with it moreover zhang et al 2021 records the phase transition of 1 wt nacl solution during temperature and pressure rising to 500 c and 25 mpa through a visual static experiment and strongly confirms the above phase transition process notably voisin et al 2019 reveals for the first time that a v l diphasic limit first exists between 390 c and about 415 420 c then the first nacl crystal appears at 420 c owing to a marked change in the v l phase proportions resulting in the existence of a triphasic domain at 420 450 c as shown by the red dotted line in fig 4 b zhang et al zhang et al 2021 speculates that it may be caused by continuous flow but it still required to be confirmed further in subsequent study na2so4 h2o is one of the most typical type 2b binary salt h2o systems as shown in fig 4 c with temperature raising in the subcritical range of 374 15 c its solubility firstly increases 0 40 c then remains at around 35 wt 40 220 c yet much lower than that of nacl and then reduces sharply 220 374 15 c to a negligible value approaching the critical point it crystallizes and precipitates by heterogeneous nucleation see section 4 1 once the salt concentration exceeds solubility zhang et al 2020 unlike nacl h2o system there exist two intersections p h2o rich s l v critical end point located near the critical point of pure water q na2so4 rich s l v critical end point located at about 400 c 114 mpa of solubility and critical curves resulting in a precipitation behavior under subcritical conditions without v l diphasic domain and 3 phase equilibrium voisin et al 2017a hence the saturated fluid continuously transforms from l to v phase with temperature raising 2 2 2 ternary nacl na2so4 h2o system according to the classification of binary salt h2o systems the ternary salt salt h2o systems can be divided into various types khan and rogak 2004 valyashko 1971 for example type 1a 1a ternary system consists of two type 1a salts and type 1a 2b ternary system contains type 1a and type 2b salts similarly the other combinations are also available specifically including type 1a 1a type 1b 1b type 1a 1b type 2a 2a type 2b 2b type 2a 2b type 1a 2a type 1a 2b type 1b 2a type 1b 2b hegde and hicks 2012 khan and rogak 2004 valyashko 1973 valyashko et al 2000 the ternary salt salt h2o systems e g typical nacl na2so4 h2o system armellini et al 1994 hodes et al 2004b urusova and valyashko 2017 zhang et al 2020 and the corresponding phase diagrams have been investigated by armellini et al 1994 dipippo et al 1999 and valyashko 1997 2002 2004 valyashko et al 2000 fig 5 displays the t x diagram of nacl na2so4 h2o at 25 mpa hodes et al 2004b valyashko 2004 zhang et al 2019 it can be found that the eutonic curve highlighted by the red dotted curve begins at the apex of water and ends at the eutectic about 628 c of dry salt mixture nacl and na2so4 the analog of binary solidus in the ternary systems is a constant curve representing a four phase univariate equilibrium among two solid phases saturated liquid and vapor it is worth noting that although na2so4 is a type 2 salt with a discontinuous solidus the eutonic curve of ternary system of nacl type 1 and na2so4 type 2 mixture is continuous it is reported that the isothermal slices phase diagram obtained by fig 5 which of the nacl na2so4 h2o system at 25 and 22 5 mpa can be found in the literatures armellini et al 1994 dipippo et al 1999 hodes et al 2004b can clearly reflect the dissolution crystallization and deposition features of ternary brine system over the whole temperature range nacl has a higher solubility than na2so4 the crystallization area of na2so4 is dramatically larger than that of nacl zhang et al 2014 and the unsaturated l phase always exists the salt content in the v phase is very low at 400 550 c under the supercritical condition of 450 c there is no s phase region of salt crystals and an s v phase equilibrium system appears at 450 c compared to the pure na2so4 h2o system the solubility of na2so4 increases sharply at 300 500 c after adding nacl and has a similar increasing trend to that of nacl h2o with temperature increasing in the subcritical region this may be explained by the effect of type 1 on type 2 salts i e mixing type 1 salts with type 2 salts increases the solubility of type 2 salts valyashko 1973 2002 2004 moreover voisin et al 2019 also quantitatively verifies the influence of type 1 on type 2 salts by an experimental study and attributes this phenomenon to the formation of nacl dense brine phase expressing that the polarity increases owing to a high concentration of nacl in the brine solution thereby increasing the solubility of na2so4 3 dissolution characteristics and measurement methods the great majority of inorganic salts are readily soluble in normal water but under sub supercritical conditions their solubilities decrease significantly solubility largely depends on the dielectric constant and ion product constant of water which decreases significantly when the supercritical state is reached thereby weakening the ionization ability of inorganic salts zhang et al 2019 therefore the solubility of inorganic salts drops sharply resulting in saturated precipitation the formed salt microcrystals then grow further and gradually deposit on the inner surfaces of reactor and pipeline thereby clogging the scwo system salt deposition in sub supercritical water is closely relevant with the solubility of inorganic salts hence the characteristics and mechanisms of dissolution experimental setups and solubility measurement methods under sub supercritical conditions are summarized in this section 3 1 several relevant theories of inorganic salt dissolution table 1 summarizes six related theories about salts dissolution mechanisms in sub supercritical water at present it is generally believed that they ion hydration ion association salting out effect salting in effect common ion effect and the effect of type 1 on type 2 salt should be considered when analyzing the interactions of various salts in multiple brine system ions in electrolyte aqueous solution have positive or negative charges while water molecules are polar molecules thus there exists electrostatic attraction between them the structure of water molecules is destroyed if the interaction energy between ions and water molecules is higher than the hydrogen bond energy among water molecules therefore a hydration film is formed around ion the water molecules in the hydration film then attract other water molecules around them through hydrogen bonds the above phenomenon is called ion hydration at room temperature and pressure the dielectric constant in the electrolyte aqueous solution is high and free ions are relatively abundant ion hydration dominates and ions are surrounded by water molecules so inorganic salts can dissolve well in water however in mixed solutions or under high temperature and pressure conditions the dielectric constant becomes very low ions with opposite charges approach each other to a critical distance under the attraction of coulomb force forming ion pairs hence there are relatively few free ions in aqueous solution which greatly weakens the interaction between ions and water molecules this phenomenon is called ion association at high temperature and pressure the dielectric constant in aqueous solution decreases so there are mainly ion pairs rather than free ions resulting in the insolubility of inorganic salts in water when exploring the solubility of inorganic salts in ternary brine system the salting out effect salting in effect common ion effect and the effect of type 1 on type 2 salt should be comprehensively considered when another salt is added the solubility of one salt decreases known as salting out effect otherwise salting in effect and it should be noted that the two salts do not share the same ions common ion effect is defined as the decrease in solubility of two salts that share a common anion or cation when dissolved in water in addition mixing type 1 salt with type 2 salt increases the solubility of type 2 salt type 2 salt is less soluble in scw than type 1 salt notably the solubility of na2so4 type 2 should be decreased after adding nacl type 1 considering the common ion effect but increases according to the effect of type 1 on type 2 salt hence it is difficult to predict whether the solubility of na2so4 in the ternary nacl na2so4 h2o system increases or decreases voisin et al 2019 which requires further study 3 2 solubility and dissolution characteristics as mentioned above nacl and na2so4 are typical type 1 and 2 salts respectively many researchers have devoted to investigating their solubilities and dissolution characteristics in sub supercritical water but data on other salts are still relatively scarce armellini and tester 1993 first summarizes most of the previous experimental data of nacl and na2so4 solubilities in steam along with the measurement methods and devices voisin et al 2017a reviews the solubility data and measuring devices of inorganic salts in sub supercritical water zhang et al 2019 summarizes the solubility of na2so4 in scwo and scwg processes then zhang et al 2020 again sums up the solubility data of common salts in sub supercritical water and the corresponding measuring methods however a detailed analysis summary and comparison of typical type 1 nacl and type 2 na2so4 solubility data is still lacking especially there is no perfect summary on measurement methods and devices and the interaction of nacl na2so4 and other salt mixtures hence according to the above reviews and recent research status more comprehensive measuring methods and devices the solubility and dissolution characteristics of nacl and na2so4 in binary brine systems and the interaction of inorganic salts in ternary brine systems are summarized in this section 3 2 1 measurement methods of salt solubility originally the measurement of salt solubility is for geological purposes the phase equilibrium of nacl h2o binary system under sub supercritical conditions are studied by vapor pressure measurement and then the lacking solubility data near the critical point is supplemented by experiments to perfect the corresponding phase diagrams benedict 1939 bischoff and rosenbauer 1984 keevil 1942 khaibullin and borisov 1966 ölander et al 1950 parisod and plattner 1981 sourirajan and kennedy 1962 the solubility of nacl in steam at high temperature and pressure 450 500 c 5 10 mpa is studied to better understand the salt deposition that occurs in turbines and steam machines galobardes et al 1981a 1981b water steam is then continuously analyzed using a flame spectroscopy detector to detect the na concentration over time moreover the solubility of inorganic salts can also be measured by chloride titrations martynova and samoilov 1957 1962 styrikovich et al 1955 alekhin and vakulenko 1988 vakulenko et al 1989 titrates na by ion chromatography to measure the concentration of nacl and even 22na radioactive tracers in batch system for in situ analysis meanwhile martynova 1976 morey and hesselgesser 1951 styrikovich et al 1955 studies the solubility of na2so4 in steam using the 35s radioactive tracer in a continuous system the measurement of salt solubility becomes extremely difficult under supercritical conditions of up to 500 c and 30 mpa currently there are two most common methods including salt bed and salt precipitation as shown in fig 6 a pure water is injected pressurized and heated and then passes through a tube filled with salt crystals thereby reaching a maximum saturation concentration by dissolving inorganic salts meanwhile the salt concentration in the effluent is analyzed using icp inductive coupled plasma emission spectrometer or ic ion chromatography and the measured value is the solubility at that temperature and pressure this is called the salt bed method this method can prevent pipeline clogging but only suitable for lower saturation concentrations due to the limited amount of salt in tube armellini and tester 1993 and this method can also be used to study the solubility of other inorganic salts higashi et al 2005 khan and rogak 2004 leusbrock et al 2008 conversely brine solution is introduced pressurized and heated to supercritical state whereby crystallization and precipitation occur the remaining brine solution containing salt is passed through a filter and then the effluent is then analyzed for salt concentration to obtain the solubility of inorganic salt at the corresponding pressure and temperature dell orco et al 1995 as shown in fig 6 c voisin et al 2017b obtains the solubility of na2so4 in the range of 50 500 c by the above method other authors have built similar devices ding et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 notably it works especially well with low melting point salts this method is also used for various salts but not limited to low melting point salts leusbrock et al 2008 see fig 6 b it is worth noting that some researchers combine the salt bed and salt precipitation methods to analyze and obtain their solubilities in sub supercritical water khan and rogak 2004 the introduced brine solution is firstly pressurized and heated to a supercritical state a flow conductivity meter at the end of device can continuously tracks the salt concentration of effluent the conductivity decreases after salt precipitates in tube secondly pure water is passed through the tube to dissolve the precipitated salts when the conductivity reduces to a stable value pure water is saturated to a similar concentration to the previous brine so the conductivity remains constant until there is not enough salt to saturate the water the advantage of this method is that the solubility values can be compared between the dissolution and precipitation methods thereby verifying the reliability of solubility data with only one experiment as shown in fig 6 d several other methods are also applied to measure the solubility of salts in sub supercritical water table 2 summarizes almost all measurement methods of salt solubility available in the literatures ravich and borovaya 1964 1968 ravich et al 1953 obtains the solubilities of nacl na2so4 and k2so4 at elevated temperature and pressure by measuring pressure change in the autoclave hodes et al 2004a 2004b 2003 hodes 1998 hurst et al 2002 measures the solubilities of na2so4 and k2so4 by gradually increasing the temperature of hot finger in a brine solution until precipitation is observed see fig 6 e shvedov and tremaine 2000 and rogak and teshima 2004 measure the na2so4 concentration in the effluent after precipitation at a given pressure and find that its solubility drops sharply at 25 mpa and 385 c armellini 1993 armellini and tester 1993 and dipippo 1998 dipippo et al 1999 obtain the solubility of nacl and na2so4 in an optically accessible flow cell by visual observation or precipitation detection abdulagatov et al 1998 reimer and vogel 2013 2016 uses high pressure differential scanning calorimetry to detect the solid precipitation in various binary and ternary brine systems thereby indirectly obtain the solubilities of inorganic salts 3 2 2 solubility of nacl and na2so4 in binary brine systems over the past several decades numerous experiments have been carried out to measure the solubility of salts under different conditions of high temperature and pressure it must be converted to the same form to obtain a global representation of solubility density takes into account the comprehensive effects of temperature and pressure on salt solubility hence the solubilities of nacl and na2so4 in the previous literatures are expressed as a function of water density as shown in fig 7 obviously the data have a similar trend with a significant drop with decreasing density in sub supercritical zone this may be attributed to the enhanced ion association and the reduced ion hydration effects as water density decreases leading to crystallization and precipitation li and lu 2005 robinson and stokes 1965 zhang et al 2019 it is worth noting that the decreasing trend of na2so4 solubility is more obvious than that of nacl zhang et al 2021 parisod and plattner 1981 concludes that the solubility of nacl decreases to 200 mg l 1 at 500 c and 25 mpa while that of na2so4 is much lower dropping by nearly four orders of magnitude at 300 440 c armellini and tester 1993 points out that the solubility of nacl ranges from 0 9 to 101 ppm at 450 550 c and 10 25 mpa but the solubility of na2so4 is over two orders of magnitude lower than that of nacl under the same conditions notably the data vary widely which may be attributed to different conditions devices and methods table 3 summarizes most of the available solubility data for nacl and na2so4 in sub supercritical water from previous literatures as a typical type 1 nacl has received extensive attention in its solubility studies higashi et al 2005 finds that the isobaric solubility decreases with temperature increasing at 9 0 12 0 mpa liu et al 2020 claims that the solubility of nacl decreases slightly before the phase transition point and decreases significantly afterwards ding et al 2017 points out that the solubility raises insignificantly with increasing water density at low density but dramatically increases at high density leusbrock et al 2008 extends the solubility of nacl to higher densities and obtains 89 5084 mg l 1 within 380 410 c and 17 23 5 mpa in addition the phase diagrams of nacl h2o system have been built according to the dissolution and phase transition behaviors see fig 4 a and b na2so4 as a typical type 2 salt is more likely to cause deposition and reactor clogging than nacl owing to its lower solubility near the critical point and high viscosity príkopský et al 2007 xu et al 2015 thus attracting more extensive attention xiang et al 2001 finds the isobaric solubility of na2so4 is approximately 10 times at 400 c that at 500 c and the isothermal solubility is about 5 times at 30 mpa that at 22 5 mpa rogak and teshima 2004 measures the solubility of na2so4 at 25 mpa in a heated flow system with fully turbulent flow and finds that it decreases by a factor of about 1000 with increasing temperature at 380 400 c armellini 1993 concludes that the solubility of na2so4 at 500 c and 25 mpa is 0 9 0 2 ppm which is two orders of magnitude lower than that of nacl under the same conditions while liu et al 2020 also comes to a similar conclusion under different experimental conditions yan 2011 confirms that the solubility of na2so4 decreases with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure due to the decrease of dielectric constant and it increases with temperature and then decreases slightly and drops significantly after the phase transition temperature ding et al 2019 finds that the isothermal solubility increases with increasing pressure while the isobaric solubility decreases with increasing temperature besides a weak cation hydrolysis effect in na2so4 solution is demonstrated by measuring the ph of samples ding et al 2019 which is also found in other studies armellini and tester 1993 leusbrock et al 2010 and that the hydrolysis of na at higher density is more pronounced than at lower density notably hydrolysis has no significant effect on solubility it is noteworthy that voisin et al 2017b finds that the solubilities of na2so4 at 400 c is very consistent with that in the literatures but at 400 450 c it reaches a stable value of 0 5 mg l 1 differing from those in the literatures in addition khan and rogak 2004 points out that the solubility data derived by shvedov and tremaine 2000 are underestimated for example by a factor of almost 3 at 100 kg m 3 this requires further research to confirm 3 2 3 interaction of inorganic salts in ternary brine systems as mentioned in section 3 1 when exploring the dissolution and deposition characteristics of inorganic salts in ternary brine systems multiple factors should be comprehensively considered including ion hydration ion association common ion effect salting out effect salting in effect and the effect of type 1 on type 2 salt the great majority of existing studies have considered these factors table 4 summarizes various ternary brine systems mixed with nacl or na2so4 from previous literatures temperature and pressure range from normal temperature and pressure to sub supercritical state the main contents and conclusions of previous literatures are summarized in detail it is found that the main work focuses on the establishment of ternary phase diagrams the influence of one salt on the solubility and phase behavior of another salt although the results are slightly different the laws and trends are roughly the same in this section the interaction of various inorganic salts in ternary brine systems is summarized compared and analyzed based on previous investigations thereby providing some suggestions for future research mixed salt of nacl and na2so4 the dissolution behaviors of pure nacl and na2so4 in sub supercritical water have been well studied but little is known about their mixing behaviors and interactions in ternary brine systems armellini and teste 1991 dipippo et al 1999 successfully reconstructs part of nacl na2so4 h2o phase diagram at 550 c and 25 mpa and finds that the solubility of na2so4 increases after adding nacl which is consistent with valyashko s predictions valyashko 1997 2002 2004 valyashko 2002 also discusses various ternary phase diagrams obtained by a transformation of topological types or by changing the location of nonvariant points without a transformation of topological types moreover the solubility and density of equilibrium liquid phase are determined by the isothermal solution saturation method lu et al 2017 and the solubility of stable and metastable phase equilibria are also determined by the isothermal solution saturation and isothermal evaporation methods respectively zhu et al 2020 and then the phase diagrams are drawn based on their experimental data the results on liquid liquid immiscibility solubility critical and tricritical phenomena in sub supercritical water are reviewed by valyashko 1997 a two phase firstly appears for nacl before solid salt while na2so4 nucleates solids directly from supercritical fluid armellini et al 1994 the nacl na2so4 h2o system reaches saturation at 313 15 k when nacl and na2so4 are 22 56 wt and 5 00 wt respectively zhang et al 2014 the system consists of two three phase equilibria regions divided by a two phase fluid region and two types of monovariant critical curves as temperature increases the three phase regions approach each other until the two phase fluid equilibrium disappears and the monovariant critical curves meet at a binary homogeneous critical point around 495 c and 75 mpa urusova and valyashko 2017 it has been proved that the addition of nacl can reduce the fouling caused by na2so4 scaling makaev et al 2011 nucleation of solid phase from the homogeneous liquid phase is observed for na2so4 rich salt mixtures whereas nacl rich salt mixtures exhibit a vapor separation from the homogeneous liquid phase dipippo et al 1999 notably an important study attributes the weakening of plugging in the nacl na2so4 h2o system to the dense phase formed by nacl voisin et al 2019 and the solubility at 380 400 c is 10 times higher than that of pure na2so4 because the dense phase dissolves part of na2so4 solid crystals preventing complete precipitation mixed salt of nacl and other salts ternary systems of nacl and other salts such as type 1 salts na2hpo4 bacl2 kcl licl srcl2 etc and type 2 salts na2co3 have been studied over the past few years nacl has a strong salting out effect on na2co3 at 40 c and ambient pressure cao et al 2019 and the reduce of nacl content decreases the solubility of na2co3 at 425 450 and 475 c urusova and valyashko 2011 implying that type 1 salts have a greater effect on the dissolution properties of na2co3 at supercritical conditions than salting out effect chou 1982 chou et al 1992 determines the isobaric sections of liquidus in the nacl kcl h2o system via differential thermal analysis and obtains the sylvite solubility along the three phase curve in the kcl h2o system by the intersection of sylvite liquidus isopleths and the three phase curve in the p t diagram sterner et al 1987 establishes an equation to describe the vapor saturated solubility relationship in the stability fields of halite sylvite and hydrohalite as a result of repeated depressurization more halite precipitation results in a decrease in na k ratios in both brine and coexisting steam phases thus suggesting that lower pressure favors k over na in vapor fournier and thompson 1993 at 350 400 c the solubilities of nacl and na2hpo4 in the nacl na2hpo4 h2o system are slightly higher than those in the nacl h2o and na2hpo4 h2o systems indicating that the dense phase of nacl h2o can increase the solubility of other salts in high density areas zhang et al 2021 it has also been demonstrated in the nacl na2so4 h2o system armellini and tester 1993 armellini et al 1994 hong et al 1995 notably above 425 c the results are reversed which may be attributed to the common ion effect similar to the solubility law recently reported by voisin et al 2019 urusova et al 2011 finds that the solubilities of nacl and bacl2 in the nacl bacl2 h2o system have the same trend at 385 500 c whereas that of bacl2 drops at 515 and 530 c urusova et al 2011 and the temperature coefficient of solubility converts from negative to positive and the critical behavior is eliminated it is inconsistent with marshall 1975 and valyashko s reports valyashko 1973 that both bacl2 and nacl are type 1 salts without critical behavior this may be due to the lack of research and understanding of binary bacl2 h2o system nacl has a stronger common ion effect than licl but licl has a salting out effect on nacl in the nacl licl h2o system cui 2020 lovera et al 2009 the pitzer model can be well used to predict the solubilities of salts in the nacl srcl2 h2o system gao et al 2020 srcl2 has a higher solubility than nacl in the nacl srcl2 h2o system because srcl2 has a stronger salting out effect than nacl li et al 2015 mixed salt of na2so4 and other salts organic wastewater often causes reactor clogging due to crystallization and precipitation of na2so4 hence it is of great significance to study the solubility characteristics of na2so4 and the interaction with other salts in ternary or higher systems it is found that the crystallization area of na2so4 in the na2so4 nah2po4 h2o system is significantly larger than that in the nah2po4 2h2o system zhang et al 2014 at higher na2hpo4 contents solid precipitation does not occur leading to pseudo type 1d behavior including liquid immiscibility reimer and vogel 2016 after the addition of k3po4 the solubility of na2so4 increases and further increases due to the increase of k3po4 concentration which is consistent with the experimental analysis obtained by peterson et al peterson et al 2009 using neutron photography in the na2so4 na2co3 h2o system the solubility of na2so4 is very close to that in the na2so4 h2o system khan and rogak 2004 whereas at a high density of about 480 g l 1 it decreases due to the common ion effect of na2co3 on na2so4 by comparing the phase diagrams of na2so4 na2co3 h2o at different temperatures it is found that the crystallization area of na2co3 2na2so4 remains basically unchanged with temperature increasing cao et al 2019 and the solubility of na2co3 decreases significantly with increasing na2so4 concentration due to strong salting out effect a slight salting in effect can be observed on na2so4 but a strong one on na2co3 reimer and vogel 2016 salting in effect and liquid liquid immiscibility still exist even with both two type 2 salts in the na2so4 k2so4 h2o system reimer and vogel 2013 2016 because of common ion effect after the addition of k2so4 the solubility of na2so4 decreases and further decreases with increasing k2so4 concentration at low fluid density tang et al 2014 it has a slight salting in effect on na2so4 after adding mgso4 reimer and vogel 2016 moreover in the na2so4 li2so4 h2o system with reducing li2so4 content the solution density changes regularly guo et al 2013 and at 35 c relatively higher than that at 75 c the solubility trends of various salts with different anions and anions are revealed k na m g 2 and hpo 4 2 so 4 2 co 3 2 e g k2so4 na2so4 mg2so4 and na2hpo4 na2so4 na2co3 however zhang et al 2020 summarizes the solubility order of the same cation and anion based on the research results as follows na k mg2 ca2 and no 3 c l h 2 po 4 hpo 4 2 po 4 3 so 4 2 co 3 2 the results are slightly different voisin et al 2017a points out that the radius of na is small and thus has a strong electrostatic interactions with other ions resulting in the formation of clusters and ion association before precipitation the larger the k radius the weaker the electrostatic interaction and the dielectric constant is less affected by the decrease in temperature mg2 has a larger ion radius but its ion radius is smaller than that of k or na because the ion charge is 2 and is very sensitive to changes in dielectric constant notably existing studies mainly focus on the dissolution characteristics of inorganic salts under low temperature and pressure the data under sub supercritical are relatively scarce due to harsh conditions in addition in actual scwo treatment of organic wastes brine solutions contain a variety of inorganic salts and complex mixtures of organics water and oxidants are present chen et al studies the precipitation of na2so4 and na2co3 in a complex scw environment containing c2h5oh and h2o2 chen et al 2022 however the studies on the solubility of other mixed systems are still very lacking or even blank let alone more diverse systems 4 deposition characteristics and measurement methods inorganic salts are highly soluble in water at ambient temperature and pressure but it crystallizes grows and aggregates and then precipitates when rising to near supercritical state some viscous inorganic salts e g na2so4 and k2so4 xu et al 2015 may collide with the reactor walls adhere and deposit on the internal surfaces of reactor and pipeline however with temperature reducing during cooling and depressurization process part of the formed salt powders particles may re dissolve in water owing to the fully reversible crystallization and precipitation processes so collecting salt powder particles for offline analysis is a great challenge recently great efforts have been devoted to the deposition study of inorganic salts in the scwo process various experimental setups and methods for collecting salt powder particles or in situ observation and online detection have been developed in this section the deposition characteristics mechanisms and main measurement technologies of inorganic salts have been summarized 4 1 deposition characteristics of inorganic salts voisin et al 2018 2017b claims that na2so4 hardly has any nucleation or growth mechanism due to the phenomenon of direct precipitation the average size of na2so4 particles is 20 nm and there is no obvious particle growth with temperature and time small aggregates with particle size 1 mm coexist with large aggregates with particle size 10 mm and the shape is not obvious armellini and teste 1991 indicates that most of na2so4 particles are 1 2 mm one of which is quite large due to its higher viscosity granular deposition is beneficial to controlling the thickness of salt deposition due to its instability once a certain thickness is reached part of the deposited salt is removed by bulk fluid and a new deposition cycle begins hodes et al 2004a khan 2005 k2so4 is a granular deposition see fig 8 b which is dendritic and easy to remove while na2so4 is a crystalline deposit with a relatively smooth surface and a dense interior see fig 8 a which must be removed mechanically or by dissolving in normal water hodes et al 2004a similar results are found by khan 2005 with granular crystallization helping to control deposition thickness in addition under the condition of short residence time more fine but uneven crystal particles tend to be generated hodes et al 2004a fig 8 c shows the picture of na2so4 deposition at 1 5 ml min 1 500 c and 25 mpa apparently the na2so4 deposition adheres tightly to the heated inner wall in the actual scwo process it may deteriorate heat transfer and the salt layer inevitably falls off due to gravity after long term operation seriously damaging reactor and causing shutdown and maintenance the salt deposition processes involve mass transfer and adhesion to inner wall and the deposition rate ultimately depends on their combined effects karakama et al 2012 keigo 2011 na2so4 is found to nucleate homogeneously and polymerize and grow in scw armellini et al 1994 homogeneous nucleation in bulk fluid helps to reduce the deposition on the inner wall whereas heterogeneous nucleation tends to occur on the inner wall which is prone to serious salt deposition problems hodes et al 2003 crystallization and deposition mechanisms of salts in scwo environment fall into two categories zhang et al 2020 inorganic salts spontaneously nucleate in bulk fluid in the direction of increasing axial saturation under the limitation of concentration gradient diffusion homogeneous nucleation occurs when a certain saturation is reached in bulk fluid when nuclei collide with each other and undergo secondary nucleation they gradually grow and form larger crystals that are easily deposit by gravity this is called homogeneous crystallization the other is heterogeneous crystallization on reactor surface which refers to the heterogeneous nucleation process of inorganic salt ions then the crystals evolve into a deposited layer through a molecular diffusion convection process induced by intermolecular forces and solid liquid interfacial tension meanwhile the solubility of inorganic salts in the near wall fluid decreases as the wall is heated creating a radial concentration gradient that further promotes nucleation and crystallization on the wall at present the deposition mechanisms of inorganic salts under the supercritical conditions are still lacking hence further explorations are required to solve the salt deposition problem in the scwo process 4 2 measurement methods of salt deposition at present various experimental methods have been developed such as rapid pressure released visual device neutron radiography online diagnosis high pressure differential scanning calorimetry hot finger etc this section summarizes most of the experimental methods reported in the literatures as shown in table 5 online diagnosis as a common technology has been applied to detect salt precipitation and reactor clogging in continuous experimental setups but reactor clogging can only be observed indirectly through pressure and temperature changes and phase transitions cannot be observed visual device neutron radiography and hot finger technologies have the advantage of in situ visualization but are relatively expensive notably experiments can be performed quickly cheaply and safely through a visual experimental technology in quartz capillary without catalytic activity and with good corrosion resistance in recent years high pressure differential scanning calorimetry as a thermal analysis tool can easily distinguish different phase transitions and is an accurate technology for phase behaviors under high temperature and pressure conditions in addition a new technology rapid pressure released has been applied to collect salt powders under supercritical conditions but it may cause damage to reactor with a high risk 4 2 1 rapid pressure released it is of great significance to collect precipitated salt powders under supercritical conditions because the great majority of aggregate analyses such as scanning electron microscopy dynamic light scattering and granulometry cannot be performed in situ generally the salt powders are collected after the system is completely cooled and depressurized but it may re dissolve in water voisin et al 2018 designs an experimental setup dedicated to the recovery of precipitated salt powders which can be collected in a controllable manner as shown in fig 9 a after salt precipitation the water in reactor is removed by introducing pressurized nitrogen under the conditions studied flowing pressurized nitrogen instead of water nitrogen has high compressibility low heat capacity high chemical stability and neutrality can reduce the temperature and pressure of system ensuring that the solid salt powders in reactor is not re dissolved the salt powders are then analyzed by scanning electron microscopy dynamic light scattering and granulometry to obtain the size morphology and particle size distribution of aggregates it is found that na2so4 aggregates have no well definite shape and seemly consist of more small aggregates about 0 5 μ m and some larger ones about 10 μ m furthermore it seems that initial concentration does not affect final aggregate size or distribution wang et al 2020 in their patent invents a test system for the crystallization and deposition of inorganic salt in sub supercritical water moreover the authors design a similar experimental device the difference is that a rapid pressure released bypass for back pressure valve is installed instead of introducing pressurized nitrogen as displayed in fig 9 b through the established experimental device we study the deposition of na2so4 at 25 mpa and 500 c see fig 8 c and find that the collected inorganic salt particles are dry which can be well used for subsequent aggregate analyses 4 2 2 visual device visual analysis is a method that allows in situ observation but few transparent materials can withstand the supercritical conditions of high temperature and pressure fortunately sapphire is an excellent material that can withstand high temperature and pressure and is also a monocrystal material so it has low x ray absorption and is fully compatible with x ray scattering analysis a continuous tube setup is established for visual recording and synchrotron wide angles x ray scattering in situ analysis to track the formation of na2so4 particles in real time and to collect their nucleation and growth rates becker et al 2010 voisin et al 2017b dipippo 1998 dipippo et al 1999 constructs an optically accessible cell device made of inconel 625 and a sapphire window capable of withstanding 30 mpa and 600 c and armellini and teste 1991 armellini et al 1994 designs a similar apparatus to observe phase transitions and locate phase boundaries in the nacl h2o system under isobaric conditions a flow system armellini and teste 1991 armellini et al 1994 is added into the above cell to study the rapid or shock like precipitation in scw the shock crystallization experiments of nacl h2o and na2so4 h2o systems indicate that the equilibrium phase relationship is important for determining the morphology and size of particles formed in the scwo process and 1 μm na2so4 particles form in a very short time of 10 ms while nacl may not form crystals at 385 c hurst et al 2002 constructs a flow cell with a sapphire window for visual observation and raman spectroscopy of salt deposition and nucleation in near critical solutions the direct in situ observation method of salt crystalline phase is confirmed by raman spectroscopy it is found that na2so4 deposited from solution to hot finger at near critical temperature presents an i type crystal structure a stable form of hexagonal phase above 241 c after cooling in a n2 atmosphere the deposited salt shows a v phase structure a thenardite phase that is usually exhibited by crystals grown from aqueous solution at ambient conditions instead of metastable form iii an orthorhombic metastable phase exhibited at room temperature after cycling to high temperature which may be attributed to the presence of residual water vapor brodale and giauque 1972 hapanowicz and sr 1996 although it is feasible to study the precipitation and phase behavior of inorganic salts by building a visual flow cell or a capillary with a sapphire window and it also has the advantage of isobaric experiments it is expensive and not readily available therefore odu et al 2015 develops a visual technology equipped with quartz capillaries to study the phase behavior and precipitation of nacl h2o system and salt nucleation and growth in scw this method is first developed by potic et al 2004 to study the thermochemical conversion of wet biomass in scw experiments can be performed quickly cheaply and safely through this method quartz capillary can also withstand high temperature and pressure up to 60 mpa and 900 c and has no catalytic activity and good corrosion resistance but isobaric measurements are not possible because the pressure in capillary increases with temperature since the water vapor pressure mainly determines the total pressure the pressure in quartz capillary can be controlled by the initial amount of solution in the capillary potic et al 2004 the p t relationship for water in a closed system is used to estimate the pressure in capillary at different recording temperatures wagner et al 2000 two distinct regions are found to exist after the critical point is exceeded the first bubble appears at 380 c forming a vapor liquid v l region the liquid level in capillary decreases with continued heating thereby increasing the salt concentration in the liquid phase at 450 c a vapor liquid solid v l s transition phase appears and the system enters the vapor solid v s region the above observations are consistent with those of armellini and teste 1991 zhang et al 2021 also establishes a similar experimental setup to observe the phase equilibriums of nacl h2o na2hpo4 h2o and nacl na2hpo4 h2o systems 4 2 3 neutron radiography neutron radiography is a technology that can be used for in situ dynamic real time imaging it uses a uniformly collimated neutron beam with a small divergence angle to vertically penetrate the object to be tested for detection it can be used to explore the precipitation of various mixed inorganic salts in scw peterson et al 2008 studies the precipitation clogging and transport behavior of na2b4o7 k3po4 na2b4o7 na2so4 na2b4o7 strongly attenuates neutrons and can be used as a tracer and supercritical heavy water d2o d2o has a weak attenuation effect on neutron in separator by neutron photography no clogging is observed in the na2b4o7 k3po4 d2o system but it occurs in the na2b4o7 na2so4 d2o system however this technology is limited to artificial systems boron containing mixed salts e g na2b4o7 as the precipitation phase and heavy water d2o as the flowing phase it s called reverse phase imaging technology therefore peterson et al 2009 uses normal water 1h2o h2o strongly attenuates neutrons rather than heavy water 2h2o or d2o as a flowing phase and uses na2so4 or k3po4 without boron salts as experimental simulated salts this is called normal phase imaging technology and can be used to observe the precipitation of any salts without boron salts in scw it cannot clearly distinguish the regions of low water density and salt deposition but can provide fluid density changes that reverse phase imaging technology cannot na2so4 and k3po4 are found to have the same precipitation and transport behaviors as in the literature peterson et al 2008 and the clogging of na2so4 significantly reduced after adding k3po4 this is consistent with the results of tang et al 2014 and also with the suggestion by hazlebeck 2001 that adding phosphate during hydrothermal process can prevent clogging in addition peterson et al 2010 also uses neutron radiography to monitor the fluid flow behavior of continuous fluid phase in reactor in real time schubert et al 2012 2010a b systematically investigates the precipitation clogging and separation characteristics of various single and mixed salts in scw by neutron radiography technology in a continuous laboratory device specifically it includes type 1 salt nacl kcl etc type 2 salt na2co3 na2so4 and k2so4 type 1 and 1 salt kh2po4 k2hpo4 and nano3 k2co3 type 1 and 2 salt k3po4 na2so4 type 2 and 2 salt na2co3 k2so4 na3po4 k2so4 na3po4 na2so4 and na2so4 k2so4 type 1 salts can be recovered as concentrated brine without clogging reactor schubert et al 2010a while type 2 salts cannot be recovered and adhere to reactor wall causing reactor clogging schubert et al 2010b the precipitation and separation behaviors of kh2po4 k2hpo4 and nano3 k2co3 are similar to type 1 salts schubert et al 2010b na2co3 and k2so4 can also be recovered as concentrated brine since a certain amount of type 1 salt k2co3 may be formed schubert et al 2010b a k3po4 na2so4 mixture may be formed in a na3po4 k2so4 mixture in scw while the mixtures of na3po4 na2so4 and na2so4 k2so4 are true type 2 salt mixture and do not form a type 1 salt mixture schubert et al 2012 the na3po4 k2so4 mixture shows the same separation performance as k3po4 na2so4 indicating that the type 1 salt k3po4 is formed in the na3po4 k2so4 mixture the na3po4 na2so4 mixture is not recovered as concentrated brine and causes reactor clogging schubert et al 2012 but concentrated brine can be removed from na2so4 k2so4 mixture at 450 460 c which may be explained by the formation of mixed salt naxkyso4 schubert et al 2012 4 2 4 online diagnosis salt deposition experiments are conducted through some continuous devices and at the same time salt deposition and reactor clogging are dynamically detected by online diagnosis technology kawasaki et al 2007 investigates the flow characteristics and precipitation behavior of brine solution in a tube lab scale apparatus with low flow rates 0 8 65 cm s 1 and a tube bench scale apparatus with high flow rates 45 196 cm s 1 at high temperatures 350 600 c and pressures 25 mpa haroldsen et al 1996 studies the deposition characteristics of na2so4 on the inner surface of porous transpiring wall at different flow rates different temperatures and with or without a protective water film by online diagnosis technology and process observation filipovic 1999 studies nacl deposition in the ubc noram scwo pilot plant and finds that the deposition rate does not change with time but phase transitions are still observed filipovic 1999 performs the deposition experiments of na2so4 in a scwo continuous reactor of sandia national laboratory meanwhile the pressure is monitored to detect the pipeline clogging and evaluate the deposition rate the results show that the clogging rate is proportional to the flow rate of salt injected into reactor furthermore it takes longer to clog the pipeline at higher flow rates which is inconsistent with the findings of kawasaki et al 2007 zhang et al 2020 explains that a higher rate may increase the probability of intermolecular collision and salt diffusion to the wall resulting in faster deposition for low viscosity insoluble particles increasing speed improves particle transport capacity and reduces deposition but the conclusions still require discussion xu et al 2013 systematically studies the effects of pressure temperature operation time initial concentration and flow rate on deposition characteristics in scw using a continuous flow setup meanwhile two parameters including deposition rate and deposition speed related to the mass concentration of na2co3 in reactor effluent are defined to evaluate the deposition of na2co3 in reactor their results are basically consistent with those of lajeunesse et al 1993 except that they observes the opposite effect of pressure on deposition speed 4 2 5 high pressure differential scanning calorimetry high pressure differential scanning calorimetry is a thermal analysis tool used to measure the heat flow of a sample versus a reference it can easily distinguish different phase transitions under heating mode such as the precipitation of solid salts or the emergence of a second liquid phase it is an accurate technology for exploring the phase behaviors of brine solution at hydrothermal conditions abdulagatov et al 1998 reimer and vogel 2013 reimer and vogel 2013 obtains some new data on solid phase precipitation of na2so4 h2o k2so4 h2o and k2hpo4 h2o systems at low concentration range 0 14 15 0 wt calorimetric measurement of liquid liquid immiscibility in hydrothermal salt solution is reported for the first time furthermore it is found that liquid liquid immiscibility is observed in the k2so4 na2so4 h2o system and thus it is considered that the phase behavior of this ternary system is similar to that of binary type 1d salt solution although it consists of two type 2 salts then reimer and vogel 2016 again utilizes this technology to study the phase behavior and precipitation of various ternary systems by detecting precipitation immiscibility limit and supercritical homogenization 4 2 6 hot finger hurst et al 2002 and hodes et al 2004a 2004b hodes 1998 insert a heating cylinder heat finger laterally into a micro scwo reactor and then gradually heat the salt solution through heat finger heat finger is kept at a temperature 10 c higher than salt solution to drive salt deposition combined with visual technology the solubility the surface temperature of hot finger is measured when precipitation occur and deposition rate c of na2so4 and k2so4 solutions are studied in scw see fig 8 a and b after a solution of 4 wt na2so4 10 47 g min 1 or k2so4 10 39 g min 1 flows through hot finger for 15 or 10 min the precipitation of k2so4 is dendritic but that of na2so4 is not the thickness of salt layer formed on heat finger is equal to the radius of heat finger after only 10 min the salt deposition rate is about 1 g min 1 as a function of time and salt concentration hodes et al 2003 hodes 1998 however one drawback of hot finger technology is that it must be removed after each operation to measure the mass of deposited salt 5 a new idea inhibiting salt deposition although many institutions and scholars are devoted to weakening the salt deposition during scwo process by the above methods there exist still many problems in practical applications notably molten salt as a reaction medium has high solubility and thermal stability for inorganics frangini and masi 2016 lovering and shrivenham 1982 and has been applied in many aspects wan et al 2015 2017 wang et al 2013 2016b 2016c 2017 conduct extensive studies on molten salt in geochemistry which is of great significance for exploring the melting properties of salts at high temperature especially supercritical conditions mcbrayer et al 1997 1998 first mentions in their patents that after adding the salts with low melting points e g nano3 kno3 naoh and koh the melting point of mixed salts can be lowered thus maintaining a fluid state and avoiding reactor clogging hazlebeck 2001 reports in his patent that the addition of phosphate compounds inhibits the deposition of salts in reactor reimer and vogel 2016 demonstrate the existence of melting phenomenon after mixing sulfate and phosphate many studies have been carried out on the melting properties of various salts under normal conditions but very few under supercritical conditions notably duverger nédellec et al 2020 voisin et al 2020 for the first time reports the application of molten salt in scw and investigates molten naoh in scw and its dissolution effect on deposited na2so4 the results indicate that the concentration of the first effluent sample is 1000 ppm about 5 ppm under the same condition if no naoh is added after injecting naoh into the system at 400 420 c and 25 mpa proving that the salt deposit formed can be dissolved and removed via injecting the salts with low melting point into the system subsequently zhang et al 2021 studies the scwo treatment of glyphosate wastewater nacl is main component but no salt deposition or system clogging is observed after testing and detailed analysis it is found that an amount of na2hpo4 its melting temperature is as low as 250 c is produced during scwo treatment process then the melting phenomenon of na2hpo4 is verified by a visual phase equilibrium apparatus zhang et al 2021 voisin et al 2020 and zhang et al 2021 point out that the melting points of other coexisting salts with high melting points is lowered or melt dissolve in the salts with low melting points if the salts with low melting points e g nano3 kno3 na2hpo4 nah2po4 naoh koh etc are added to the scwo system therefore the molten fluid called hydrothermal molten salt hymos is formed at low temperature and then flows out with feed stream effectively avoiding the clogging of reactor and pipeline in addition zhang et al 2021 finds that na2hpo4 and nacl melt in sub supercritical water with melting points lower than those of pure salt and ambient pressure conditions this can be explained by the arrangement of water molecules and inorganic salt ions after adding other salts to a pure solution due to different properties such as ion size and charge they may alternately arrange among ions and become more disordered further lowering the melting point of mixture the formation and redissolution process of hymos is as follows a homogeneous electrolyte of salt solution is first injected into the scwo system under pressure and heated simultaneously precipitation occurs when a certain temperature is reached as the precipitation temperature is higher than the melting point the precipitated salt immediately melts to form hymos the molten salt returns to the initial homogeneous electrolyte salt solution as it flows to aftercooler system thus avoiding clogging caused by salt deposition fig 10 displays the formation and re dissolution of hymos for typical nano3 with low melting point and na2so4 with high melting point nano3 may first melt in the low temperature region owing to its low melting point and then gradually dissolve melt supersaturated na2so4 with high melting point as temperature increases thus forming a mixed hymos system as shown in fig 10 a the other mechanism is that the melting point of other coexisting salts may be lowered due to the presence of the salts with low melting point then they may melt simultaneously at a certain temperature as displayed in fig 10 b 6 conclusions and prospects the present work summarizes and updates systematically the research status of the characteristics mechanisms and measurement methods of inorganic salt dissolution and deposition in sub supercritical water inorganic salts are reclassified in detail based on the melting points almost all of type 2 salts have higher melting points 600 c except for na3po4 and coso4 374 c and these of most sulfate and carbonate salts are 800 c while 600 c for most nitrate and phosphate salts the phase diagram characteristics of typical binary nacl h2o and na2so4 h2o and ternary nacl na2so4 h2o systems are analyzed the addition of nacl increases the solubility of na2so4 by several orders of magnitude which can be explained by the formation of nacl dense brine phase six related theories about salt dissolution mechanisms in sub supercritical water are introduced and it is generally believed that they should be considered when analyzing the interactions of various salts in multiple brine system more comprehensive measurement methods of salt solubility are reviewed of which salt precipitation and salt bed are the most common ones besides various salt deposition testing methods are summed up in detail among which the rapid pressure released technology has great advantages as a method to obtain the salt particles for off line analyses finally a new idea hydrothermal molten salt system is reviewed which indicates that salts with low melting point can dissolve ones with high melting point and thus avoiding salt deposition during scwo process these findings can provide valuable guidance for solving the salt deposition problem during scwo treatment of organic wastewater currently the fundamental data on the solubility and deposition properties of binary brine solutions let alone ternary or higher systems are still lacking in fact feedstock contains various inorganic salts organic matter water oxidant etc except for a study on the precipitation of na2so4 and na2co3 in the real scw environment containing c2h5oh and h2o2 chen et al 2022 there are few data on the real mixed brine solutions thus the follow up studies should firstly focus on obtaining the data of pure salt solutions in near supercritical and then the influences of other components in addition the hydrothermal molten salt system should attract more attention declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

15418,hydrated electron eaq based photochemical processes have emerged as a promising technology for contaminant removal in water due to the mild operating conditions this review aims to provide a comprehensive and up to date summary on eaq based photochemical processes for the decomposition of various oxidative contaminants specifically the characteristics of different photo reductive systems are first elaborated including the environment required to generate sufficient eaq the advantages and disadvantages of each system and the comparison of the degradation efficiency of contaminants induced by eaq in addition the identification methods of eaq e g laser flash photolysis scavenging studies chemical probes and electron spin resonance techniques are summarized and the influences of operating conditions e g solution ph dissolved oxygen source chemical concentration and uv type on the performance of contaminants are also discussed considering the complexity of contaminated water particular attention is paid to the influence of water matrix e g coexisting anions alkalinity and humic acid moreover the degradation regularities of various contaminants e g perfluorinated compounds disinfection by products and nitrate by eaq are summarized we finally put forward several research prospects for the decomposition of contaminants by eaq based photochemical processes to promote their practical application in water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrated electron photochemical processes water treatment perfluorinated compounds disinfection by products data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction photochemical reduction processes have attracted increasing attention as a promising water treatment technology dong et al 2018 liu et al 2020 the principle of photochemical reduction processes is that using ultraviolet light uv as the activation method to generate reductive radical species thereby reducing various oxidative contaminants xiao et al 2017a in fact the effect of photochemical reduction processes in decomposing contaminants depends on the types of reductive radical species involving hydrated electron eaq h atom h and sulfite radical anions so 3 by comparing the reduction potentials of eaq 2 9 v h 2 3 v and so 3 0 63 v eaq is considered to be the most effective active radical buxton et al 1988 thus compared with conventional oxidation and biodegradation eaq based photochemical processes exhibit higher efficiency and milder operation conditions in the degradation of contaminants for example the degradation efficiency of hfpo da by uv sulfite within 3 h was 100 which was much higher than that by uv persulfate 5 indicating that eaq based photochemical processes are more effective than oxidative processes bao et al 2018 similarly bromate at a concentration of 0 1 mm needed to be cultured in sulfur containing microorganisms for 5 d to be biodegraded chairez et al 2010 while bromate at the same concentration could be completely decomposed with 2 h under eaq attack xiao et al 2017b implying that eaq based photochemical processes require shorter cycle and simpler operation than biodegradation furthermore contaminants are easily attacked by eaq to form short chain intermediates which can reduce toxicity and enhance biodegradability of parent compound yu et al 2018 cui et al 2020 generally eaq is mainly generated by two different photolysis methods including direct photolysis and indirect photolysis in direct photolysis system eaq h and hydroxyl radical oh are generated by the photoionization of liquid water under vacuum ultraviolet irradiation vuv 185 nm zoschke et al 2014 esfahani and mohseni 2022 however the photon energy required for direct photolysis is high 647 kj mol 1 gu et al 2017a and the quantum yield of eaq is low 0 045 esfahani and mohseni 2022 therefore more attention is paid for the indirect photolysis due to its high eaq generation and mild reaction conditions in indirect photolysis system sufficient eaq is generated by inorganic anions iodide sulfite and organic solutes aminopolycarboxylic acid indole derivative under uv irradiation thus decomposing a variety of contaminants including perfluorinated compounds pfcs park et al 2009 qu et al 2014 bao et al 2019a disinfection by products dbps li et al 2012 jung et al 2016 nitrate tan et al 2021 the literatures focusing on contaminant reduction using eaq based photochemical processes are listed in tables 1 3 1 r φ i 0 1 1 0 ε cl v in fact the eaq formation rate r in different photo reductive systems can be calculated via eq 1 where φ is the quantum yield of source chemical photolysis mol e 1 ε is the molar adsorption coefficient of source chemical m 1 cm 1 i 0 is the photon flux entering the solution e s 1 c is source chemical concentration m l is effective path length due to the different characteristics e g quantum yield and molar coefficient of eaq source chemicals the conditions required for them to generate sufficient eaq under uv irradiation are also different therefore a systematic review of eaq generated by different photo reductive system is conducted to promote the development and application of this technology in the decomposition of oxidative contaminants in water this review has the following objectives i the characteristics of different photo reductive systems are presented and their advantages and disadvantages are elucidated for readers to select a suitable system for degrading oxidative contaminants ii the currently reported identification methods of eaq are summarized to further explore the degradation behavior and pathway of contaminants by eaq iii the factors affecting the decomposition efficiency are analyzed and compared in order to achieve complete degradation of contaminants under appropriate operation conditions iv the degradation characteristics of pfcs dbps and nitrate are discussed to provide a technically feasible method for the application of eaq based photochemical processes in contaminated water v the knowledge demands and research prospects of eaq based photochemical processes are proposed to meet the application challenges 2 eaq generated by different photo reductive systems 2 1 uv iodide since eaq generated by iodide under uv irradiation is demonstrated to have high quantum yield and molar absorptivity sauer et al 2004 the application of uv iodide system in the degradation of various contaminants has attracted increasing attention as listed in table 1 generally the photoionization of iodide i in water produces iodide radical i and eaq via charge transfer to solvent state ctts via eq 2 specifically an excited iodide i h 2 o is generated by iodide under uv irradiation followed by decaying to a ground state i or degrading to a caged complex i e via eqs 3 5 finally the caged complex dissociates into eaq and i via eq 6 2 i hv i ctts i e aq 3 i h 2 o hv i h 2 o 4 i h 2 o i h 2 o 5 i h 2 o i e h 2 o 6 i e i e aq 7 i o 2 h 2 o 2 i 2 4 o h 8 i 2 o 2 h i 2 h o 2 the quantum yield of eaq generated by uv iodide at wavelengths of 248 nm is 0 286 0 008 which is higher than that of uv sulfite 0 108 0 001 sauer et al 2004 and the molar absorption coefficient of iodide 400 m 1 cm 1 is also higher sulfite 30 m 1 cm 1 at 248 nm sauer et al 2004 therefore the eaq source chemical concentration used in uv iodide system is an order of magnitude lower than in uv sulfite system which avoids chemical waste fig 1 c for example achieving almost 80 defluorination of pfoa 10 35 mg l 1 required photolysis of 10 mm sulfite abusallout et al 2021 or 0 3 mm iodide qu et al 2010 compared with 20 mm sulfite k 0 008 min 1 the pseudo first order rate constant between pfos and 0 3 mm iodide was higher k 0 0295 min 1 qu et al 2014 implying that efficient degradation of pfos could be achieved in the presence of low concentration iodide what s more compared with uv sulfite uv iodide is still capable of decomposing contaminants under mildly acidic conditions fig 1a for instance uv iodide achieved 98 pfos degradation at ph 6 5 park et al 2009 whereas pfos defluorination was significantly inhibited by uv sulfite at ph 7 gu et al 2017a however the photolysis of iodide generates undesirable products such as iodine i2 and triiodide i3 which absorb visible light rahn et al 1997 besides the photolysis process of iodide is easily influenced by dissolved oxygen which limits its practical engineering application fig 1b in addition to quenching eaq dissolved oxygen quenches i and i 2 iodine anion radical via eqs 7 and 8 resulting in low degradation efficiency of contaminants for example qu et al presented that the defluorination rate of pfoa with n2 bubbling was 98 8 and 5 when o2 was used qu et al 2010 2 2 uv sulfite since the 1960s the photoionization of sulfite so3 2 in water has been extensively investigated dogliotti et al 1968 in the process of uv irradiation eaq so 3 and h are generated by sulfite via eqs 9 and 10 later more attention was paid to the application of uv sulfite system as seen in table 2 9 so 3 2 hv so 3 e aq 10 hso 3 hv so 3 h 11 hso 3 e aq so 3 2 h 12 h o h h 2 o e aq 13 so 3 o 2 so 5 14 so 5 so 3 2 so 4 so 4 2 15 so 4 so 3 2 so 3 so 4 2 due to the high reactivity eaq with o2 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 dissolved oxygen do does have a negative impact on the degradation of contaminants in uv sulfite system qiao et al 2019 seid et al 2020 tan et al 2021 however the addition of sufficient sulfite is capable of depleting o2 enabling the uv sulfite system to decompose contaminants even under aerobic conditions abusallout et al 2021 esfahani and mohseni 2022 gu et al 2017b xiao et al 2017a liu et al 2014 gu et al 2016 fig 1b this is because when the molar ratio of sulfite to do is larger than 2 1 do can be completely consumed through a series of chain photo reaction generally 10 20 mm of sulfite was applied in uv sulfite system which can consume most of dissolved oxygen 3 8 mg l 1 in water abusallout et al 2021 leading to a very low level of residual o2 0 2 mg l 1 and sufficient sulfite in the reactor esfahani and mohseni 2022 therefore it can be concluded that high concentration sulfite can eliminate the quenching effect of do and maintain the steady concentration of eaq which is conductive to the reduction of contaminants by uv sulfite system for example gu et al found that uv sulfite 10 mm achieved 100 pfoa degradation efficiency at 10 min in the presence of o2 5 mg l 1 respectively gu et al 2017b likewise abusallout et al reported that in the presence of do concentrations of 1 0 mg l 1 5 0 mg l 1 and 8 0 mg l 1 uv sulfite exhibited similar defluorination efficiency of pfoa 80 abusallout et al 2021 in particular liu et al reported that the addition of 2 5 mm sulfite in pilot scale uv sulfite system could effectively eliminate the adverse effects of do liu et al 2021 this also indicates that adding a certain concentration of sulfite is an efficient strategy to achieve deoxidation instead of injecting inert gas notably due to the low molar adsorption coefficient at 248 nm 30 m 1 cm 1 and low quantum yield of eaq 0 108 0 001 248 nm the sulfite concentration required in the reaction is high 10 20 mm resulting in excessive consumption of eaq source chemicals fig 1c generally the degradation rate of contaminants e g pfos gu et al 2017a hfpo da bao et al 2018 f 53b bao et al 2019a increases as increasing sulfite concentration to 20 mm for example gu et al found that the degradation rate constant of pfos in uv sulfite system increased from 0 0022 0 004 min 1 to 0 0145 0 006 min 1 as increasing sulfite concentration from 1 to 20 mm gu et al 2017a besides due to the high required so3 2 concentration the effluent concentration of sulfate ions so4 2 produced by the reaction is higher than the standards for drinking water quality of china 250 mg l 1 2 61 mm which may pose a threaten to the environment in addition the degradation of contaminants in uv sulfite system is mostly performed under alkaline conditions fig 1a which is attributed to the fact that ph determines the species distribution of sulfur species so3 2 or bisulfite hso3 for example gu et al found that the decomposition of pfos was totally suppressed at ph 7 0 and the reaction rate constant of pfos by uv sulfite at ph 9 2 0 118 min 1 was much higher than that at ph 8 0 0 026 min 1 gu et al 2016 likewise esfahani et al reported that the removal efficiency of pfos in uv sulfite system at ph 3 3 7 0 and 9 1 was 6 9 8 and 55 1 respectively indicating alkaline condition was more favorable for reducing various contaminants esfahani and mohseni 2022 this is due to that more than 99 so3 2 are found in the solution at ph 9 1 xiao et al 2017b which generates more eaq under uv irradiation in alkaline solution while at ph 7 2 the dominant species is hso3 which generates more h with low reducing ability via eq 10 meanwhile eaq is also easily quenched by h and hso3 at low ph maza et al 2019 which decreases the yield of eaq 2 3 uv apca commonly eaq is easily quenched by oxidizing species e g oh o 2 ho 2 leading to low yield and short lifetime of eaq to address this issue aminopolycarboxylic acid apca is used as oh quenchers to enhance eaq yield due to their excellent electron donating ability apcas are a class of compounds with multiple carboxyl groups linked to a single or multiple n atoms mainly including nitrilotriacetic acid nta and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta it was reported that nta and edta were used to decompose pfos under uv irradiation gu et al 2020 table 3 the phenomenon could be explained by two aspects on the one hand the fully hydrated nta after hydration spheres can act as a photosensitizer to induce water photodissociation and photoionization to generate eaq sun et al 2018 on the other hand the reaction rate constant of apca with oh 109 m 1 s 1 is significantly higher than that with eaq 106 m 1 s 1 leitner et al 2003 so oh can be quenched by nta and edta preventing the recombination between eaq and oh and in turn extending the survival time of eaq for instance compared with uv sulfite 1 ns lian et al 2004 and uv iodide 2 ns qu et al 2010 the lifetime of eaq generated by uv nta can be extended to 11 6 μs sun et al 2018 respectively compared with uv iodide the degradation of contaminants can be achieved by uv apca system under aerobic conditions fig 1b for example gu et al reported that uv edta defluorinated 51 19 and 50 06 pfos in the absence and presence of do respectively gu et al 2020 similar phenomenon was also found in other studies sun et al 2018 this was attributed to the fact that apca was capable of quenching various oxidative species e g o 2 ho 2 in the presence of o2 however the photolysis of apca produces amine compound with a foul odor which limits its practical application sun et al 2018 liu et al 2021 2 4 uv indole derivative it is noticed that the photolysis of iodide and sulfite generate eaq however the requirement for alkaline or anoxic environment limits its industrial application therefore more attention has been paid to the photoionization of aromatic compounds joschek and grossweiner 1966 indole derivatives indole or its derivatives as representative aromatic compounds have received extensive attention due to their wide distribution in nature in general the photoionization of indole eq 16 and its derivative e g 3 indole acetic acid iaa generates eaq and radical cations chen et al 2021 among them the eaq quantum yield of iaa is higher than that of indole under uv irradiation and its quantum yield increases with the shortening of the excitation wavelength pigault et al 1982 tian et al 2016 the literatures concentrating on pfcs reduction using uv indole derivative are listed in table 3 16 indole hv e aq indol e it was reported that uv indole could degrade contaminants over a ph range of ph 4 8 under aerobic conditions indicating that the system has the potential for practical application chen et al 2021 however the yield of eaq in uv indole derivative system is low due to the quenching effect of eaq by the simultaneously formed radical cations h and o2 tian et al 2015 therefore adding organo montmorillonite tian et al 2016 2018 chen et al 2019a or cationic surfactant chen et al 2020a 2020b into uv indole derivative system can promote the yield of eaq thus decomposing contaminants more effectively firstly the addition of organo montmorillonite can effectively promote the degradation efficiency of contaminants in uv indole derivative for instance the degradation rate constant of pfoa by uv iaa with montmorillonite was 0 0098 min 1 at ph 6 tian et al 2018 which was 2 times higher than that by uv iaa system 0 0044 min 1 at ph 6 chen et al 2020b this could be explained by the fact that the unique structure of organo montmorillonite prevents the diffusion of h and o2 into the clay interlayer in uv iaa system tian et al 2016 2018 in particular the presence of montmorillonite also broadens the applicable ph range of uv indole derivative system 3 11 tian et al 2016 secondly the addition of cationic surfactant e g cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab also enhances the degradation efficiency of contaminants by uv indole derivative for instance chen et al presented that the rate constant of pfoa degradation in uv iaa in the presence of ctab was 0 0278 min 1 which was much higher than that of in uv iaa 0 0044 min 1 chen et al 2020b this was attributed to the fact that ctab co adsorbs indole derivative and pfoa to form self assembled micelle system on the one hand the regionally confined micelle is able to accelerate the transfer of eaq from indole derivative to pfoa on the other hand the micelle system can repel h and o2 away from system due to its high ζ potential therefore providing a barrier for internal reduction reactions interestingly the formed micelle system can be directly separated from the solution because of its self agglomeration and sedimentation avoiding secondary pollution hence the degradation of pfoa can be realized by uv indole derivative system under ambient conditions e g room temperature neutral and aerobic conditions fig 1 making it potential for decomposing pfas in practical contaminated water however compared with uv iodide and uv sulfite system uv indole derivative system exhibits lower kinetics which needs to further study in the future 3 identification of eaq eaq generated by the activation of different source chemicals including sulfite iodide apca indole and its derivative has been already summarized in section 2 it is common that the identification of reactive species is closely related to degradation mechanism behavior and pathway of contaminants meanwhile it is crucial to distinguish the dominant role of eaq or h in the system due to their high reducing ability at present the main technologies for identifying eaq include laser flash photolysis scavenging studies electron spin resonance techniques fig 2 3 1 laser flash photolysis laser flash photolysis lep is a nanoscale transient absorption technique which is quantitatively capable of identifying free radicals this is a way to directly detect the generation and contribution of eaq generated by source chemical the transient absorption spectra from 300 nm to 710 nm is measured at 10 nm intervals and the broad and asymmetric optical absorption peak at 690 nm is attribute to the generation signal of eaq huang et al 2007 as reported the adsorption peak intensity of eaq decreased with the extension of monitoring time demonstrating that eaq was continuously reacting with contaminants or their intermediates for example sun et al presented that as the monitoring time increased from 0 1 to 9 0 μs the peak intensity at 690 nm decreased continuously indicating that eaq were reacting with pfos or other intermediates fig 3 a sun et al 2018 moreover the life time of eaq τ is calculated by measuring the absorption attenuation kinetics of eaq at 690 nm which can be used to quantify the reaction efficiency between eaq and contaminants chen et al 2020a τ is calculated based on the least square fitting of the kinetic equation after normalization eq 17 among them b i is the amplitude of the curve at time 0 τ i is the representative of different decay processes representing the decay from the beginning to 37 of the initial signal value notably the lower the value of τ the faster the decay of eaq that is the higher reaction efficiency between eaq and contaminants for instance chen et al described the decay kinetics of pfoa indole and its derivatives it was found that eaq generated in the donaxine pfoa system had the shortest lifetime τ 1305 3 ns compared with 3 iaa 1 iaa and indole suggesting that eaq generated by donaxine had a higher reaction efficiency towards pfoa fig 3b chen et al 2021 therefore lep studies give a proof to confirm the existence and mechanism of eaq 17 r t b 1 e t τ 1 b 2 e t τ 2 b 3 e t τ 3 b 4 e t τ 4 3 2 quenching studies and chemical probes since large scale lep experimental equipment is not common in the laboratory a simpler method for the identification of free radicals is required quenching studies refers to the purposeful quenching of reactive species using the specificity of quenchers so that the contribution of each reactive species can be indirectly distinguished by studying the inhibitory effect of contaminants because both h and eaq are reducing radicals quenchers are mainly used to identify the generation and contribution of eaq or h table 4 exhibits the reaction rate constant of quenchers with reactive active species n2o no2 and no3 are generally used to identify whether eaq or h is the predominant reactive species in the reaction system li et al 2012 ren et al 2021 xie et al 2017 specifically and no2 can effectively quench eaq and h whereas no3 are only able to quench eaq owing to their distinct second order rate constants eqs 18 21 buxton et al 1988 as a result the dominant role of eaq can be demonstrated by investigating the respective inhibitory effects of no2 and no3 on the degradation of contaminants for instance li et al found that the degradation rate of mcaa in uv sulfite system was 99 while significant inhibition was found in addition of no2 and no3 18 thereby indicating the predominant role of eaq in the degradation of mcaa by uv sulfite li et al 2012 xiao et al showed that complete bromate degradation was achieved by uv sulfite within 60 min however the degradation rate of bromate in the presence of 0 4 mm no2 and no3 at ph 4 was 7 and 42 respectively finding that the reduction reaction was only largely inhibited by no2 instead of no3 at ph 4 which proved the contribution of eaq and h fig 4 a meanwhile it was also found by xiao et al that the degradation rate of bromate was largely inhibited by both no2 and no3 at ph 9 24 indicating that eaq was the dominant reactive species fig 4b xiao et al 2017b in addition to no2 and no3 n2o was selected as quenching agent to indirectly prove the role of eaq because of its different reactivity towards eaq and h eq 22 and 23 for example sun et al presented that the defluorination rate of pfos in the presence and absence of n2o were 8 and 46 8 respectively indicating that eaq was the predominant role in the reductive process sun et al 2018 18 no 2 e aq n o 2 2 19 no 2 h no o h 20 no 3 e aq n o 3 2 21 no 3 h n o 3 h 22 n 2 o e aq n 2 oh o h 23 n 2 o h n 2 oh 24 c h 2 clco o e aq c h 2 co o c l 25 c h 2 clco o h chclo o h 2 mcaa is established as a chemical probe to confirm the role of eaq because the produced by the reaction of mcaa with eaq and h are different via eqs 24 and 25 li et al 2014 this can be demonstrated that the primary role of eaq can be determined by the release of cl in the dichlorination of mcaa while h can react with mcaa to release h2 by abstracting h for instance gu j et al reported that cl was formed in the degradation process of mcaa indicating eaq was responsible for the dichlorination of mcaa gu et al 2017c similar results are found by li et al that negligible degradation effect of mcaa 5 was observed at ph 6 implying that at this ph the dominant species is not eaq li et al 2012 it is worth noting that mcaa is also reported to estimate the steady state concentration of eaq eaq ss because its high reactivity towards eaq gu et al 2017c yu et al 2018 fennell et al 2022b eaq ss of photo reductive system can be calculated via eq 26 where k i is the second order rate constant between eaq and quencher s i s i is s i concentration r e is eaq formation rate 26 e aq ss r e k i s i k 2 mcaa 3 3 electron spin resonance technique as an auxiliary technique electron spin resonance technique esr can be combined with lep or quenching experiments to further demonstrate the dominant role of eaq esr is a technique that can detect free radicals generated in chemical or biological processes wang et al 2011 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrole oxynitride dmpo is commonly used as a trapping agent for in situ detection of eaq generated in the reaction resulting in esr spectrum with dmpo electron dmpo h signals via eq 27 as reported the signals for dmpo h a n no 16 51 0 01 g a h ch2 22 59 0 01 g were due to the generation of eaq madden et al 2001 what s more the dmpo h spin adduct has nine splitting peaks and the signal intensities of these peaks are 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 fig 4c it is common that the stronger these peak signals of dmpo h the higher the generation capacity of eaq for example chen et al found that the dmpo h intensity of 3 iaa was higher than indole and other derivatives indicating the generation capacity of eaq in 3 iaa solution was better than that in other solutions fig 4d chen et al 2021 this further confirms the existence of eaq which is consistent with the results of quenching studies 27 dmpo e aq h dmpo h 4 effects of experimental parameters 4 1 solution ph solution ph remarkably influences the availability of eaq and the distribution ratio of eaq source chemicals which affects the decomposition efficiency of contaminants generally increasing ph is facilitate to decompose contaminants and the optimum ph for the degradation process is 9 12 qu et al 2014 gu et al 2017a liu et al 2021 for example the rate constant of pfoa in uv ki system at 10 0 was 0 0295 min 1 which was more than 49 times higher than the rate constant at ph 5 0 0 0006 min 1 qu et al 2014 similarly the defluorination efficiency of pfos increased from 6 to 65 as increasing ph from 6 0 to 10 0 besides the degradation efficiency of mcaa by uv sulfite increased obviously from 10 to 98 when ph increased from 6 0 to 10 1 li et al 2012 bromate removal efficiency in uv sulfite system increased from 19 to 100 as ph increasing from 5 to 10 liu et al 2014 the results show that the reductive process is more efficient under alkaline conditions this can be explained from two aspects on the one hand solution ph determines the interconversion between eaq and h it is believed that eaq is rapidly quenched by h to form h at near neutral ph 7 1 via eq 28 whereas h reacts with oh to convert to eaq at high ph 8 7 via eq 29 additionally it was found that the yield of eaq in uv sulfite system at ph 9 was 4 5 orders of magnitude greater than that at ph 4 5 meanwhile the quenching rate of eaq by h was reported to decrease by 1 order of magnitude for every increase in ph value buxton et al 1988 as a result alkaline conditions promote the net yield of eaq more than under acidic conditions thereby promoting the degradation efficiency of contaminants for example gu et al presented that the defluorination rate of pfos by uv sulfite at ph 9 was 52 which was 7 4 times higher than that at ph 6 0 7 gu et al 2017a 28 e aq h h 29 o h h e aq h 2 o on the other hand solution ph significantly influences the distribution of eaq source chemical which further affects the generation of different reduction system among them eaq source chemicals that are easily affected by ph are mainly sulfite and iodide in uv sulfite system pka of sulfite is 7 2 implying that hso3 is dominant at ph 3 7 and so3 2 is dominant at ph 7 2 esfahani and mohseni 2022 it is common that so3 2 undergoes a protonation reaction at low ph to produce hso3 and then generates h instead of eaq under uv irradiation for example esfahani et al found that a significant increase of pfos degradation from 8 to 55 1 as ph increasing from 4 6 to 9 1 which was due to that more eaq was generated by so3 2 in alkaline solution thereby achieving efficient degradation of pfos esfahani and mohseni 2022 furthermore in uv iodide system i2 disproportionates with oh to generate i at higher ph value 8 5 which further promotes the generation of eaq eq 35 in the meantime less i 2 and i 3 are generated which decreases the consumption of eaq via eqs 30 34 therefore high concentration eaq is realized under alkaline conditions due to the disproportionation reaction of i2 for example qu et al presented that the decomposition rate constant of pfoa by uv iodide at ph 9 0 was 0 0287 min 1 which was almost 48 times higher than that at ph 5 0 0 0006 min 1 qu et al 2014 this was attributed to the fact that alkaline conditions were more capable of promoting the recycle of i and inhibiting the quenching of eaq thus promoting the reduction process of pfoa 30 i i i 2 31 i i i 2 32 i i 2 i 3 33 e aq i 2 i 2 34 e aq i 3 i 2 i 35 3 i 2 6 o h io 3 5 i 3 h 2 o to avoid inhibitory effect of low ph on the reductive degradation process many efforts have been made for example gu et al added organo montmorillonite to uv indole system finding that 70 defluorination of pfoa was achieved even at ph 3 tian et al 2016 this was because protons in the structure of montmorillonite could be replaced by the hydrophobic phase which in turn prevented eaq being quenched by h similar results of wide ph range 3 11 were reported for the degradation of pfcs by uv indole derivatives in the presence of montmorillonite modified with different surfactants e g pvpcos ala chen et al 2019a kugler et al 2021 in addition chen et al developed a self assembled micelle composed of ctab modified iaa and pfoa finding that the micelle had almost same rate constant of pfoa at ph 4 8 0 75 0 1 h 1 indicating that uv ctab iaa system was capable of degrading pfoa in a wide ph range chen et al 2020b the phenomenon was attributed to the fact that the positively charged micelle protected the inner rection reaction inside from h 4 2 dissolved oxygen the presence of dissolved oxygen do obviously decreases the degradation efficiency of contaminants the negative impact is due to the quenching effect of do on eaq k 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 liu et al 2014 besides do reduces the yield of eaq because of its ability to adsorb some photons lyu et al 2015a in general the inhibitory effect of do on the decomposition of contaminants is very strong due to the continuous existence of do for example park et al found that the degradation of pfos by uv iodide at 150 min with ar bubbling was 95 which was much higher than that of with air bubbling 2 park et al 2009 additionally qu et al presented overall defluorination efficiency of pfoa in uv iodide system was 98 and 5 in the presence and absence of o2 respectively qu et al 2010 cao et al showed that the defluorination rate of f 53b by uv iodide with n2 bubbling was 25 65 which was higher than that of with o2 bubbling 11 08 cao et al 2022 liu et al found that uv sulfite achieved 81 bromate degradation efficiency with n2 bubbling 0 5 l min 1 while uv sulfite only degraded 27 bromate with do bubbling 0 5 l min 1 liu et al 2014 these findings show that the efficient degradation of contaminants requires strict anaerobic conditions however efforts have been made to minimize the quenching effect of o2 on eaq a strategy is to select an appropriate eaq source chemical for photoionization to minimize the adverse effect of do gu et al 2017b esfahani et al 2022 among them sulfite is reported to be a source chemical that avoids the quenching effect of eaq for instance gu et al proposed that the degradation efficiency of pfos by uv sulfite was almost the same in o2 purging solution as in n2 puring solution gu et al 2016 this was because the formed so 3 reacted with o2 via eq 13 followed by a chain photoreaction with sulfite via eqs 14 and 15 when the molar ratio of do to sulfite was 1 2 do was almost quenched by sulfite thereby promoting the net yield of eaq esfahani and mohseni 2022 as a result the quenching of do on eaq can be minimized which is favorable for applying in environmental engineering in addition to sulfite apca also inhibits the quenching effect of do for example sun et al found that the defluorination rate of pfos by uv nta were 46 8 and 35 8 under n2 and air saturation respectively sun et al 2018 the phenomenon was due to that nta and excited nta nta were capable of reacting with o2 when air was present thereby promoting the net yield of eaq which in turn improved the degradation of pfos notably organo montmorillonite was reported to protect eaq from quenching by o2 enabling uv indole derivative to perform at ambient conditions zhang et al 2018 for instance chen et al added organo montmorillonite in uv iaa system finding that pfoa were completely removed under both n2 and ambient conditions chen et al 2019a this was because montmorillonite could not only adsorb iaa and pfoa to the interlayer but also the hydrophobic phase used for modification effectively prevented o2 from entering the interlayer to quench eaq 4 3 eaq source chemical concentration the concentration of eaq source chemical e g sulfite iodide is an essential factor in decomposing contaminants because it is directly related to the generation of eaq in uv iodide system the removal efficiency of pfas increases with the increase of i concentration within a certain range and then decreases with the increase of i concentration as reported the range of iodide concentration was 0 25 10 mm qu et al 2014 sun et al 2017a 2017b and the optimum i concentration was mostly 0 3 mm guo et al 2018 cao et al 2022 for example qu et al found that the defluorination rate of pfoa by uv iodide increased from 2 to 98 9 as increasing i concentration from 0 mm to 0 3 mm and decreased to 4 as increasing i concentration to 0 7 mm qu et al 2010 the adverse effect of excess i concentration was that generated i2 and i3 in the reaction was capable of quenching eaq resulting in low yields of eaq eqs 33 and 34 similarly pfas decomposition efficiency is proportional to so3 2 concentration in general more eaq produced as increasing so3 2 concentration 1 20 mm gu et al 2017a esfahani and mohseni 2022 and the optimum so3 2 concentration for decomposing pfas is 20 mm bao et al 2018 for example song et al presented that the degradation ratio of pfoa increased from 5 6 to 90 when the so3 2 concentration increased from 0 5 to 20 mm which could be explained by the linear relationship between the calculated relative quasi stationary concentration of eaq and sulfite concentration song et al 2013 interestingly although the sulfite concentration required to degrade pfas is high 10 mm the sulfite concentration required to degrade bdps is lower 2 mm botlaguduru et al 2015 for example liu et al found that bromate decomposition rate increased to 100 within 2 mm so 3 2 liu et al 2014 4 4 uv type uv type plays an important role in the degradation of contaminants and different uv lights excite different uv wavelengths of photons as reported in previous literatures the types of uv lamps are classified into low pressure uv lamp uv l 254 nm esfahani and mohseni 2022 medium pressure uv lamp uv m 200 600 nm jung et al 2014 and high pressure uv lamp uv h 200 600 nm uv l is considered as the most commonly used light source for degrading various contaminants owing to its low energy consumption and environmental protection as reported mcaa li et al 2012 bromate jung et al 2016 pfas song et al 2013 were effectively degraded under uv l irradiation however the specific emission spectrum and low fluence rate of uv l limit its ability to efficiently degrade certain contaminants e g bromate pfas for example jung et al found that the degradation time and rate constant of bromate with uv m irradiation were 50 min and 0 051 min 1 respectively which were superior to those with uv l irradiation 240 min and 0 017 min 1 jung et al 2014 similar result was observed by xiao et al and the author exhibited that the rate constant of bromate under uv m irradiation was 0 036 min 1 which was more than 5 times higher than that under uv l irradiation 0 007 min 1 xiao et al 2017b this was mainly because uv m has a wider distribution range 200 600 nm including the absorbance peak of bromate at 195 nm amy et al 1998 additionally abusallout et al found that high defluorination efficiencies of pfoa 82 and pfos 65 were achieved by uv m sulfite system which was attributed to the fact that high energy emitted by uv m could overcome ph adjustment and the quenching effect of o2 thereby promoting the eaq yield abusallout et al 2021 in fact light intensity and photon flux of high pressure uv lamp uv h was reported as 1000 mw cm 2 and 3 13 10 6 einstein s 1 cm 2 zhang et al 2012 which was much higher than that of uv l 3 5 mw cm 2 3 37 10 8 einstein s 1 cm 2 song et al 2013 and uv m 4 9 mw cm 2 respectively thus uv h is more facilitate to generate more eaq and in turn effectively decomposing pfcs gu et al 2017b for example gu et al found that compared with eaq generated by uv sulfite with uv l or uv m abundant eaq were generated by uv sulfite with uv h thus completely degrading pfos within 30 min gu et al 2016 generally electrical energy is calculated by using the electrical energy per order eeo kwh m 3 value which represents the energy required to reduce contaminant concentration by an order of magnitude in 1 m3 of contaminated water eq 36 36 e eo 2 303 p k v where p kw is lamp power k h 1 is pseudo first order rate constant v m3 is solution volume the eeo value of uv h sulfite for pfoa degradation was 3 253 kwh m 3 chen et al 2020b which was much higher than that of uv m sulfite 495 kwh m 3 abusallout et al 2021 and uv l sulfite 15 7 kwh m 3 bentel et al 2020 indicating that uv h sulfite is not economical therefore it can be concluded that uv h sulfite system is not suitable for treating large scale contaminated water because of its high electrical energy consumption 4 5 water matrix water matrix is ubiquitous in real water including inorganic matters e g co existing anions zhang et al 2022 alkalinity lyu et al 2015b and dissolved organic matters nom e g humic acid sun et al 2017b it is noticed that water matrix exhibits enhanced or inhibiting effect on the degradation of contaminants the enhanced effect is due to the fact that water matrix acts as source chemical to generate eaq which promotes reduction process meanwhile water matrix blocks uv light and the photolysis of water matrix quenches eaq which inhibits the decomposition of contaminants therefore it is essential to investigate the effect of water matrix to evaluate the application potential of eaq based photochemical processes in water treatment cl hco3 and no3 2 are common co existing anions in natural water matrix due to their high reactivity towards eaq buxton et al 1988 these co existing anions have inhibitory effects on the photo reductive degradation of contaminants to varying degrees fennell et al 2022a for example zhang et al found that the degradation efficiency of mcaa by uv sulfite system was 92 which was much higher than that by uv sulfite system in the presence of 8 mm cl 39 4 and hco3 67 7 respectively implying that the quenching effect of cl was higher than hco3 on eaq zhang et al 2022 interestingly no3 2 has significant inhibitory effect on the removal of contaminants which is often classified as a quencher to confirm the dominant role of eaq gu et al 2017a xiao et al 2017b in addition alkalinity natural ph buffer 8 can improve the availability of eaq and promote the decomposition of contaminants lyu et al 2015b humic acid ha as the major constituent of nom is capable of significantly promoting the decomposition efficiency of various contaminant in photo reductive system for example sun et al investigated that the defluorination of pfos by uv iodide increased from 4 4 to 55 6 in the presence of ha 1 mg l 1 sun et al 2017b guo et al reported that the rate constant of pfoa by uv iodide ha was 0 0137 min 1 which was higher than that of by uv iodide 0 0116 min 1 guo et al 2018 this was not only because ha could reduce iodide oxide e g i2 hoi io 3 i 3 to i but also the quinone group in ha could act as an electron shuttle to improve the electron transfer capacity however high concentration of ha in turn inhibits the removal efficiency of contaminants for example jung et al pointed out that the rate constant of bromate in uv sulfite ha system increased from 0 017 to 0 071 min 1 as increasing ha concentration from 0 to 1 mg l 1 and then decreased to 0 030 min 1 as it further increased to 5 mg l 1 jung et al 2016 the negative effect of ha was attributed to the fact that excessive ha reacted with photons or sulfite resulting in low yields of eaq 5 application for reducing various contaminants with eaq 5 1 perfluorinated compounds perfluorinated compounds pfcs are a group of chemicals that contain c f bonds due to their high c f bond 116 kcal mol 1 pfcs exhibit strong recalcitrance to physical and biological treatments compared with advanced treatment techniques including advanced oxidation process jiao et al 2022 li et al 2020 zero valent iron reduction blotevogel et al 2018 and photocatalytic reduction huang et al 2017 eaq based photochemical processes present significantly higher pfcs decomposition efficiency fig 5 b for comparison fig 5a shows the redox potentials of eaq and other reactive species so 4 oh zero valent iron zvi and conduction band electron ecb 5 1 1 perfluorinated carboxylic acids perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas cnf2n 1coo are a type of pfcs characterized by the carboxylic group located at the end of perfluoroalkyl chains with varying lengths n 1 panchangam et al 2009 it is found that eaq is capable of effectively reducing pfcas and the characteristics of eaq based photochemical processes to degrade pfcas are summarized as follows commonly the decomposing efficiency of pfcas is not limited by variable fluoroalkyl chain lengths n 2 to 10 which can be manifested by their similar degradation and defluorination rates for example bentel et al presented that complete degradation rate of pfcas n 2 to 10 was achieved by uv sulfite system within 8 12 h and the defluorination rate of pfcas at 48 h was also similar ranging from 50 63 to 58 23 bentel et al 2019 similar phenomenon was found by park et al that the degradation rate constant of pfcas n 3 5 7 by uv iodide were all about 0 0014 min 1 park et al 2009 this was attributed to the fact that the lowest c f bond dissociation energies bdes in n 2 pfcas was α position cf2 106 5 107 3 kcal mol 1 regardless of chain length and h f exchange also occurred at α position indicating that n 2 pfcas had the similar initial reaction site esfahani et al 2022 bentel et al 2020 however the decomposition of trifluoroacetate tfa cf3coo n 1 is an exception for instance bentel et al found that the degradation rate of tfa 81 4 at 12 h was lower than that of n 2 pfcas 100 which was attributed to the fact that c f bdes in tfa 116 8 kcal mol 1 was stronger than the α position cf2 in n 2 pfcas 106 5 107 3 kcal mol 1 resulting in the failure to directly cleavage c f bond during tfa degradation bentel et al 2020 meanwhile the defluorination rate of tfa 100 was higher than that of n 2 pfcas 54 which was due to the fact that tfa produced inorganic f co2 and h2o via dheh cycle instead of h f exchange and in turn achieving complete defluorination cui et al 2020 perfluorooctanoic acid c7f15cooh pfoa as a representative of pfca n 7 is reported to be effectively decomposed by eaq generated different source chemicals under different experimental conditions for example gu et al found that 100 degradation and 45 7 defluorination rates of pfoa by uv sulfite were achieved within 10 min at ph 9 2 and 5 mg l 1 do gu et al 2017b chen et al reported that uv indole achieved 100 degradation and 90 defluorination rates of pfoa in the presence of ctab under ambient conditions including neutral room temperature and aerobic environment chen et al 2020a in addition pfoa degradation rate tends to be higher than its defluorination rate for instance the degradation rate of pfoa was as high as 100 bao et al 2018 while pfoa defluorination rate was 46 8 74 78 gu et al 2020 except for some special reports of almost complete defluorination qu et al 2010 the phenomenon was because pfoa produced f containing intermediates due to the cleavage of cc bonds without the simultaneous release of f compared with so 4 or oh generated by oxidative system eaq generated by reductive system has higher pfoa degradation efficiency for example bao et al found that the degradation rate of pfoa in reductive uv sulfite system was 100 which was 3 8 times higher than that in oxidative uv persulfate ps system 26 bao et al 2018 qu et al presented the degradation rate constant of pfoa by reductive uv iodide system 0 0073 min 1 was higher than that by oxidative uv ps system 0 0014 min 1 qu et al 2010 this was due to the fact that the cleavage of c f 544 kj mol 1 bonds of pfoa could not be directly attacked by so 4 or oh 276 kj mol 1 in addition to high degradation efficiency the reaction conditions required for pfoa degradation by eaq are mild and the final products are environmentally friendly for example qu et al pointed out that the final products of pfoa degradation by uv iodide were f formic acid and acetic acid among them f was easily removed from water and formic acid or acetic acid produced by the reaction could also avoid the problem of co2 emission qu et al 2010 5 1 2 perfluorinated sulfonic acids perfluorinated sulfonic acids pfsas cnf2n 1 so3 are typical pfcs which are characterized by the fact that the sulfonic group is located at the end of the perfluoroalkyl chain with varying length n 1 panchangam et al 2009 the degradation of pfsas by eaq based photochemical processes has the following characteristics first the degradation kinetics and f release of pfsas is closely related to chain length park et al 2009 this was because the lowest c f bdes was located in the middle of fluoroalkyl chain and the h f exchange occurred in the middle of pfsas which further split into two short fluorocarbon chains bentel et al 2019 therefore pfsas degradation and defluorination increased with the increase of chain length gu et al 2020 whereas as mentioned before the degradation and defluorination efficiency of pfcas are independent of chain length for example park et al presented that the reaction rate constant of pfbs n 4 k 0 0004 min 1 pfhs n 6 k 0 0012 min 1 pfos n 8 k 0 0030 min 1 increased with increasing chain length of pfsas while pfba n 3 pfha n 5 and pfoa n 7 had the similar degradation rate constant although they are different pfcas with variable chain length k 0 0013 min 1 park et al 2009 second the degradation rate constant of n 1 pfsas is slower than that of n 1 pfcas implying that pfsas are more difficult to be degraded by eaq than pfcas for example bentel et al found that the degradation and defluorination rates of the n 1 pfsas cf3so3 were negligible while the degradation and defluorination rates of n 1 pfcas tfa were 81 4 and 100 at 12 h respectively bentel et al 2019 similarly gu et al reported that the rate constant of pfos by uv sulfite was 0 118 min 1 gu et al 2016 which was 4 times lower than that of pfoa 0 455 min 1 gu et al 2017b abusallout et al presented that the defluorination rate constant of pfos 0 0314 0 01 min 1 by uv sulfite was lower than that of pfoa 0 0616 0 008 min 1 under the same conditions abusallout et al 2021 this is because c f bdes for the α position cf2 near coo in pfcas is 106 5 107 3 kcal mol 1 which is lower than those of α position cf2 near so3 in pfsas 109 2 113 6 kcal mol 1 bentel et al 2019 as a result compared with pfsa α position cf2 in pfcas is easier to be attacked by eaq thereby achieving high degradation and defluorination efficiency in addition due to their different head groups e g so3 and coo h f exchange occurs at different locations in the pfsas and pfcas structure thus affecting their degradation pathway h f exchange occurs in the middle of perfluoroalkyl chain in pfsas because based on all c f bdes 106 4 118 8 kcal mol 1 the middle cf2 group has lowest bdes 106 4 106 9 kcal mol 1 bentel et al 2019 h f exchange occurs at α position of pfcas which was due to the fact that based on all c f bdes 106 8 118 1 kcal mol 1 c f bdes at α position cf2 in pfcas is lowest 106 8 107 3 kcal mol 1 bentel et al 2020 furthermore liner and branched isomers of pfos have different reactivity towards eaq the degradation efficiency of branched pfos is much faster than that of linear pfos kugler et al 2021 for instance lin et al found that the rate constant of branched pfos by uv sulfite 0 0806 min 1 was much higher than the linear one 0 00029 min 1 jin et al 2015 likewise gu et al reported that negligible degradation of linear pfos was observed in uv iodide within 30 min while the degradation rate of branched pfos was 60 gu et al 2016 this was attributed to the fact that the tertiary c f bonds in branched pfos possessed higher adiabatic electron affinity compared to linear pfos which provides more electron attachment sites and make it easier to be decomposed by eaq 5 1 3 perfluorinated alternatives hexafluoropropylene oxide oligomer acids hfpo oa include hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid hfpo ta and hexafluoropropylene oxide tetramer acid hfpo tea which are alternatives to pfoa the characteristics of eaq based photochemical processes to decompose hfpo oa are as follows first eaq generated by reductive system is more effective than so 4 generated by oxidative system for hfpo oa degradation for example bao et al presented that the degradation rate of hfpo da in uv sulfite system at 3 h was 100 which was much higher than that of in uv ps system 5 bao et al 2018 this may be due to the nucleophilicity of eaq effectively splitting the ether group in the hfpo da molecule while α cf3 in the hfpo da molecule would interfere with the attack of coo by so 4 second the degradation products of hfpo oa in reductive system are more environmentally friendly than those in oxidative system this is because hfpo oa can be completely degraded into co2 f and hcoo in uv sulfite system bao et al 2019b however in ps system the final product of hfpo tea and hfpo ta is hfpo da which is difficult to be oxidized by so 4 leading to a large amount of hfpo da accumulation li et al 2020 besides the defluorination efficiency of hfpo da is higher than that of pfoa in reductive system for example the defluorination rate of hfpo da by uv sulfite at 4 h 85 was higher than of pfoa 60 bao et al 2018 which was attributed that the ether bond in hfpo da led to the instability of the intermediate and thus shortened the defluorination process monochlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate f 53 and perfluoroalkyl ether potassium sulfonate f 53b as synthesized alternatives to pfos posing a threaten to human health gao et al 2016 it is found that f 53b is not oxidized by heat activated ps technology thus eaq based photochemical processes are confirmed to effectively decompose f 53b compared with direct photolysis eaq generated by different photo reductive systems can degrade f 53b more efficiently for example cao et al demonstrated that the defluorination rate of f 53b at 2 h in uv iodide system was 17 which was more than 3 times higher than that in sole uv system 4 8 cao et al 2022 and the degradation pathway was that f 53b was dechlorinated by the attack of eaq first followed by the continuous shedding of ch2 units additionally bao et al observed that the degradation efficiency of f 53b by uv sulfite was higher than that of f 53 which was attribute to the fact that c cl bdes 305 9 kj mol 1 in f 53 b was lower than c f bdes 482 7 kj mol 1 in f 53 bao et al 2019a indicating that the reduction ability of f 53b was enhanced by in the presence of cl atom moreover almost no degradation efficiency of f 53 and f 53b was achieved by uv ps while 90 degradation rate of f 53 and f 53b was achieved by uv sulfite under the same condition bao et al 2019a demonstrating the reduction process was superior to the oxidation process 5 1 4 practical pfcs containing water it is reported that eaq based photochemical processes has the feasibility of decomposing practical pfcs containing water e g industrial wastewater groundwater for example qu et al pointed out that uv iodide degraded 96 pfoa containing industrial wastewater within 12 h qu et al 2010 chen et al found that 100 degradation efficiency of pfoa containing industrial wastewater was achieved by uv indole derivative in the presence of organo montmorillonite chen et al 2019a and ctab chen et al 2020a indicating that photo reductive system has great potential for degrading practical wastewater in addition liu et al presented that a pilot scale combination of nanofiltration no and uv sulfite was capable of degrading 12 pfass detected in groundwater and the results showed that more than 90 pfas was degraded after 8 h by hybrid no uv sulfite system liu et al 2021 notably compared with other methods eaq based photochemical processes exhibit higher economic feasibility in practical applications for example the calculated eeo of pilot scale no uv sulfite for pfoa was 3 7 kwh m 3 liu et al 2021 which was almost 4 times and 14 times lower than that of pilot scale plasma technology 16 kwh m 3 nau hix et al 2021 and photocatalytic process 51 kwh m 3 qanbarzadeh et al 2020 respectively indicating that no uv sulfite is economical furthermore the energy cost of hybrid no uv sulfite system is much lower than that of bench scale uv sulfite system for instance the eeo of hybrid no uv sulfite for pfoa and pfos is 3 7 kwh m 3 and 5 2 kwh m 3 respectively which were much higher than that of uv sulfite 36 7 kwh m 3 and 51 9 kwh m 3 respectively liu et al 2021 this was attributed to the fact that the volume of water treated in the hybrid system 568 l is an order of magnitude larger than that in the uv reactor 57 l therefore eaq based photochemical processes has applicability and cost effectiveness in practical application 5 2 disinfection by products disinfection by products dbps include monochloroacetic acid bromate n nitrosodimethylamine which are harmful to human health due to their toxicity and bioaccumulation kimura et al 2017 due to the high reactivity of eaq to halogenated compounds the c x x cl br bond can be attacked by eaq to break rapidly thus releasing halide ions furthermore eaq has high reaction rate constant with n nitrosodimethylamine 1 41 1010 m 1 s 1 therefore eaq based photochemical processes are considered to be the most efficient method to degrade dbps fig 5b 5 2 1 monochloroacetic acid monochloroacetic acid mcaa is a kind of dbps with strong ecological risk owing to their high efficiency and environmental friendly products eaq based photochemical processes are demonstrated to effectively degrade mcaa liu et al 2014 the detailed degradation characteristics are as follows first compared with zvi reduction tang et al 2015 and photocatalytic oxidation wu et al 2007 eaq based photochemical processes present higher degradation efficiency for example the reaction rate constant of mcaa by reductive uv iodide system was 0 0218 min 1 yu et al 2018 which was much higher than that by zvi reduction 0 00273 min 1 tang et al 2015 and oxidative uv o3 tio2 0 0027 min 1 mas et al 2005 respectively second the degradation products of mcaa by eaq based photochemical processes are environmentally friendly for example li et al found that the products of mcaa by uv sulfite are acetic acid hac succinic acid sa and sulfoacetic acid saa respectively li et al 2012 which avoids the direct mineralization of contaminants into co2 whereas in oxidative uv h2o2 system the final products were toxic halogenated organic matters e g ethylene chlorohydrin wu et al 2007 besides compared with the sole system the combined photo reductive systems have higher efficiency for mcaa degradation for instance yu et al proposed that the degradation rate constant of mcaa by uv sulfite iodide was 0 2572 min 1 which was higher than that by uv sulfite 0 0672 min 1 and uv iodide 0 0218 min 1 respectively yu et al 2018 the phenomenon is due to the pronounced synergistic effect of s iv and iodide on the one hand eaq can be generated by sulfite and iodide under uv irradiation on the other hand generated reactive iodine species can be reduced by sulfite to i thus increasing the net yield of eaq 5 2 2 bromate bromate bro3 is a typical dbp that is highly persistent and environmentally recalcitrant in water compared with traditional methods morais et al 2019 qiao et al 2019 eaq based photochemical processes show excellent performance in decomposing bromate jung et al 2016 xiao et al 2017a xiao et al 2017b compared with ecb reduction and zvi reduction the reduction efficiency of bromate by eaq is higher for instance the degradation rate constant of bromate by uv sulfite was 0 088 min 1 qiao et al 2019 which was higher than that by uv tio2 graphene 0 0094 min 1 huang et al 2014 and zvi reduction 0 0169 min 1 xin et al 2018 respectively additionally the byproducts of bromate degradation by eaq based photochemical processes are relatively green bromide botlaguduru et al 2015 while the membrane separation only concentrates the bromate solution which requires further post processing moslemi et al 2012 furthermore compared with direct photolysis uv sulfite is more economical due to its reduced operating costs for example nawaz et al pointed out that the electricity cost required for uv sulfite was 9 1 m3 which was 2 times lower than that required for direct photolysis 18 m3 indicating that uv sulfite was economical nawaz et al 2017 notably eaq based photochemical processes also exhibit high performance for bromate removal in practical water treatment for example xiao et al found that a pilot scale uv sulfite system degraded 60 bromate in raw water from tai lake within 30 min at ph 7 0 xiao et al 2017a xiao et al also found that the degradation efficiency of bromate in tap water from yangtze river by uv sulfite within 30 min at ph 7 0 was 82 xiao et al 2017b the degradation efficiency of bromate in tap water from yangtze river by uv sulfite was higher than that in raw water from tai lake the inconsistence was due to the fact that the concentration of dissolved organic carbon and nitrate in tap water was lower than that in raw water indicating that the inhibitory effect of water matrix in tap water is weaker than that in raw water 5 2 3 n nitrosodimethylamine n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is a dbp produced during chlorine disinfection process of chloramination and chlorination which is carcinogenic and mutagenic compared with oxidation process eaq based photochemical processes have higher decomposition efficiency of ndma for example the degradation rate constant by reductive uv iodide and uv sulfite systems were 0 60 min 1 sun et al 2017a and 0 70 min 1 seid et al 2020 respectively which were higher than by oxidative uv h2o2 0 0613 min 1 zhou et al 2012 in addition eaq based photochemical processes is able to generate non toxic products when degrading ndma thus decreasing the potential secondary pollution for example sun et al presented that the final products of ndma in uv iodide system were hcoo and n2 which effectively avoided the regeneration of ndma sun et al 2017a whereas gui et al found that the reduction of ndma by metallic fe or ni fe catalysts produced toxic intermediate such as dma among them dma was the precursor of ndma which could cause secondary pollution gui et al 2000 5 3 nitrate nitrate no3 pollution is increasing due to the overuse of nitrogen fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels which has a significant adverse impact on the water environment compared with traditional methods the degradation of nitrate by eaq based photochemical processes has the following characteristics firstly eaq based photochemical processes have higher nitrate degradation efficiency than zvi reduction for example the reaction rate constant of nitrate by uv sulfite was 0 050 min 1 tan et al 2021 which was much higher than by zvi reduction 0 007 min 1 kim et al 2012 the phenomenon is attributed to the fact that eaq is thermodynamically capable of converting nitrate to n2 and has high reaction kinetics for nitrogen species secondly eaq based photochemical processes are beneficial to improve the sensitivity of nitrate conversion to n2 thereby promoting the generation of harmless n2 for example tan et al presented that 100 nitrate could be reduced to n2 by uv sulfite within 90 min tan et al 2021 indicating eaq based photochemical processes are environmental friendly method in comparison nitrate was mainly transformed to undesired ammonium by zvi reduction which could not be removed from water kim et al 2012 similarly chen et al found that formate radical generated by uv formate system caused 30 selectivity of n2 chen et al 2019b additionally eaq based photochemical processes are cost effective compared with ion exchange barrabésa et al 2011 and zero valent iron kim et al 2012 eaq based photochemical processes do not produce secondary waste and use toxic reducing agents avoiding expensive post treatment and waste of chemical solvents 6 conclusion and research prospects hydrated electron eaq based photochemical processes show a good application prospective in decomposing various oxidative contaminants but for target contaminants selecting an appropriate photo reductive system under different operation conditions has been a concerned problem herein we presented a critical review focusing on the characteristics of different eaq based photochemical processes the identification methods of eaq the factors influencing eaq generation and the degradation regularities of contaminants i the required environment advantages and disadvantages of various photo reductive systems are different therefore the characteristics of each system is summarized to achieve efficient decomposition efficiency of contaminants for example uv iodide is able to decompose contaminants under weakly acidic conditions and the concentration of iodide is low however uv iodide system cannot be accomplished under aerobic conditions uv sulfite is not easily susceptible to dissolved oxygen but it is mostly used under strong alkaline conditions and sulfite concentration is high uv apca can degrade pfoa without controlling dissolved oxygen while formed byproducts produce a foul odor uv indole derivative is capable of decomposing pfoa at ambient environment but it has a relatively low degradation kinetics ii the summary of eaq identification methods is beneficial to explore the degradation mechanism behavior and pathway induced by eaq among them laser flash photolysis is a direct identification method but it requires large testing equipment quenching studies and chemical probes use the reactivity of quenchers with different reactive species e g eaq h to indirectly confirm the generation of eaq electron spin resonance technique is an auxiliary method to demonstrate eaq generation together with quenching studies or chemical probe iii the analysis of the factors influencing the photo reductive process contributes to promote the yield of eaq thus enhancing photo reductive efficiency alkaline conditions are favorable for eaq release the presence of dissolved oxygen generally inhibits eaq generation increasing the concentration of source chemicals to some extent can enhance eaq formation eaq generation increases with the increase of the excitation wavelength of uv lamp but more energy will be consumed considering the complicated context of water and wastewater the enhanced or inhibitory effect towards contaminant removal depends on the type and concentration of water matrix for example coexisting ions such as chloride bicarbonate and nitrate inhibit the degradation efficiency due to their quenching effect on eaq alkaline as natural buffer is positive for degrading contaminants a certain concentration of humic acid acts as photosensitizer enhances eaq generation whereas high humic acid concentration results in a low yield of eaq due to its quenching effect iv due to high reactivity of eaq with halogenated organic compounds and nitrogen containing compounds eaq based photochemical processes is capable of decomposing perfluorinated compounds disinfection by products and nitrate although current investigations imply that eaq based photochemical processes are efficient for the degradation of various oxidative contaminants further research is still needed to promote its potential application in practical water treatment based on this review several suggestions are made as follows i the yield of eaq in different photo reductive system needs to be improved due to the high reactivity of eaq with coexisting quenches such as h do and oh the number of eaq available for reducing contaminants is greatly decreased thus one method is to use new and more efficient eaq source chemical to enhance the quantum yield of eaq another method is to add appropriate reductant to minimize the quenching effect of coexisting quenchers on eaq for instance alleviating h inhibition by adding reductant can reduce the dependence of eaq based photochemical processes on alkaline ph therefore avoiding expensive ph adjustment ii the water safety caused by eaq based photochemical processes in the process of decomposing contaminants need to be further investigated firstly excessive addition of eaq source chemicals is harmful to the water environment for example excessive sulfites can result in sulfate concentrations that are higher than the standards for drinking water quality of china and america high concentrations of indole and its derivatives produce an extremely unpleasant taste secondly the degradation intermediates and their toxicity after eaq based photochemical processes need to be researched as the degradation products may be more toxic than the parent compounds eventually the effect of eaq based photochemical processes on the formation of disinfection by products e g iodinated disinfection by products needs to be assessed iodine species e g i2 i generated by uv iodide may react with some organic compounds to form iodine dbps which increase the toxicity in the reaction iii at present the decomposition of contaminants by eaq based photochemical processes is mostly performed in the laboratory the following points need to be considered if applying this technology in practical water treatment firstly most of the wastewater in the laboratory is synthetic which contains high concentrations and single types of contaminants however the diversity and complexity of water samples need to be considered in practical contaminated water although the review has discussed the effect of inorganic matters e g coexisting anions alkalinity and dissolved organic matters e g humic acid in water on contaminant degradation efficiency the effect of other special dissolved organic matters e g effluent organic matter efom should also be concerned secondly because the suspended substances in the practical water can easily cause light refraction or scattering the utilization rate of light is very low thus designing an efficient photoreactor is crucial iv integrating eaq based photochemical processes with other chemical or physical methods can provide multiple barriers for degrading contaminants in water thereby improving the overall decomposition efficiency for instance combing oxidation system uv tio2 with uv sulfite can generate degradation products with low toxicity and high mineralization capacity or adding a nanofiltration process before uv sulfite can effectively concentrate contaminated water which is more conductive to subsequent photo reductive degradation of contaminants

15418,hydrated electron eaq based photochemical processes have emerged as a promising technology for contaminant removal in water due to the mild operating conditions this review aims to provide a comprehensive and up to date summary on eaq based photochemical processes for the decomposition of various oxidative contaminants specifically the characteristics of different photo reductive systems are first elaborated including the environment required to generate sufficient eaq the advantages and disadvantages of each system and the comparison of the degradation efficiency of contaminants induced by eaq in addition the identification methods of eaq e g laser flash photolysis scavenging studies chemical probes and electron spin resonance techniques are summarized and the influences of operating conditions e g solution ph dissolved oxygen source chemical concentration and uv type on the performance of contaminants are also discussed considering the complexity of contaminated water particular attention is paid to the influence of water matrix e g coexisting anions alkalinity and humic acid moreover the degradation regularities of various contaminants e g perfluorinated compounds disinfection by products and nitrate by eaq are summarized we finally put forward several research prospects for the decomposition of contaminants by eaq based photochemical processes to promote their practical application in water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrated electron photochemical processes water treatment perfluorinated compounds disinfection by products data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction photochemical reduction processes have attracted increasing attention as a promising water treatment technology dong et al 2018 liu et al 2020 the principle of photochemical reduction processes is that using ultraviolet light uv as the activation method to generate reductive radical species thereby reducing various oxidative contaminants xiao et al 2017a in fact the effect of photochemical reduction processes in decomposing contaminants depends on the types of reductive radical species involving hydrated electron eaq h atom h and sulfite radical anions so 3 by comparing the reduction potentials of eaq 2 9 v h 2 3 v and so 3 0 63 v eaq is considered to be the most effective active radical buxton et al 1988 thus compared with conventional oxidation and biodegradation eaq based photochemical processes exhibit higher efficiency and milder operation conditions in the degradation of contaminants for example the degradation efficiency of hfpo da by uv sulfite within 3 h was 100 which was much higher than that by uv persulfate 5 indicating that eaq based photochemical processes are more effective than oxidative processes bao et al 2018 similarly bromate at a concentration of 0 1 mm needed to be cultured in sulfur containing microorganisms for 5 d to be biodegraded chairez et al 2010 while bromate at the same concentration could be completely decomposed with 2 h under eaq attack xiao et al 2017b implying that eaq based photochemical processes require shorter cycle and simpler operation than biodegradation furthermore contaminants are easily attacked by eaq to form short chain intermediates which can reduce toxicity and enhance biodegradability of parent compound yu et al 2018 cui et al 2020 generally eaq is mainly generated by two different photolysis methods including direct photolysis and indirect photolysis in direct photolysis system eaq h and hydroxyl radical oh are generated by the photoionization of liquid water under vacuum ultraviolet irradiation vuv 185 nm zoschke et al 2014 esfahani and mohseni 2022 however the photon energy required for direct photolysis is high 647 kj mol 1 gu et al 2017a and the quantum yield of eaq is low 0 045 esfahani and mohseni 2022 therefore more attention is paid for the indirect photolysis due to its high eaq generation and mild reaction conditions in indirect photolysis system sufficient eaq is generated by inorganic anions iodide sulfite and organic solutes aminopolycarboxylic acid indole derivative under uv irradiation thus decomposing a variety of contaminants including perfluorinated compounds pfcs park et al 2009 qu et al 2014 bao et al 2019a disinfection by products dbps li et al 2012 jung et al 2016 nitrate tan et al 2021 the literatures focusing on contaminant reduction using eaq based photochemical processes are listed in tables 1 3 1 r φ i 0 1 1 0 ε cl v in fact the eaq formation rate r in different photo reductive systems can be calculated via eq 1 where φ is the quantum yield of source chemical photolysis mol e 1 ε is the molar adsorption coefficient of source chemical m 1 cm 1 i 0 is the photon flux entering the solution e s 1 c is source chemical concentration m l is effective path length due to the different characteristics e g quantum yield and molar coefficient of eaq source chemicals the conditions required for them to generate sufficient eaq under uv irradiation are also different therefore a systematic review of eaq generated by different photo reductive system is conducted to promote the development and application of this technology in the decomposition of oxidative contaminants in water this review has the following objectives i the characteristics of different photo reductive systems are presented and their advantages and disadvantages are elucidated for readers to select a suitable system for degrading oxidative contaminants ii the currently reported identification methods of eaq are summarized to further explore the degradation behavior and pathway of contaminants by eaq iii the factors affecting the decomposition efficiency are analyzed and compared in order to achieve complete degradation of contaminants under appropriate operation conditions iv the degradation characteristics of pfcs dbps and nitrate are discussed to provide a technically feasible method for the application of eaq based photochemical processes in contaminated water v the knowledge demands and research prospects of eaq based photochemical processes are proposed to meet the application challenges 2 eaq generated by different photo reductive systems 2 1 uv iodide since eaq generated by iodide under uv irradiation is demonstrated to have high quantum yield and molar absorptivity sauer et al 2004 the application of uv iodide system in the degradation of various contaminants has attracted increasing attention as listed in table 1 generally the photoionization of iodide i in water produces iodide radical i and eaq via charge transfer to solvent state ctts via eq 2 specifically an excited iodide i h 2 o is generated by iodide under uv irradiation followed by decaying to a ground state i or degrading to a caged complex i e via eqs 3 5 finally the caged complex dissociates into eaq and i via eq 6 2 i hv i ctts i e aq 3 i h 2 o hv i h 2 o 4 i h 2 o i h 2 o 5 i h 2 o i e h 2 o 6 i e i e aq 7 i o 2 h 2 o 2 i 2 4 o h 8 i 2 o 2 h i 2 h o 2 the quantum yield of eaq generated by uv iodide at wavelengths of 248 nm is 0 286 0 008 which is higher than that of uv sulfite 0 108 0 001 sauer et al 2004 and the molar absorption coefficient of iodide 400 m 1 cm 1 is also higher sulfite 30 m 1 cm 1 at 248 nm sauer et al 2004 therefore the eaq source chemical concentration used in uv iodide system is an order of magnitude lower than in uv sulfite system which avoids chemical waste fig 1 c for example achieving almost 80 defluorination of pfoa 10 35 mg l 1 required photolysis of 10 mm sulfite abusallout et al 2021 or 0 3 mm iodide qu et al 2010 compared with 20 mm sulfite k 0 008 min 1 the pseudo first order rate constant between pfos and 0 3 mm iodide was higher k 0 0295 min 1 qu et al 2014 implying that efficient degradation of pfos could be achieved in the presence of low concentration iodide what s more compared with uv sulfite uv iodide is still capable of decomposing contaminants under mildly acidic conditions fig 1a for instance uv iodide achieved 98 pfos degradation at ph 6 5 park et al 2009 whereas pfos defluorination was significantly inhibited by uv sulfite at ph 7 gu et al 2017a however the photolysis of iodide generates undesirable products such as iodine i2 and triiodide i3 which absorb visible light rahn et al 1997 besides the photolysis process of iodide is easily influenced by dissolved oxygen which limits its practical engineering application fig 1b in addition to quenching eaq dissolved oxygen quenches i and i 2 iodine anion radical via eqs 7 and 8 resulting in low degradation efficiency of contaminants for example qu et al presented that the defluorination rate of pfoa with n2 bubbling was 98 8 and 5 when o2 was used qu et al 2010 2 2 uv sulfite since the 1960s the photoionization of sulfite so3 2 in water has been extensively investigated dogliotti et al 1968 in the process of uv irradiation eaq so 3 and h are generated by sulfite via eqs 9 and 10 later more attention was paid to the application of uv sulfite system as seen in table 2 9 so 3 2 hv so 3 e aq 10 hso 3 hv so 3 h 11 hso 3 e aq so 3 2 h 12 h o h h 2 o e aq 13 so 3 o 2 so 5 14 so 5 so 3 2 so 4 so 4 2 15 so 4 so 3 2 so 3 so 4 2 due to the high reactivity eaq with o2 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 dissolved oxygen do does have a negative impact on the degradation of contaminants in uv sulfite system qiao et al 2019 seid et al 2020 tan et al 2021 however the addition of sufficient sulfite is capable of depleting o2 enabling the uv sulfite system to decompose contaminants even under aerobic conditions abusallout et al 2021 esfahani and mohseni 2022 gu et al 2017b xiao et al 2017a liu et al 2014 gu et al 2016 fig 1b this is because when the molar ratio of sulfite to do is larger than 2 1 do can be completely consumed through a series of chain photo reaction generally 10 20 mm of sulfite was applied in uv sulfite system which can consume most of dissolved oxygen 3 8 mg l 1 in water abusallout et al 2021 leading to a very low level of residual o2 0 2 mg l 1 and sufficient sulfite in the reactor esfahani and mohseni 2022 therefore it can be concluded that high concentration sulfite can eliminate the quenching effect of do and maintain the steady concentration of eaq which is conductive to the reduction of contaminants by uv sulfite system for example gu et al found that uv sulfite 10 mm achieved 100 pfoa degradation efficiency at 10 min in the presence of o2 5 mg l 1 respectively gu et al 2017b likewise abusallout et al reported that in the presence of do concentrations of 1 0 mg l 1 5 0 mg l 1 and 8 0 mg l 1 uv sulfite exhibited similar defluorination efficiency of pfoa 80 abusallout et al 2021 in particular liu et al reported that the addition of 2 5 mm sulfite in pilot scale uv sulfite system could effectively eliminate the adverse effects of do liu et al 2021 this also indicates that adding a certain concentration of sulfite is an efficient strategy to achieve deoxidation instead of injecting inert gas notably due to the low molar adsorption coefficient at 248 nm 30 m 1 cm 1 and low quantum yield of eaq 0 108 0 001 248 nm the sulfite concentration required in the reaction is high 10 20 mm resulting in excessive consumption of eaq source chemicals fig 1c generally the degradation rate of contaminants e g pfos gu et al 2017a hfpo da bao et al 2018 f 53b bao et al 2019a increases as increasing sulfite concentration to 20 mm for example gu et al found that the degradation rate constant of pfos in uv sulfite system increased from 0 0022 0 004 min 1 to 0 0145 0 006 min 1 as increasing sulfite concentration from 1 to 20 mm gu et al 2017a besides due to the high required so3 2 concentration the effluent concentration of sulfate ions so4 2 produced by the reaction is higher than the standards for drinking water quality of china 250 mg l 1 2 61 mm which may pose a threaten to the environment in addition the degradation of contaminants in uv sulfite system is mostly performed under alkaline conditions fig 1a which is attributed to the fact that ph determines the species distribution of sulfur species so3 2 or bisulfite hso3 for example gu et al found that the decomposition of pfos was totally suppressed at ph 7 0 and the reaction rate constant of pfos by uv sulfite at ph 9 2 0 118 min 1 was much higher than that at ph 8 0 0 026 min 1 gu et al 2016 likewise esfahani et al reported that the removal efficiency of pfos in uv sulfite system at ph 3 3 7 0 and 9 1 was 6 9 8 and 55 1 respectively indicating alkaline condition was more favorable for reducing various contaminants esfahani and mohseni 2022 this is due to that more than 99 so3 2 are found in the solution at ph 9 1 xiao et al 2017b which generates more eaq under uv irradiation in alkaline solution while at ph 7 2 the dominant species is hso3 which generates more h with low reducing ability via eq 10 meanwhile eaq is also easily quenched by h and hso3 at low ph maza et al 2019 which decreases the yield of eaq 2 3 uv apca commonly eaq is easily quenched by oxidizing species e g oh o 2 ho 2 leading to low yield and short lifetime of eaq to address this issue aminopolycarboxylic acid apca is used as oh quenchers to enhance eaq yield due to their excellent electron donating ability apcas are a class of compounds with multiple carboxyl groups linked to a single or multiple n atoms mainly including nitrilotriacetic acid nta and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta it was reported that nta and edta were used to decompose pfos under uv irradiation gu et al 2020 table 3 the phenomenon could be explained by two aspects on the one hand the fully hydrated nta after hydration spheres can act as a photosensitizer to induce water photodissociation and photoionization to generate eaq sun et al 2018 on the other hand the reaction rate constant of apca with oh 109 m 1 s 1 is significantly higher than that with eaq 106 m 1 s 1 leitner et al 2003 so oh can be quenched by nta and edta preventing the recombination between eaq and oh and in turn extending the survival time of eaq for instance compared with uv sulfite 1 ns lian et al 2004 and uv iodide 2 ns qu et al 2010 the lifetime of eaq generated by uv nta can be extended to 11 6 μs sun et al 2018 respectively compared with uv iodide the degradation of contaminants can be achieved by uv apca system under aerobic conditions fig 1b for example gu et al reported that uv edta defluorinated 51 19 and 50 06 pfos in the absence and presence of do respectively gu et al 2020 similar phenomenon was also found in other studies sun et al 2018 this was attributed to the fact that apca was capable of quenching various oxidative species e g o 2 ho 2 in the presence of o2 however the photolysis of apca produces amine compound with a foul odor which limits its practical application sun et al 2018 liu et al 2021 2 4 uv indole derivative it is noticed that the photolysis of iodide and sulfite generate eaq however the requirement for alkaline or anoxic environment limits its industrial application therefore more attention has been paid to the photoionization of aromatic compounds joschek and grossweiner 1966 indole derivatives indole or its derivatives as representative aromatic compounds have received extensive attention due to their wide distribution in nature in general the photoionization of indole eq 16 and its derivative e g 3 indole acetic acid iaa generates eaq and radical cations chen et al 2021 among them the eaq quantum yield of iaa is higher than that of indole under uv irradiation and its quantum yield increases with the shortening of the excitation wavelength pigault et al 1982 tian et al 2016 the literatures concentrating on pfcs reduction using uv indole derivative are listed in table 3 16 indole hv e aq indol e it was reported that uv indole could degrade contaminants over a ph range of ph 4 8 under aerobic conditions indicating that the system has the potential for practical application chen et al 2021 however the yield of eaq in uv indole derivative system is low due to the quenching effect of eaq by the simultaneously formed radical cations h and o2 tian et al 2015 therefore adding organo montmorillonite tian et al 2016 2018 chen et al 2019a or cationic surfactant chen et al 2020a 2020b into uv indole derivative system can promote the yield of eaq thus decomposing contaminants more effectively firstly the addition of organo montmorillonite can effectively promote the degradation efficiency of contaminants in uv indole derivative for instance the degradation rate constant of pfoa by uv iaa with montmorillonite was 0 0098 min 1 at ph 6 tian et al 2018 which was 2 times higher than that by uv iaa system 0 0044 min 1 at ph 6 chen et al 2020b this could be explained by the fact that the unique structure of organo montmorillonite prevents the diffusion of h and o2 into the clay interlayer in uv iaa system tian et al 2016 2018 in particular the presence of montmorillonite also broadens the applicable ph range of uv indole derivative system 3 11 tian et al 2016 secondly the addition of cationic surfactant e g cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab also enhances the degradation efficiency of contaminants by uv indole derivative for instance chen et al presented that the rate constant of pfoa degradation in uv iaa in the presence of ctab was 0 0278 min 1 which was much higher than that of in uv iaa 0 0044 min 1 chen et al 2020b this was attributed to the fact that ctab co adsorbs indole derivative and pfoa to form self assembled micelle system on the one hand the regionally confined micelle is able to accelerate the transfer of eaq from indole derivative to pfoa on the other hand the micelle system can repel h and o2 away from system due to its high ζ potential therefore providing a barrier for internal reduction reactions interestingly the formed micelle system can be directly separated from the solution because of its self agglomeration and sedimentation avoiding secondary pollution hence the degradation of pfoa can be realized by uv indole derivative system under ambient conditions e g room temperature neutral and aerobic conditions fig 1 making it potential for decomposing pfas in practical contaminated water however compared with uv iodide and uv sulfite system uv indole derivative system exhibits lower kinetics which needs to further study in the future 3 identification of eaq eaq generated by the activation of different source chemicals including sulfite iodide apca indole and its derivative has been already summarized in section 2 it is common that the identification of reactive species is closely related to degradation mechanism behavior and pathway of contaminants meanwhile it is crucial to distinguish the dominant role of eaq or h in the system due to their high reducing ability at present the main technologies for identifying eaq include laser flash photolysis scavenging studies electron spin resonance techniques fig 2 3 1 laser flash photolysis laser flash photolysis lep is a nanoscale transient absorption technique which is quantitatively capable of identifying free radicals this is a way to directly detect the generation and contribution of eaq generated by source chemical the transient absorption spectra from 300 nm to 710 nm is measured at 10 nm intervals and the broad and asymmetric optical absorption peak at 690 nm is attribute to the generation signal of eaq huang et al 2007 as reported the adsorption peak intensity of eaq decreased with the extension of monitoring time demonstrating that eaq was continuously reacting with contaminants or their intermediates for example sun et al presented that as the monitoring time increased from 0 1 to 9 0 μs the peak intensity at 690 nm decreased continuously indicating that eaq were reacting with pfos or other intermediates fig 3 a sun et al 2018 moreover the life time of eaq τ is calculated by measuring the absorption attenuation kinetics of eaq at 690 nm which can be used to quantify the reaction efficiency between eaq and contaminants chen et al 2020a τ is calculated based on the least square fitting of the kinetic equation after normalization eq 17 among them b i is the amplitude of the curve at time 0 τ i is the representative of different decay processes representing the decay from the beginning to 37 of the initial signal value notably the lower the value of τ the faster the decay of eaq that is the higher reaction efficiency between eaq and contaminants for instance chen et al described the decay kinetics of pfoa indole and its derivatives it was found that eaq generated in the donaxine pfoa system had the shortest lifetime τ 1305 3 ns compared with 3 iaa 1 iaa and indole suggesting that eaq generated by donaxine had a higher reaction efficiency towards pfoa fig 3b chen et al 2021 therefore lep studies give a proof to confirm the existence and mechanism of eaq 17 r t b 1 e t τ 1 b 2 e t τ 2 b 3 e t τ 3 b 4 e t τ 4 3 2 quenching studies and chemical probes since large scale lep experimental equipment is not common in the laboratory a simpler method for the identification of free radicals is required quenching studies refers to the purposeful quenching of reactive species using the specificity of quenchers so that the contribution of each reactive species can be indirectly distinguished by studying the inhibitory effect of contaminants because both h and eaq are reducing radicals quenchers are mainly used to identify the generation and contribution of eaq or h table 4 exhibits the reaction rate constant of quenchers with reactive active species n2o no2 and no3 are generally used to identify whether eaq or h is the predominant reactive species in the reaction system li et al 2012 ren et al 2021 xie et al 2017 specifically and no2 can effectively quench eaq and h whereas no3 are only able to quench eaq owing to their distinct second order rate constants eqs 18 21 buxton et al 1988 as a result the dominant role of eaq can be demonstrated by investigating the respective inhibitory effects of no2 and no3 on the degradation of contaminants for instance li et al found that the degradation rate of mcaa in uv sulfite system was 99 while significant inhibition was found in addition of no2 and no3 18 thereby indicating the predominant role of eaq in the degradation of mcaa by uv sulfite li et al 2012 xiao et al showed that complete bromate degradation was achieved by uv sulfite within 60 min however the degradation rate of bromate in the presence of 0 4 mm no2 and no3 at ph 4 was 7 and 42 respectively finding that the reduction reaction was only largely inhibited by no2 instead of no3 at ph 4 which proved the contribution of eaq and h fig 4 a meanwhile it was also found by xiao et al that the degradation rate of bromate was largely inhibited by both no2 and no3 at ph 9 24 indicating that eaq was the dominant reactive species fig 4b xiao et al 2017b in addition to no2 and no3 n2o was selected as quenching agent to indirectly prove the role of eaq because of its different reactivity towards eaq and h eq 22 and 23 for example sun et al presented that the defluorination rate of pfos in the presence and absence of n2o were 8 and 46 8 respectively indicating that eaq was the predominant role in the reductive process sun et al 2018 18 no 2 e aq n o 2 2 19 no 2 h no o h 20 no 3 e aq n o 3 2 21 no 3 h n o 3 h 22 n 2 o e aq n 2 oh o h 23 n 2 o h n 2 oh 24 c h 2 clco o e aq c h 2 co o c l 25 c h 2 clco o h chclo o h 2 mcaa is established as a chemical probe to confirm the role of eaq because the produced by the reaction of mcaa with eaq and h are different via eqs 24 and 25 li et al 2014 this can be demonstrated that the primary role of eaq can be determined by the release of cl in the dichlorination of mcaa while h can react with mcaa to release h2 by abstracting h for instance gu j et al reported that cl was formed in the degradation process of mcaa indicating eaq was responsible for the dichlorination of mcaa gu et al 2017c similar results are found by li et al that negligible degradation effect of mcaa 5 was observed at ph 6 implying that at this ph the dominant species is not eaq li et al 2012 it is worth noting that mcaa is also reported to estimate the steady state concentration of eaq eaq ss because its high reactivity towards eaq gu et al 2017c yu et al 2018 fennell et al 2022b eaq ss of photo reductive system can be calculated via eq 26 where k i is the second order rate constant between eaq and quencher s i s i is s i concentration r e is eaq formation rate 26 e aq ss r e k i s i k 2 mcaa 3 3 electron spin resonance technique as an auxiliary technique electron spin resonance technique esr can be combined with lep or quenching experiments to further demonstrate the dominant role of eaq esr is a technique that can detect free radicals generated in chemical or biological processes wang et al 2011 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrole oxynitride dmpo is commonly used as a trapping agent for in situ detection of eaq generated in the reaction resulting in esr spectrum with dmpo electron dmpo h signals via eq 27 as reported the signals for dmpo h a n no 16 51 0 01 g a h ch2 22 59 0 01 g were due to the generation of eaq madden et al 2001 what s more the dmpo h spin adduct has nine splitting peaks and the signal intensities of these peaks are 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 fig 4c it is common that the stronger these peak signals of dmpo h the higher the generation capacity of eaq for example chen et al found that the dmpo h intensity of 3 iaa was higher than indole and other derivatives indicating the generation capacity of eaq in 3 iaa solution was better than that in other solutions fig 4d chen et al 2021 this further confirms the existence of eaq which is consistent with the results of quenching studies 27 dmpo e aq h dmpo h 4 effects of experimental parameters 4 1 solution ph solution ph remarkably influences the availability of eaq and the distribution ratio of eaq source chemicals which affects the decomposition efficiency of contaminants generally increasing ph is facilitate to decompose contaminants and the optimum ph for the degradation process is 9 12 qu et al 2014 gu et al 2017a liu et al 2021 for example the rate constant of pfoa in uv ki system at 10 0 was 0 0295 min 1 which was more than 49 times higher than the rate constant at ph 5 0 0 0006 min 1 qu et al 2014 similarly the defluorination efficiency of pfos increased from 6 to 65 as increasing ph from 6 0 to 10 0 besides the degradation efficiency of mcaa by uv sulfite increased obviously from 10 to 98 when ph increased from 6 0 to 10 1 li et al 2012 bromate removal efficiency in uv sulfite system increased from 19 to 100 as ph increasing from 5 to 10 liu et al 2014 the results show that the reductive process is more efficient under alkaline conditions this can be explained from two aspects on the one hand solution ph determines the interconversion between eaq and h it is believed that eaq is rapidly quenched by h to form h at near neutral ph 7 1 via eq 28 whereas h reacts with oh to convert to eaq at high ph 8 7 via eq 29 additionally it was found that the yield of eaq in uv sulfite system at ph 9 was 4 5 orders of magnitude greater than that at ph 4 5 meanwhile the quenching rate of eaq by h was reported to decrease by 1 order of magnitude for every increase in ph value buxton et al 1988 as a result alkaline conditions promote the net yield of eaq more than under acidic conditions thereby promoting the degradation efficiency of contaminants for example gu et al presented that the defluorination rate of pfos by uv sulfite at ph 9 was 52 which was 7 4 times higher than that at ph 6 0 7 gu et al 2017a 28 e aq h h 29 o h h e aq h 2 o on the other hand solution ph significantly influences the distribution of eaq source chemical which further affects the generation of different reduction system among them eaq source chemicals that are easily affected by ph are mainly sulfite and iodide in uv sulfite system pka of sulfite is 7 2 implying that hso3 is dominant at ph 3 7 and so3 2 is dominant at ph 7 2 esfahani and mohseni 2022 it is common that so3 2 undergoes a protonation reaction at low ph to produce hso3 and then generates h instead of eaq under uv irradiation for example esfahani et al found that a significant increase of pfos degradation from 8 to 55 1 as ph increasing from 4 6 to 9 1 which was due to that more eaq was generated by so3 2 in alkaline solution thereby achieving efficient degradation of pfos esfahani and mohseni 2022 furthermore in uv iodide system i2 disproportionates with oh to generate i at higher ph value 8 5 which further promotes the generation of eaq eq 35 in the meantime less i 2 and i 3 are generated which decreases the consumption of eaq via eqs 30 34 therefore high concentration eaq is realized under alkaline conditions due to the disproportionation reaction of i2 for example qu et al presented that the decomposition rate constant of pfoa by uv iodide at ph 9 0 was 0 0287 min 1 which was almost 48 times higher than that at ph 5 0 0 0006 min 1 qu et al 2014 this was attributed to the fact that alkaline conditions were more capable of promoting the recycle of i and inhibiting the quenching of eaq thus promoting the reduction process of pfoa 30 i i i 2 31 i i i 2 32 i i 2 i 3 33 e aq i 2 i 2 34 e aq i 3 i 2 i 35 3 i 2 6 o h io 3 5 i 3 h 2 o to avoid inhibitory effect of low ph on the reductive degradation process many efforts have been made for example gu et al added organo montmorillonite to uv indole system finding that 70 defluorination of pfoa was achieved even at ph 3 tian et al 2016 this was because protons in the structure of montmorillonite could be replaced by the hydrophobic phase which in turn prevented eaq being quenched by h similar results of wide ph range 3 11 were reported for the degradation of pfcs by uv indole derivatives in the presence of montmorillonite modified with different surfactants e g pvpcos ala chen et al 2019a kugler et al 2021 in addition chen et al developed a self assembled micelle composed of ctab modified iaa and pfoa finding that the micelle had almost same rate constant of pfoa at ph 4 8 0 75 0 1 h 1 indicating that uv ctab iaa system was capable of degrading pfoa in a wide ph range chen et al 2020b the phenomenon was attributed to the fact that the positively charged micelle protected the inner rection reaction inside from h 4 2 dissolved oxygen the presence of dissolved oxygen do obviously decreases the degradation efficiency of contaminants the negative impact is due to the quenching effect of do on eaq k 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 liu et al 2014 besides do reduces the yield of eaq because of its ability to adsorb some photons lyu et al 2015a in general the inhibitory effect of do on the decomposition of contaminants is very strong due to the continuous existence of do for example park et al found that the degradation of pfos by uv iodide at 150 min with ar bubbling was 95 which was much higher than that of with air bubbling 2 park et al 2009 additionally qu et al presented overall defluorination efficiency of pfoa in uv iodide system was 98 and 5 in the presence and absence of o2 respectively qu et al 2010 cao et al showed that the defluorination rate of f 53b by uv iodide with n2 bubbling was 25 65 which was higher than that of with o2 bubbling 11 08 cao et al 2022 liu et al found that uv sulfite achieved 81 bromate degradation efficiency with n2 bubbling 0 5 l min 1 while uv sulfite only degraded 27 bromate with do bubbling 0 5 l min 1 liu et al 2014 these findings show that the efficient degradation of contaminants requires strict anaerobic conditions however efforts have been made to minimize the quenching effect of o2 on eaq a strategy is to select an appropriate eaq source chemical for photoionization to minimize the adverse effect of do gu et al 2017b esfahani et al 2022 among them sulfite is reported to be a source chemical that avoids the quenching effect of eaq for instance gu et al proposed that the degradation efficiency of pfos by uv sulfite was almost the same in o2 purging solution as in n2 puring solution gu et al 2016 this was because the formed so 3 reacted with o2 via eq 13 followed by a chain photoreaction with sulfite via eqs 14 and 15 when the molar ratio of do to sulfite was 1 2 do was almost quenched by sulfite thereby promoting the net yield of eaq esfahani and mohseni 2022 as a result the quenching of do on eaq can be minimized which is favorable for applying in environmental engineering in addition to sulfite apca also inhibits the quenching effect of do for example sun et al found that the defluorination rate of pfos by uv nta were 46 8 and 35 8 under n2 and air saturation respectively sun et al 2018 the phenomenon was due to that nta and excited nta nta were capable of reacting with o2 when air was present thereby promoting the net yield of eaq which in turn improved the degradation of pfos notably organo montmorillonite was reported to protect eaq from quenching by o2 enabling uv indole derivative to perform at ambient conditions zhang et al 2018 for instance chen et al added organo montmorillonite in uv iaa system finding that pfoa were completely removed under both n2 and ambient conditions chen et al 2019a this was because montmorillonite could not only adsorb iaa and pfoa to the interlayer but also the hydrophobic phase used for modification effectively prevented o2 from entering the interlayer to quench eaq 4 3 eaq source chemical concentration the concentration of eaq source chemical e g sulfite iodide is an essential factor in decomposing contaminants because it is directly related to the generation of eaq in uv iodide system the removal efficiency of pfas increases with the increase of i concentration within a certain range and then decreases with the increase of i concentration as reported the range of iodide concentration was 0 25 10 mm qu et al 2014 sun et al 2017a 2017b and the optimum i concentration was mostly 0 3 mm guo et al 2018 cao et al 2022 for example qu et al found that the defluorination rate of pfoa by uv iodide increased from 2 to 98 9 as increasing i concentration from 0 mm to 0 3 mm and decreased to 4 as increasing i concentration to 0 7 mm qu et al 2010 the adverse effect of excess i concentration was that generated i2 and i3 in the reaction was capable of quenching eaq resulting in low yields of eaq eqs 33 and 34 similarly pfas decomposition efficiency is proportional to so3 2 concentration in general more eaq produced as increasing so3 2 concentration 1 20 mm gu et al 2017a esfahani and mohseni 2022 and the optimum so3 2 concentration for decomposing pfas is 20 mm bao et al 2018 for example song et al presented that the degradation ratio of pfoa increased from 5 6 to 90 when the so3 2 concentration increased from 0 5 to 20 mm which could be explained by the linear relationship between the calculated relative quasi stationary concentration of eaq and sulfite concentration song et al 2013 interestingly although the sulfite concentration required to degrade pfas is high 10 mm the sulfite concentration required to degrade bdps is lower 2 mm botlaguduru et al 2015 for example liu et al found that bromate decomposition rate increased to 100 within 2 mm so 3 2 liu et al 2014 4 4 uv type uv type plays an important role in the degradation of contaminants and different uv lights excite different uv wavelengths of photons as reported in previous literatures the types of uv lamps are classified into low pressure uv lamp uv l 254 nm esfahani and mohseni 2022 medium pressure uv lamp uv m 200 600 nm jung et al 2014 and high pressure uv lamp uv h 200 600 nm uv l is considered as the most commonly used light source for degrading various contaminants owing to its low energy consumption and environmental protection as reported mcaa li et al 2012 bromate jung et al 2016 pfas song et al 2013 were effectively degraded under uv l irradiation however the specific emission spectrum and low fluence rate of uv l limit its ability to efficiently degrade certain contaminants e g bromate pfas for example jung et al found that the degradation time and rate constant of bromate with uv m irradiation were 50 min and 0 051 min 1 respectively which were superior to those with uv l irradiation 240 min and 0 017 min 1 jung et al 2014 similar result was observed by xiao et al and the author exhibited that the rate constant of bromate under uv m irradiation was 0 036 min 1 which was more than 5 times higher than that under uv l irradiation 0 007 min 1 xiao et al 2017b this was mainly because uv m has a wider distribution range 200 600 nm including the absorbance peak of bromate at 195 nm amy et al 1998 additionally abusallout et al found that high defluorination efficiencies of pfoa 82 and pfos 65 were achieved by uv m sulfite system which was attributed to the fact that high energy emitted by uv m could overcome ph adjustment and the quenching effect of o2 thereby promoting the eaq yield abusallout et al 2021 in fact light intensity and photon flux of high pressure uv lamp uv h was reported as 1000 mw cm 2 and 3 13 10 6 einstein s 1 cm 2 zhang et al 2012 which was much higher than that of uv l 3 5 mw cm 2 3 37 10 8 einstein s 1 cm 2 song et al 2013 and uv m 4 9 mw cm 2 respectively thus uv h is more facilitate to generate more eaq and in turn effectively decomposing pfcs gu et al 2017b for example gu et al found that compared with eaq generated by uv sulfite with uv l or uv m abundant eaq were generated by uv sulfite with uv h thus completely degrading pfos within 30 min gu et al 2016 generally electrical energy is calculated by using the electrical energy per order eeo kwh m 3 value which represents the energy required to reduce contaminant concentration by an order of magnitude in 1 m3 of contaminated water eq 36 36 e eo 2 303 p k v where p kw is lamp power k h 1 is pseudo first order rate constant v m3 is solution volume the eeo value of uv h sulfite for pfoa degradation was 3 253 kwh m 3 chen et al 2020b which was much higher than that of uv m sulfite 495 kwh m 3 abusallout et al 2021 and uv l sulfite 15 7 kwh m 3 bentel et al 2020 indicating that uv h sulfite is not economical therefore it can be concluded that uv h sulfite system is not suitable for treating large scale contaminated water because of its high electrical energy consumption 4 5 water matrix water matrix is ubiquitous in real water including inorganic matters e g co existing anions zhang et al 2022 alkalinity lyu et al 2015b and dissolved organic matters nom e g humic acid sun et al 2017b it is noticed that water matrix exhibits enhanced or inhibiting effect on the degradation of contaminants the enhanced effect is due to the fact that water matrix acts as source chemical to generate eaq which promotes reduction process meanwhile water matrix blocks uv light and the photolysis of water matrix quenches eaq which inhibits the decomposition of contaminants therefore it is essential to investigate the effect of water matrix to evaluate the application potential of eaq based photochemical processes in water treatment cl hco3 and no3 2 are common co existing anions in natural water matrix due to their high reactivity towards eaq buxton et al 1988 these co existing anions have inhibitory effects on the photo reductive degradation of contaminants to varying degrees fennell et al 2022a for example zhang et al found that the degradation efficiency of mcaa by uv sulfite system was 92 which was much higher than that by uv sulfite system in the presence of 8 mm cl 39 4 and hco3 67 7 respectively implying that the quenching effect of cl was higher than hco3 on eaq zhang et al 2022 interestingly no3 2 has significant inhibitory effect on the removal of contaminants which is often classified as a quencher to confirm the dominant role of eaq gu et al 2017a xiao et al 2017b in addition alkalinity natural ph buffer 8 can improve the availability of eaq and promote the decomposition of contaminants lyu et al 2015b humic acid ha as the major constituent of nom is capable of significantly promoting the decomposition efficiency of various contaminant in photo reductive system for example sun et al investigated that the defluorination of pfos by uv iodide increased from 4 4 to 55 6 in the presence of ha 1 mg l 1 sun et al 2017b guo et al reported that the rate constant of pfoa by uv iodide ha was 0 0137 min 1 which was higher than that of by uv iodide 0 0116 min 1 guo et al 2018 this was not only because ha could reduce iodide oxide e g i2 hoi io 3 i 3 to i but also the quinone group in ha could act as an electron shuttle to improve the electron transfer capacity however high concentration of ha in turn inhibits the removal efficiency of contaminants for example jung et al pointed out that the rate constant of bromate in uv sulfite ha system increased from 0 017 to 0 071 min 1 as increasing ha concentration from 0 to 1 mg l 1 and then decreased to 0 030 min 1 as it further increased to 5 mg l 1 jung et al 2016 the negative effect of ha was attributed to the fact that excessive ha reacted with photons or sulfite resulting in low yields of eaq 5 application for reducing various contaminants with eaq 5 1 perfluorinated compounds perfluorinated compounds pfcs are a group of chemicals that contain c f bonds due to their high c f bond 116 kcal mol 1 pfcs exhibit strong recalcitrance to physical and biological treatments compared with advanced treatment techniques including advanced oxidation process jiao et al 2022 li et al 2020 zero valent iron reduction blotevogel et al 2018 and photocatalytic reduction huang et al 2017 eaq based photochemical processes present significantly higher pfcs decomposition efficiency fig 5 b for comparison fig 5a shows the redox potentials of eaq and other reactive species so 4 oh zero valent iron zvi and conduction band electron ecb 5 1 1 perfluorinated carboxylic acids perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas cnf2n 1coo are a type of pfcs characterized by the carboxylic group located at the end of perfluoroalkyl chains with varying lengths n 1 panchangam et al 2009 it is found that eaq is capable of effectively reducing pfcas and the characteristics of eaq based photochemical processes to degrade pfcas are summarized as follows commonly the decomposing efficiency of pfcas is not limited by variable fluoroalkyl chain lengths n 2 to 10 which can be manifested by their similar degradation and defluorination rates for example bentel et al presented that complete degradation rate of pfcas n 2 to 10 was achieved by uv sulfite system within 8 12 h and the defluorination rate of pfcas at 48 h was also similar ranging from 50 63 to 58 23 bentel et al 2019 similar phenomenon was found by park et al that the degradation rate constant of pfcas n 3 5 7 by uv iodide were all about 0 0014 min 1 park et al 2009 this was attributed to the fact that the lowest c f bond dissociation energies bdes in n 2 pfcas was α position cf2 106 5 107 3 kcal mol 1 regardless of chain length and h f exchange also occurred at α position indicating that n 2 pfcas had the similar initial reaction site esfahani et al 2022 bentel et al 2020 however the decomposition of trifluoroacetate tfa cf3coo n 1 is an exception for instance bentel et al found that the degradation rate of tfa 81 4 at 12 h was lower than that of n 2 pfcas 100 which was attributed to the fact that c f bdes in tfa 116 8 kcal mol 1 was stronger than the α position cf2 in n 2 pfcas 106 5 107 3 kcal mol 1 resulting in the failure to directly cleavage c f bond during tfa degradation bentel et al 2020 meanwhile the defluorination rate of tfa 100 was higher than that of n 2 pfcas 54 which was due to the fact that tfa produced inorganic f co2 and h2o via dheh cycle instead of h f exchange and in turn achieving complete defluorination cui et al 2020 perfluorooctanoic acid c7f15cooh pfoa as a representative of pfca n 7 is reported to be effectively decomposed by eaq generated different source chemicals under different experimental conditions for example gu et al found that 100 degradation and 45 7 defluorination rates of pfoa by uv sulfite were achieved within 10 min at ph 9 2 and 5 mg l 1 do gu et al 2017b chen et al reported that uv indole achieved 100 degradation and 90 defluorination rates of pfoa in the presence of ctab under ambient conditions including neutral room temperature and aerobic environment chen et al 2020a in addition pfoa degradation rate tends to be higher than its defluorination rate for instance the degradation rate of pfoa was as high as 100 bao et al 2018 while pfoa defluorination rate was 46 8 74 78 gu et al 2020 except for some special reports of almost complete defluorination qu et al 2010 the phenomenon was because pfoa produced f containing intermediates due to the cleavage of cc bonds without the simultaneous release of f compared with so 4 or oh generated by oxidative system eaq generated by reductive system has higher pfoa degradation efficiency for example bao et al found that the degradation rate of pfoa in reductive uv sulfite system was 100 which was 3 8 times higher than that in oxidative uv persulfate ps system 26 bao et al 2018 qu et al presented the degradation rate constant of pfoa by reductive uv iodide system 0 0073 min 1 was higher than that by oxidative uv ps system 0 0014 min 1 qu et al 2010 this was due to the fact that the cleavage of c f 544 kj mol 1 bonds of pfoa could not be directly attacked by so 4 or oh 276 kj mol 1 in addition to high degradation efficiency the reaction conditions required for pfoa degradation by eaq are mild and the final products are environmentally friendly for example qu et al pointed out that the final products of pfoa degradation by uv iodide were f formic acid and acetic acid among them f was easily removed from water and formic acid or acetic acid produced by the reaction could also avoid the problem of co2 emission qu et al 2010 5 1 2 perfluorinated sulfonic acids perfluorinated sulfonic acids pfsas cnf2n 1 so3 are typical pfcs which are characterized by the fact that the sulfonic group is located at the end of the perfluoroalkyl chain with varying length n 1 panchangam et al 2009 the degradation of pfsas by eaq based photochemical processes has the following characteristics first the degradation kinetics and f release of pfsas is closely related to chain length park et al 2009 this was because the lowest c f bdes was located in the middle of fluoroalkyl chain and the h f exchange occurred in the middle of pfsas which further split into two short fluorocarbon chains bentel et al 2019 therefore pfsas degradation and defluorination increased with the increase of chain length gu et al 2020 whereas as mentioned before the degradation and defluorination efficiency of pfcas are independent of chain length for example park et al presented that the reaction rate constant of pfbs n 4 k 0 0004 min 1 pfhs n 6 k 0 0012 min 1 pfos n 8 k 0 0030 min 1 increased with increasing chain length of pfsas while pfba n 3 pfha n 5 and pfoa n 7 had the similar degradation rate constant although they are different pfcas with variable chain length k 0 0013 min 1 park et al 2009 second the degradation rate constant of n 1 pfsas is slower than that of n 1 pfcas implying that pfsas are more difficult to be degraded by eaq than pfcas for example bentel et al found that the degradation and defluorination rates of the n 1 pfsas cf3so3 were negligible while the degradation and defluorination rates of n 1 pfcas tfa were 81 4 and 100 at 12 h respectively bentel et al 2019 similarly gu et al reported that the rate constant of pfos by uv sulfite was 0 118 min 1 gu et al 2016 which was 4 times lower than that of pfoa 0 455 min 1 gu et al 2017b abusallout et al presented that the defluorination rate constant of pfos 0 0314 0 01 min 1 by uv sulfite was lower than that of pfoa 0 0616 0 008 min 1 under the same conditions abusallout et al 2021 this is because c f bdes for the α position cf2 near coo in pfcas is 106 5 107 3 kcal mol 1 which is lower than those of α position cf2 near so3 in pfsas 109 2 113 6 kcal mol 1 bentel et al 2019 as a result compared with pfsa α position cf2 in pfcas is easier to be attacked by eaq thereby achieving high degradation and defluorination efficiency in addition due to their different head groups e g so3 and coo h f exchange occurs at different locations in the pfsas and pfcas structure thus affecting their degradation pathway h f exchange occurs in the middle of perfluoroalkyl chain in pfsas because based on all c f bdes 106 4 118 8 kcal mol 1 the middle cf2 group has lowest bdes 106 4 106 9 kcal mol 1 bentel et al 2019 h f exchange occurs at α position of pfcas which was due to the fact that based on all c f bdes 106 8 118 1 kcal mol 1 c f bdes at α position cf2 in pfcas is lowest 106 8 107 3 kcal mol 1 bentel et al 2020 furthermore liner and branched isomers of pfos have different reactivity towards eaq the degradation efficiency of branched pfos is much faster than that of linear pfos kugler et al 2021 for instance lin et al found that the rate constant of branched pfos by uv sulfite 0 0806 min 1 was much higher than the linear one 0 00029 min 1 jin et al 2015 likewise gu et al reported that negligible degradation of linear pfos was observed in uv iodide within 30 min while the degradation rate of branched pfos was 60 gu et al 2016 this was attributed to the fact that the tertiary c f bonds in branched pfos possessed higher adiabatic electron affinity compared to linear pfos which provides more electron attachment sites and make it easier to be decomposed by eaq 5 1 3 perfluorinated alternatives hexafluoropropylene oxide oligomer acids hfpo oa include hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid hfpo ta and hexafluoropropylene oxide tetramer acid hfpo tea which are alternatives to pfoa the characteristics of eaq based photochemical processes to decompose hfpo oa are as follows first eaq generated by reductive system is more effective than so 4 generated by oxidative system for hfpo oa degradation for example bao et al presented that the degradation rate of hfpo da in uv sulfite system at 3 h was 100 which was much higher than that of in uv ps system 5 bao et al 2018 this may be due to the nucleophilicity of eaq effectively splitting the ether group in the hfpo da molecule while α cf3 in the hfpo da molecule would interfere with the attack of coo by so 4 second the degradation products of hfpo oa in reductive system are more environmentally friendly than those in oxidative system this is because hfpo oa can be completely degraded into co2 f and hcoo in uv sulfite system bao et al 2019b however in ps system the final product of hfpo tea and hfpo ta is hfpo da which is difficult to be oxidized by so 4 leading to a large amount of hfpo da accumulation li et al 2020 besides the defluorination efficiency of hfpo da is higher than that of pfoa in reductive system for example the defluorination rate of hfpo da by uv sulfite at 4 h 85 was higher than of pfoa 60 bao et al 2018 which was attributed that the ether bond in hfpo da led to the instability of the intermediate and thus shortened the defluorination process monochlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate f 53 and perfluoroalkyl ether potassium sulfonate f 53b as synthesized alternatives to pfos posing a threaten to human health gao et al 2016 it is found that f 53b is not oxidized by heat activated ps technology thus eaq based photochemical processes are confirmed to effectively decompose f 53b compared with direct photolysis eaq generated by different photo reductive systems can degrade f 53b more efficiently for example cao et al demonstrated that the defluorination rate of f 53b at 2 h in uv iodide system was 17 which was more than 3 times higher than that in sole uv system 4 8 cao et al 2022 and the degradation pathway was that f 53b was dechlorinated by the attack of eaq first followed by the continuous shedding of ch2 units additionally bao et al observed that the degradation efficiency of f 53b by uv sulfite was higher than that of f 53 which was attribute to the fact that c cl bdes 305 9 kj mol 1 in f 53 b was lower than c f bdes 482 7 kj mol 1 in f 53 bao et al 2019a indicating that the reduction ability of f 53b was enhanced by in the presence of cl atom moreover almost no degradation efficiency of f 53 and f 53b was achieved by uv ps while 90 degradation rate of f 53 and f 53b was achieved by uv sulfite under the same condition bao et al 2019a demonstrating the reduction process was superior to the oxidation process 5 1 4 practical pfcs containing water it is reported that eaq based photochemical processes has the feasibility of decomposing practical pfcs containing water e g industrial wastewater groundwater for example qu et al pointed out that uv iodide degraded 96 pfoa containing industrial wastewater within 12 h qu et al 2010 chen et al found that 100 degradation efficiency of pfoa containing industrial wastewater was achieved by uv indole derivative in the presence of organo montmorillonite chen et al 2019a and ctab chen et al 2020a indicating that photo reductive system has great potential for degrading practical wastewater in addition liu et al presented that a pilot scale combination of nanofiltration no and uv sulfite was capable of degrading 12 pfass detected in groundwater and the results showed that more than 90 pfas was degraded after 8 h by hybrid no uv sulfite system liu et al 2021 notably compared with other methods eaq based photochemical processes exhibit higher economic feasibility in practical applications for example the calculated eeo of pilot scale no uv sulfite for pfoa was 3 7 kwh m 3 liu et al 2021 which was almost 4 times and 14 times lower than that of pilot scale plasma technology 16 kwh m 3 nau hix et al 2021 and photocatalytic process 51 kwh m 3 qanbarzadeh et al 2020 respectively indicating that no uv sulfite is economical furthermore the energy cost of hybrid no uv sulfite system is much lower than that of bench scale uv sulfite system for instance the eeo of hybrid no uv sulfite for pfoa and pfos is 3 7 kwh m 3 and 5 2 kwh m 3 respectively which were much higher than that of uv sulfite 36 7 kwh m 3 and 51 9 kwh m 3 respectively liu et al 2021 this was attributed to the fact that the volume of water treated in the hybrid system 568 l is an order of magnitude larger than that in the uv reactor 57 l therefore eaq based photochemical processes has applicability and cost effectiveness in practical application 5 2 disinfection by products disinfection by products dbps include monochloroacetic acid bromate n nitrosodimethylamine which are harmful to human health due to their toxicity and bioaccumulation kimura et al 2017 due to the high reactivity of eaq to halogenated compounds the c x x cl br bond can be attacked by eaq to break rapidly thus releasing halide ions furthermore eaq has high reaction rate constant with n nitrosodimethylamine 1 41 1010 m 1 s 1 therefore eaq based photochemical processes are considered to be the most efficient method to degrade dbps fig 5b 5 2 1 monochloroacetic acid monochloroacetic acid mcaa is a kind of dbps with strong ecological risk owing to their high efficiency and environmental friendly products eaq based photochemical processes are demonstrated to effectively degrade mcaa liu et al 2014 the detailed degradation characteristics are as follows first compared with zvi reduction tang et al 2015 and photocatalytic oxidation wu et al 2007 eaq based photochemical processes present higher degradation efficiency for example the reaction rate constant of mcaa by reductive uv iodide system was 0 0218 min 1 yu et al 2018 which was much higher than that by zvi reduction 0 00273 min 1 tang et al 2015 and oxidative uv o3 tio2 0 0027 min 1 mas et al 2005 respectively second the degradation products of mcaa by eaq based photochemical processes are environmentally friendly for example li et al found that the products of mcaa by uv sulfite are acetic acid hac succinic acid sa and sulfoacetic acid saa respectively li et al 2012 which avoids the direct mineralization of contaminants into co2 whereas in oxidative uv h2o2 system the final products were toxic halogenated organic matters e g ethylene chlorohydrin wu et al 2007 besides compared with the sole system the combined photo reductive systems have higher efficiency for mcaa degradation for instance yu et al proposed that the degradation rate constant of mcaa by uv sulfite iodide was 0 2572 min 1 which was higher than that by uv sulfite 0 0672 min 1 and uv iodide 0 0218 min 1 respectively yu et al 2018 the phenomenon is due to the pronounced synergistic effect of s iv and iodide on the one hand eaq can be generated by sulfite and iodide under uv irradiation on the other hand generated reactive iodine species can be reduced by sulfite to i thus increasing the net yield of eaq 5 2 2 bromate bromate bro3 is a typical dbp that is highly persistent and environmentally recalcitrant in water compared with traditional methods morais et al 2019 qiao et al 2019 eaq based photochemical processes show excellent performance in decomposing bromate jung et al 2016 xiao et al 2017a xiao et al 2017b compared with ecb reduction and zvi reduction the reduction efficiency of bromate by eaq is higher for instance the degradation rate constant of bromate by uv sulfite was 0 088 min 1 qiao et al 2019 which was higher than that by uv tio2 graphene 0 0094 min 1 huang et al 2014 and zvi reduction 0 0169 min 1 xin et al 2018 respectively additionally the byproducts of bromate degradation by eaq based photochemical processes are relatively green bromide botlaguduru et al 2015 while the membrane separation only concentrates the bromate solution which requires further post processing moslemi et al 2012 furthermore compared with direct photolysis uv sulfite is more economical due to its reduced operating costs for example nawaz et al pointed out that the electricity cost required for uv sulfite was 9 1 m3 which was 2 times lower than that required for direct photolysis 18 m3 indicating that uv sulfite was economical nawaz et al 2017 notably eaq based photochemical processes also exhibit high performance for bromate removal in practical water treatment for example xiao et al found that a pilot scale uv sulfite system degraded 60 bromate in raw water from tai lake within 30 min at ph 7 0 xiao et al 2017a xiao et al also found that the degradation efficiency of bromate in tap water from yangtze river by uv sulfite within 30 min at ph 7 0 was 82 xiao et al 2017b the degradation efficiency of bromate in tap water from yangtze river by uv sulfite was higher than that in raw water from tai lake the inconsistence was due to the fact that the concentration of dissolved organic carbon and nitrate in tap water was lower than that in raw water indicating that the inhibitory effect of water matrix in tap water is weaker than that in raw water 5 2 3 n nitrosodimethylamine n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is a dbp produced during chlorine disinfection process of chloramination and chlorination which is carcinogenic and mutagenic compared with oxidation process eaq based photochemical processes have higher decomposition efficiency of ndma for example the degradation rate constant by reductive uv iodide and uv sulfite systems were 0 60 min 1 sun et al 2017a and 0 70 min 1 seid et al 2020 respectively which were higher than by oxidative uv h2o2 0 0613 min 1 zhou et al 2012 in addition eaq based photochemical processes is able to generate non toxic products when degrading ndma thus decreasing the potential secondary pollution for example sun et al presented that the final products of ndma in uv iodide system were hcoo and n2 which effectively avoided the regeneration of ndma sun et al 2017a whereas gui et al found that the reduction of ndma by metallic fe or ni fe catalysts produced toxic intermediate such as dma among them dma was the precursor of ndma which could cause secondary pollution gui et al 2000 5 3 nitrate nitrate no3 pollution is increasing due to the overuse of nitrogen fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels which has a significant adverse impact on the water environment compared with traditional methods the degradation of nitrate by eaq based photochemical processes has the following characteristics firstly eaq based photochemical processes have higher nitrate degradation efficiency than zvi reduction for example the reaction rate constant of nitrate by uv sulfite was 0 050 min 1 tan et al 2021 which was much higher than by zvi reduction 0 007 min 1 kim et al 2012 the phenomenon is attributed to the fact that eaq is thermodynamically capable of converting nitrate to n2 and has high reaction kinetics for nitrogen species secondly eaq based photochemical processes are beneficial to improve the sensitivity of nitrate conversion to n2 thereby promoting the generation of harmless n2 for example tan et al presented that 100 nitrate could be reduced to n2 by uv sulfite within 90 min tan et al 2021 indicating eaq based photochemical processes are environmental friendly method in comparison nitrate was mainly transformed to undesired ammonium by zvi reduction which could not be removed from water kim et al 2012 similarly chen et al found that formate radical generated by uv formate system caused 30 selectivity of n2 chen et al 2019b additionally eaq based photochemical processes are cost effective compared with ion exchange barrabésa et al 2011 and zero valent iron kim et al 2012 eaq based photochemical processes do not produce secondary waste and use toxic reducing agents avoiding expensive post treatment and waste of chemical solvents 6 conclusion and research prospects hydrated electron eaq based photochemical processes show a good application prospective in decomposing various oxidative contaminants but for target contaminants selecting an appropriate photo reductive system under different operation conditions has been a concerned problem herein we presented a critical review focusing on the characteristics of different eaq based photochemical processes the identification methods of eaq the factors influencing eaq generation and the degradation regularities of contaminants i the required environment advantages and disadvantages of various photo reductive systems are different therefore the characteristics of each system is summarized to achieve efficient decomposition efficiency of contaminants for example uv iodide is able to decompose contaminants under weakly acidic conditions and the concentration of iodide is low however uv iodide system cannot be accomplished under aerobic conditions uv sulfite is not easily susceptible to dissolved oxygen but it is mostly used under strong alkaline conditions and sulfite concentration is high uv apca can degrade pfoa without controlling dissolved oxygen while formed byproducts produce a foul odor uv indole derivative is capable of decomposing pfoa at ambient environment but it has a relatively low degradation kinetics ii the summary of eaq identification methods is beneficial to explore the degradation mechanism behavior and pathway induced by eaq among them laser flash photolysis is a direct identification method but it requires large testing equipment quenching studies and chemical probes use the reactivity of quenchers with different reactive species e g eaq h to indirectly confirm the generation of eaq electron spin resonance technique is an auxiliary method to demonstrate eaq generation together with quenching studies or chemical probe iii the analysis of the factors influencing the photo reductive process contributes to promote the yield of eaq thus enhancing photo reductive efficiency alkaline conditions are favorable for eaq release the presence of dissolved oxygen generally inhibits eaq generation increasing the concentration of source chemicals to some extent can enhance eaq formation eaq generation increases with the increase of the excitation wavelength of uv lamp but more energy will be consumed considering the complicated context of water and wastewater the enhanced or inhibitory effect towards contaminant removal depends on the type and concentration of water matrix for example coexisting ions such as chloride bicarbonate and nitrate inhibit the degradation efficiency due to their quenching effect on eaq alkaline as natural buffer is positive for degrading contaminants a certain concentration of humic acid acts as photosensitizer enhances eaq generation whereas high humic acid concentration results in a low yield of eaq due to its quenching effect iv due to high reactivity of eaq with halogenated organic compounds and nitrogen containing compounds eaq based photochemical processes is capable of decomposing perfluorinated compounds disinfection by products and nitrate although current investigations imply that eaq based photochemical processes are efficient for the degradation of various oxidative contaminants further research is still needed to promote its potential application in practical water treatment based on this review several suggestions are made as follows i the yield of eaq in different photo reductive system needs to be improved due to the high reactivity of eaq with coexisting quenches such as h do and oh the number of eaq available for reducing contaminants is greatly decreased thus one method is to use new and more efficient eaq source chemical to enhance the quantum yield of eaq another method is to add appropriate reductant to minimize the quenching effect of coexisting quenchers on eaq for instance alleviating h inhibition by adding reductant can reduce the dependence of eaq based photochemical processes on alkaline ph therefore avoiding expensive ph adjustment ii the water safety caused by eaq based photochemical processes in the process of decomposing contaminants need to be further investigated firstly excessive addition of eaq source chemicals is harmful to the water environment for example excessive sulfites can result in sulfate concentrations that are higher than the standards for drinking water quality of china and america high concentrations of indole and its derivatives produce an extremely unpleasant taste secondly the degradation intermediates and their toxicity after eaq based photochemical processes need to be researched as the degradation products may be more toxic than the parent compounds eventually the effect of eaq based photochemical processes on the formation of disinfection by products e g iodinated disinfection by products needs to be assessed iodine species e g i2 i generated by uv iodide may react with some organic compounds to form iodine dbps which increase the toxicity in the reaction iii at present the decomposition of contaminants by eaq based photochemical processes is mostly performed in the laboratory the following points need to be considered if applying this technology in practical water treatment firstly most of the wastewater in the laboratory is synthetic which contains high concentrations and single types of contaminants however the diversity and complexity of water samples need to be considered in practical contaminated water although the review has discussed the effect of inorganic matters e g coexisting anions alkalinity and dissolved organic matters e g humic acid in water on contaminant degradation efficiency the effect of other special dissolved organic matters e g effluent organic matter efom should also be concerned secondly because the suspended substances in the practical water can easily cause light refraction or scattering the utilization rate of light is very low thus designing an efficient photoreactor is crucial iv integrating eaq based photochemical processes with other chemical or physical methods can provide multiple barriers for degrading contaminants in water thereby improving the overall decomposition efficiency for instance combing oxidation system uv tio2 with uv sulfite can generate degradation products with low toxicity and high mineralization capacity or adding a nanofiltration process before uv sulfite can effectively concentrate contaminated water which is more conductive to subsequent photo reductive degradation of contaminants

discuss how these properties can be included in models to study and predict the rejection of omps initially an omp classification is proposed to capture the relevant properties of 58 omps following the methodology described in this study more and new omps can be easily included in this classification the classification aims to increase the comprehension and mechanistic understanding of omp removal based on the physicochemical principles used to classify the 58 omps it is expected that other omps in the same groups will be similarly rejected from this classification we present an overview of the rejection mechanisms involved in the removal of specific omp groups for instance we discuss the removal of omps classified as perfluoroalkyl substances e g perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa these substances are highly relevant due to their human toxicity at extremely low concentration as well as their persistence and omnipresence in the environment finally we discuss how the rejection of omps can be predicted by describing both the membrane solution interface and calculating the transport of solutes inside the membrane we illustrate the importance and impact of different rejection mechanisms and interfacial phenomena on omp removal and propose an extended nernst plank equation to calculate the transport of solutes across the membrane due to convection diffusion and electromigration finally we show how the theory discussed in this review leads to improved predictions of omp rejection by the membranes keywords nanofiltration reverse osmosis micropollutant removal rejection model micropollutant classification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction organic micropollutants omps are chemicals that occur in the environment due to human activities e g agriculture medicine consumption and due to industrial activities in general the concentrations of these substances in aquatic environments remain at trace levels i e ppb level stamm et al 2016 moreover omps e g carbamazepine sotalol pfoa metronidazole diuron are increasingly found in water sources across the world in europe barbosa et al 2016 möller et al 2010 robles molina et al 2014 tröger et al 2018 the usa mead et al 2009 oppenheimer et al 2011 wang et al 2020b and china ren et al 2020 yan et al 2018 therefore concerns about drinking water safety and public health have been raised schwarzenbach et al 2006 because of potential long term effects of omps on human health these compounds are often on national watch lists and defined as contaminants of emerging concern barbosa et al 2016 verliefde et al 2007a an example is the growing attention to perfluoroalkyl substances and the risk that they represent to human health in europe contaminated drinking water with perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos is one important contributor to the exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances schrenk et al 2020 another clear example is the concern about substances classified as nitrosamines which can be carcinogenic and which are not sufficiently removed by membranes research on omps has focused on developing new analytical techniques and detection methods richardson and ternes 2011 schmidt 2018 evaluating environmental risks of different omps figuière et al 2022 gross and osterle 1968 licona et al 2018 sanganyado et al 2021 yang et al 2022 and developing technologies to remove omps in wastewater treatment luo et al 2014 ma et al 2018b and drinking water production piai et al 2019 plakas and karabelas 2012 vergili 2013 in this review we will focus on omp removal with membrane based processes in drinking water production previous authors have thoroughly reviewed the theory behind removal of omps with membranes khanzada et al 2020 liu et al 2009 plakas and karabelas 2012 schäfer et al 2011 teodosiu et al 2018 in this review we summarize this theory to support and explain the advantages of a properties based classification and approaches and suggestions are given to improve existing models conventional water treatment processes such as coagulation flocculation sedimentation and sand filtration do not effectively remove all omps and advanced water treatment processes awt are often considered to achieve higher removal in drinking water treatment plants dwtps several reviews discussed available technologies to remove omps in drinking water production benner et al 2013 teodosiu et al 2018 wang et al 2020a yang et al 2014 of these technologies adsorption on activated carbon or on other materials advanced oxidation processes aops and membrane based processes are the most promising in terms of removal efficiencies teodosiu et al 2018 in adsorption processes omps are adsorbed onto the adsorption materials and are thereby removed from water piai et al 2021 aops are based on the production of hydroxyl radicals to break down and remove omps from contaminated water the downside of aops is the production of toxic by products which can be even more toxic than the original omps during the oxidation process ates and argun 2021 von gunten 2018 wang et al 2019 membrane based processes such as nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have become an attractive option to remove omps in dwtps the operational principle of these membrane based processes is similar a pressure gradient is the main driving force and a semi permeable membrane acts as a barrier for contaminants compared to ro nf employs membranes with bigger pores resulting in a lower rejection of solutes but nf has the advantage that it can be operated at lower pressure the removal efficiency of most omps with ro and nf is higher than with other advanced water treatment processes such as adsorption on activated carbon and advanced oxidation lee et al 2012 song et al 2020 sudhakaran et al 2013 and toxic by products are not produced mestankova et al 2016 schwarzenbach et al 2006 veloutsou et al 2014 although nf and ro show high removal of most omps albergamo et al 2020 xu et al 2020 the mechanisms of retention of these compounds remain poorly understood due to a lack of understanding it has been challenging to determine the key factors that govern the rejection and that can be tailored to further improve the removal of omps for instance it is not well understood how different omps behave at the membrane solution interface or how membrane and omp properties affect the transport of solutes inside the membrane therefore there is a need for mechanistic models that are derived from physicochemical principles to accurately predict rejection efficiencies of omps and to improve the removal performance of membrane based processes ideally mechanistic models can quantify the effect of interfacial phenomena and of key molecular properties to predict the rejection of omps and optimize process design in this review we will discuss several considerations in developing a theoretical approach to study and model omp removal with nf and ro this review covers the following topics the classification of omps using molecular properties on a continuous scale the rejection mechanisms involved in membrane based processes an overview of rejection rates with commercial membranes and theory to account for phenomena at the membrane solution interface and the transport of solutes inside the membrane unlike previous studies in this review we critically analyze each of these topics to provide a clear view of important research areas that need to be addressed propose alternatives to overcome challenges in the field and illustrate with model calculations the effect of physical and chemical phenomena on omp removal for instance we show how our novel classification can facilitate the development of models to test the rejection of omps and enable selecting prototypical model omps that can be used for the validation of theoretical models besides we explain and illustrate how the theory considerations and calculations in this review can be combined to improve the prediction of omp removal with existing models a classification of omps based on molecular properties contributes to the identification of critical parameters that affect the removal in a complex mixture containing different micropollutants omps are often complex organic molecules with a molecular weight up to 800 g mol a non spherical shape and a molecular structure that is composed of a combination of hydrophobic hydrophilic ionizable and ionic parts nam et al 2014 the large number of compounds that are classified as omps all with different molecular properties is one of the difficulties to develop a model that can be applied to all omps in this review we stress the importance of a systematic theory driven approach to study the removal of omps in nf and ro therefore to overcome the problem of the huge number of compounds that are considered as omps a classification that is based on molecular properties is proposed the molecular properties of omps together with the membrane characteristics and the chemistry of the solution are directly associated with the removal efficiency in nf and ro see fig 1 boussu et al 2008 zhu 2015 with the classification proposed in this study we can qualitatively indicate which rejection mechanisms e g size exclusion electrostatic repulsion and specific solute membrane interactions and transport mechanisms are predominant in the rejection of omps with similar properties furthermore we discuss theory to describe the membrane solution interface and to model omp transport inside the membrane we present approaches to account for size exclusion charge repulsion attraction and solute affinity towards the membrane which directly relate to the main rejection mechanisms section 3 in this review we give an overview of the transport theories commonly used in nf and ro and summarize previous attempts to study the transport of omps the extended nernst plank enp equation is used to calculate the transport of solutes due to diffusion convection and electromigration we discuss how the enp equation can be coupled to the description of the membrane solution interface to include the effect of size based exclusion charge regulation solute membrane interaction and molecule molecule interaction on the rejection of omps and therefore predict the removal performance of membrane based processes in summary this review focuses on the development of a theoretical approach to study and model omp removal only a model that combines the physicochemical interactions and transport mechanisms involved in the rejection of omps will be able to predict the removal performance of nf and ro for the wide range of omps that are present in commonly used water sources and support technology improvements e g new membrane developments and process optimization and design 2 classification models that capture all relevant molecular properties of omps and their transport through membranes are essential to gain a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in omp removal and to help the design of more effective membranes key steps in the development of these models are the identification of the relevant physicochemical properties and the validation of the models with experimental data for both a systematic analysis of omps is required and a classification of omps into well defined groups can help to achieve this in this section we propose a new apprach to classify micropollutants that has the potential to qualitative compare omp removal data identify problematic omps insufficient removal with specific membranes and facilitate model development and validation thus greatly advancing the study of omp removal micropollutants are traditionally classified based on their industrial provenance or usage lefebvre et al 2010 ren et al 2020 schwarzenbach et al 2006 such as pharmaceuticals pesticides flame retardants hormones industrial chemicals personal care products and more recently perfluoroalkyl substances pfas this classification is useful when evaluating and assessing the sources of contamination but it does not provide much relevant information to study and understand omp removal in membrane based processes to mitigate the limitations of provenance based classification many researchers list a collection of molecular properties in their studies kimura et al 2004 liu et al 2009 taheran et al 2016 however the omp application area is usually kept as the main classification criterion a different approach that can be more adequate is to group the organic compounds based on molecular properties bellona et al 2011 verliefde et al 2007a yangali quintanilla 2010 such as hydrophobicity molecular weight m w solubility polarizability etc this approach holds great potential because the molecular properties of omps give more insight into the possible removal mechanisms that are involved and that affect rejection efficiency during membrane based processes kiso et al 2001b liu et al 2009 verliefde et al 2007b for instance high hydrophobicity of omps might lead to lower retention by ro membranes due to adsorption and partitioning into the membrane boussu et al 2008 nghiem et al 2004 in most cases nf and ro membranes are hydrophobic therefore depending on the membrane characteristics the diffusion of hydrophobic solutes inside the membrane is enhanced octanol water partitioning coefficients log kow are frequently used to quantify the hydrophobicity of a molecule likewise polarity parametrized by the dipole moment could be an indicator of both hydrophobicity and attractive interactions between organic molecules steed and atwood 2009 the latter may be relevant to consider when studying the aggregation or cluster formation of molecules at or near membranes in addition to hydrophobicity and polarity the classification of omps must consider the capacity of these molecules to dissociate and carry a charge whether a molecule is ionic or neutral has been shown to significantly affect the retention of organic micropollutants albergamo et al 2019 yangali quintanilla 2010 the acid dissociation constant pka is often used to define the charge ability of molecules e g weakly charged uncharged schäfer et al 2011 several authors have started to explore the use of molecular properties to classify omps for instance verliefde et al 2007a classified 22 compounds to qualitatively study the prediction of omp rejection they defined groups based on a binary division of each compound into hydrophobic hydrophilic charged uncharged and below above the cutoff size of the membrane pores these three binary choices yielded eight groups which could be used to explain the behavior of the 22 omps reasonably well similarly de ridder et al 2010 used the structure of the molecules aromatic or aliphatic and whether these are able to form hydrogen bonds or not to define binary classes of compounds however many of the molecular properties invoked in these studies are continuous variables hence there is significant variation in the degree of hydrophobicity or net charge between omps that are classified as hydrophobic and charged in the binary choice models for instance using the aqueous solubility as a measure of hydrophobicity micropollutants commonly found to be hydrophobic can differ in solubility by three orders of magnitude likewise the k a of these micropollutants and thus their degree of de protonation can vary by as much as seven orders of magnitude consequently the properties of micropollutants within one binary group and therefore their retention by membranes may differ significantly to account for these differences between the binary classified hydrophobic or charged omps we suggest to take the classification of micropollutants one step further and propose here to identify groups of micropollutants based on their actual coordinates in the continuous 3d phase space defined by solubility in water charge ability γ and molecular weight charge ability is defined as pka for acid omps and 14 pkb for base omps and it indicates whether an omp will be charged at neutral ph regardless of the sign these properties are selected because they are good indicators molecular descriptors to analyze three fundamental phenomena involved in omp removal specifically molecular weight relates with steric exclusion γ with donnan exclusion and solubility with possible omp membrane interactions molecular weight is not a direct measure of molecular dimensions however it can still indicate the molecule size and it is an easily accessible and well defined parameter van der bruggen and vandecasteele 2002 solubility in water is used as an improved measure of hydrophobicity instead of the octanol water partitioning coefficient because some of the omps we have included notably pfas are also barely soluble in organic solvents such as octanol which could distort the interpretation of log kow s this approach uses the quantitative physicochemical properties of micropollutants and contains no implicit bias based on the usage or occurrence of compounds moreover by using a continuous scale all the values of the molecular properties are considered therefore a more precise description of each group is possible in total 58 of the most frequently detected and problematic micropollutants were classified the selection was made based on previous studies and aims to include a broad number of compounds with various molecular properties and different usage e g pharmaceuticals pesticides industrial chemicals de grooth et al 2014 khanzada et al 2020 lai et al 2016 schoonenberg kegel et al 2010 taheran et al 2016 van beelen 2000 verliefde et al 2007a yangali quintanilla et al 2010b 2010a the omps were then automatically allocated to separate groups using a cluster finding algorithm in matlab i e hierarchical clustering and an f test was used to determine the optimal number of groups the optimal number of groups to classify the 58 omps based on their molecular weight charge ability γ and solubility in water was found to be 8 in fig 2 the groups are presented in a 3d plot the 2d views are given in the supplementary information si classifying omps into groups like these can provide useful insight in the possible membrane based removal mechanisms and it enables selecting prototypical model omps that can be used in the validation of theoretical models jin and peldszus 2012 for instance in models using quantitative structure activity relationship qsar and quantitative structure property relationships qspr the classification of omps based on molecular properties is crucial agenson et al 2003 bellona et al 2011 de ridder et al 2010 libotean et al 2008 yangali quintanilla et al 2010b the ideal classification will not only facilitate the development of models to test the rejection of omps but will also remain unchanged when different organic compounds are added to the growing list of micropollutants as they become known in the future it is therefore important to continuously evaluate and revise the proposed classification we emphasize that the classification proposed here is not the only possible classification it is based on three important molecular properties that we discuss in detail in section 3 it is possible to extend or modify the current classification with additional parameters such as dipole moment or net charge an extensive validation based on data obtained under comparable conditions is required to distinguish between different classifications which is currently not possible because of the limited available experimental data as we will discuss later in section 3 nevertheless this novel classification is an important step towards a new classification approach based on molecular properties on a continuous scale which can be more helpful in understanding the removal of omps and replacing traditional provenance based classifications moreover this classification provides insight into the relevant mechanisms involved in the removal of omps with similar molecular properties further efforts are needed to validate and improve the classification proposed in this work it is interesting to take a closer look at the molecular and physicochemical differences between the groups identified by our classification in table 1 each group from fig 2 is described in qualitative terms this table is a simplified way to understand and illustrate the general differences between groups however the classification used in this review is based on a continuous scale and binary interpretation of the characteristics of each group should be avoided furthermore the descriptive names given in this table are meant to facilitate referencing to each group during the analysis to fully benefit from the classification presented in this study one must look at the values of the three molecular descriptors used to define the 8 omp groups the compounds in the iodide and perfluoroalkyl groups have high m w 500 g mol despite the similar size these two groups are different because of the high solubility in water of the iodide compounds due to the presence of many polar groups and the strong charge combined with a very low polarity of the perfluoroalkyl compounds the molecular structure of the perfluoroalkyl compounds can be divided into a polar part that gives a strong charge to the molecule and a large perfluorinated aliphatic or aromatic part that makes it poorly soluble typical examples include pfoa the removal of iodide compounds is governed mainly by steric exclusion contrary to perfluoroalkyl compounds where other phenomena such as charge repulsion attraction between the membrane and the omps must also be considered the smaller the omp the larger the importance of other molecular properties in the removal of omps compounds in group 3 are labeled as cyclic hydrophobic all the omps in this group have a backbone of aromatic or aliphatic rings and lack a significant amount of highly polar or strongly charged substituents these molecules are thus poorly soluble despite the few polar or weakly charged groups for instance ibuprofen ibf which is used as medication against pain and inflammation contains one aromatic benzene ring it has a single carboxylic acid functional group which gives it an overall negative charge but that is not sufficient to improve the solubility to the mm range the compounds in group 6 are the most diverse in structure usage and properties we labeled them as small hydrophobic despite the difference in chemical structure aromatic rings are also the core of the small hydrophobic compounds these compounds are slightly smaller than the cyclic compounds group 3 and have about the same solubility but the main difference is the fact that these molecules are uncharged or only very weakly charged the presence of some polar and uncharged functional groups results in neutral compounds that are hardly soluble in water for instance in this group we can find cholesterols such as hormones and phenolic compounds in contrast cyclic charged and nitrogen compounds groups 4 and 5 are simpler and smaller and have at least one functional group that can be easily de protonated e g metformin therefore compounds in these groups have a strong ionic character and a minor hydrophobic part which results in high solubility in water the most soluble omps are the nitrogen rich compounds they are not necessarily smaller than the cyclic charged compounds but they typically have much smaller hydrophobic elements e g gabapentine or no hydrophobic elements at all e g aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa based on the description of the omps within these groups the removal by membranes can be insufficient and special attention might be needed to these two groups for instance in the cases of metronidazole and metformin the low molecular weight and positive charge of these compounds leads to a low rejection by nf membranes lipp et al 2010 yangali quintanilla et al 2011 in groups 7 and 8 we classify the small neutral and small hydrophilic compounds respectively the compounds in these two groups are interesting because of their very low molecular weight high solubility and neutral or partially charged character based on these characteristics it is expected that membranes with large pores do not represent a proper barrier for these compounds besides the distribution of these molecules in the bulk is not affected by the surface charge of the membrane thus repulsive energies do not contribute to rejection for instance removal of n nitroso dimethylamine ndma a compound classified as small polar has been reported to be lower than 20 in nf fujioka et al 2014 therefore special attention must be given to omps that are in this group 3 removal of omps with membranes different mechanisms affect the removal of omps in nf and ro the mechanisms responsible for the rejection of specific solutes depend on the properties and characteristics of the membrane the solute and the aqueous media solution see fig 1 boussu et al 2008 libotean et al 2008 mänttäri et al 2006 van der bruggen et al 1999 zhang et al 2004 zhu 2015 however three key mechanisms can be identified size exclusion electrostatic repulsion and solute membrane interactions in fig 3 these rejection mechanisms are illustrated this section covers the principles on omp rejection and provides a clear view on the phenomena that need to be considered in a mechanistic model moreover the key rejection mechanisms are linked to the different groups of omps in section 2 size exclusion is the most important rejection mechanism for many compounds since the membrane is in principle a porous physical barrier to solutes an omp will be sieved based on the ratio between its size and the pore size of the membrane in a membrane a pore is the structure of continuous and connected pathways for transport of water and ions water is the entity that explores that finds these pathways and fills them up ions move through these pathways these connected pathways we refer to as pores we note that membrane pores are sometimes depicted as straight channels but this is not in agreement with the microscopic structure of most nf and ro membranes in theory the molecules that are larger than the membrane pores will just be rejected size exclusion is dependent on the properties of the membrane and the omp yet determining these properties might be a challenge the pore dimensions of nf and ro membranes are different and their size distribution can widely vary depending on the membrane used currently the membrane s pore size can be estimated with transport models bowen and mukhtar 1996 or can be experimentally determined with techniques such as microscopy observation and thermoporometry otero et al 2008 zhao et al 2000 the molecular weight m w is commonly used to relate the size of omps with their rejection therefore the term molecular weight cut off mwco is often found in the specifications of commercial membranes and refers to the lowest m w at which 90 of solutes is retained by the membrane singh 2005 the m w is a well defined and easily accessible property of omps and experimental studies have shown clear correlations between the m w and omp rejection as expected based on the importance of size exclusion in the rejection of solutes van der bruggen et al 1999 nevertheless the use of m w is frequently debated because the rejection of some omps has been lower than expected based on their m w chen et al 2004 yangali quintanilla et al 2010b ozaki and li 2002 indicated that in the case of dissociated omps there is no linear relationship between rejection and m w we believe that the discrepancy found between m w and rejection for some classes of omps originates from the contributions of other interactions between omps and the membrane therefore we propose in this review that the other molecular aspects shown in fig 3 need to be incorporated in physicochemical models of omp removal in this work m w is used to describe the size of omps nevertheless one must consider and evaluate whether for a specific case m w should be replaced with a more realistic descriptor of molecular volume or size instead of using m w several authors have proposed using other molecular properties that describe the molecular geometry and size such as length and width to model omps agenson et al 2003 kiso et al 2001b 2001a this is a promising approach that can indeed lead to improvements on the study of omp rejection however there are practical challenges to be addressed before implementing this method for instance the definition of single size can be ambiguous as a molecule has different dimensions such as width length and height moreover the estimation of these molecular dimensions relies on molecular studies that can be difficult and time demanding nevertheless we have correlated m w with a descriptor of molecular volume the solvent excluded volume for the omps used in the classification the solvent excluded volume is the volume from which a solvent is excluded by the presence of a molecule omp this volume corresponds to the van der waals volume plus the interstitial volume connolly 1983 1985 it was calculated in chemdraw 3d perkin elmer with the built in property calculator the molecular area and volume are based on a connolly calculation with a probe water radius of 1 4 å the correlations between m w and solvent excluded volume are given fig 4 the m w correlates with the volume calculated however for compounds in group 2 perfluorinated a different correlation was found with slope m 0 50 which means that m w would overpredict the size of these compounds the repulsion of solutes due to charge offers an extra barrier especially when size exclusion is insufficient molecular size mwco the effect of electrostatic repulsion is dependent on the solution membrane and omp properties in general the membrane and omp charge will determine the distribution of solutes close to the membrane omps of which the charge is of opposite sign to the membrane charge will have an increased concentration in the membrane charge based attraction while omps with the same sign will have a decreased concentration repulsion however the charge of omps and of the membrane surface often depend on ph and the presence of other charged compounds because of chargeable functional groups as a result the precise contribution of charge repulsion or attraction to the rejection can be non trivial and must be carefully considered based on the physicochemical characteristics of the membrane and the omp the surface charge of nf and ro membranes results from the deprotonation acid base equilibria of functional groups in the membrane therefore the polymeric material of the membrane and the ph and composition of the solution determine the membrane charge hassan et al 2007 mänttäri et al 2006 mohammad et al 2003 to study solute rejection due to electrostatic repulsion a commonly used approach is the experimental determination of the membrane potential or zeta potential afonso et al 2001 elimelech et al 1994 jun et al 2020 the zeta potential is strongly dependent on the ph and ionic strength of the solution afonso et al 2001 and it is an indicator of the membrane charge for instance it has been used to demonstrate that the polyamide top layer of thin film composite tfc membranes commercially mostly used gives a strong negative charge to the membrane hurwitz et al 2010 besides the membrane charge the charge of the omp needs to be defined whether an organic molecule is charged or not is determined by the solution ph and the acid or base dissociation constant of the molecule pka or pkb value luo and wan 2013 that can be inferred from the previously described classification furthermore to model and calculate omp rejection the valence of the ionizable omp is needed at neutral ph some omps will have multiple functional groups that can be charged e g edta and glyphosate in the si fig 2 we present the valence of all the micropollutants used in this study finally specific solute membrane interactions can also significantly impact the removal of omps semião and schäfer 2013 solute membrane affinity results in adsorption at the surface omps can have a particular affinity towards the membrane due to their hydrophobic character or their hydrogen bonding ability in membrane characterization the membrane s hydrophobicity is expressed by water contact angle hurwitz et al 2010 the more hydrophobic a membrane is the larger the water contact angle for instance kiso et al 2001b discussed the effect of hydrophobicity on the rejection of pesticides and concluded that highly hydrophobic pesticides are prone to adsorb onto the membrane which directly impacts the rejection efficiency moreover schäfer et al 2011 recently reviewed the adsorption of estrogenic compounds which are hydrophobic compounds and one of the most endocrine disrupting omps onto polymeric membranes they reported that adsorption of estrogens was dependent on the type of membrane polymer the micropollutant characteristics solution chemistry operational conditions of the filtration process and membrane morphology moreover they concluded that the estimation of chemical interactions between polymers and micropollutants and the integration of adsorption phenomena into models are fundamental knowledge gaps besides the physicochemical properties of omps and the membrane the water matrix chemistry also plays a role in solute membrane interactions for instance the presence and influence of macromolecules such as natural organic matter nom and other foulants in the rejection of omps has been investigated yoon and lueptow 2005 reported that competitive adsorption of nom could outweight the effect of omp adsorption schäfer et al 2010 described that the presence of nom or other organic substances can lead to hydrophilization of the membrane surface which reduces the effect of hydrophobic solute membrane interaction moreover the presence of nom has been reported to enhance the effect of size exclusion and electrostatic repulsion zhang et al 2004 zhu 2015 reported that for membranes with a larger pore size the presence of foulants can increase the size exclusion effect of omps due to pore blocking the foulant particles deposit on the membrane and can reduce the size of the pores the presence of macromolecules in solution not only affects solute membrane interactions but can also induce solute solute interactions azaïs et al 2016 kimura et al 2009 the association of omps with different macromolecules can result in enhanced rejection for instance xu et al 2019 found that positively charged pharmaceuticals could be adsorbed onto humic acid ha molecules overall the omp ha complex has a large number of hydrophilic groups from the ha which leads to enhanced rejection of the omps associated with the ha molecules the membrane and the omp properties sometimes dependent on the solution chemistry can provide insight into which mechanism is predominant in the rejection of omps for instance the membrane properties can be compared with the characteristics of the groups reported in section 2 to analyze omp removal for this purpose we summarized experimental data on the rejection of omps using four nf membranes in fig 5 although experimental studies have covered the use of ro membranes ebrahimzadeh et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 we will limit this section to nf mainly because there is more experimental data with nf on the 58 omps used in this study in table 2 we summarized the properties of four different thin film composite nf membranes pore size and mwco are used to describe size exclusion zeta potential for electrostatic repulsion or attraction and water contact angle as an indicator of the hydrophobicity of the membrane these membranes were selected because they have been the most used in experimental studies and thus more data is available for the comparison fig 5 presents the passage values of several omps for different nf membranes passage p i is the fraction of micropollutants that is not rejected by the membrane and ends up in the clean water stream the passage relates to rejection r i as p i 1 r i and rejection is defined by eq 12 each bar corresponds to the average passage of the groups defined in the classification besides the color used in fig 5 matches the color of the groups in fig 2 the selection of the omps that are used for this figure is based on the available data in literature detailed information on the operational conditions and the micropollutant that each data point represents is given in the si three different markers are used to represent different studies from literature yangali quintanilla et al 2011 lipp et al 2010 fujioka et al 2014 direct comparison between the experimental data reported in these three studies is not possible because of differences in operating conditions in literature the lack of protocols with standardized conditions to test omp removal represents a significant challenge to compare results and analyze the chemical properties and membrane characteristics that influence omp rejection therefore defining such standard conditions would be highly relevant with a validated theoretical framework experimental data collected under standardized conditions can be extrapolated to determine the rejection of omps under other environmentally relevant conditions below we aim to compare and analyze the removal of omps based on the membrane properties and the omp characteristics for this purpose we only compare experimental data from the same reference overall the membranes with the smallest pore size 0 4 nm desal hl and nf90 showed higher rejection than the other membranes regardless of the charge and hydrophobicity of the membrane and the compounds which indicates that size exclusion is a dominant parameter in the rejection of omps despite the importance of size exclusion electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic interactions still affect omp removal and become more important in certain cases for instance the membrane desal hl is less hydrophobic lower water contact angle than the membrane nf90 the difference in hydrophobicity of these two membranes could be the reason for the lower passage of cyclic charged omps group 4 with desal hl compounds in this group are small m w 100 300 g mol and moderately charged thus the effects of size exclusion and electrostatic repulsion are less pronounced in this scenario hydrophobic interactions may become more relevant in the removal of omps the higher hydrophobicity of the membrane nf90 could increase the concentration of partially soluble compounds in the membrane such as the cyclic charged and enhance the transport through the membrane the membranes nf200 and nf270 are similar in pore size but have a substantially different membrane charge and hydrophobicity the higher membrane charge and lower hydrophobicity of the membrane nf200 can be the reason for the lower passage of the perfluorinated compounds group 2 the improved rejection of the membrane nf200 compared to membrane nf270 is due to the fewer hydrophobic interactions between the highly hydrophobic compounds classified in group 2 as expected from the classification the small polar compounds in group 8 were problematic to remove size exclusion and electrostatic repulsion offered by all membranes were insufficient to remove the compounds classified in this group interestingly there is a large difference in passage of omps in group 5 with the membrane nf90 omps in this group are molecules with medium size and strongly charged and therefore electrostatic repulsion becomes more important the two compounds depicted are metformin and edta the charge of these omps and the negatively charged membrane explains the higher passage of metformin compared to edta therefore determining whether an omp is charged or not is not enough to calculate omp rejection instead the valence of the ionizable omp is needed considering to classify positively and negatively charged omps in different groups could improve the classification of omps however in this work with the few positively charged omps that are considered and the limited experimental data this step is not implemented the experimental data reported in previous studies cannot be used to accurately predict rejection of individual omps based on the membrane properties and the characteristics of the groups defined in our classification therefore in future experiments the analysis of the membrane and omp properties should drive the selection of target compounds additionally standardized conditions are needed to determine the key factors that affect the removal of omps with different membranes only in this way the validation of a theoretical framework based on omp properties as discussed in the next section will be possible despite the lack of experimental data to show the classification potential and fully validate the defined groups based on omp removal data this approach has an advantage over the traditional provenance based classification as it can provide a better idea of the relevant phenomena that must be included in a transport model to study a specific omp nevertheless we emphasize here that any type of classification has limitations for instance a narrow classification with only a few omps may capture the passage better but does not allow one to draw general conclusions or to extend the conclusions to other molecules instead in our classification broad groups with multiple omps were identified therefore the passage of some specific components may deviate from the average of its group 4 interfacial theory to understand and even predict which micropollutants can be effectively removed by membrane filtration and to propose strategies to improve the rejection of certain micropollutants an appropriate theoretical description of the membrane based removal process is required it is necessary to account for both the physicochemical diversity in micropollutants section 2 and the principal rejection mechanisms section 3 rejection is an interfacial phenomenon that takes place at the boundary between solution and the membrane figura and teixeira 2007 in this section we discuss the theoretical approaches used to study omps at the membrane solution interface interestingly omps can be roughly classified between ions and small colloids fig 6 which allows us to apply approaches that are used to describe the behavior of ions and colloids at the interface we take the main rejection mechanisms discussed in section 3 to explain how each of these mechanisms can be considered and we discuss possible corrections to account for micropollutant size shape charge ph changes hydrophobicity and adsorption moreover we present model calculations to illustrate the effect of different phenomena on the concentration of omps inside the membrane to describe the concentration of species in the membrane at the boundary the chemical potential across the membrane solution interface is used in equilibrium the chemical potential μ of a solute i at both sides of the membrane interface the solution side and the inside of the membrane are related according to μ ref i μ i exc μ i aff μ i mol ln c i z i ϕ μ ref i μ m i exc μ m i aff μ m i mol ln c m i z i ϕ m 1 where μ ref i is a reference value of the chemical potential μ i exc accounts for the volumetric exclusion of the solute steric exclusion μ i aff represents the affinity of the solute towards the membrane μ i mol accounts for molecule molecule interactions at the interface z i is the charge of the molecule and ϕ is the electric potential to account for the electrostatic repulsion or attraction of charged solutes in eq 1 the chemical potential μ and the electric potential ϕ are dimensionless however eq 1 can be multiplied by rt to arrive at unit j mol 1 to calculate the concentration in the pores of the membrane at the membrane solution interface we can rewrite eq 1 as 2 c i m c i exp z i δ ϕ δ μ i exc δ μ i aff δ μ i mol where c i m is the concentration inside the membrane and c i is the concentration of the solution concentrations inside the membrane are defined per unit total membrane volume additionally in the membrane electro neutrality must be considered 3 z i c i m x 0 where x is the membrane charge density the potential terms δ μ i exc δ μ i aff and δ μ i mol will be simply expressed as μ i exc μ i aff and μ i mol the volumetric excess effect μ i exc can be defined as a steric partitioning coefficient φ i exc exp μ i exc which is dependent on the size of the molecules and the membrane pores an equation of state eos can be implemented to include a realistic approximation of the porous medium i e which is formed by connected and immobile beads and to estimate μ i exc for omps for instance the boublik mansoori carnahan starling leland bmcsl eos can be used to calculate μ i exc of single spheres or multiple spheres that are connected to each other spruijt and biesheuvel 2014 with this approach we can model a porous medium as a network of connected beads biesheuvel et al 2020 to model the volumetric excess function of an omp modeled as a sphere entering the porous medium we assume tracer conditions i e the volume fraction occupied by a solute i spherical omp is minimal with respect to the beads that form the porous medium under this condition the excess term for a spherical omp is given by 4 μ i exc 3 η 1 η α i 3 α i 2 ln 1 η η 2 η 1 η 2 2 α i 3 ln 1 η η 2 η 2 4 η 1 1 η 3 where η is the packing degree of the porous medium which relates to the membrane porosity p as η 1 p and α i σ i σ p represents the size ratio between the spherical omps and the beads of which we consider the porous medium to be formed however to model the porous medium as a large array of beads it is better to define the size ratio between the omps and the characteristic pore dimension of the porous medium α i σ i h p where h p is equal to pore volume over the area or the inverse of the specific surface area a l the characteristic pore dimension of the membrane is a much more accessible property of the membrane this modified size ratio α i relates to the size ratio in eq 4 as 5 α i 6 η 1 η α now we extend the bmcsl theory to consider the shape of the omps the molecular shape of omps can widely vary especially for those compounds with high m w the molecular structure of omps can be represented as a number of subunits or touching beads and this number may correspond to some of the molecule s functional groups e g carboxyl sulfonate halogenate benzene etc therefore in this approach such an omp can be envisioned as a complex of connected spheres which we will call n mers e g dimers trimer or tetramers for this situation μ i exc of a monomer is calculated with eq 4 note that α i represents the size of the monomer over the dimension of the beads of which the porous medium is formed the chemistry and composition of each monomer are not considered for this approach the number of monomers n or beads in an omp needs to be defined approximating molecules as building blocks or beads linked together is not new bonomi and camilloni 2019 this is called mapping and it has been used in the development of molecular dynamics simulations for instance in martini coarse grain cg simulations which are normally used to study the free energy of biomolecular systems the first step is to map the molecule to building blocks called beads in martini cg simulations a single bead represents four nonhydrogen atoms also some specific chemical groups such as carboxylates esters and aromatic and aliphatic rings are represented as a single bead marrink 2007 wassenaar 2015 although we do not cover molecular dynamics in this review paper the methodology used to define the beads in cg simulations can potentially be applied to study and predict the rejection of large and complex omps in fig 7 we evaluate the effect of the number of monomers n and the packing degree of the porous media η on the total value of μ i exc in fig 7a μ i exc is given for molecules with identical volumes but different shape one molecule is modeled as a sphere n 1 while the others are modeled as a dimer a trimer and a tetramer n 2 n 3 and n 4 the size of the molecule modeled as a sphere relates to the size of one monomer according to 6 d i n 1 d o n 1 3 where d i n 1 is the size of a monomer in the n mer d o is the size of the omp modeled as a single sphere and n represents the number of monomers in fig 7a the results show that for omps with α i 0 5 the value of the volumetric excess term increases with the number of monomers i e a molecule that is modeled as a complex of connected monomers will be more excluded by the membrane than an omp modeled as a single sphere μ i n 4 exc μ i n 3 exc μ i n 2 exc μ i n 1 exc the size of each monomer of a complex omp is smaller than the size of the omp modelled as a single sphere however the total size of the complex omp is larger by a factor n 1 3 therefore complex omps n 1 are more excluded by the membrane for omps with α i 0 5 μ i exc is similar in all the cases regardless of the number of monomers in fig 7b we evaluate the effect of η on μ i exc for dimers overall the volumetric excess has small dependency on the packing degree of the membrane and for molecules with α i 1 the volumetric excess is independent of η i e μ i exc is the same for all the different values of η this novel method still needs to be validated for instance the model parameters that are needed in this method i e η h p and σ i should be related to membrane characteristics and molecular properties of omps however it can be a promising alternative to calculate the partitioning of omps especially for large molecules the approach presented in this work can improve estimates of the steric partitioning coefficient because it offers a more realistic description of the porous medium i e the porous medium is a dense packing of connected beads furthermore the calculation of the partitioning of omps with more complex structures can be improved in nf and ro an appropriate model to describe the membrane solution interface is the donnan model epsztein et al 2018 seidel et al 2001 with this model the potential difference across the interface ϕ m ϕ is defined as the donnan potential δ ϕ d in an ideal case where only electrostatic interactions are included and the contribution of affinity and size are neglected this potential is only dependent on the concentration of all ionic species in solution and the membrane charge density x for a solution with only monovalent solutes z i 1 the donnan potential is given by 7 δ ϕ d sinh 1 β where β x 2 c although the ph of the solution is not implicitly included in eq 7 ph plays an important role in determining the donnan potential and hence the electrostatic repulsion attraction the ph of the solution hydronium concentration h3o 10 ph is part of the equilibrium reactions that result in the dissociation of protons by the functional groups in the membrane e g rcooh h 3 o rco o for instance in polyamide thin film composite membranes at low ph the protonation of amide groups gives a positive surface charge to the membrane while at high ph the membrane is negatively charged due to the dissociation of carboxylic groups see fig 8 a besides the equilibrium reaction of functional groups in the membrane the ph affects the protonation or deprotonation of omps determining the charge of omps is crucial to accurately predict omp rejection therefore one should consider the acid base equilibria to calculate the valence of charged omps groups 2 3 4 and 5 additionally some omps such as edta have multiple ionizable groups and multiple pka s resulting in multivalent omps for an omp such as edta we must estimate the deprotonation degree of each functional group to determine its valence and rejection for an acidic ionizable group the concentration ratio of deprotonated over protonated molecules a ah is given by 8 a ah 10 ph p k a small changes in ph can result in considerable changes of the dissociation degree of the molecules especially for the omps with a pka value close to the bulk ph therefore omps that would be neutrally charged in the bulk are partially charged at the interface and in the membrane or vice versa changes in ph can result from the presence of amphoteric ions in solution and the potential difference across the interface the ph difference across the membrane solution interface is corrected by the donnan potential 9 p h m p h δ ϕ d ln 10 in fig 8b the ph drop across the membrane solution interface is presented together with the ratio of deprotonated over protonated molecules eq 8 on the x axis we have the distance from the membrane surface where d 0 represents the position at the membrane surface these results were calculated for a solution with 50 mm nacl 3 10 9 mm micropollutant and membrane charge density x 100 mm the ph profile near the membrane is calculated with eq 9 evaluating the electrical potential across the interface ϕ x which was calculated with the classical poisson boltzmann simplified for monovalent salts eq 3 7 in biesheuvel et al 2020 the pka of the omps determines the effect of the ph on the protonation degree for omps with a pka close to the bulk ph a small change in ph δph 0 2 can strongly affect the amount of charged molecules and therefore the effect of electrostatic repulsion a predictive model that does not include the effect of ph on the charge of molecules would simply over or under predict the rejection of solutes for instance the change in local ph across the membrane has already proven to have an important effect on the selectivity transport and rejection of amphoteric ions biesheuvel et al 2020 the affinity μ i aff can be described as the preference of any omp to be in the polymeric phase membrane rather than in the aqueous phase a positive affinity would mean that the concentration of the omp is higher in the membrane than in the bulk solution therefore the affinity between specific solutes and the material of the membrane must be considered since it can affect the transport and rejection of solutes the affinity term in eq 2 can be defined as model parameter and can be calculated by fitting transport models with experimental data to illustrate the effect of affinity independent variable on the concentration of omps in the membrane eq 2 is evaluated for a hypothetical case where only the donnan potential and the affinity δ ϕ d and μ aff are considered in fig 9 the increased concentration in the membrane at the interface for positive negative and neutral omps is given as function of μ i aff for the calculation a membrane charge of x 100 mm was assumed in fig 9 the ratio between the concentration in the membrane c m and the bulk c is given as function of μ i aff compared with the bulk neutrally and positively charged omps are always present in equal or higher concentrations in the membrane which is not the case for negatively charged omps at the surface of a negatively charged membrane the concentration of negatively charged omps is lower in comparison with the bulk despite electrostatic repulsion as illustrated in fig 9b the concentration of negatively charged omps with a certain μ i aff value can increase at the surface the affinity of co charged omps can overcome the effect of electrostatic repulsion resulting in enhanced transport through the membrane the gibbs energy of interaction δ g i between the membrane and a specific solute can be used to account for the affinity of the solute towards the membrane with δ g i it is possible to calculate the partitioning coefficient due to the affinity of omps for the membrane for instance in a study by semião and schäfer 2013 the partitioning coefficient of estrogenic micropollutants is calculated by the ratio between the solute and the pore radius steric and a parameter b δ g i k t to account for interfacial interaction with the membrane although the authors included b as a parameter to fit the theory to experimental data it can be experimentally determined to calculate δ g i we need to characterize the membrane and estimate the hydrophobic interactions by using contact angle experiments brant and childress 2002 greiveldinger and shanahan 1999 in several studies this experimental approach has already been used to estimate the influence of interfacial phenomena on the partitioning of solutes into the membrane ma et al 2018a verliefde et al 2009a molecule molecule interactions are the interactions between the micropollutants and other dissolved components e g natural organic matter nom other micropollutants ions etc such interactions can certainly affect the removal of omps for instance neale and schäfer 2012 used organic matter water partition coefficients k om to study and quantify the removal of micropollutants due to omp nom interaction and they found that the removal of hormones was substantially improved by this type of interaction alternatively to account for molecule molecule interaction between omps the concept of free energy of mixing δ g m can be used which is given by the entropy and enthalpy of mixing young and balsara 2014 at the trace concentration omps are present the enthalpy of mixing can be neglected and therefore interaction between omps is not likely however for the omps with extremely low solubility the molecule molecule interactions will become more favorable and the enthalpy term can be significant the enthalpy of mixing is given by the concentration of omps and an attraction term k m m such an attraction term can be associated to the solubility of omps in water 5 transport principles in ro and nf to completely describe the removal of omps in membrane based processes to quantify the fluxes of omps and to estimate the concentration of omps in the permeate we must consider the transport of omps through the membrane in nf and ro the transport of the solutes inside the membrane is due to diffusion electromigration and convection solutes diffuse across the membrane in response to the concentration gradients inside the membrane it is important to mention that such a gradient is determined by the partitioning of solutes into the membrane interfacial theory electromigration is the transport of charged molecules due to an electric potential difference across the membrane convection is the transport of molecules associated to the velocity of the media water they are dissolved in drag force in this section we provide a summary of the modeling approaches to study omp transport in porous media and elaborate on the improvement of existing models fig 10 shows a schematic representation of the rejection and transport mechanisms involved in membrane based processes in this representation 3 different mechanisms determine the partitioning of the solute inside the membrane the different mechanisms are i the steric exclusion that results in reduced concentration of big molecules compared to the membrane pores in the membrane ii the donnan exclusion or attraction of charged molecules and iii the solute membrane and molecule molecule interactions that can lead to an increased or decreased concentration inside the membrane the transport models used in nf and ro mostly fall into two categories irreversible thermodynamics it and mechanistic models yaroshchuk et al 2019 former models are simpler since the membrane is seen as a black box and the membrane structure is not considered nikonenko et al 2002 this simplified approach might be helpful to avoid complicated mathematical calculations among the it models we can find the solution diffusion model and the spiegler kedem model biesheuvel et al 2022 wang et al 2021 in the study of omp removal it models have already been considered to evaluate and compare the contribution of diffusion and convection in the total transport of omps inside the membrane kim et al 2007 and to include solute membrane interactions botton et al 2012 ma et al 2018 verliefde et al 2009a 2008 contrary to it models mechanistic models do consider the inner structure and properties of the membrane allowing for a more fundamental understanding of the transport therefore we will elaborate on these models in mechanistic models membranes are commonly and conveniently considered as a thin layer with a specific charge and a finite nanoporous structure inside gross and osterle 1968 jacazio et al 1972 these porous structures can be approximated as cylindrical or slit channels with a specific diameter and these channels exclude solutes based on size dechadilok and deen 2006a or as indicated in the previous section the membrane can be seen as a network of interconnected voids dražević et al 2014 kłosowski et al 2016 yan et al 2015 to consider the membrane structure mechanistic models can include a term to account for membrane porosity and tortuosity this term allows to correct the fluxes and velocities per total cross sectional area of the membrane and for the length of a tortuous non straight pore oren and biesheuvel 2018 another consideration in mechanistic models is that in liquid filled pores of molecular dimensions the transport of solutes is different from solution therefore a friction factor is used to correct the transport inside the membrane the friction factor is attributable to a combination of particle wall and hydrodynamic interactions and steric restrictions dechadilok and deen 2006a in nf and ro membranes the assumption is made that solute transport is hindered due to those steric restrictions therefore solute transport is directly associated with the molecular weight and the size of the molecule as an example of a mechanistic model we will discuss the extended nernst planck equation enp the enp equation is derived from the maxwell stefan equation and considers only the friction of solutes with the membrane and the fluid and it is extended to include hindered transport oren and biesheuvel 2018 the enp equation describes the transport of solutes as the sum of electromigration diffusion and convection moreover the enp equation accounts for the membrane characteristics by including a friction factor between the solute and the membrane the membrane porosity and the tortuosity with the enp equation the flux j of a solute i across the membrane is given by 10 j i v f k f i c i k f i τ d i c i x z i c i ϕ x the three terms on the right hand side account for the transport due to convection diffusion and electric field gradient respectively the water velocity through the membrane is v f k f i is a friction factor this friction factor depends on the solute membrane friction and thus relates to porous medium properties and the size of the solutes the term τ is a reduction factor dependent on membrane porosity and tortuosity d i is the diffusion coefficient in the bulk and z i represents the charge valence of the solute in case the diffusion coefficient of a solute omp is unknown different correlations can be used for instance with the hayduk and laudie relation the diffusion coefficient of a solute in water can be calculated as a function of the water viscosity ϑ w solute molecular weight m w and density ρ kim et al 2007 according to 11 d i ε ϑ w 1 14 m w ρ 0 589 where ε is a constant ε 13 26 10 5 ϑ w is the viscosity of water 1 002 mpa s at 20 c m w is the molecular weight of the solute g mol and ρ is the density of the solute g cm in previous studies the friction factor k f i has been defined as two different hindrances factors for convection and diffusion k c i and k d i which are a function of the ratio between ion size and pore diameter λ i bandini and vezzani 2003 bowen et al 1997 with increasing ion size k d i which is always 1 goes down while k c i increases until it reaches a maximum value at certain λ i the calculation of the hindrance factors assumes that solutes have a sphere like shape however as mentioned in previous sections omps can have diverse shapes and structures hence the shape approximation to a sphere might be debatable kiso et al 2011 approximated omps as rectangular parallelepipeds and calculated the partitioning coefficient as a function of the molecular width and length using molecular sterimol parameters harper et al 2012 which was later used to correct the transport due to convection kiso et al 2011 sterimol parameters are multidimensional and quantify steric demands along different principal axes of the molecule brethomé et al 2019 coupling the enp equation to the general donnan equation to include solute partitioning at the interface between the membrane and the bulk results in the well known donnan steric pore model dspm wang and lin 2021 with this model it is possible to describe the mass transfer of charged and neutral solutes through porous media calculate the concentration profiles inside the membrane and calculate the concentration of solutes in the permeate side rejection the dspm model has been used to predict the rejection of omps by membranes for instance wang et al 2015 used this model to predict omp rejection in an nf process however they concluded that the applicability of the dspm is limited to model the transport of those compounds that are hydrophilic and that have relatively low molecular weight the main reason for this limitation is that the conventional dspm model leaves out extra contributions castaño osorio et al 2022 wang et al 2015 such as solute membrane affinity to calculate the partitioning of solutes into the membrane by including the interaction of solutes with the membrane one can improve the accuracy of transport models to predict omp rejection for instance verliefde et al 2009b compared the prediction of rejection from a model solely based on the steric exclusion and a model including the interaction of solutes with the membrane they concluded that the model considering only steric exclusion overestimated the rejection of omps while including solute membrane interactions improved the accuracy of the model the effect of solute membrane interactions on rejection was more pronounced for pesticides and for operating conditions employed to produce a higher permeate flux 6 µm s 1 bisphenol a ba is an interesting example of how model predictions of rejection can be improved with the considerations described in this review e g including membrane affinity to estimate the partitioning of solutes in experimental studies the rejection of ba has been less than half of the value predicted by a model only based on steric exclusion nghiem et al 2005 therefore we calculate the rejection of this omp as function of water velocity v f rejection is defined by 12 r 1 c p i c f i where c p i is the concentration of a solute in the permeate clean water and c f i the concentration in the feed in this calculation the model used is based on the enp equation and the theory described in section 4 eqs 2 and 10 a similar model was used in our previous work castaño osorio et al 2022 we assume the solution ph is neutral and the membrane properties correspond to the membrane nf270 at this ph the membrane is negatively charged and ba is uncharged pka 9 6 see s i therefore the contribution of electromigration in eq 10 is not considered moreover the contribution of molecule molecule interaction in eq 2 is not included in the calculation in fig 11 the results of ba rejection are presented different affinity values μ i aff were used to show the effect of solute membrane affinity on the rejection of ba the rejection progressively decreases from μ i aff 0 to μ i aff 3 higher affinity results in an increased concentration of ba in the membrane partitioning and lower ba rejection however the affinity of a certain solute does not only impact its concentration in the membrane in addition the diffusion and convection can be hindered or promoted due to interaction with the membrane material in the calculation performed for fig 11 the effect of membrane affinity on convection and diffusion is not yet accounted for in further studies the impact of affinity on the transport of solutes inside the membrane needs to be addressed in fig 11 the gray star indicates the experimental value found for the rejection of ba nghiem et al 2005 including the affinity contribution in the partitioning of ba into the membrane improves the prediction of rejection compared to the experimentally determined rejection of ba accurate models to predict omp removal must consider the three main rejection mechanisms involved during nf and ro processes size exclusion electrostatic repulsion and solute membrane interactions azaïs et al 2016 kimura et al 2009 kiso et al 2001b 2001a schäfer et al 2011 semião et al 2013 van der bruggen et al 1999 xu et al 2019 yoon and lueptow 2005 zhang et al 2004 zhu 2015 moreover solute solute interactions because of electrostatic interactions ph dependent steric effects and solute solute affinity also play a role conventional models successfully account for the electrostatic repulsion of charged solutes however extra effort is required to improve the estimation of size exclusion of large omps with irregular shape and to integrate the solute membrane interaction in the models in section 4 to estimate the partitioning of omps we have elaborated on improved approaches to account for steric exclusion and to include the solute affinity these approaches can be included in the transport theory to allow for more accurate predictions of omp removal for instance in the dspm model the partitioning at the membrane edges will not only include the size but also the effect of solute membrane interactions moreover solute membrane interactions can be included in the correction of transport due to convection kiso et al 2011 in future research the model parameters defined in the theoretical approach in section 4 and 5 can be related to molecular properties of omps to determine any correlation and ease the study of omp removal 6 conclusions to address the problem of omps in drinking water production there is a need for models to predict omp removal in membrane based processes one of the main challenges in omp removal is the vast number of compounds classified as omps and their differences in molecular properties e g size charge structure and functional groups however a first step to ease this problem is by implementing a classification of omps based on key molecular properties and such a classification will allow us to identify different groups of omps nonetheless the classification of omps does not address modeling omp removal in nf and ro although several authors have tried to address this problem the lack of robust models based on physicochemical principles remains another knowledge gap this review examined several possibilities to extend existing models and study the behavior and fate of omps in nf and ro from this review the following considerations for future studies and conclusions can be drawn a classification based on molecular properties can be beneficial for the validation of theories like the ones that we discussed in this review with this sort of classification it is possible to define the main mechanisms involved in the rejection of omps in a specific group which can provide a more fundamental understanding of the process and facilitate the development of new models however the limited experimental data to vindicate this classification is a major issue therefore in future studies it is important to consider the molecular properties of the omps in the selection of model compounds in experimental and theoretical studies only in this way a classification as the one proposed in this study can be validated the classification does not provide a quantitative prediction of the rejection however it provides more relevant information compared to provenance based classifications on the phenomena that affect omp removal with certain membranes and on the omps that represent a challenge for removal one challenge for the validation of the given classification and for comparison of relevant experimental data was the lack of standardized operating conditions it is important for the field to develop experimental protocols that provide well established conditions to test the rejection of omps with different membranes to validate the relevance and applicability of the classification of omps it is needed to evaluate the rejection of the compounds classified in the same group to determine whether their removal is similar steric effects are crucial to determine the removal of omps in this work the use of the bmcsl eos is proposed to account for such effects although this theoretical approach is not new it has not been used in the study of omp removal yet therefore future work must explore the potential of this approach for omp removal the membrane characteristics and the chemistry of the solution influence the rejection mechanisms and the interfacial phenomena in nf and ro therefore predictive models need to be extended to consider the ph interaction between the omps with macromolecules and different ions in solution the properties of omps and different membrane characteristics such as pore size and hydrophobicity the estimation of solute membrane affinity is crucial to model omp removal however conducting experimental tests for all possible solute membrane combinations is time demanding new approaches must be used to determine solute membrane affinity and relate affinity with the membrane and omp properties besides it is important to resolve whether the affinities of omps classified in a specific group are relatively similar transport models to study nf and ro can be extended to include various phenomena that affect the rejection of omps with specific characteristics based on physicochemical properties of the omp the membrane characteristics and the solution composition one can decide whether specific mechanisms are important to be included in a transport model declaration of competing interest none

15419,organic micropollutants omps in drinking water constitute a potential risk to human health therefore effective removal of these pollutants is required nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro are promising membrane based technologies to remove omps in nf and ro the rejection of omps depends on the properties and characteristics of the membrane the solute and the solution in this review we discuss how these properties can be included in models to study and predict the rejection of omps initially an omp classification is proposed to capture the relevant properties of 58 omps following the methodology described in this study more and new omps can be easily included in this classification the classification aims to increase the comprehension and mechanistic understanding of omp removal based on the physicochemical principles used to classify the 58 omps it is expected that other omps in the same groups will be similarly rejected from this classification we present an overview of the rejection mechanisms involved in the removal of specific omp groups for instance we discuss the removal of omps classified as perfluoroalkyl substances e g perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa these substances are highly relevant due to their human toxicity at extremely low concentration as well as their persistence and omnipresence in the environment finally we discuss how the rejection of omps can be predicted by describing both the membrane solution interface and calculating the transport of solutes inside the membrane we illustrate the importance and impact of different rejection mechanisms and interfacial phenomena on omp removal and propose an extended nernst plank equation to calculate the transport of solutes across the membrane due to convection diffusion and electromigration finally we show how the theory discussed in this review leads to improved predictions of omp rejection by the membranes keywords nanofiltration reverse osmosis micropollutant removal

have been raised schwarzenbach et al 2006 because of potential long term effects of omps on human health these compounds are often on national watch lists and defined as contaminants of emerging concern barbosa et al 2016 verliefde et al 2007a an example is the growing attention to perfluoroalkyl substances and the risk that they represent to human health in europe contaminated drinking water with perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos is one important contributor to the exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances schrenk et al 2020 another clear example is the concern

review we will focus on omp removal with membrane based processes in drinking water production previous authors have thoroughly reviewed the theory behind removal of omps with membranes khanzada et al 2020 liu et al 2009 plakas and karabelas 2012 schäfer et al 2011 teodosiu et al 2018 in this review we summarize this theory to support and explain the advantages of a properties based classification and approaches and suggestions are given to improve existing models conventional water treatment processes such as coagulation flocculation sedimentation and sand filtration do not effectively remove all omps and advanced water treatment processes awt are often considered to achieve higher removal in drinking water treatment plants dwtps several reviews discussed available technologies to remove omps in drinking water production benner et al 2013 teodosiu et al 2018 wang et al 2020a yang et al 2014 of these technologies adsorption on activated carbon or on other materials advanced oxidation processes aops and membrane based processes are the most promising in terms of removal efficiencies teodosiu et al 2018 in adsorption processes omps are adsorbed onto the adsorption materials and are thereby removed from water piai et al 2021 aops are based on the production of hydroxyl radicals to break down and remove omps from contaminated water the downside of aops is the production of toxic by products which can be even more toxic than the original omps during the oxidation process ates and argun 2021 von gunten 2018 wang et al 2019 membrane based processes such as nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have become an attractive option to remove omps in dwtps the operational principle of these membrane based processes is similar a pressure gradient is the main driving force and a semi permeable membrane acts as a barrier for contaminants compared to ro nf employs membranes with bigger pores resulting in a lower rejection of solutes but nf has the advantage that it can be operated at lower pressure the removal efficiency of most omps with ro and nf is higher than with other advanced water treatment processes such as adsorption on activated carbon and advanced oxidation lee et al 2012 song et al 2020 sudhakaran et al 2013 and toxic by products are not produced mestankova et al 2016 schwarzenbach et al 2006 veloutsou et al 2014 although nf and ro show high removal of most omps albergamo et al 2020 xu et al 2020 the mechanisms of retention of these compounds remain poorly understood due to a lack of understanding it has been challenging to determine the key factors that govern the rejection and that can be tailored to further improve the removal of omps for instance it is not well understood how different omps behave at the membrane solution interface or how membrane and omp properties affect the transport of solutes inside the membrane therefore there is a need for mechanistic models that are derived from physicochemical principles to accurately predict rejection efficiencies of omps and to improve the removal performance of membrane based processes ideally mechanistic models can quantify the effect of interfacial phenomena and of key molecular properties to predict the rejection of omps and optimize process design in this review we will discuss several considerations in developing a theoretical approach to study and model omp removal with nf and ro this review covers the following topics the classification of omps using molecular properties on a continuous scale the rejection mechanisms involved in membrane based processes an overview of rejection rates with commercial membranes and theory to account for phenomena at the membrane solution interface and the transport of solutes inside the membrane unlike previous studies in this review we critically analyze each of these topics to provide a clear view of important research areas that need to be addressed propose alternatives to overcome challenges in the field and illustrate with model calculations the effect of physical and chemical phenomena on omp removal for instance we show how our novel classification can facilitate the development of models to test the rejection of omps and enable selecting prototypical model omps that can be used for the validation of theoretical models besides we explain and illustrate how the theory considerations and calculations in this review can be combined to improve the prediction of omp removal with existing models a classification of omps based on molecular properties contributes to the identification of critical parameters that affect the removal in a complex mixture containing different micropollutants omps are often complex organic molecules with a molecular weight up to 800 g mol a non spherical shape and a molecular structure that is composed of a combination of hydrophobic hydrophilic ionizable and ionic parts nam et al 2014 the large number of compounds that are classified as omps all with different molecular properties is one of the difficulties to develop a model that can be applied to all omps in this review we stress the importance of a systematic theory driven approach to study the removal of omps in nf and ro therefore to overcome the problem of the huge number of compounds that are considered as omps a classification that is based on molecular properties is proposed the molecular properties of omps together with the membrane characteristics and the chemistry of the solution are directly associated with the removal efficiency in nf and ro see fig 1 boussu et al 2008 zhu 2015 with the classification proposed in this study we can qualitatively indicate which rejection mechanisms e g size exclusion electrostatic repulsion and specific solute membrane interactions and transport mechanisms are predominant in the rejection of omps with similar properties furthermore we discuss theory to describe the membrane solution interface and to model omp transport inside the membrane we present approaches to account for size exclusion charge repulsion attraction and solute affinity towards the membrane which directly relate to the main rejection mechanisms section 3 in this review we give an overview of the transport theories commonly used in nf and ro and summarize previous attempts to study the transport of omps the extended nernst plank enp equation is used to calculate the transport of solutes due to diffusion convection and electromigration we discuss how the enp equation can be coupled to the description of the membrane solution interface to include the effect of size based exclusion charge regulation solute membrane interaction and molecule molecule interaction on the rejection of omps and therefore predict the removal performance of membrane based processes in summary this review focuses on the development of a theoretical approach to study and model omp removal only a model that combines the physicochemical interactions and transport mechanisms involved in the rejection of omps will be able to predict the removal performance of nf and ro for the wide range of omps that are present in commonly used water sources and support technology improvements e g new membrane developments and process optimization and design 2 classification models that capture all relevant molecular properties of omps and their transport through membranes are essential to gain a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in omp removal and to help the design of more effective membranes key steps in the development of these models are the identification of the relevant physicochemical properties and the validation of the models with experimental data for both a systematic analysis of omps is required and a classification of omps into well defined groups can help to achieve this in this section we propose a new apprach to classify micropollutants that has the potential to qualitative compare omp removal data identify problematic omps insufficient removal with specific membranes and facilitate model development and validation thus greatly advancing the study of omp removal micropollutants are traditionally classified based on their industrial provenance or usage lefebvre et al 2010 ren et al 2020 schwarzenbach et al 2006 such as pharmaceuticals pesticides flame retardants hormones industrial chemicals personal care products and more recently perfluoroalkyl substances pfas this classification is useful when evaluating and assessing the sources of contamination but it does not provide much relevant information to study and understand omp removal in membrane based processes to mitigate the limitations of provenance based classification many researchers list a collection of molecular properties in their studies kimura et al 2004 liu et al 2009 taheran et al 2016 however the omp application area is usually kept as the main classification criterion a different approach that can be more adequate is to group the organic compounds based on molecular properties bellona et al 2011 verliefde et al 2007a yangali quintanilla 2010 such as hydrophobicity molecular weight m w solubility polarizability etc this approach holds great potential because the molecular properties of omps give more insight into the possible removal mechanisms that are involved and that affect rejection efficiency during membrane based processes kiso et al 2001b liu et al 2009 verliefde et al 2007b for instance high hydrophobicity of omps might lead to lower retention by ro membranes due to adsorption and partitioning into the membrane boussu et al 2008 nghiem et al 2004 in most cases nf and ro membranes are hydrophobic therefore depending on the membrane characteristics the diffusion of hydrophobic solutes inside the membrane is enhanced octanol water partitioning coefficients log kow are frequently used to quantify the hydrophobicity of a molecule likewise polarity parametrized by the dipole moment could be an indicator of both hydrophobicity and attractive interactions between organic molecules steed and atwood 2009 the latter may be relevant to consider when studying the aggregation or cluster formation of molecules at or near membranes in addition to hydrophobicity and polarity the classification of omps must consider the capacity of these molecules to dissociate and carry a charge whether a molecule is ionic or neutral has been shown to significantly affect the retention of organic micropollutants albergamo et al 2019 yangali quintanilla 2010 the acid dissociation constant pka is often used to define the charge ability of molecules e g weakly charged uncharged schäfer et al 2011 several authors have started to explore the use of molecular properties to classify omps for instance verliefde et al 2007a classified 22 compounds to qualitatively study the prediction of omp rejection they defined groups based on a binary division of each compound into hydrophobic hydrophilic charged uncharged and below above the cutoff size of the membrane pores these three binary choices yielded eight groups which could be used to explain the behavior of the 22 omps reasonably well similarly de ridder et al 2010 used the structure of the molecules aromatic or aliphatic and whether these are able to form hydrogen bonds or not to define binary classes of compounds however many of the molecular properties invoked in these studies are continuous variables hence there is significant variation in the degree of hydrophobicity or net charge between omps that are classified as hydrophobic and charged in the binary choice models for instance using the aqueous solubility as a measure of hydrophobicity micropollutants commonly found to be hydrophobic can differ in solubility by three orders of magnitude likewise the k a of these micropollutants and thus their degree of de protonation can vary by as much as seven orders of magnitude consequently the properties of micropollutants within one binary group and therefore their retention by membranes may differ significantly to account for these differences between the binary classified hydrophobic or charged omps we suggest to take the classification of micropollutants one step further and propose here to identify groups of micropollutants based on their actual coordinates in the continuous 3d phase space defined by solubility in water charge ability γ and molecular weight charge ability is defined as pka for acid omps and 14 pkb for base omps and it indicates whether an omp will be charged at neutral ph regardless of the sign these properties are selected because they are good indicators molecular descriptors to analyze three fundamental phenomena involved in omp removal specifically molecular weight relates with steric exclusion γ with donnan exclusion and solubility with possible omp membrane interactions molecular weight is not a direct measure of molecular dimensions however it can still indicate the molecule size and it is an easily accessible and well defined parameter van der bruggen and vandecasteele 2002 solubility in water is used as an improved measure of hydrophobicity instead of the octanol water partitioning coefficient because some of the omps we have included notably pfas are also barely soluble in organic solvents such as octanol which could distort the interpretation of log kow s this approach uses the quantitative physicochemical properties of micropollutants and contains no implicit bias based on the usage or occurrence of compounds moreover by using a continuous scale all the values of the molecular properties are considered therefore a more precise description of each group is possible in total 58 of the most frequently detected and problematic micropollutants were classified the selection was made based on previous studies and aims to include a broad number of compounds with various molecular properties and different usage e g pharmaceuticals pesticides industrial chemicals de grooth et al 2014 khanzada et al 2020 lai et al 2016 schoonenberg kegel et al 2010 taheran et al 2016 van beelen 2000 verliefde et al 2007a yangali quintanilla et al 2010b 2010a the omps were then automatically allocated to separate groups using a cluster finding algorithm in matlab i e hierarchical clustering and an f test was used to determine the optimal number of groups the optimal number of groups to classify the 58 omps based on their molecular weight charge ability γ and solubility in water was found to be 8 in fig 2 the groups are presented in a 3d plot the 2d views are given in the supplementary information si classifying omps into groups like these can provide useful insight in the possible membrane based removal mechanisms and it enables selecting prototypical model omps that can be used in the validation of theoretical models jin and peldszus 2012 for instance in models using quantitative structure activity relationship qsar and quantitative structure property relationships qspr the classification of omps based on molecular properties is crucial agenson et al 2003 bellona et al 2011 de ridder et al 2010 libotean et al 2008 yangali quintanilla et al 2010b the ideal classification will not only facilitate the development of models to test the rejection of omps but will also remain unchanged when different organic compounds are added to the growing list of micropollutants as they become known in the future it is therefore important to continuously evaluate and revise the proposed classification we emphasize that the classification proposed here is not the only possible classification it is based on three important molecular properties that we discuss in detail in section 3 it is possible to extend or modify the current classification with additional parameters such as dipole moment or net charge an extensive validation based on data obtained under comparable conditions is required to distinguish between different classifications which is currently not possible because of the limited available experimental data as we will discuss later in section 3 nevertheless this novel classification is an important step towards a new classification approach based on molecular properties on a continuous scale which can be more helpful in understanding the removal of omps and replacing traditional provenance based classifications moreover this classification provides insight into the relevant mechanisms involved in the removal of omps with similar molecular properties further efforts are needed to validate and improve the classification proposed in this work it is interesting to take a closer look at the molecular and physicochemical differences between the groups identified by our classification in table 1 each group from fig 2 is described in qualitative terms this table is a simplified way to understand and illustrate the general differences between groups however the classification used in this review is based on a continuous scale and binary interpretation of the characteristics of each group should be avoided furthermore the descriptive names given in this table are meant to facilitate referencing to each group during the analysis to fully benefit from the classification presented in this study one must look at the values of the three molecular descriptors used to define the 8 omp groups the compounds in the iodide and perfluoroalkyl groups have high m w 500 g mol despite the similar size these two groups are different because of the high solubility in water of the iodide compounds due to the presence of many polar groups and the strong charge combined with a very low polarity of the perfluoroalkyl compounds the molecular structure of the perfluoroalkyl compounds can be divided into a polar part that gives a strong charge to the molecule and a large perfluorinated aliphatic or aromatic part that makes it poorly soluble typical examples include pfoa the removal of iodide compounds is governed mainly by steric exclusion contrary to perfluoroalkyl compounds where other phenomena such as charge repulsion attraction between the membrane and the omps must also be considered the smaller the omp the larger the importance of other molecular properties in the removal of omps compounds in group 3 are labeled as cyclic hydrophobic all the omps in this group have a backbone of aromatic or aliphatic rings and lack a significant amount of highly polar or strongly charged substituents these molecules are thus poorly soluble despite the few polar or weakly charged groups for instance ibuprofen ibf which is used as medication against pain and inflammation contains one aromatic benzene ring it has a single carboxylic acid functional group which gives it an overall negative charge but that is not sufficient to improve the solubility to the mm range the compounds in group 6 are the most diverse in structure usage and properties we labeled them as small hydrophobic despite the difference in chemical structure aromatic rings are also the core of the small hydrophobic compounds these compounds are slightly smaller than the cyclic compounds group 3 and have about the same solubility but the main difference is the fact that these molecules are uncharged or only very weakly charged the presence of some polar and uncharged functional groups results in neutral compounds that are hardly soluble in water for instance in this group we can find cholesterols such as hormones and phenolic compounds in contrast cyclic charged and nitrogen compounds groups 4 and 5 are simpler and smaller and have at least one functional group that can be easily de protonated e g metformin therefore compounds in these groups have a strong ionic character and a minor hydrophobic part which results in high solubility in water the most soluble omps are the nitrogen rich compounds they are not necessarily smaller than the cyclic charged compounds but they typically have much smaller hydrophobic elements e g gabapentine or no hydrophobic elements at all e g aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa based on the description of the omps within these groups the removal by membranes can be insufficient and special attention might be needed to these two groups for instance in the cases of metronidazole and metformin the low molecular weight and positive charge of these compounds leads to a low rejection by nf membranes lipp et al 2010 yangali quintanilla et al 2011 in groups 7 and 8 we classify the small neutral and small hydrophilic compounds respectively the compounds in these two groups are interesting because of their very low molecular weight high solubility and neutral or partially charged character based on these characteristics it is expected that membranes with large pores do not represent a proper barrier for these compounds besides the distribution of these molecules in the bulk is not affected by the surface charge of the membrane thus repulsive energies do not contribute to rejection for instance removal of n nitroso dimethylamine ndma a compound classified as small polar has been reported to be lower than 20 in nf fujioka et al 2014 therefore special attention must be given to omps that are in this group 3 removal of omps with membranes different mechanisms affect the removal of omps in nf and ro the mechanisms responsible for the rejection of specific solutes depend on the properties and characteristics of the membrane the solute and the aqueous media solution see fig 1 boussu et al 2008 libotean et al 2008 mänttäri et al 2006 van der bruggen et al 1999 zhang et al 2004 zhu 2015 however three key mechanisms can be identified size exclusion electrostatic repulsion and solute membrane interactions in fig 3 these rejection mechanisms are illustrated this section covers the principles on omp rejection and provides a clear view on the phenomena that need to be considered in a mechanistic model moreover the key rejection mechanisms are linked to the different groups of omps in section 2 size exclusion is the most important rejection mechanism for many compounds since the membrane is in principle a porous physical barrier to solutes an omp will be sieved based on the ratio between its size and the pore size of the membrane in a membrane a pore is the structure of continuous and connected pathways for transport of water and ions water is the entity that explores that finds these pathways and fills them up ions move through these pathways these connected pathways we refer to as pores we note that membrane pores are sometimes depicted as straight channels but this is not in agreement with the microscopic structure of most nf and ro membranes in theory the molecules that are larger than the membrane pores will just be rejected size exclusion is dependent on the properties of the membrane and the omp yet determining these properties might be a challenge the pore dimensions of nf and ro membranes are different and their size distribution can widely vary depending on the membrane used currently the membrane s pore size can be estimated with transport models bowen and mukhtar 1996 or can be experimentally determined with techniques such as microscopy observation and thermoporometry otero et al 2008 zhao et al 2000 the molecular weight m w is commonly used to relate the size of omps with their rejection therefore the term molecular weight cut off mwco is often found in the specifications of commercial membranes and refers to the lowest m w at which 90 of solutes is retained by the membrane singh 2005 the m w is a well defined and easily accessible property of omps and experimental studies have shown clear correlations between the m w and omp rejection as expected based on the importance of size exclusion in the rejection of solutes van der bruggen et al 1999 nevertheless the use of m w is frequently debated because the rejection of some omps has been lower than expected based on their m w chen et al 2004 yangali quintanilla et al 2010b ozaki and li 2002 indicated that in the case of dissociated omps there is no linear relationship between rejection and m w we believe that the discrepancy found between m w and rejection for some classes of omps originates from the contributions of other interactions between omps and the membrane therefore we propose in this review that the other molecular aspects shown in fig 3 need to be incorporated in physicochemical models of omp removal in this work m w is used to describe the size of omps nevertheless one must consider and evaluate whether for a specific case m w should be replaced with a more realistic descriptor of molecular volume or size instead of using m w several authors have proposed using other molecular properties that describe the molecular geometry and size such as length and width to model omps agenson et al 2003 kiso et al 2001b 2001a this is a promising approach that can indeed lead to improvements on the study of omp rejection however there are practical challenges to be addressed before implementing this method for instance the definition of single size can be ambiguous as a molecule has different dimensions such as width length and height moreover the estimation of these molecular dimensions relies on molecular studies that can be difficult and time demanding nevertheless we have correlated m w with a descriptor of molecular volume the solvent excluded volume for the omps used in the classification the solvent excluded volume is the volume from which a solvent is excluded by the presence of a molecule omp this volume corresponds to the van der waals volume plus the interstitial volume connolly 1983 1985 it was calculated in chemdraw 3d perkin elmer with the built in property calculator the molecular area and volume are based on a connolly calculation with a probe water radius of 1 4 å the correlations between m w and solvent excluded volume are given fig 4 the m w correlates with the volume calculated however for compounds in group 2 perfluorinated a different correlation was found with slope m 0 50 which means that m w would overpredict the size of these compounds the repulsion of solutes due to charge offers an extra barrier especially when size exclusion is insufficient molecular size mwco the effect of electrostatic repulsion is dependent on the solution membrane and omp properties in general the membrane and omp charge will determine the distribution of solutes close to the membrane omps of which the charge is of opposite sign to the membrane charge will have an increased concentration in the membrane charge based attraction while omps with the same sign will have a decreased concentration repulsion however the charge of omps and of the membrane surface often depend on ph and the presence of other charged compounds because of chargeable functional groups as a result the precise contribution of charge repulsion or attraction to the rejection can be non trivial and must be carefully considered based on the physicochemical characteristics of the membrane and the omp the surface charge of nf and ro membranes results from the deprotonation acid base equilibria of functional groups in the membrane therefore the polymeric material of the membrane and the ph and composition of the solution determine the membrane charge hassan et al 2007 mänttäri et al 2006 mohammad et al 2003 to study solute rejection due to electrostatic repulsion a commonly used approach is the experimental determination of the membrane potential or zeta potential afonso et al 2001 elimelech et al 1994 jun et al 2020 the zeta potential is strongly dependent on the ph and ionic strength of the solution afonso et al 2001 and it is an indicator of the membrane charge for instance it has been used to demonstrate that the polyamide top layer of thin film composite tfc membranes commercially mostly used gives a strong negative charge to the membrane hurwitz et al 2010 besides the membrane charge the charge of the omp needs to be defined whether an organic molecule is charged or not is determined by the solution ph and the acid or base dissociation constant of the molecule pka or pkb value luo and wan 2013 that can be inferred from the previously described classification furthermore to model and calculate omp rejection the valence of the ionizable omp is needed at neutral ph some omps will have multiple functional groups that can be charged e g edta and glyphosate in the si fig 2 we present the valence of all the micropollutants used in this study finally specific solute membrane interactions can also significantly impact the removal of omps semião and schäfer 2013 solute membrane affinity results in adsorption at the surface omps can have a particular affinity towards the membrane due to their hydrophobic character or their hydrogen bonding ability in membrane characterization the membrane s hydrophobicity is expressed by water contact angle hurwitz et al 2010 the more hydrophobic a membrane is the larger the water contact angle for instance kiso et al 2001b discussed the effect of hydrophobicity on the rejection of pesticides and concluded that highly hydrophobic pesticides are prone to adsorb onto the membrane which directly impacts the rejection efficiency moreover schäfer et al 2011 recently reviewed the adsorption of estrogenic compounds which are hydrophobic compounds and one of the most endocrine disrupting omps onto polymeric membranes they reported that adsorption of estrogens was dependent on the type of membrane polymer the micropollutant characteristics solution chemistry operational conditions of the filtration process and membrane morphology moreover they concluded that the estimation of chemical interactions between polymers and micropollutants and the integration of adsorption phenomena into models are fundamental knowledge gaps besides the physicochemical properties of omps and the membrane the water matrix chemistry also plays a role in solute membrane interactions for instance the presence and influence of macromolecules such as natural organic matter nom and other foulants in the rejection of omps has been investigated yoon and lueptow 2005 reported that competitive adsorption of nom could outweight the effect of omp adsorption schäfer et al 2010 described that the presence of nom or other organic substances can lead to hydrophilization of the membrane surface which reduces the effect of hydrophobic solute membrane interaction moreover the presence of nom has been reported to enhance the effect of size exclusion and electrostatic repulsion zhang et al 2004 zhu 2015 reported that for membranes with a larger pore size the presence of foulants can increase the size exclusion effect of omps due to pore blocking the foulant particles deposit on the membrane and can reduce the size of the pores the presence of macromolecules in solution not only affects solute membrane interactions but can also induce solute solute interactions azaïs et al 2016 kimura et al 2009 the association of omps with different macromolecules can result in enhanced rejection for instance xu et al 2019 found that positively charged pharmaceuticals could be adsorbed onto humic acid ha molecules overall the omp ha complex has a large number of hydrophilic groups from the ha which leads to enhanced rejection of the omps associated with the ha molecules the membrane and the omp properties sometimes dependent on the solution chemistry can provide insight into which mechanism is predominant in the rejection of omps for instance the membrane properties can be compared with the characteristics of the groups reported in section 2 to analyze omp removal for this purpose we summarized experimental data on the rejection of omps using four nf membranes in fig 5 although experimental studies have covered the use of ro membranes ebrahimzadeh et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 we will limit this section to nf mainly because there is more experimental data with nf on the 58 omps used in this study in table 2 we summarized the properties of four different thin film composite nf membranes pore size and mwco are used to describe size exclusion zeta potential for electrostatic repulsion or attraction and water contact angle as an indicator of the hydrophobicity of the membrane these membranes were selected because they have been the most used in experimental studies and thus more data is available for the comparison fig 5 presents the passage values of several omps for different nf membranes passage p i is the fraction of micropollutants that is not rejected by the membrane and ends up in the clean water stream the passage relates to rejection r i as p i 1 r i and rejection is defined by eq 12 each bar corresponds to the average passage of the groups defined in the classification besides the color used in fig 5 matches the color of the groups in fig 2 the selection of the omps that are used for this figure is based on the available data in literature detailed information on the operational conditions and the micropollutant that each data point represents is given in the si three different markers are used to represent different studies from literature yangali quintanilla et al 2011 lipp et al 2010 fujioka et al 2014 direct comparison between the experimental data reported in these three studies is not possible because of differences in operating conditions in literature the lack of protocols with standardized conditions to test omp removal represents a significant challenge to compare results and analyze the chemical properties and membrane characteristics that influence omp rejection therefore defining such standard conditions would be highly relevant with a validated theoretical framework experimental data collected under standardized conditions can be extrapolated to determine the rejection of omps under other environmentally relevant conditions below we aim to compare and analyze the removal of omps based on the membrane properties and the omp characteristics for this purpose we only compare experimental data from the same reference overall the membranes with the smallest pore size 0 4 nm desal hl and nf90 showed higher rejection than the other membranes regardless of the charge and hydrophobicity of the membrane and the compounds which indicates that size exclusion is a dominant parameter in the rejection of omps despite the importance of size exclusion electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic interactions still affect omp removal and become more important in certain cases for instance the membrane desal hl is less hydrophobic lower water contact angle than the membrane nf90 the difference in hydrophobicity of these two membranes could be the reason for the lower passage of cyclic charged omps group 4 with desal hl compounds in this group are small m w 100 300 g mol and moderately charged thus the effects of size exclusion and electrostatic repulsion are less pronounced in this scenario hydrophobic interactions may become more relevant in the removal of omps the higher hydrophobicity of the membrane nf90 could increase the concentration of partially soluble compounds in the membrane such as the cyclic charged and enhance the transport through the membrane the membranes nf200 and nf270 are similar in pore size but have a substantially different membrane charge and hydrophobicity the higher membrane charge and lower hydrophobicity of the membrane nf200 can be the reason for the lower passage of the perfluorinated compounds group 2 the improved rejection of the membrane nf200 compared to membrane nf270 is due to the fewer hydrophobic interactions between the highly hydrophobic compounds classified in group 2 as expected from the classification the small polar compounds in group 8 were problematic to remove size exclusion and electrostatic repulsion offered by all membranes were insufficient to remove the compounds classified in this group interestingly there is a large difference in passage of omps in group 5 with the membrane nf90 omps in this group are molecules with medium size and strongly charged and therefore electrostatic repulsion becomes more important the two compounds depicted are metformin and edta the charge of these omps and the negatively charged membrane explains the higher passage of metformin compared to edta therefore determining whether an omp is charged or not is not enough to calculate omp rejection instead the valence of the ionizable omp is needed considering to classify positively and negatively charged omps in different groups could improve the classification of omps however in this work with the few positively charged omps that are considered and the limited experimental data this step is not implemented the experimental data reported in previous studies cannot be used to accurately predict rejection of individual omps based on the membrane properties and the characteristics of the groups defined in our classification therefore in future experiments the analysis of the membrane and omp properties should drive the selection of target compounds additionally standardized conditions are needed to determine the key factors that affect the removal of omps with different membranes only in this way the validation of a theoretical framework based on omp properties as discussed in the next section will be possible despite the lack of experimental data to show the classification potential and fully validate the defined groups based on omp removal data this approach has an advantage over the traditional provenance based classification as it can provide a better idea of the relevant phenomena that must be included in a transport model to study a specific omp nevertheless we emphasize here that any type of classification has limitations for instance a narrow classification with only a few omps may capture the passage better but does not allow one to draw general conclusions or to extend the conclusions to other molecules instead in our classification broad groups with multiple omps were identified therefore the passage of some specific components may deviate from the average of its group 4 interfacial theory to understand and even predict which micropollutants can be effectively removed by membrane filtration and to propose strategies to improve the rejection of certain micropollutants an appropriate theoretical description of the membrane based removal process is required it is necessary to account for both the physicochemical diversity in micropollutants section 2 and the principal rejection mechanisms section 3 rejection is an interfacial phenomenon that takes place at the boundary between solution and the membrane figura and teixeira 2007 in this section we discuss the theoretical approaches used to study omps at the membrane solution interface interestingly omps can be roughly classified between ions and small colloids fig 6 which allows us to apply approaches that are used to describe the behavior of ions and colloids at the interface we take the main rejection mechanisms discussed in section 3 to explain how each of these mechanisms can be considered and we discuss possible corrections to account for micropollutant size shape charge ph changes hydrophobicity and adsorption moreover we present model calculations to illustrate the effect of different phenomena on the concentration of omps inside the membrane to describe the concentration of species in the membrane at the boundary the chemical potential across the membrane solution interface is used in equilibrium the chemical potential μ of a solute i at both sides of the membrane interface the solution side and the inside of the membrane are related according to μ ref i μ i exc μ i aff μ i mol ln c i z i ϕ μ ref i μ m i exc μ m i aff μ m i mol ln c m i z i ϕ m 1 where μ ref i is a reference value of the chemical potential μ i exc accounts for the volumetric exclusion of the solute steric exclusion μ i aff represents the affinity of the solute towards the membrane μ i mol accounts for molecule molecule interactions at the interface z i is the charge of the molecule and ϕ is the electric potential to account for the electrostatic repulsion or attraction of charged solutes in eq 1 the chemical potential μ and the electric potential ϕ are dimensionless however eq 1 can be multiplied by rt to arrive at unit j mol 1 to calculate the concentration in the pores of the membrane at the membrane solution interface we can rewrite eq 1 as 2 c i m c i exp z i δ ϕ δ μ i exc δ μ i aff δ μ i mol where c i m is the concentration inside the membrane and c i is the concentration of the solution concentrations inside the membrane are defined per unit total membrane volume additionally in the membrane electro neutrality must be considered 3 z i c i m x 0 where x is the membrane charge density the potential terms δ μ i exc δ μ i aff and δ μ i mol will be simply expressed as μ i exc μ i aff and μ i mol the volumetric excess effect μ i exc can be defined as a steric partitioning coefficient φ i exc exp μ i exc which is dependent on the size of the molecules and the membrane pores an equation of state eos can be implemented to include a realistic approximation of the porous medium i e which is formed by connected and immobile beads and to estimate μ i exc for omps for instance the boublik mansoori carnahan starling leland bmcsl eos can be used to calculate μ i exc of single spheres or multiple spheres that are connected to each other spruijt and biesheuvel 2014 with this approach we can model a porous medium as a network of connected beads biesheuvel et al 2020 to model the volumetric excess function of an omp modeled as a sphere entering the porous medium we assume tracer conditions i e the volume fraction occupied by a solute i spherical omp is minimal with respect to the beads that form the porous medium under this condition the excess term for a spherical omp is given by 4 μ i exc 3 η 1 η α i 3 α i 2 ln 1 η η 2 η 1 η 2 2 α i 3 ln 1 η η 2 η 2 4 η 1 1 η 3 where η is the packing degree of the porous medium which relates to the membrane porosity p as η 1 p and α i σ i σ p represents the size ratio between the spherical omps and the beads of which we consider the porous medium to be formed however to model the porous medium as a large array of beads it is better to define the size ratio between the omps and the characteristic pore dimension of the porous medium α i σ i h p where h p is equal to pore volume over the area or the inverse of the specific surface area a l the characteristic pore dimension of the membrane is a much more accessible property of the membrane this modified size ratio α i relates to the size ratio in eq 4 as 5 α i 6 η 1 η α now we extend the bmcsl theory to consider the shape of the omps the molecular shape of omps can widely vary especially for those compounds with high m w the molecular structure of omps can be represented as a number of subunits or touching beads and this number may correspond to some of the molecule s functional groups e g carboxyl sulfonate halogenate benzene etc therefore in this approach such an omp can be envisioned as a complex of connected spheres which we will call n mers e g dimers trimer or tetramers for this situation μ i exc of a monomer is calculated with eq 4 note that α i represents the size of the monomer over the dimension of the beads of which the porous medium is formed the chemistry and composition of each monomer are not considered for this approach the number of monomers n or beads in an omp needs to be defined approximating molecules as building blocks or beads linked together is not new bonomi and camilloni 2019 this is called mapping and it has been used in the development of molecular dynamics simulations for instance in martini coarse grain cg simulations which are normally used to study the free energy of biomolecular systems the first step is to map the molecule to building blocks called beads in martini cg simulations a single bead represents four nonhydrogen atoms also some specific chemical groups such as carboxylates esters and aromatic and aliphatic rings are represented as a single bead marrink 2007 wassenaar 2015 although we do not cover molecular dynamics in this review paper the methodology used to define the beads in cg simulations can potentially be applied to study and predict the rejection of large and complex omps in fig 7 we evaluate the effect of the number of monomers n and the packing degree of the porous media η on the total value of μ i exc in fig 7a μ i exc is given for molecules with identical volumes but different shape one molecule is modeled as a sphere n 1 while the others are modeled as a dimer a trimer and a tetramer n 2 n 3 and n 4 the size of the molecule modeled as a sphere relates to the size of one monomer according to 6 d i n 1 d o n 1 3 where d i n 1 is the size of a monomer in the n mer d o is the size of the omp modeled as a single sphere and n represents the number of monomers in fig 7a the results show that for omps with α i 0 5 the value of the volumetric excess term increases with the number of monomers i e a molecule that is modeled as a complex of connected monomers will be more excluded by the membrane than an omp modeled as a single sphere μ i n 4 exc μ i n 3 exc μ i n 2 exc μ i n 1 exc the size of each monomer of a complex omp is smaller than the size of the omp modelled as a single sphere however the total size of the complex omp is larger by a factor n 1 3 therefore complex omps n 1 are more excluded by the membrane for omps with α i 0 5 μ i exc is similar in all the cases regardless of the number of monomers in fig 7b we evaluate the effect of η on μ i exc for dimers overall the volumetric excess has small dependency on the packing degree of the membrane and for molecules with α i 1 the volumetric excess is independent of η i e μ i exc is the same for all the different values of η this novel method still needs to be validated for instance the model parameters that are needed in this method i e η h p and σ i should be related to membrane characteristics and molecular properties of omps however it can be a promising alternative to calculate the partitioning of omps especially for large molecules the approach presented in this work can improve estimates of the steric partitioning coefficient because it offers a more realistic description of the porous medium i e the porous medium is a dense packing of connected beads furthermore the calculation of the partitioning of omps with more complex structures can be improved in nf and ro an appropriate model to describe the membrane solution interface is the donnan model epsztein et al 2018 seidel et al 2001 with this model the potential difference across the interface ϕ m ϕ is defined as the donnan potential δ ϕ d in an ideal case where only electrostatic interactions are included and the contribution of affinity and size are neglected this potential is only dependent on the concentration of all ionic species in solution and the membrane charge density x for a solution with only monovalent solutes z i 1 the donnan potential is given by 7 δ ϕ d sinh 1 β where β x 2 c although the ph of the solution is not implicitly included in eq 7 ph plays an important role in determining the donnan potential and hence the electrostatic repulsion attraction the ph of the solution hydronium concentration h3o 10 ph is part of the equilibrium reactions that result in the dissociation of protons by the functional groups in the membrane e g rcooh h 3 o rco o for instance in polyamide thin film composite membranes at low ph the protonation of amide groups gives a positive surface charge to the membrane while at high ph the membrane is negatively charged due to the dissociation of carboxylic groups see fig 8 a besides the equilibrium reaction of functional groups in the membrane the ph affects the protonation or deprotonation of omps determining the charge of omps is crucial to accurately predict omp rejection therefore one should consider the acid base equilibria to calculate the valence of charged omps groups 2 3 4 and 5 additionally some omps such as edta have multiple ionizable groups and multiple pka s resulting in multivalent omps for an omp such as edta we must estimate the deprotonation degree of each functional group to determine its valence and rejection for an acidic ionizable group the concentration ratio of deprotonated over protonated molecules a ah is given by 8 a ah 10 ph p k a small changes in ph can result in considerable changes of the dissociation degree of the molecules especially for the omps with a pka value close to the bulk ph therefore omps that would be neutrally charged in the bulk are partially charged at the interface and in the membrane or vice versa changes in ph can result from the presence of amphoteric ions in solution and the potential difference across the interface the ph difference across the membrane solution interface is corrected by the donnan potential 9 p h m p h δ ϕ d ln 10 in fig 8b the ph drop across the membrane solution interface is presented together with the ratio of deprotonated over protonated molecules eq 8 on the x axis we have the distance from the membrane surface where d 0 represents the position at the membrane surface these results were calculated for a solution with 50 mm nacl 3 10 9 mm micropollutant and membrane charge density x 100 mm the ph profile near the membrane is calculated with eq 9 evaluating the electrical potential across the interface ϕ x which was calculated with the classical poisson boltzmann simplified for monovalent salts eq 3 7 in biesheuvel et al 2020 the pka of the omps determines the effect of the ph on the protonation degree for omps with a pka close to the bulk ph a small change in ph δph 0 2 can strongly affect the amount of charged molecules and therefore the effect of electrostatic repulsion a predictive model that does not include the effect of ph on the charge of molecules would simply over or under predict the rejection of solutes for instance the change in local ph across the membrane has already proven to have an important effect on the selectivity transport and rejection of amphoteric ions biesheuvel et al 2020 the affinity μ i aff can be described as the preference of any omp to be in the polymeric phase membrane rather than in the aqueous phase a positive affinity would mean that the concentration of the omp is higher in the membrane than in the bulk solution therefore the affinity between specific solutes and the material of the membrane must be considered since it can affect the transport and rejection of solutes the affinity term in eq 2 can be defined as model parameter and can be calculated by fitting transport models with experimental data to illustrate the effect of affinity independent variable on the concentration of omps in the membrane eq 2 is evaluated for a hypothetical case where only the donnan potential and the affinity δ ϕ d and μ aff are considered in fig 9 the increased concentration in the membrane at the interface for positive negative and neutral omps is given as function of μ i aff for the calculation a membrane charge of x 100 mm was assumed in fig 9 the ratio between the concentration in the membrane c m and the bulk c is given as function of μ i aff compared with the bulk neutrally and positively charged omps are always present in equal or higher concentrations in the membrane which is not the case for negatively charged omps at the surface of a negatively charged membrane the concentration of negatively charged omps is lower in comparison with the bulk despite electrostatic repulsion as illustrated in fig 9b the concentration of negatively charged omps with a certain μ i aff value can increase at the surface the affinity of co charged omps can overcome the effect of electrostatic repulsion resulting in enhanced transport through the membrane the gibbs energy of interaction δ g i between the membrane and a specific solute can be used to account for the affinity of the solute towards the membrane with δ g i it is possible to calculate the partitioning coefficient due to the affinity of omps for the membrane for instance in a study by semião and schäfer 2013 the partitioning coefficient of estrogenic micropollutants is calculated by the ratio between the solute and the pore radius steric and a parameter b δ g i k t to account for interfacial interaction with the membrane although the authors included b as a parameter to fit the theory to experimental data it can be experimentally determined to calculate δ g i we need to characterize the membrane and estimate the hydrophobic interactions by using contact angle experiments brant and childress 2002 greiveldinger and shanahan 1999 in several studies this experimental approach has already been used to estimate the influence of interfacial phenomena on the partitioning of solutes into the membrane ma et al 2018a verliefde et al 2009a molecule molecule interactions are the interactions between the micropollutants and other dissolved components e g natural organic matter nom other micropollutants ions etc such interactions can certainly affect the removal of omps for instance neale and schäfer 2012 used organic matter water partition coefficients k om to study and quantify the removal of micropollutants due to omp nom interaction and they found that the removal of hormones was substantially improved by this type of interaction alternatively to account for molecule molecule interaction between omps the concept of free energy of mixing δ g m can be used which is given by the entropy and enthalpy of mixing young and balsara 2014 at the trace concentration omps are present the enthalpy of mixing can be neglected and therefore interaction between omps is not likely however for the omps with extremely low solubility the molecule molecule interactions will become more favorable and the enthalpy term can be significant the enthalpy of mixing is given by the concentration of omps and an attraction term k m m such an attraction term can be associated to the solubility of omps in water 5 transport principles in ro and nf to completely describe the removal of omps in membrane based processes to quantify the fluxes of omps and to estimate the concentration of omps in the permeate we must consider the transport of omps through the membrane in nf and ro the transport of the solutes inside the membrane is due to diffusion electromigration and convection solutes diffuse across the membrane in response to the concentration gradients inside the membrane it is important to mention that such a gradient is determined by the partitioning of solutes into the membrane interfacial theory electromigration is the transport of charged molecules due to an electric potential difference across the membrane convection is the transport of molecules associated to the velocity of the media water they are dissolved in drag force in this section we provide a summary of the modeling approaches to study omp transport in porous media and elaborate on the improvement of existing models fig 10 shows a schematic representation of the rejection and transport mechanisms involved in membrane based processes in this representation 3 different mechanisms determine the partitioning of the solute inside the membrane the different mechanisms are i the steric exclusion that results in reduced concentration of big molecules compared to the membrane pores in the membrane ii the donnan exclusion or attraction of charged molecules and iii the solute membrane and molecule molecule interactions that can lead to an increased or decreased concentration inside the membrane the transport models used in nf and ro mostly fall into two categories irreversible thermodynamics it and mechanistic models yaroshchuk et al 2019 former models are simpler since the membrane is seen as a black box and the membrane structure is not considered nikonenko et al 2002 this simplified approach might be helpful to avoid complicated mathematical calculations among the it models we can find the solution diffusion model and the spiegler kedem model biesheuvel et al 2022 wang et al 2021 in the study of omp removal it models have already been considered to evaluate and compare the contribution of diffusion and convection in the total transport of omps inside the membrane kim et al 2007 and to include solute membrane interactions botton et al 2012 ma et al 2018 verliefde et al 2009a 2008 contrary to it models mechanistic models do consider the inner structure and properties of the membrane allowing for a more fundamental understanding of the transport therefore we will elaborate on these models in mechanistic models membranes are commonly and conveniently considered as a thin layer with a specific charge and a finite nanoporous structure inside gross and osterle 1968 jacazio et al 1972 these porous structures can be approximated as cylindrical or slit channels with a specific diameter and these channels exclude solutes based on size dechadilok and deen 2006a or as indicated in the previous section the membrane can be seen as a network of interconnected voids dražević et al 2014 kłosowski et al 2016 yan et al 2015 to consider the membrane structure mechanistic models can include a term to account for membrane porosity and tortuosity this term allows to correct the fluxes and velocities per total cross sectional area of the membrane and for the length of a tortuous non straight pore oren and biesheuvel 2018 another consideration in mechanistic models is that in liquid filled pores of molecular dimensions the transport of solutes is different from solution therefore a friction factor is used to correct the transport inside the membrane the friction factor is attributable to a combination of particle wall and hydrodynamic interactions and steric restrictions dechadilok and deen 2006a in nf and ro membranes the assumption is made that solute transport is hindered due to those steric restrictions therefore solute transport is directly associated with the molecular weight and the size of the molecule as an example of a mechanistic model we will discuss the extended nernst planck equation enp the enp equation is derived from the maxwell stefan equation and considers only the friction of solutes with the membrane and the fluid and it is extended to include hindered transport oren and biesheuvel 2018 the enp equation describes the transport of solutes as the sum of electromigration diffusion and convection moreover the enp equation accounts for the membrane characteristics by including a friction factor between the solute and the membrane the membrane porosity and the tortuosity with the enp equation the flux j of a solute i across the membrane is given by 10 j i v f k f i c i k f i τ d i c i x z i c i ϕ x the three terms on the right hand side account for the transport due to convection diffusion and electric field gradient respectively the water velocity through the membrane is v f k f i is a friction factor this friction factor depends on the solute membrane friction and thus relates to porous medium properties and the size of the solutes the term τ is a reduction factor dependent on membrane porosity and tortuosity d i is the diffusion coefficient in the bulk and z i represents the charge valence of the solute in case the diffusion coefficient of a solute omp is unknown different correlations can be used for instance with the hayduk and laudie relation the diffusion coefficient of a solute in water can be calculated as a function of the water viscosity ϑ w solute molecular weight m w and density ρ kim et al 2007 according to 11 d i ε ϑ w 1 14 m w ρ 0 589 where ε is a constant ε 13 26 10 5 ϑ w is the viscosity of water 1 002 mpa s at 20 c m w is the molecular weight of the solute g mol and ρ is the density of the solute g cm in previous studies the friction factor k f i has been defined as two different hindrances factors for convection and diffusion k c i and k d i which are a function of the ratio between ion size and pore diameter λ i bandini and vezzani 2003 bowen et al 1997 with increasing ion size k d i which is always 1 goes down while k c i increases until it reaches a maximum value at certain λ i the calculation of the hindrance factors assumes that solutes have a sphere like shape however as mentioned in previous sections omps can have diverse shapes and structures hence the shape approximation to a sphere might be debatable kiso et al 2011 approximated omps as rectangular parallelepipeds and calculated the partitioning coefficient as a function of the molecular width and length using molecular sterimol parameters harper et al 2012 which was later used to correct the transport due to convection kiso et al 2011 sterimol parameters are multidimensional and quantify steric demands along different principal axes of the molecule brethomé et al 2019 coupling the enp equation to the general donnan equation to include solute partitioning at the interface between the membrane and the bulk results in the well known donnan steric pore model dspm wang and lin 2021 with this model it is possible to describe the mass transfer of charged and neutral solutes through porous media calculate the concentration profiles inside the membrane and calculate the concentration of solutes in the permeate side rejection the dspm model has been used to predict the rejection of omps by membranes for instance wang et al 2015 used this model to predict omp rejection in an nf process however they concluded that the applicability of the dspm is limited to model the transport of those compounds that are hydrophilic and that have relatively low molecular weight the main reason for this limitation is that the conventional dspm model leaves out extra contributions castaño osorio et al 2022 wang et al 2015 such as solute membrane affinity to calculate the partitioning of solutes into the membrane by including the interaction of solutes with the membrane one can improve the accuracy of transport models to predict omp rejection for instance verliefde et al 2009b compared the prediction of rejection from a model solely based on the steric exclusion and a model including the interaction of solutes with the membrane they concluded that the model considering only steric exclusion overestimated the rejection of omps while including solute membrane interactions improved the accuracy of the model the effect of solute membrane interactions on rejection was more pronounced for pesticides and for operating conditions employed to produce a higher permeate flux 6 µm s 1 bisphenol a ba is an interesting example of how model predictions of rejection can be improved with the considerations described in this review e g including membrane affinity to estimate the partitioning of solutes in experimental studies the rejection of ba has been less than half of the value predicted by a model only based on steric exclusion nghiem et al 2005 therefore we calculate the rejection of this omp as function of water velocity v f rejection is defined by 12 r 1 c p i c f i where c p i is the concentration of a solute in the permeate clean water and c f i the concentration in the feed in this calculation the model used is based on the enp equation and the theory described in section 4 eqs 2 and 10 a similar model was used in our previous work castaño osorio et al 2022 we assume the solution ph is neutral and the membrane properties correspond to the membrane nf270 at this ph the membrane is negatively charged and ba is uncharged pka 9 6 see s i therefore the contribution of electromigration in eq 10 is not considered moreover the contribution of molecule molecule interaction in eq 2 is not included in the calculation in fig 11 the results of ba rejection are presented different affinity values μ i aff were used to show the effect of solute membrane affinity on the rejection of ba the rejection progressively decreases from μ i aff 0 to μ i aff 3 higher affinity results in an increased concentration of ba in the membrane partitioning and lower ba rejection however the affinity of a certain solute does not only impact its concentration in the membrane in addition the diffusion and convection can be hindered or promoted due to interaction with the membrane material in the calculation performed for fig 11 the effect of membrane affinity on convection and diffusion is not yet accounted for in further studies the impact of affinity on the transport of solutes inside the membrane needs to be addressed in fig 11 the gray star indicates the experimental value found for the rejection of ba nghiem et al 2005 including the affinity contribution in the partitioning of ba into the membrane improves the prediction of rejection compared to the experimentally determined rejection of ba accurate models to predict omp removal must consider the three main rejection mechanisms involved during nf and ro processes size exclusion electrostatic repulsion and solute membrane interactions azaïs et al 2016 kimura et al 2009 kiso et al 2001b 2001a schäfer et al 2011 semião et al 2013 van der bruggen et al 1999 xu et al 2019 yoon and lueptow 2005 zhang et al 2004 zhu 2015 moreover solute solute interactions because of electrostatic interactions ph dependent steric effects and solute solute affinity also play a role conventional models successfully account for the electrostatic repulsion of charged solutes however extra effort is required to improve the estimation of size exclusion of large omps with irregular shape and to integrate the solute membrane interaction in the models in section 4 to estimate the partitioning of omps we have elaborated on improved approaches to account for steric exclusion and to include the solute affinity these approaches can be included in the transport theory to allow for more accurate predictions of omp removal for instance in the dspm model the partitioning at the membrane edges will not only include the size but also the effect of solute membrane interactions moreover solute membrane interactions can be included in the correction of transport due to convection kiso et al 2011 in future research the model parameters defined in the theoretical approach in section 4 and 5 can be related to molecular properties of omps to determine any correlation and ease the study of omp removal 6 conclusions to address the problem of omps in drinking water production there is a need for models to predict omp removal in membrane based processes one of the main challenges in omp removal is the vast number of compounds classified as omps and their differences in molecular properties e g size charge structure and functional groups however a first step to ease this problem is by implementing a classification of omps based on key molecular properties and such a classification will allow us to identify different groups of omps nonetheless the classification of omps does not address modeling omp removal in nf and ro although several authors have tried to address this problem the lack of robust models based on physicochemical principles remains another knowledge gap this review examined several possibilities to extend existing models and study the behavior and fate of omps in nf and ro from this review the following considerations for future studies and conclusions can be drawn a classification based on molecular properties can be beneficial for the validation of theories like the ones that we discussed in this review with this sort of classification it is possible to define the main mechanisms involved in the rejection of omps in a specific group which can provide a more fundamental understanding of the process and facilitate the development of new models however the limited experimental data to vindicate this classification is a major issue therefore in future studies it is important to consider the molecular properties of the omps in the selection of model compounds in experimental and theoretical studies only in this way a classification as the one proposed in this study can be validated the classification does not provide a quantitative prediction of the rejection however it provides more relevant information compared to provenance based classifications on the phenomena that affect omp removal with certain membranes and on the omps that represent a challenge for removal one challenge for the validation of the given classification and for comparison of relevant experimental data was the lack of standardized operating conditions it is important for the field to develop experimental protocols that provide well established conditions to test the rejection of omps with different membranes to validate the relevance and applicability of the classification of omps it is needed to evaluate the rejection of the compounds classified in the same group to determine whether their removal is similar steric effects are crucial to determine the removal of omps in this work the use of the bmcsl eos is proposed to account for such effects although this theoretical approach is not new it has not been used in the study of omp removal yet therefore future work must explore the potential of this approach for omp removal the membrane characteristics and the chemistry of the solution influence the rejection mechanisms and the interfacial phenomena in nf and ro therefore predictive models need to be extended to consider the ph interaction between the omps with macromolecules and different ions in solution the properties of omps and different membrane characteristics such as pore size and hydrophobicity the estimation of solute membrane affinity is crucial to model omp removal however conducting experimental tests for all possible solute membrane combinations is time demanding new approaches must be used to determine solute membrane affinity and relate affinity with the membrane and omp properties besides it is important to resolve whether the affinities of omps classified in a specific group are relatively similar transport models to study nf and ro can be extended to include various phenomena that affect the rejection of omps with specific characteristics based on physicochemical properties of the omp the membrane characteristics and the solution composition one can decide whether specific mechanisms are important to be included in a transport model declaration of competing interest none
