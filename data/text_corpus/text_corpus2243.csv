11215,better use of rainfall is an essential strategy to save irrigation water for paddy rice since unnecessary irrigation is usually applied to field without considering the possible rainfall after irrigation weather forecast e g rainfall can be used to potentially save irrigation water in this study the rainfall event mainly focused on the total rainfall in consecutive 3 days within rice growth period rather than the daily rainfall based on that three rain levels were redefined for irrigation decision making by incorporating the possible rain level of the first 3 days in weather forecast horizon a new method based on simple decision rule was proposed and evaluated for irrigation scheduling of paddy rice over a wide range of climate conditions in china the results indicated that the occurrence probability of each rain level in next 3 days can be clearly recognized and their forecasting performance was much better than that of daily rain events comparing to the conventional irrigation the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method can further save irrigation water about 0 100 mm and reduce drainage about 0 60 mm without significant yield loss 1 the results also showed that the efficiency of water saving and drainage reduction had a certain correlation with the total rainfall and the daily rainfall distribution during rice growth period moreover about 1 3 extra irrigations were needed in this new irrigation scheduling method due to great temp spatial variation of rainfall distributions and imperfect weather forecasts nevertheless the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method incorporated with weather forecast is suggested to apply in irrigation practice for its simplicity and effectiveness keywords irrigation water weather forecast new irrigation scheduling method water saving drainage reduction 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is one of the most important staple crops with about 163 million hectares of harvested area worldwide faostat 2014 and its production supports more than 3 billion people on the earth nguyen and ferrero 2006 about 75 of the total production comes from irrigated rice bouman and tuong 2001 which requires large amount of freshwater tuong et al 2005 bouman et al 2007 however water scarcity has become a threat issue for irrigated rice because of increasing population growing water consumption for non agriculture sectors and decreasing availability derived from resource depletion pimentel et al 2004 xiong et al 2010 there is an urgent need to saving irrigation water and maintain rice production belder et al 2004 yao et al 2012 monaco and sali 2018 irrigation scheduling determines the timing and amount of irrigation applied to the field cai et al 2011 conventionally irrigation event takes place when soil moisture or field water depth for paddy rice is below a certain threshold and irrigation quota is calculated by subtracting the soil moisture water depth from an upper threshold xie and cui 2011 stirzaker et al 2017 since limited irrigation water in crop growing season may decrease crop yield tuong et al 2005 the irrigation scheduling should be optimized under specific limited conditions various studies have focused on this issue in order to obtain minimum loss of crop yield or maximum farmer s profits bergez et al 2002 nijbroek and jones 2003 shang and mao 2006 zhang and oweis 2007 most of these studies have provided solutions for long term decision making of water allocation to different crop growth stages by using historical weather data however the results could be hardly used in irrigation practice because of great variability of weather conditions therefore some studies tried to incorporate weather forecast data e g rainfall into irrigation scheduling and proved that it can potentially reduce irrigation water by improving rainfall utilize efficiency gowing and ejieji 2001 wang and cai 2009 cai et al 2011 linker and sylaios 2016 on the other hand bergez and garcia 2010 reported that weather forecast information does not provide substantial increase in the margin benefits and pointed out that the available flow rate for irrigation played a more important role in irrigation management in china there is much rainfall in the growing season of paddy rice and making better use of rainfall is an essential strategy to save irrigation water alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation has been reported as an effective water saving technique for paddy rice without significantly decreasing yield yao et al 2012 price et al 2013 shao et al 2014 lampayan et al 2015 carrijo et al 2017 in most cases people including farmers does not take consideration of weather forecast information in the irrigation scheduling of awd and rainfall often happens in the next two or three days after irrigation it may lead to irrigation water waste due to surface drainage and an environment issue would be accelerated because the surface drainage is the main source of nitrogen loss from paddy field yoshinaga et al 2007 thus a further reduction of the irrigation water and surface drainage in awd is of great importance by using forecast information in this paper the rainfall distribution and performance of public weather forecast in rice growth period in china were firstly analyzed and then a new method based on simple decision rule was proposed for irrigation scheduling of paddy rice using weather forecast information a simple water balance model integrated with a crop water production function is used to simulate daily field water depth and the effect of water stress on final yield rather than a crop model which needs to be calibrated before application tan et al 2016 2017 in the study a daily rule regarding to whether or not irrigation is applied on a given day and the amount of irrigation water is the main focus while optimization is beyond our scope the objectives of the study are i to evaluate the quality of short term public weather forecast over a wide range of climate conditions and soil types in different rice planting area of china ii to validate the effectiveness of this newly proposed method in irrigation scheduling for awd in terms of water saving and drainage reduction the results of this paper are expected to supply a new guidance for irrigation scheduling and real time irrigation decision making 2 materials and methods 2 1 data paddy rice is widely distributed in china according to the ecological environments social and economic backgrounds and rice cropping characteristics in different areas of china the chinese rice planting area is divided into six rice cropping regions mei et al 1988 thus six typical stations responding to each of the rice cropping regions were selected fig 1 and table 1 it is worth to note that double season rice early rice and late rice is planted at nanchang and nanning and single season rice middle rice is planted at the other stations all the stations were assumed to apply the awd irrigation and share the same criterion of field water depth in each growth stage of paddy rice water depth starts at 30 mm and upper thresholds for maximum water depth after irrigation and rain are respectively set as 20 mm and 50 mm over the rice growth period irrigation water is applied after three non flooded days in the yellow ripe stage the field naturally dries without irrigation supplementation daily observed meteorological data of 2012 2013 and 2015 at each station was obtained from the china meteorological data service center http data cma gov cn including daily values of maximum and minimum temperature average temperature relative humidity average wind speed and sunshine hours daily public weather forecast data with 7 day lead time corresponding to the same periods and stations was collected from weather china http www weather com cn and only weather type e g sunny cloudy overcast light rain et al is included here as it contains rainfall information noting that the observed and forecast weather data of 2014 at some stations is incomplete thus the data is not included in this paper phenological data of 2012 2013 and 2015 at each station was collected from field experiments including stages of returning green rg early tillering et late tillering lt jointing booting jb heading flowering hf milk ripe mi and yellow ripe yr crop coefficient at each crop growth stage of the three rice types is collected from field experiments at jiangxi experimental irrigation station located at nanchang li et al 2018 as shown in table 2 due to lack of experiment data the crop coefficients data is used for all the stations without considering its spatial and temporal difference it is important to note that for the late rice the crop coefficients at hf and mi stages are much higher than that of the early rice and middle rice this is because higher leaf area lai and moister soil conditions were observed during the hf and mi stages of late rice which results in relatively higher daily average crop transpiration and soil evaporation between plants than that of the early rice and middle rice in addition high temperature higher than 30 c was frequently observed during these two stages of early rice and middle rice in our experiment which can result in stomatal closure and it may lead to decrease of crop transpiration thus relatively smaller crop coefficients were likely obtained the high values of crop coefficients and its great variations between cultivars have been reported in previous studies choudhury and singh 2016 lv et al 2018 wu et al 2016 2 2 water balance method the irrigation scheduling is calculated by using water balance method and the water balance equation in paddy rice field is given as follows 1 w l i w l i 1 p i i i e t c i d p i r i where w l i w l i 1 are field water depth or the soil water storage of crop root zone in paddy field at the end of day i and i 1 mm day p i is the precipitation on day i mm day i i is the irrigation amount on day i mm day e t c i is the actual evapotranspiration on day i mm day d p i is the deep percolation on day i mm day and r i is the surface drainage on day i mm day in this study the daily deep percolation d p i was set as a constant value the values for sandy loam loam and clay were set as 3 0 2 5 and 2 0 mm day respectively before the field water level was depleted otherwise the value was set as zero the irrigation amount was calculated according to the predefined upper thresholds for maximum water depth after irrigation and different decision rules introduced in the later section of 2 4 2 the surface drainage r i was calculated as the redundant part exceeding the upper thresholds for maximum water depth after a rainfall the actual evapotranspiration is estimated by 2 e t c k c k s e t 0 where k c is single crop coefficient k s is water stress coefficient k s 1 when there is no soil water stress and e t 0 is reference evapotranspiration mm day fao penman monteith method is adopted to compute the reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 3 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is

kpa e a is actual vapor pressure kpa δ is slope vapor pressure curve kpa c and γ is psychrometric constant kpa c the water stress coefficient is calculated by allen et al 1998 4 k s 1 0 d r r a w t a

root zone mm t a w and r a w are expressed as follows allen et al 1998 5 t a w 1000 θ f c θ w p z r 6 r a w p t a w where θ f c is the soil water moisture at field capacity m3 m3 θ w p is the soil moisture at wilting point m3 m3 z r is rooting depth m and p is average fraction of t a w that can be depleted from the root zone before water stress the root zone is assumed at field capacity when the field surface water is depleted i e d r i 0 according to allen et al 1998 the rooting depth is set as 0 5 m p is 0 2 and θ f c θ w p is estimated responding to specific soil type the values of above parameters used to calculate water stress coefficients in rice growth period at all stations are shown in table 3 2 3 evaluation of weather forecast previous studies have reported that there is much uncertainty in weather forecast luo et al 2014 yang et al 2016 to evaluate the quality of local weather forecast the critical success index csi also known as threat score ts or ratio of verification is used schaefer 1990 7 c s i n a n a n b n c where n a is the number of hits i e the days that both forecast and observation fall in prescribed threshold ranges n b is the number of false alarms i e the days that forecast falls in the threshold ranges while observation does not and n c is the number of misses i e the days that forecast falls outside the threshold ranges while observation falls in according to the daily observed rainfall mm 24 h 1 the daily weather type is divided into seven events and the threshold values for no rain nr light rain lr moderate rain mr heavy rain hr storm st heavy storm hs and severe storm ss are set as 0 0 1 0 1 10 10 25 25 50 50 100 100 250 250 mm respectively 2 4 irrigation scheduling 2 4 1 estimation of expected rainfall amount in the first 3 days in practice when making a decision for irrigation the total rainfall in future days within forecast horizon is more important than the rainfall on a specific day and a rain event usually lasts for more than one day especially for those with a high grade of rainfall e g mr hr and st et al therefore only the rainfall probabilities of the first 3 days are considered as a whole in this study for decision making of irrigation although the rainfall forecast has a horizon of 7 days furthermore a rainfall event happened at any day of the first 3 days was assumed to have equivalent impact on our decision making i e more importance was paid on the total rainfall probability in the first 3 days rather than the probability at some specific day the total rainfall in consecutive 3 days was divided into three levels no irrigation risk i e only nr happens in the consecutive 3 days low irrigation risk i e only nr and lr happens in the consecutive 3 days and at least one day is lr high irrigation risk i e at least one day is mr or hr or st or hs or ss in the consecutive 3 days it is worth to note that the risk is regarding to possible waste of irrigation water to compute the probabilities of the three rain levels weight for each rainfall grade was given the weights for no rain light rain and moderate rain or higher grades i e heavy rain storm heavy storm and severe storm are 0 0 1 and 1 0 respectively then a rainfall index r i 3 d was defined as a sum of the rainfall weights in the consecutive 3 days to present the three rain levels i e no irrigation risk nir r i 3 d 0 low irrigation risk lir 0 1 r i 3 d 1 0 high irrigation risk hir r i 3 d 1 0 then the probability of specific rain level i e nir lir hir in the first 3 days of forecast period is calculated by 8 p a b n a n b where a and b is the specific rain level p a b is the probability of a happened when b is forecasted n a is the number of a i e the a is observed when b is forecasted n b is the total number of forecasted b the expected rainfall amount corresponding to nir lir hir levels is given as follows 9 r e b p l i r b r o l i r p h i r b r o h i r where r e b is the expected rainfall amount of specific rain level i e nir lir hir p l i r b and p h i r b are the probability of that lir and hir were observed when b is forecasted respectively r o l i r and r o h i r are the average of observed rainfall distribution for lir and hir respectively 2 4 2 rule of decision making for irrigation in the conventional irrigation scheduling the amount of irrigation water is generally calculated by 10 i i w l i r r w l i where w l i r r is the maximum threshold of field water depth for irrigation mm when the weather forecast information is considered the rule of decision making for irrigation is given as follows 1 the amount of irrigation water is calculated by 11 i i w l i r r w l i r e b 2 if i i 10 mm the irrigation is postponed to day i 1 3 if irrigation occurs on any day t no irrigation can occur in any of the next consecutive 3 days t 1 t 2 t 3 2 5 crop water production function when the weather forecast information is considered in the irrigation scheduling of the awd the amount of irrigation water and time of irrigation will be changed thus a yield reduction will happen because of continuous water stress to evaluate the effect of water stress on crop yield crop water production functions cwpf are usually used to relate yield reduction to water deficit at some specified period of crop growth in irrigation optimization and water management igbadun et al 2007 zhang and oweis 2007 in this paper the jensen model jensen 1968 was employed to quantify the effect of this newly proposed irrigation scheduling method on yield the model is expressed as 12 y a y m i 1 n e t a i e t m i λ i where y a is the crop yield from water stress treatment y m is the crop yield from non stressed treatment e t a i is the actual crop evapotranspiration from water stress treatment at growth stage i e t m i is the actual crop evapotranspiration from non stressed treatment at growth stage i λ i is water stress sensitivity index at growth stage i and n is the number of growth stages in this study the values of λ i for the three rice types are derived from literature as shown in table 4 2 6 analysis tool software the statistic analysis of weather forecast data was carried out with fortran programming and the irrigation scheduling simulations were also done with a fortran program and it was visually validated with the excel 2016 software all the figures were plotted with the originpro 2015 3 results 3 1 evaluation of weather forecast for daily rainfall the frequencies of various events were analyzed based on the observed daily rainfall in rice growth period of 2012 2013 and 2015 at each station fig 2 the results showed that the distribution of rainfall events in rice growth period had great difference among various stations while there was relatively small inner annual variability at each station for example the nr and lr events took place with an equivalent frequency about 0 4 in middle rice growth period at dujiangyan station djy m fig 2a while the frequencies of nr and lr in middle rice growth period at yinchuan station yc m were about 0 8 and 0 2 respectively on average of three years fig 2h moreover the distribution of rainfall events varied greatly with rice growth seasons for example the frequencies of lr mr and hr events in early rice growth period at nanchang nc e and nanning nn e were obviously higher than that in late rice growth period i e nc l and nn l fig 2d g for a lead time of 7 days the critical success index csi of various rainfall events at each station is presented in fig 3 it showed that the csi varied greatly among different rainfall events and significant difference was existed between the stations the csi of nr event was the highest and generally decreased with lead time in rice grow period at most of the stations except for djy m fig 3a and nn e fig 3f the csi of lr and mr events is very low at all stations and there is no regular pattern varying with lead time for the other rainfall events e g hr st hs and ss the csi is almost zero due to low frequency of occurrence although the csi of hr and st is nonzero at some stations fig 3a c f it is worth noting that the csi was set as zero when a specific rainfall event did not occur in the three years 3 2 expected rainfall in the first 3 days under a wide range of climate conditions in this study the rainfall in consecutive 3 days was mainly focused on according to observed rainfall data in rice growth period at each station distribution of rainfall in consecutive 3 days for two rain levels defined as in section 2 4 were analyzed fig 4 and table 5 for rain level lir in the consecutive 3 days the rainfall in gy m kf m and yc m had relatively lower variations than other stations fig 4a for rain level hir the variations of rainfall in kf m and nn e were much lower than other stations fig 4b and the standard deviation sd of which was 23 4 and 19 3 mm respectively table 5 furthermore there was obvious difference in rainfall distributions among the various stations in particular the variation of rainfall for hir in djy m was very high the sd is 107 3 mm in table 5 this is because a severe storm was observed in dyj m of 2013 the maximum 24 h rainfall is 423 8 mm to avoid the impact of extreme event on rainfall distribution in dyj m the extreme values were eliminated in calculating mean values of rainfall for hir the mean and sd of rainfall distribution without extreme values were 46 3 and 43 8 mm respectively fig 5 showed that the forecast of specific rain level i e nir lir and hir contained much uncertainty at all stations when the nir was forecasted in the next 3 days the probability of observed nir i e positive forecast in dyj m was only 24 while the probability of observed hir was 54 fig 5a on the contrary the probabilities of observed nir and lir when the nir was forecasted in nc l are 80 and 13 respectively fig 5e when the lir was forecasted in the next 3 days the probabilities of observed lir varied from 40 to 58 among all stations while high probabilities of hir were observed in djy m 36 nc e 42 and nn e 35 and relatively high probabilities of nir were observed in gy m 32 kf m 30 and yc m 36 when the hir was forecasted in the next 3 days the probabilities of nir were very small less than 10 in rice growth period at all stations while high probabilities of lir were observed in djy m 52 and yc m 73 and the probabilities of observed hir were higher than 60 in rice growth period at other stations the expected rainfall corresponding to specific forecasted rain level in the next 3 days was estimated as the product of average rainfall and probability table 6 showed that the expected rainfall of forecasted nir was relatively high in djy m 13 2 mm and nc e 8 4 mm while the values in kf m nc l nn l and yc m were negligible less than 5 mm the highest expected rainfall of forecasted lir was obtained in nc e 22 5 mm while the value in yc m 4 7 mm was negligible additionally the expected rainfall of forecasted hir in yc m was only 11 4 mm while the values varied from 21 5 to 41 1 mm in the rice growth period at other stations 3 3 impacts of weather forecast on irrigation scheduling fig 6 and 7 showed the effects of weather forecast on irrigation scheduling calculated with the newly proposed method in this paper comparing to conventional irrigation scheduling of the awd the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method can further save irrigation water about 0 100 mm and reduce drainage about 0 60 mm without significant yield loss 1 fig 6 the amount of water reduction for both irrigation and drainage had a certain correlation with rainfall in rice growth period and the values became negligible when the rainfall was beyond a limited range however there was obvious inner annual variability in the positive effects derived from the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method fig 7a and b in terms of water saving and drainage water reduction for example the amount of irrigation water was reduced by 24 2 92 mm in gy m of 2012 while it was reduced by 13 2 26 mm in 2015 moreover the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method increased the number of irrigation timings especially in kf m and yc m about 1 3 extra irrigations two extra irrigations on average were needed in this new irrigation scheduling method due to great temp spatial variation of rainfall distributions and imperfect weather forecasts fig 7c nevertheless comparing to conventional irrigation the final yield of paddy rice in awd derived from the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method was not significantly reduced fig 7d although slight yield reduction less than 1 was observed in kf m nc l and yc m on the contrary the final yield derived from the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method slightly increased in some situations e g djy m and gy m 4 discussion fig 3 indicated that the forecasting performance for nr was much better than that of rain events i e lr mr and hr et al and the quality of performance deteriorate with lead time this is in accordance with previous findings hejazi et al 2014 luo et al 2016 the good forecast performance of nr in rice growth period is partly attributed to its high frequency of occurrence fig 3 also indicated that the forecasting performance of lr has poor correlation with lead time and the relatively good performance on some days within the forecast horizon are more likely due to random chance as well as mr hr and st thus reasons for the worse performance of rain events are more complicated than that of nr for example the average frequency of lr was slightly higher than that of nr in djy m whereas the csi of lr was much lower than that of nr poor forecast of rain events would lead to hard decision on irrigation comparing to daily rainfall forecast the forecasting performance of redefined rain levels i e nir lir and hir can be improved by taking the total rainfall in consecutive 3 days as a whole since the expected rainfall of nir in djy m and nc e are relatively high the amount of irrigation water should be accordingly reduced to make better use of possible rain even though the nir is predicted in next 3 days with the forecast information of rain level in next 3 days the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method could save irrigation water and reduce surface drainage to some extent without significant yield loss fig 6 and 7 through reducing unnecessary irrigation and making a better use of rainfall gowing and ejieji 2001 cai et al 2011 however the proposed method brought 1 3 extra irrigations in rice growth period which would result in more physical and mental input i e labor and money for irrigation management this is mainly because the observed rainfall corresponding to a specific rain level varies greatly table 5 and the expected rainfall in next 3 days cannot be accurately estimated due to imperfect weather forecast fig 5 the inner annual variability of water saving efficiency can be attributed to great uncertainty of rainfall distribution in rice growth period in practice irrigation events are influenced by multi level constraints including available water supply flow rate food security irrigation cost and labor inputs et al in this paper the irrigation decision was made independently without a consideration of water supply in each growth stage and only yield loss was used to evaluate the efficiency of this irrigation scheduling method incorporated with weather forecast thus further research will focus on an optimization of water allocation with multi objectives in whole crop growth period one of the limitations of this study is that only six typical stations were used to validate the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method without a full consideration of the spatial variability of forecast rainfall data and area coverage of meteorological station another limitation of this study is that the spatial and temporal variability of the crop coefficients was not taken in consideration we will investigate into the impacts of variability of rainfall and the crop coefficients in our further studies 5 conclusions in this study potential benefits of weather forecast in irrigation scheduling was discussed and six typical stations were selected from different rice planting area to validate the idea over a wide range of climate conditions in china based on the daily observed and forecasted meteorological data the performance of weather forecast for daily rain events was evaluated then three rain levels were redefined by taking the total rainfall in the consecutive 3 days within rice growth period as a whole and analyzed the rainfall distributions and the probabilities of occurrence in next 3 days for each rain level after that the expected rainfall was estimated for each rain level when it was predicted in next 3 days finally a new method incorporated with short term weather forecast was proposed and evaluated for irrigation scheduling of paddy rice in awd the results indicated that the occurrence probability of each rain level in next 3 days can be clearly recognized and their forecasting performance was much better than that of daily rain events to make better use of possible rainfall in next 3 days the amount of irrigation water should be modified with the expected rainfall corresponding to specific rain level in next 3 days when it was predicted on the current day comparing to the conventional irrigation the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method can further save irrigation water about 0 100 mm and reduce drainage about 0 60 mm without significant yield loss 1 through reducing unnecessary irrigation and improving rainfall use efficiency the results also showed that the efficiency of water saving and drainage reduction had a certain correlation with the total rainfall and the daily rainfall distribution during rice growth period moreover due to great temp spatial variation of rainfall distributions and imperfect weather forecasts 1 3 extra irrigations were needed in this new irrigation scheduling method nevertheless the newly proposed irrigation

periods and stations was collected from weather china http www weather com cn and only weather type e g sunny cloudy overcast light rain et al is included here as it contains rainfall information noting that the observed and forecast weather data of 2014 at some stations is incomplete thus the data is not included in this paper phenological data of 2012 2013 and 2015 at each station was collected from field experiments including stages of returning green rg early tillering et late tillering lt jointing booting jb heading flowering hf milk ripe mi and yellow ripe yr crop coefficient at each crop growth stage of the three rice types is collected from field experiments at jiangxi experimental irrigation station located at nanchang li et al 2018 as shown in table 2 due to lack of experiment data the crop coefficients data is used for all the stations without considering its spatial and temporal difference it is important to note that for the late rice the crop coefficients at hf and mi stages are much higher than that of the early rice and middle rice this is because higher leaf area lai and moister soil conditions were observed during the hf and mi stages of late rice which results in relatively higher daily average crop transpiration and soil evaporation between plants than that of the early rice and middle rice in addition high temperature higher than 30 c was frequently observed during these two stages of early rice and middle rice in our experiment which can result in stomatal closure and it may lead to decrease of crop transpiration thus relatively smaller crop coefficients were likely obtained the high values of crop coefficients and its great variations between cultivars have been reported in previous studies choudhury and singh 2016 lv et al 2018 wu et al 2016 2 2 water balance method the irrigation scheduling is calculated by using water balance method and the water balance equation in paddy rice field is given as follows 1 w l i w l i 1 p i i i e t c i d p i r i where w l i w l i 1 are field water depth or the soil water storage of crop root zone in paddy field at the end of day i and i 1 mm day p i is the precipitation on day i mm day i i is the irrigation amount on day i mm day e t c i is the actual evapotranspiration on day i mm day d p i is the deep percolation on day i mm day and r i is the surface drainage on day i mm day in this study the daily deep percolation d p i was set as a constant value the values for sandy loam loam and clay were set as 3 0 2 5 and 2 0 mm day respectively before the field water level was depleted otherwise the value was set as zero the irrigation amount was calculated according to the predefined upper thresholds for maximum water depth after irrigation and different decision rules introduced in the later section of 2 4 2 the surface drainage r i was calculated as the redundant part exceeding the upper thresholds for maximum water depth after a rainfall the actual evapotranspiration is estimated by 2 e t c k c k s e t 0 where k c is single crop coefficient k s is water stress coefficient k s 1 when there is no soil water stress and e t 0 is reference

above parameters used to calculate water stress coefficients in rice growth period at all stations are shown in table 3 2 3 evaluation of weather forecast previous studies have reported that there is much uncertainty in weather forecast luo et al 2014 yang et al 2016 to evaluate the quality of local weather forecast the critical success index csi also known as threat score ts or ratio of verification is used schaefer 1990 7 c s i n a n a n b n c where n a is the number of hits i e the days that both forecast and observation fall in prescribed threshold ranges n b is the number of false alarms i e the days that forecast falls in the threshold ranges while observation does not and n c is the number of misses i e the days that forecast falls outside the threshold ranges while observation falls in according to the daily observed rainfall mm 24 h 1 the daily weather type is divided into seven events and the threshold values for no rain nr light rain lr moderate rain mr heavy rain hr storm st heavy storm hs and severe storm ss are set as 0 0 1 0 1 10 10 25 25 50 50 100 100 250 250 mm respectively 2 4 irrigation scheduling 2 4 1 estimation of expected rainfall amount in the first 3 days in practice when making a decision for irrigation the total rainfall in future days within forecast horizon is more important than the rainfall on a specific day and a rain event usually lasts for more than one day especially for those with a high grade of rainfall e g mr hr and st et al therefore only the rainfall probabilities of the first 3 days are considered as a whole in this study for decision making of irrigation although the rainfall forecast has a horizon of 7 days furthermore a rainfall event happened at any day of the first 3 days was assumed to have equivalent impact on our decision making i e more importance was paid on the total rainfall probability in the first 3 days rather than the probability at some specific day the total rainfall in consecutive 3 days was divided into three levels no irrigation risk i e only nr happens in the consecutive 3 days low irrigation risk i e only nr and lr happens in the consecutive 3 days and at least one day is lr high irrigation risk i e at least one day is mr or hr or st or hs or ss in the consecutive 3 days it is worth to note that the risk is regarding to possible waste of irrigation water to compute the probabilities of the three rain levels weight for each rainfall grade was given the weights for no rain light rain and moderate rain or higher grades i e heavy rain storm heavy storm and severe storm are 0 0 1 and 1 0 respectively then a rainfall index r i 3 d was defined as a sum of the rainfall weights in the consecutive 3 days to present the three rain levels i e no irrigation risk nir r i 3 d 0 low irrigation risk lir 0 1 r i 3 d 1 0 high irrigation risk hir r i 3 d 1 0 then the probability of specific rain level i e nir lir hir in the first 3 days of forecast period is calculated by 8 p a b n a n b where a and b is the specific rain level p a b is the probability of a happened when b is forecasted n a is the number of a i e the a is observed when b is forecasted n b is the total number of forecasted b the expected rainfall amount corresponding to nir lir hir levels is given as follows 9 r e b p l i r b r o l i r p h i r b r o h i r where r e b is the expected rainfall amount of specific rain level i e nir lir hir p l i r b and p h i r b are the probability of that lir and hir were observed when b is forecasted respectively r o l i r and r o h i r are the average of observed rainfall distribution for lir and hir respectively 2 4 2 rule of decision making for irrigation in the conventional irrigation scheduling the amount of irrigation water is generally calculated by 10 i i w l i r r w l i where w l i r r is the maximum threshold of field water depth for irrigation mm when the weather forecast information is considered the rule of decision making for irrigation is given as follows 1 the amount of irrigation water is calculated by 11 i i w l i r r w l i r e b 2 if i i 10 mm the irrigation is postponed to day i 1 3 if irrigation occurs on any day t no irrigation can occur in any of the next consecutive 3 days t 1 t 2 t 3 2 5 crop water production function when the weather forecast information is considered in the irrigation scheduling of the awd the amount of irrigation water and time of irrigation will be changed thus a yield reduction will happen because of continuous water stress to evaluate the effect of water stress on crop yield crop water production functions cwpf are usually used to relate yield reduction to water deficit at some specified period of crop growth in irrigation optimization and water management igbadun et al 2007 zhang and oweis 2007 in this paper the jensen model jensen 1968 was employed to quantify the effect of this newly proposed irrigation scheduling method on yield the model is expressed as 12 y a y m i 1 n e t a i e t m i λ i where y a is the crop yield from water stress treatment y m is the crop yield from non stressed treatment e t a i is the actual crop evapotranspiration from water stress treatment at growth stage i e t m i is the actual crop evapotranspiration from non stressed treatment at growth stage i λ i is water stress sensitivity index at growth stage i and n is the number of growth stages in this study the values of λ i for the three rice types are derived from literature as shown in table 4 2 6 analysis tool software the statistic analysis of weather forecast data was carried out with fortran programming and the irrigation scheduling simulations were also done with a fortran program and it was visually validated with the excel 2016 software all the figures were plotted with the originpro 2015 3 results 3 1 evaluation of weather forecast for daily rainfall the frequencies of various events were analyzed based on the observed daily rainfall in rice growth period of 2012 2013 and 2015 at each station fig 2 the results showed that the distribution of rainfall events in rice growth period had great difference among various stations while there was relatively small inner annual variability at each station for example the nr and lr events took place with an equivalent frequency about 0 4 in middle rice growth period at dujiangyan station djy m fig 2a while the frequencies of nr and lr in middle rice growth period at yinchuan station yc m were about 0 8 and 0 2 respectively on average of three years fig 2h moreover the distribution of rainfall events varied greatly with rice growth seasons for example the frequencies of lr mr and hr events in early rice growth period at nanchang nc e and nanning nn e were obviously higher than that in late rice growth period i e nc l and nn l fig 2d g for a lead time of 7 days the critical success index csi of various rainfall events at each station is presented in fig 3 it showed that the csi varied greatly among different rainfall events and significant difference was existed between the stations the csi of nr event was the highest and generally decreased with lead time in rice grow period at most of the stations except for djy m fig 3a and nn e fig 3f the csi of lr and mr events is very low at all stations and there is no regular pattern varying with lead time for the other rainfall events e g hr st hs and ss the csi is almost zero due to low frequency of occurrence although the csi of hr and st is nonzero at some stations fig 3a c f it is worth noting that the csi was set as zero when a specific rainfall event did not occur in the three years 3 2 expected rainfall in the first 3 days under a wide range of climate conditions in this study the rainfall in consecutive 3 days was mainly focused on according to observed rainfall data in rice growth period at each station distribution of rainfall in consecutive 3 days for two rain levels defined as in section 2 4 were analyzed fig 4 and table 5 for rain level lir in the consecutive 3 days the rainfall in gy m kf m and yc m had relatively lower variations than other stations fig 4a for rain level hir the variations of rainfall in kf m and nn e were much lower than other stations fig 4b and the standard deviation sd of which was 23 4 and 19 3 mm respectively table 5 furthermore there was obvious difference in rainfall distributions among the various stations in particular the variation of rainfall for hir in djy m was very high the sd is 107 3 mm in table 5 this is because a severe storm was observed in dyj m of 2013 the maximum 24 h rainfall is 423 8 mm to avoid the impact of extreme event on rainfall distribution in dyj m the extreme values were eliminated in calculating mean values of rainfall for hir the mean and sd of rainfall distribution without extreme values were 46 3 and 43 8 mm respectively fig 5 showed that the forecast of specific rain level i e nir lir and hir contained much uncertainty at all stations when the nir was forecasted in the next 3 days the probability of observed nir i e positive forecast in dyj m was only 24 while the probability of observed hir was 54 fig 5a on the contrary the probabilities of observed nir and lir when the nir was forecasted in nc l are 80 and 13 respectively fig 5e when the lir was forecasted in the next 3 days the probabilities of observed lir varied from 40 to 58 among all stations while high probabilities of hir were observed in djy m 36 nc e 42 and nn e 35 and relatively high probabilities of nir were observed in gy m 32 kf m 30 and yc m 36 when the hir was forecasted in the next 3 days the probabilities of nir were very small less than 10 in rice growth period at all stations while high probabilities of lir were observed in djy m 52 and yc m 73 and the probabilities of observed hir were higher than 60 in rice growth period at other stations the expected rainfall corresponding to specific forecasted rain level in the next 3 days was estimated as the product of average rainfall and probability table 6 showed that the expected rainfall of forecasted nir was relatively high in djy m 13 2 mm and nc e 8 4 mm while the values in kf m nc l nn l and yc m were negligible less than 5 mm the highest expected rainfall of forecasted lir was obtained in nc e 22 5 mm while the value in yc m 4 7 mm was negligible additionally the expected rainfall of forecasted hir in yc m was only 11 4 mm while the values varied from 21 5 to 41 1 mm in the rice growth period at other stations 3 3 impacts of weather forecast on irrigation scheduling fig 6 and 7 showed the effects of weather forecast on irrigation scheduling calculated with the newly proposed method in this paper comparing to conventional irrigation scheduling of the awd the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method can further save irrigation water about 0 100 mm and reduce drainage about 0 60 mm without significant yield loss 1 fig 6 the amount of water reduction for both irrigation and drainage had a certain correlation with rainfall in rice growth period and the values became negligible when the rainfall was beyond a limited range however there was obvious inner annual variability in the positive effects derived from the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method fig 7a and b in terms of water saving and drainage water reduction for example the amount of irrigation water was reduced by 24 2 92 mm in gy m of 2012 while it was reduced by 13 2 26 mm in 2015 moreover the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method increased the number of irrigation timings especially in kf m and yc m about 1 3 extra irrigations two extra irrigations on average were needed in this new irrigation scheduling method due to great temp spatial variation of rainfall distributions and imperfect weather forecasts fig 7c nevertheless comparing to conventional irrigation the final yield of paddy rice in awd derived from the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method was not significantly reduced fig 7d although slight yield reduction less than 1 was observed in kf m nc l and yc m on the contrary the final yield derived from the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method slightly increased in some situations e g djy m and gy m 4 discussion fig 3 indicated that the forecasting performance for nr was much better than that of rain events i e lr mr and hr et al and the quality of performance deteriorate with lead time this is in accordance with previous findings hejazi et al 2014 luo et al 2016 the good forecast performance of nr in rice growth period is partly attributed to its high frequency of occurrence fig 3 also indicated that the forecasting performance of lr has poor correlation with lead time and the relatively good performance on some days within the forecast horizon are more likely due to random chance as well as mr hr and st thus reasons for the worse performance of rain events are more complicated than that of nr for example the average frequency of lr was slightly higher than that of nr in djy m whereas the csi of lr was much lower than that of nr poor forecast of rain events would lead to hard decision on irrigation comparing to daily rainfall forecast the forecasting performance of redefined rain levels i e nir lir and hir can be improved by taking the total rainfall in consecutive 3 days as a whole since the expected rainfall of nir in djy m and nc e are relatively high the amount of irrigation water should be accordingly reduced to make better use of possible rain even though the nir is predicted in next 3 days with the forecast information of rain level in next 3 days the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method could save irrigation water and reduce surface drainage to some extent without significant yield loss fig 6 and 7 through reducing unnecessary irrigation and making a better use of rainfall gowing and ejieji 2001 cai et al 2011 however the proposed method brought 1 3 extra irrigations in rice growth period which would result in more physical and mental input i e labor and money for irrigation management this is mainly because the observed rainfall corresponding to a specific rain level varies greatly table 5 and the expected rainfall in next 3 days cannot be accurately estimated due to imperfect weather forecast fig 5 the inner annual variability of water saving efficiency can be attributed to great uncertainty of rainfall distribution in rice growth period in practice irrigation events are influenced by multi level constraints including available water supply flow rate food security irrigation cost and labor inputs et al in this paper the irrigation decision was made independently without a consideration of water supply in each growth stage and only yield loss was used to evaluate the efficiency of this irrigation scheduling method incorporated with weather forecast thus further research will focus on an optimization of water allocation with multi objectives in whole crop growth period one of the limitations of this study is that only six typical stations were used to validate the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method without a full consideration of the spatial variability of forecast rainfall data and area coverage of meteorological station another limitation of this study is that the spatial and temporal variability of the crop coefficients was not taken in consideration we will investigate into the impacts of variability of rainfall and the crop coefficients in our further studies 5 conclusions in this study potential benefits of weather forecast in irrigation scheduling was discussed and six typical stations were selected from different rice planting area to validate the idea over a wide range of climate conditions in china based on the daily observed and forecasted meteorological data the performance of weather forecast for daily rain events was evaluated then three rain levels were redefined by taking the total rainfall in the consecutive 3 days within rice growth period as a whole and analyzed the rainfall distributions and the probabilities of occurrence in next 3 days for each rain level after that the expected rainfall was estimated for each rain level when it was predicted in next 3 days finally a new method incorporated with short term weather forecast was proposed and evaluated for irrigation scheduling of paddy rice in awd the results indicated that the occurrence probability of each rain level in next 3 days can be clearly recognized and their forecasting performance was much better than that of daily rain events to make better use of possible rainfall in next 3 days the amount of irrigation water should be modified with the expected rainfall corresponding to specific rain level in next 3 days when it was predicted on the current day comparing to the conventional irrigation the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method can further save irrigation water about 0 100 mm and reduce drainage about 0 60 mm without significant yield loss 1 through reducing unnecessary irrigation and improving rainfall use efficiency the results also showed that the efficiency of water saving and drainage reduction had a certain correlation with the total rainfall and the daily rainfall distribution during rice growth period moreover due to great temp spatial variation of rainfall distributions and imperfect weather forecasts 1 3 extra irrigations were needed in this new irrigation scheduling method nevertheless the newly proposed irrigation scheduling method incorporated with weather forecast is suggested to apply in irrigation practice for its simplicity and effectiveness acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the

11216,over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation has led to a series of ecological and environmental problems in the north china plain ncp identifying the water consumption and groundwater level dynamics under different cropping systems can help to develop groundwater neutral system in the ncp the whcns soil water heat carbon and nitrogen simulator model was applied to quantify the effects of different cropping systems 2h1y two harvests in one year 3h2y three harvests in two years and 1h1y one harvest in one year on groundwater use and crop growth and to explore the trade offs of possible scenarios on the decline of groundwater level and cereal yield results showed that whcns performed well in simulating soil water content leaf area index dry matter and crop yield as well as groundwater level dynamics with the nash and sutcliffe efficiency 0 4 and index of agreement 0 8 the simulated results indicated that the groundwater levels of 2h1y decreased faster than those of other cropping systems at a decline rate of 0 33 m yr 1 irrigation of 300 mm yr 1 for the remaining high yield of winter wheat mainly resulted in the decline of groundwater level in the ncp scenario analyses showed that the groundwater levels would stop decreasing when the current planting area of winter wheat decreased by 76 however the reduction of wheat planting area scenario 1 will also decrease the annual yield by 27 from 13 547 to 9909 kg ha 1 fallowing scenario 2 may reduce annual yield by 50 from 13 547 to 6834 kg ha 1 in order to maintain groundwater level the snwt south to north water transfer project scenario 3 may have to provide 50 of irrigation water 130 mm yr 1 to prevent groundwater decline while maintaining the current yield scenario 3 could be better than scenario 1 only if the water price was less than 8 m 3 in the future reducing winter wheat planting area especially for low yield cropland may be a good option to mitigate groundwater decline while maintaining relatively high yield and income for local farmers in the ncp keywords groundwater level water productivity cropping system soil crop system model groundwater neutral system north china plain 1 introduction groundwater is essential for food production and sustaining ecosystems the importance of groundwater for global food security will intensify due to the increased demand for food land degradation and climate change taylor et al 2013 groundwater level decline has been persistent in the north china plain ncp due to intensive agriculture for the past few decades the ncp played an important role in ensuring food security in china zhao et al 2007 xiao et al 2017 currently the ncp contributes to over 60 of the national wheat yield and approximately 45 of maize yield national bureau of statistics of china 2008 however the overuse of groundwater for irrigation has decreased the water level by 1 m per year in the last three decades yang et al 2015a the situation of the ncp is probably the most relevant case in studying the trade offs between food production and groundwater sustainability actually the ncp has a long history of providing food for other parts of china since 1970s intensive agricultural production has developed rapidly in this region due to the increased population and demand for food moreover the cropping system in the ncp started to shift from one harvest per year 1h1y and or three harvests in two years 3h2y to two harvests per year 2h1y system wu et al 2002 in 1980s the 2h1y of winter wheat summer maize double cropping system was widely adopted because of its high annual crop yield of 15 000 kg ha 1 zhao et al 2007 li et al 2015 sun et al 2015 however this system relied heavily on groundwater irrigation because the rivers were inaccessible in many areas in ncp in addition the growth of winter wheat was poorly synchronized with the rainy season only 20 30 of total rainfall occurs during the winter wheat growing season liu et al 2001 wang et al 2008 sun et al 2010 qin et al 2015 for an optimal yield of winter wheat a total supplementary irrigation of 300 mm yr 1 is normally required for the ncp region preferably with an irrigation of three to four times wang et al 2003 zhang et al 2006 for the last three decades groundwater irrigation has been intensified to meet the water demand of the 2h1y cropping system kendy 2002 huang et al 2014 over exploitation of groundwater is not sustainable and has also caused many environmental problems such as land subsidence and seawater intrusion wang 2004 qiu 2010 zhou and zhao 2013 huang et al 2014 groundwater depression zones were found in many large cities in the ncp including beijing tianjin and cangzhou huang et al 2014 the total area of the depression zone of beijing increased from 1155 km2 in 1986 to 4400 km2 in 2010 zhou and zhao 2013 groundwater overexploitation also led to seawater intrusion in many coastal cities dalian tianjin etc huang et al 2014 by 2007 the cumulative area of seawater intrusion in shandong province reached 3441 8 km2 many intrusion areas experienced soil salinization zhou and zhao 2013 thereby threatening agricultural production and environmental safety to relieve water shortage in ncp many water saving technologies e g irrigation methods and deficit irrigation and new water saving crop varieties have been developed to improve the water use efficiency wue and while maintaining high crop yield zhang et al 2010 liu et al 2013 chen et al 2014 liu et al 2013 conducted a four years field experiment to evaluate the wue and crop yield under sprinkler and surface irrigation in the ncp they found that the sprinkler irrigation method significantly increased the wue and winter wheat yield and significantly decreased the evapotranspiration with an average water use of 178 mm yr 1 chen et al 2014 studied the wue and yield of winter wheat under different irrigation regimes and weather conditions in the ncp where wue decreased with the increase in irrigation moreover deficit irrigation one or two irrigation applications was suggested for a relatively increased wue and yield zhang et al 2010 analyzed 26 winter wheat varieties released between 1970 and 2002 and showed that wue was significantly increased from 1 0 1 2 kg m 3 in 1970s to 1 4 1 5 kg m 3 in 2000s these water saving technologies and new water saving varieties have mitigated the groundwater decline in this region to a certain extent the demand of irrigation for winter wheat remained high due to poor synchronization between the growing season of winter wheat and the rainy season kang et al 2003 qin et al 2015 in the ncp summer maize is not normally irrigated due to the sufficient rainfall during the summer whereas about 300 mm of irrigation is necessary for winter wheat sun et al 2011 hence the current cropping systems should be converted to secure the groundwater resources in the ncp sun et al 2011 yang et al 2015a xiao et al 2017 for example van oort et al 2016 proposed a groundwater neutral cropping system to preserve the groundwater and explored the options base on calibrated apsim model by changing the water management practices and crop sequence the simulations indicated that the total crop yield may decrease by 44 of that for the current practice if agriculture were made groundwater neutral water conservation with the use of plastic film could limit this reduction to 21 33 however the effects of reduced winter wheat planting area fallow season and the use of external water inputs from south to north water transfer project swnt on groundwater levels have not been investigated and the associated economic benefits have not been considered therefore their feasibility should be analyzed and evaluated to stop groundwater decline and achieve relatively high income hence the objectives of the present study were to i evaluate and apply the whcns model to simulate water balances and crop yields under different cropping systems ii predict groundwater level dynamics and explore groundwater neutral cropping systems in the study area and iii analyze and evaluate the net income of different groundwater

water content at the key crop growth stages of sowing seedling and jointing water management for summer maize was similar to that for all treatments based on farmer s practices each experiment plot was 10 m 5 m in size and was replicated for four times in randomized block designs approximately 1 m of protection line was set between the neighboring plots to reduce the effect of water lateral

penman monteith method from the fao is used to calculate the reference crop evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 soil water infiltration and redistribution processes are described by green ampt green and ampt 1911 and richard s equations respectively runoff is calculated using the approach designed by the u s natural resource conservation service nrcs 2004 the improved version of the ps123 model driessen and konjin 1992 is applied to simulate crop development stage dry matter production and allocation and crop yield soil c and n cycling concepts are drawn from the daisy model hansen et al 1990 the model runs on a daily time step and is driven by the meteorological and crop biological variables and agricultural management practices a detailed model description is available in the literature hu et al 2007 liang et al 2016a 2 4 groundwater level simulation the variation in soil types loam elevation and physical geomorphology were small in this county hence we assumed the whole vicinity as a large uniform irrigated cropland based on results of the simulated water balances by whcns a simple method proposed by yang et al 2015a b was applied to analyze the groundwater level dynamics under various cropping systems in this study we introduced a fraction coefficient β to assess the effect of possible water input come from the snwt project 1 d t d t δ t f 1 β i dp α where dt and dt t are the groundwater table mm at time t and t t respectively i is the amount of irrigation water mm f is ratio of area of the specific cropping system to the total irrigated area from 0 to 1 dp is the amount of deep percolation mm which calculated by the whcns model α is the aquifer specific yield which was set to 0 17 by comparing the simulated and measured groundwater tables yang et al 2015b and β is the fraction coefficient from 0 to 1 which represents the ratio of the amount of irrigation water come from external water sources may be snwt to the total amount of irrigation water inputs 2 5 simulation scenarios to further evaluate the effects of alternative cropping systems on groundwater level decline and develop the groundwater neutral cropping systems after calibrating and validating the whcns model three scenarios were designed and the simulation period extended to the last ten years from 1999 to 2008 1 scenario 1 reducing the winter wheat planting area to prevent the groundwater level decline the planting area of winter wheat for the current cropping systems 2h1y fp 2h1y wq and 2h1y ri was reduced by 0 100 at an interval of 10 in this scenario 2 scenario 2 adopting fallow to prevent groundwater level decline based on the current cropping systems 2h1y fp 2h1y wq and 2h1y ri one year of planting followed by one year of fallow 1p1f two years of planting followed by one year of fallow 2p1f three years of planting followed by one year of fallow 3p1f and continuous planting cp 3 scenario 3 how much external irrigation water from snwt is needed to maintain the current cropping system while preventing groundwater level decline in this scenario the β value in the eq 1 was set from 0 to 1 at an interval of 0 1 2 6 model parameterization the model ran continuously from oct 16 2004 to oct 2 2007 calibration and validation data included soil water content crop lai crop dry mass and yield the data from treatment 2h1y wq were used to calibrate the crop parameters of winter wheat and summer maize spring maize parameters were adjusted by comparing the simulated and measured data from treatment 1h1y data from the other three treatments 2h1y fp 2h1y ri and 3h2y were used to validate the model 2 6 1 soil hydraulic parameters soil water retention characteristic curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity are described using the brooks and corey 1966 and mualem and dagan 1978 equations respectively soil saturated water content θs field capacity θfc wilting water content θwp and residual water content θr were experimentally measured and are listed in table 2 for subsequent use in the calculation of hydraulic parameters by using the methods by rawls et al 1982 and ma et al 2009 2 λ ln θ fc θ r θ wp θ r ln 15000 333 3 h b exp ln θ fc θ r ln θ s θ r λ ln 333 λ where λ and hb are the parameters of brooks corey equation representing the shape coefficient and air entry value respectively 2 6 2 crop parameters the default crop parameters for crop modeling were based on the study of driessen and konjin 1992 and li et al 2015 whereas the partition coefficients and maximum photosynthetic were calibrated to correspond to the measured values of dry mass and lai the crop parameters are shown in table 3 2 7 model performance criteria the following three statistical indices were applied to evaluate the model performance root mean square error rmse 4 rmse i 1 n s i o i 2 n index of agreement ia willmott 1982 5 ia 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 6 nse 1 i 1 n s i o

between simulated and measured values the ia is an additional index for the evaluation of modeling performance results ranging from 0 1 the closer ia is to 1 the better the simulation quality similar to the coefficient of determination by contrast nse allows negative values and compares the deviation between the simulated and measured state variables with the variance of the measured values van liew and garbrecht 2003 analyzed many soil water dynamic process models indicating good model performance at nse 0 36 and ia 0 7 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation fig 2 illustrates the measured and simulated soil water content for treatment 2h1y fp only the results of 2h1y fp treatment are shown in the manuscript while the simulation results for the other treatments are provided by supplementary file fig s1 s4 a comparison of the measured and simulated lai and dry matter for all treatments are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively generally the simulated values agreed well with the measured data significant correlation was found between the measured and simulated soil water content crop dry mass lai and yield for all five treatments with correlation coefficients of 0 720 0 957 0 852 and 0 722 respectively table 4 the rmse nse and ia of the simulated soil water content were 0 048 cm3 cm 3 0 423 and 0 847 respectively table 4 for crop growth simulation the rmse of lai dry mass and yield were 1 4 m2 m 2 1764 kg ha 1 and 954 kg ha 1 respectively nse 0 4 and ia 0 8 for all cropping systems indicated that the model had a good performance on crop growth simulation van liew and garbrecht 2003 3 2 net water use the simulated water balances across the 1 2 m of soil profile along with wue under different cropping systems are summarized in table 5 precipitation was not enough to meet the water demand of crop growth for the three cropping systems in this region groundwater was pumped to the irrigation due to the lack of access to the rivers the amounts of irrigation water significantly differed across different cropping systems in different years ranging from 300 to 432 225 357 120 243 120 197 and 0 120 mm for 2h1y fp 2h1y wq 2h1y ri 3h2y and 1h1y respectively water consumption comprises actual evapotranspiration eta and drainage dra 2h1y had the highest eta among the three cropping systems with an average value for 2h1y 3h2y and 1h1y of 643 556 and 482 mm respectively table 5 eta and dra increased with increased the amount of irrigation for cropping system 2h1y eta and dra for the treatments can be arranged as follows 2h1y fp 2h1y wq 2h1y ri the crop yields under the three different water management practices for 2h1y cropping system showed no significant difference with an average value of 14 763 kg ha 1 yr 1 but it was significantly higher than those of 3h2y 12 081 kg ha 1 yr 1 and 1h1y 7915 kg ha 1 yr 1 table 5 a high crop yield increased the wue for 2h1y 2 30 kg m 3 compared with 3h2y 2 17 kg m 3 and 1h1y 1 64 kg m 3 the wue under different water managements for 2h1y was mainly affected by eta which can be arranged as follows 2h1y ri 2h1y wq 2h1y pf given that the irrigation water was extracted from groundwater the item of irrigation minus dra in table 5 represents the net water use nwu the range of nwu for 2h1y fp 2h1y wq 2h1y ri 3h2y and 1h1y was 113 393 62 337 3 236 20 190 51 113 mm respectively table 5 the positive value for 2h1y fp 2h1y wq and 2h1y ri cropping systems indicated the net groundwater consumption although the value of nwu was negative 20 mm for 3h2y in 2006 it was also difficult to prevent groundwater level decline in the long timescale nevertheless nwu was negative in two years for the 1h1y cropping system which could be the alternative choice only when the economic benefit is not the first option 3 3 groundwater levels simulation it is important to validate the simulated nwu by comparing the predicted and measured groundwater levels yang et al 2015a in this study the validated whcns model was applied to simulate the annual nwu under different cropping systems from 1999 to 2008 the values were expressed as the groundwater level decline by using the method described in section 2 4 considering that the cropping system crop varieties and irrigation practices were almost unchanged from 1999 to 2008 so the recent ten years were selected to validate the predicted dynamics of the groundwater levels in the study fig 5 a shows that the measured groundwater level started to decline nearly from 1995 at the beginning of the intensive double cropping system was recommended in the ncp wu et al 2002 the predicted decreasing trend of groundwater levels under the 2h1y fp cropping system matched well with the measured values fig 5a it indicated that the annual nwu was simulated by whcns model was considered as acceptable therefore the model can be used to predict the groundwater level decline under different cropping systems the simulated groundwater levels under different cropping systems are shown in fig 5a the decline rates of the 2h1y wq 2h1y ri 3h2y 1h1y spm and 1h1y sm were 0 25 0 22 0 10 0 01 and 0 07 m yr 1 respectively fig 5a among different cropping systems the groundwater levels of 2h1y fp decreased faster than those other cropping systems at a decline rate of 0 33 m yr 1 for different water management practices under the 2h1y system the groundwater table decreased fast even for the reduced water input treatment 2h1y ri suggested that groundwater level could not prevent the decline without changing the current system the annual nwu changes with different weather conditions and different cropping systems are illustrated in fig 5b the average annual nwus for different cropping systems ranged from 44 to 180 mm yr 1 and nwu had a close relationship with the annual yield the average annual yields were 15 853 14 953 13 547 10 905 8 856 and 8178 kg ha 1 for 2h1y fp 2h1y wq 2h1y ri 3h2y 1h1y spm and 1h1y sm respectively fig 5c the mean annual crop yields will be reduced by 26 2 40 1 and 44 7 when cropping systems are changed from 2h1y to 3h2y 1h1y spm and 1h1y sm respectively 3 4 scenario analysis figs 6 a and 6b show the simulated results of scenario 1 which reduce winter wheat planting area to prevent groundwater level decline with the decrease in winter wheat planting area the decline rate of groundwater level slows down fig 6a groundwater levels stopped falling when the winter wheat planting area was decreased by approximately 76 for the 2h1y ri system a larger un planting area was required for the patterns of 2h1y fp and 2h1y wq fig 6b the appropriate water management mitigated the decline in groundwater level to a certain extent moreover with reduced winter wheat planting area wheat yields are also reduced by more than 76 at scenario 1 table 6 except for reducing the wheat planting area scenario 2 tried to explore an appropriate fallow cultivation pattern fig 6c shows that the average rates of groundwater decline for 2h1y ri under different fallow patterns of cp 3p1f 2p1f and 1p1f were 0 22 0 13 0 08 and 0 01 m yr 1 respectively the 1p1f cropping system was also a good method to maintain sustainable groundwater resource but resulted in markedly decreasing of the annual crop yield from 13 547 to 6834 kg ha 1 the groundwater levels of 2h1y fp and 2h1y wq maintained a slight decline rate under the fallow patterns 1p1f whereas 2h1y ri can realize groundwater neutral fig 6d it indicated that the improved water management practice had a benefit to adopting fallow season both scenario 1 and scenario 2 maintained the groundwater level by converting the current cropping systems however the external water inputs were ignored for scenario 3 with increasing β value from 0 to 1 the status of groundwater level was changed from a declining to an increasing trend the change in groundwater levels was close to zero when the βvalue increased to 0 5 and 0 6 for 2h1y ri and 2h1y wq respectively fig 6e and 6f this finding indicated that snwt needs to provide at least 50 of the total amount of irrigation water under the current cropping system to prevent the decline in groundwater level while maintaining the current crop yield table 6 lists the results of the economic analysis of different groundwater neutral cropping systems the neutral cropping systems included three scenarios for 2h1y ri scenario 1 scenario 2 and scenario 3 and two 1h1y systems spm and sm which were described in section 3 2 the income of maize and wheat was calculated by multiplying the yield by the price considering that the irrigation water was directly pumped from the wells for scenario 1 scenario 2 1h1y spm and 1h1y sm farmers need to pay for approximately 0 8 per cubic meter for the groundwater the production costs listed in table 6 is the annual cost of labor and field practices for the different cropping systems including sowing fertilization and machine yang et al 2015 an increased intensification corresponds to an increased production cost as shown in table 6 the average annual net income was 13 780 9 923 12 328 and 11 040 ha 1 yr 1 for scenario 1 scenario 2 1h1y spm and 1h1y sm respectively table 6 scenario 1 had the highest economic income without access to the external water resources however the net income for scenario 3 had a close relationship with water price the price of non residential water from the snwt project increased to 9 0 m 3 in the latest local government work report the government of hebei province 2017 considering the annual fluctuation in snwt water price we calculated the annual net incomes of scenario 3 under different water prices and listed in table 6 the average annual net income for scenario 3 decreased from 17 478 to 8678 ha 1 yr 1 due to the increase in water price from 4 to 14 m 3 the annual net income of scenario 3 13 958 ha 1 yr 1 was very close to that of scenario 1 when the water price is approximately 8 m 3 the annual net income of 2h1y spm 12 328 ha 1 and 2h1y sum 11 040 ha 1 cropping systems were relatively low compared with that of scenario 1 13 780 ha 1 it indicated that the secenario 3 system had a better economic benefit than scenario 1 only when the water price is less than 8 m 3 4 discussions in this study we explored options to achieve food security and groundwater sustainability in the ncp our simulations indicated that reducing the winter wheat planting area adopting fallow season and using external water from swnt project could be effective measures to mitigate the decline in groundwater level while maintaining high yield in the ncp however the targets for optimization should be considered below we discussed the feasibility of these measures to stop the decline in groundwater level and analyzed the economic costs to make the groundwater level neutral while maintaining a relatively high income the discussion only focused on cereal yield due to the importance of cereals in china other cash crops such as vegetables and fruits were not considered in this study 4 1 effect of water regimes on wue and crop yield optimizing the water input can effectively improve wue and crop yield sun et al 2011 li et al 2015 in this study the annual et decreased from 723 to 599 mm yr 1 upon reducing the irrigation rate from 432 to 120 mm yr 1 among the 2h1y systems the 2h1y ri had the lowest annual et with a relatively high annual crop yield 14 085 kg ha 1 which made its wue the highest our findings agree with those of many previous studies for example li et al 2015 found that the wue of optimal irrigation practice was approximately 2 2 kg m 3 which was significantly higher than that of farmer practices 1 8 kg m 3 sun et al 2011 reported that the annual wue of four different cropping systems in the ncp ranged between 1 3 1 9 kg m 3 depending on water inputs soil type and climates in this study the wue of 2h1y ri 2 4 kg m 3 was higher than that of 2h1y fp 2 2 kg m 3 and 2h1y wq 2 3 kg m 3 the optimized water management practices usually maintained the crop yield while reducing et yang et al 2015a reported that the et for the double cropping system ranged from 641 to 808 mm yr 1 at an irrigation rate of 330 mm yr 1 in the luancheng county of the ncp van oort et al 2016 reported a decrease in et from 790 to 548 mm yr 1 when the irrigation rate changed from 345 to 44 mm yr 1 in the xinji county of the ncp these findings indicate that the improved water regime may enhance the wue and crop yield to a certain extent however according to our simulations it remains difficult to stop the decline in groundwater levels by utilizing these options 4 2 decline in groundwater level and crop yield under different cropping systems the 2h1y cropping system of ww sm makes full use of light and heat resources in the region however nearly two thirds of precipitation occurred during the summer june august in the ncp which is not synchronized with winter wheat growth qin et al 2015 sun et al 2015 some studies proposed that irrigation in the summer maize season was not necessary whereas approximately 300 mm was necessary for winter wheat sun et al 2011 sun et al 2015 analyzed the crop irrigation water requirements under different precipitation patterns in the ncp the results illustrated that precipitation pattern was a key factor affecting the wue irrigation was not necessary for maize growth but at least 247 mm of irrigation water was required for maintaining winter wheat growth in this study the nwu for 2h1y was significantly larger than that of 3h2y and 1h1y which was mainly caused by more water consumption for winter wheat the nwu values of were expressed as groundwater level dynamics indicating the effect of cropping systems on groundwater levels yang et al 2015a b yang et al 2015a applied this method to simulate the groundwater levels dynamics under different cropping systems and the results showed that the fastest decline occurred under the current 2h1y system with a rate of approximately 1 m yr 1 this phenomenon was also found in this study the decline rate of 1h1y spm was larger than that of 1h1y sm usually the sowing and harvesting dates of summer maize are mid june and early october respectively whereas spring maize is sown at late april and harvested at early october van oort et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 spring maize had a longer growth period and larger biomass than those of summer maize in the ncp hence the nwu for 1h1y spm was higher than that of 1h1y sm sun et al 2011 reported that only the 1h1y system had the potential to maintain the groundwater levels in the ncp but the annual crop yield was greatly reduced van oort et al 2016 reported that the total crop yield would decrease by 44 compared with the current pattern if make the groundwater sustainably in the long timescale in the ncp xiao et al 2017 demonstrated that the 1h1y system prevented the decline in groundwater level in the luancheng county in the ncp but decreased 50 4 of crop yield compared with the current 2h1y system these findings were close to our results 4 3 developing groundwater neutral cropping systems recently van oort et al 2016 explored various groundwater neutral cropping systems based on the current 2h1y system by using the apsim model and showed that the groundwater neutral total grain yield per year was lower than 9300 kg ha 1 in the ncp with grain yield reduction of 44 compared with the current 2h1y system these designed cropping systems were mainly implemented by changing the crop sequence and irrigation practice in our study a relatively high crop yield of 9909 kg ha 1 table 6 could be achieved through by reducing 76 of wheat planting area suggesting its potential way to keep groundwater neutral in addition the production costs were markedly decreased moreover the production costs were reduced from 5790 to 3761 ha 1 as the decrease of wheat planting area table 6 actually reducing the wheat planting area has been encouraged by the government in recent years some pilot projects setup in 15 provinces in china ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china 2018 hence reducing the wheat planting area is a good way to develop the groundwater neutral cropping systems in the ncp among all the groundwater neutral systems the scenario 3 2h1y ri had the best economic benefit for farmers when the water price is less than 8 m 3 table 6 the first phase of snwt project was finished in 2014 and the total volume of water that is projected to be transferred into the ncp is 7 0 7 5 billion m3 yr 1 including approximately 1 2 billion m3 yr 1 into beijing approximately 1 0 billion m3 yr 1 into tianjin and approximately 3 0 billion m3 yr 1 into the hebei province yang et al 2010 cao et al 2013 considering there the 0 21 million km2 of cropland in the ncp snwt water only meet a small proportion of the agricultural water demand the maximum amount of irrigation water was approximately 35 mm per year with the application of all snwt in the agricultural irrigation however at least 88 mm irrigation water was needed for 2h1y ri to prevent groundwater further decline according to the simulations moreover the snwt water mainly provides for the urban domestic water use the distribution of snwt water use among different sectors is also a problem zheng et al 2010 cao et al 2013 this study focused on optimizing the current cropping system however other water saving technologies were not included sun et al 2012 proposed that plastic film and concrete mulching were more efficient to enhance the wue without yield loss than straw mulching liu et al 2013 suggested that the traditional surface irrigation should be replaced by sprinkler irrigation for winter wheat cultivation in the ncp these methods need further studies in addition a simple method was adopted to predict the dynamics in groundwater levels in this study which ignored the possible lateral recharge from the reservoirs or the taihang mountain the whcns model could be coupled with groundwater models mike she modflow etc to analyze the response of the regional groundwater levels to various cropping systems in the future styczen and storm 1993 xu et al 2012 moreover the spatial variation of soil properties weather condition different crop rotations and field management practices were not included in this study the effects of different groundwater neutral systems on regional food production and the allocation of water resources must be further explored 5 conclusions in this study we explored the options for sustaining groundwater and food security in the ncp the most important cereal production base of china the results showed that the whcns model performed well in modeling soil water content lai dry matter and crop yield under different cropping systems with the nse 0 4 and ia 0 8 the predicted groundwater levels also coincided with the observed data these results indicated that the whcns model coupled with simple methods can predict the decline in groundwater in the ncp the methods can be applied to other aquifers after validation the simulated results indicate that both 2h1y and 3h2y cropping systems had negative nwu values which lead to the decline in groundwater level for different water levels the reduced water input cropping system 2h1y ri had the highest wue with a relatively high grain yield three scenarios were explored to prevent the decline in groundwater level in the ncp the first scenario made the groundwater level neutral by reducing 76 of the winter wheat planting area however the annual crop yield may be reduced by 27 from 13 547 to 9909 kg ha 1 second fallow was adopt to sustain the groundwater level but resulted in 50 yield reduction from 13 547 to 6834 kg ha 1 for the last scenario the snwt project needs to provide at least 50 of the total amount of irrigation 130 mm yr 1 water to prevent the decline in groundwater level while maintaining the current crop yield under the 2h1y system however the last option can only be feasible if the water price was less than 8 m 3 our results suggest that reducing the winter wheat planting area especially for the low yield cropland may be a good option to prevent further decline in the groundwater level while ensuring food security and the income of millions of local farmers

11216,over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation has led to a series of ecological and environmental problems in the north china plain ncp identifying the water consumption and groundwater level dynamics under different cropping systems can help to develop groundwater neutral system in the ncp the whcns soil water heat carbon and nitrogen simulator model was applied to quantify the effects of different cropping systems 2h1y two harvests in one year 3h2y three harvests in two years and 1h1y one harvest in one year on groundwater use and crop growth and to explore the trade offs of possible scenarios on the decline of groundwater level and cereal yield results showed that whcns performed well in simulating soil water content leaf area index dry matter and crop yield as well as groundwater level dynamics with the nash and sutcliffe efficiency 0 4 and index of agreement 0 8 the simulated results indicated that the groundwater levels of 2h1y decreased faster than those of other cropping systems at a decline rate of 0 33 m yr 1 irrigation of 300 mm yr 1 for the remaining high yield of winter wheat mainly resulted in the decline of groundwater level in the ncp scenario analyses showed that the groundwater levels would stop decreasing when the current planting area of winter wheat decreased by 76 however the reduction of wheat planting area scenario 1 will also decrease the annual yield by 27 from 13 547 to 9909 kg ha 1 fallowing scenario 2 may reduce annual yield by 50 from 13 547 to 6834 kg ha 1 in order to maintain groundwater level the snwt south to north water transfer project scenario 3 may have to provide 50 of irrigation water 130 mm yr 1 to prevent groundwater decline while maintaining the current yield scenario 3 could be better than scenario 1 only if the water price was less than 8 m 3 in the future reducing winter wheat planting area especially for low yield cropland may be a good option to mitigate groundwater decline while maintaining relatively high yield and income for local farmers in the ncp keywords groundwater level water productivity cropping system soil crop system model groundwater neutral system north china plain 1 introduction groundwater is essential for food production and sustaining ecosystems the importance of groundwater for global food security will intensify due to the increased demand for food land degradation and climate change taylor et al 2013 groundwater level decline has been persistent in the north china plain ncp due to intensive agriculture for the past few decades the ncp played an important role in ensuring food security in china zhao et al 2007 xiao et al 2017 currently the ncp contributes to over 60 of the national wheat yield and approximately 45 of maize yield national bureau of statistics of china 2008 however the overuse of groundwater for irrigation has decreased the water level by 1 m per year in the last three decades yang et al 2015a the situation of the ncp is probably the most relevant case in studying the trade offs between food production and groundwater sustainability actually the ncp has a long history of providing food for other parts of china since 1970s intensive agricultural production has developed rapidly in this region due to the increased population and demand for food moreover the cropping system in the ncp started to shift from one harvest per year 1h1y and or three harvests in two years 3h2y to two harvests per year 2h1y system wu et al 2002 in 1980s the 2h1y of winter wheat summer maize double cropping system was widely adopted because of its high annual crop yield of 15 000 kg ha 1 zhao et al 2007 li et al 2015 sun et al 2015 however this system relied heavily on groundwater irrigation because the rivers were inaccessible in many areas in ncp in addition the growth of winter wheat was poorly synchronized with the rainy season only 20 30 of total rainfall occurs during the winter wheat growing season liu et al 2001 wang et al 2008 sun et al 2010 qin et al 2015 for an optimal yield of winter wheat a total supplementary irrigation of 300 mm yr 1 is normally required for the ncp region preferably with an irrigation of three to four times wang et al 2003 zhang et al 2006 for the last three decades groundwater irrigation has been intensified to meet the water demand of the 2h1y cropping system kendy 2002 huang et al 2014 over exploitation of groundwater is not sustainable and has also caused many environmental problems such as land subsidence and seawater intrusion wang 2004 qiu 2010 zhou and zhao 2013 huang et al 2014 groundwater depression zones were found in many large cities in the ncp including beijing tianjin and cangzhou huang et al 2014 the total area of the depression zone of beijing increased from 1155 km2 in 1986 to 4400 km2 in 2010 zhou and zhao 2013 groundwater overexploitation also led to seawater intrusion in many coastal cities dalian tianjin etc huang et al 2014 by 2007 the cumulative area of seawater intrusion in shandong province reached 3441 8 km2 many intrusion areas experienced soil salinization zhou and zhao 2013 thereby threatening agricultural production and environmental safety to relieve water shortage in ncp many water saving technologies e g irrigation methods and deficit irrigation and new water saving crop varieties have been developed to improve the water use efficiency wue and while maintaining high crop yield zhang et al 2010 liu et al 2013 chen et al 2014 liu et al 2013 conducted a four years field experiment to evaluate the wue and crop yield under sprinkler and surface irrigation in the ncp they found that the sprinkler irrigation method significantly increased the wue and winter wheat yield and significantly decreased the evapotranspiration with an average water use of 178 mm yr 1 chen et al 2014 studied the wue and yield of winter wheat under different irrigation regimes and weather conditions in the ncp where wue decreased with the increase in irrigation moreover deficit irrigation one or two irrigation applications was suggested for a relatively increased wue and yield zhang et al 2010 analyzed 26 winter wheat varieties released between 1970 and 2002 and showed that wue was significantly increased from 1 0 1 2 kg m 3 in 1970s to 1 4 1 5 kg m 3 in 2000s these water saving technologies and new water saving varieties have mitigated the groundwater decline in this region to a certain extent the demand of irrigation for winter wheat remained high due to poor synchronization between the growing season of winter wheat and the rainy season kang et al 2003 qin et al 2015 in the ncp summer maize is not normally irrigated due to the sufficient rainfall during the summer whereas about 300 mm of irrigation is necessary for winter wheat sun et al 2011 hence the current cropping systems should be converted to secure the groundwater resources in the ncp sun et al 2011 yang et al 2015a xiao et al 2017 for example van oort et al 2016 proposed a groundwater neutral cropping system to preserve the groundwater and explored the options base on calibrated apsim model by changing the water management practices and crop sequence the simulations indicated that the total crop yield may decrease by 44 of that for the current practice if agriculture were made groundwater neutral water conservation with the use of plastic film could limit this reduction to 21 33 however the effects of reduced winter wheat planting area fallow season and the use of external water inputs from south to north water transfer project swnt on groundwater levels have not been investigated and the associated economic benefits have not been considered therefore their feasibility should be analyzed and evaluated to stop groundwater decline and achieve relatively high income hence the objectives of the present study were to i evaluate and apply the whcns model to simulate water balances and crop yields under different cropping systems ii predict groundwater level dynamics and explore groundwater neutral cropping systems in the study area and iii analyze and evaluate the net income of different groundwater neutral cropping systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted at the china agricultural university experimental station in wuqiao county 37 29 37 47 n 116 19 116 42 e of hebei province china the study area has a temperate sub humid arid monsoon climate the altitude is 14 22 6 m above sea level the annual mean air temperature was 12 6 c and annual cumulative temperature 0 c was about 4863 c the average annual precipitation over the last 20 years was 562 mm 60 70 of which occurred from june to august the soil at the site is classified as calcaric fluvisol with a slit loam texture usda irrigated cropland accounted about 70 of the total land in the wuqiao county the 2h1y two harvests in one year system of winter wheat summer maize ww sm is adopted widely in this area groundwater is the major irrigation water resource because rivers are inaccessible the groundwater depth in the study area is approximately 17 m 2 2 experimental design and data collection fig 1 shows that the experiment was conducted from oct 16 2004 to oct 2 2007 for three different cropping systems 2h1y 3h2y and 1h1y the 2h1y system has three different water input levels namely 2h1y fp farmer s practice 2h1y ri reduced input and 2h1y wq wuqiao system the detailed sowing and harvesting dates of different cropping systems are listed in table 1 winter wheat was planted on the middle of october and harvested on the middle of june the sowing date and harvesting date for summer maize were at the middle of june and early october compared with summer maize spring maize had a long crop growth period and was planted and harvested on late april and early september respectively detailed information on crop sequences is illustrated in fig 1 for winter wheat 75 mm irrigation water was applied at the crop key growth stage of sowing seedling jointing and grain filling for 2h1y fp treatment 2h1y wq reduced the irrigation event at grain filling compared with 2h1y fp fig 1 treatment 2h1y ri was the reduced water input treatment and the average soil water content in the root zone 0 90 cm was kept between 50 and 80 of the field capacity based on the measured soil water content at the key crop growth stages of sowing seedling and jointing water management for summer maize was similar to that for all treatments based on farmer s practices each experiment plot was 10 m 5 m in size and was replicated for four times in randomized block designs approximately 1 m of protection line was set between the neighboring plots to reduce the effect of water lateral infiltration detailed information can be found in liu 2008 a 1 5 m soil profile pit was excavated and samples from each soil textural layer were collected before the experiment beginning in 2004 soil bulk density texture saturated water content field capacity wilting point and saturated hydraulic conductivity were measured for each layer table 2 soil texture was determined using the hydrometer method gee and or 2002 soil saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using the falling head method klute and dirksen 1986 field capacity and wilting point were measured using the pressure plate method at the pressure 1 3 and 15 bar respectively the residual water content was determined by oven drying a soil sampler at 105 c to a constant weight in each plot the soil volumetric water content was measured every 10 days by using tdr mp 917 esi canada at 15 cm intervals through 120 cm of soil profile the crop leaf area index lai and the dry weights of all plant parts were determined at the stages of jointing booting flowering middle filling and maturation crop yield was determined from plots with dimensions of 3 m 3 m meteorological data were obtained from local weather station including the daily average temperature minimum and maximum temperature relative humidity average wind speed 2 m radiation and precipitation groundwater table data were collected from the local bureau of hydrology and water resources survey from long term groundwater level monitoring wells installed within the study area 2 3 model description water balances and crop growth under various cropping systems are simulated by the whcns model liang et al 2016a which is developed as a water and n management tool for intensive cropping systems in china whcns model has been successfully applied to water and n management for the major staple crops in china li et al 2015 liang et al 2016b 2017 five main modules are included in this model soil water soil heat soil c soil n and crop growth the penman monteith method from the fao is used to calculate the reference crop evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 soil water infiltration and redistribution processes are described by green ampt green and ampt 1911 and richard s equations respectively runoff is calculated using the approach designed by the u s natural resource conservation service nrcs 2004 the improved version of the ps123 model driessen and konjin 1992 is applied to simulate crop development stage dry matter production and allocation and crop yield soil c and n cycling concepts are drawn from the daisy model hansen et al 1990 the model runs on a daily time step and is driven by the meteorological and crop biological variables and agricultural management practices a detailed model description is available in the literature hu et al 2007 liang et al 2016a 2 4 groundwater level simulation the variation in soil types loam elevation and physical geomorphology were small in this county hence we assumed the whole vicinity as a large uniform irrigated cropland based on results of the simulated water balances by whcns a simple method proposed by yang et al 2015a b was applied to analyze the groundwater level dynamics under various cropping systems in this study we introduced a fraction coefficient β to assess the effect of possible water input come from the snwt project 1 d t d t δ t f 1 β i dp α where dt and dt t are the groundwater table mm at time t and t t respectively i is the amount of irrigation water mm f is ratio of area of the specific cropping system to the total irrigated area from 0 to 1 dp is the amount of deep percolation mm which calculated by the whcns model α is the aquifer specific yield which was set to 0 17 by comparing the simulated and measured groundwater tables yang et al 2015b and β is the fraction coefficient from 0 to 1 which represents the ratio of the amount of irrigation water come from external water sources may be snwt to the total amount of irrigation water inputs 2 5 simulation scenarios to further evaluate the effects of alternative cropping systems on groundwater level decline and develop the groundwater neutral cropping systems after calibrating and validating the whcns model three scenarios were designed and the simulation period extended to the last ten years from 1999 to 2008 1 scenario 1 reducing the winter wheat planting area to prevent the groundwater level decline the planting area of winter wheat for the current cropping systems 2h1y fp 2h1y wq and 2h1y ri was reduced by 0 100 at an interval of 10 in this scenario 2 scenario 2 adopting fallow to prevent groundwater level decline based on the current cropping systems 2h1y fp 2h1y wq and 2h1y ri one year of planting followed by one year of fallow 1p1f two years of planting followed by one year of fallow 2p1f three years of planting followed by one year of fallow 3p1f and continuous planting cp 3 scenario 3 how much external irrigation water from snwt is needed to maintain the current cropping system while preventing groundwater level decline in this scenario the β value in the eq 1 was set from 0 to 1 at an interval of 0 1 2 6 model parameterization the model ran continuously from oct 16 2004 to oct 2 2007 calibration and validation data included soil water content crop lai crop dry mass and yield the data from treatment 2h1y wq were used to calibrate the crop parameters of winter wheat and summer maize spring maize parameters were adjusted by comparing the simulated and measured data from treatment 1h1y data from the other three treatments 2h1y fp 2h1y ri and 3h2y were used to validate the model 2 6 1 soil hydraulic parameters soil water retention characteristic curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity are described using the brooks and corey 1966 and mualem and dagan 1978 equations respectively soil saturated water content θs field capacity θfc wilting water content θwp and residual water content θr were experimentally measured and are listed in table 2 for subsequent use in the calculation of hydraulic parameters by using the methods by rawls et al 1982 and ma et al 2009 2 λ ln θ fc θ r θ wp θ r ln 15000 333 3 h b exp ln θ fc θ r ln θ s θ r λ ln 333 λ where λ and hb are the parameters of brooks corey equation representing the shape coefficient and air entry value respectively 2 6 2 crop parameters the default crop parameters for crop modeling were based on the study of driessen and konjin 1992 and li et al 2015 whereas the partition coefficients and maximum photosynthetic were calibrated to correspond to the measured values of dry mass and lai the crop parameters are shown in table 3 2 7 model performance criteria the following three statistical indices were applied to evaluate the model performance root mean square error rmse 4 rmse i 1 n s i o i 2 n index of agreement ia willmott 1982 5 ia 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 6 nse 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where n is the number of samples si and oi are the simulated and the measured values respectively and o is mean of the measured data the rmse describes the average absolute deviation between simulated and measured values the ia is an additional index for the evaluation of modeling performance results ranging from 0 1 the closer ia is to 1 the better the simulation quality similar to the coefficient of determination by contrast nse allows negative values and compares the deviation between the simulated and measured state variables with the variance of the measured values van liew and garbrecht 2003 analyzed many soil water dynamic process models indicating good model performance at nse 0 36 and ia 0 7 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation fig 2 illustrates the measured and simulated soil water content for treatment 2h1y fp only the results of 2h1y fp treatment are shown in the manuscript while the simulation results for the other treatments are provided by supplementary file fig s1 s4 a comparison of the measured and simulated lai and dry matter for all treatments are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively generally the simulated values agreed well with the measured data significant correlation was found between the measured and simulated soil water content crop dry mass lai and yield for all five treatments with correlation coefficients of 0 720 0 957 0 852 and 0 722 respectively table 4 the rmse nse and ia of the simulated soil water content were 0 048 cm3 cm 3 0 423 and 0 847 respectively table 4 for crop growth simulation the rmse of lai dry mass and yield were 1 4 m2 m 2 1764 kg ha 1 and 954 kg ha 1 respectively nse 0 4 and ia 0 8 for all cropping systems indicated that the model had a good performance on crop growth simulation van liew and garbrecht 2003 3 2 net water use the simulated water balances across the 1 2 m of soil profile along with wue under different cropping systems are summarized in table 5 precipitation was not enough to meet the water demand of crop growth for the three cropping systems in this region groundwater was pumped to the irrigation due to the lack of access to the rivers the amounts of irrigation water significantly differed across different cropping systems in different years ranging from 300 to 432 225 357 120 243 120 197 and 0 120 mm for 2h1y fp 2h1y wq 2h1y ri 3h2y and 1h1y respectively water consumption comprises actual evapotranspiration eta and drainage dra 2h1y had the highest eta among the three cropping systems with an average value for 2h1y 3h2y and 1h1y of 643 556 and 482 mm respectively table 5 eta and dra increased with increased the amount of irrigation for cropping system 2h1y eta and dra for the treatments can be arranged as follows 2h1y fp 2h1y wq 2h1y ri the crop yields under the three different water management practices for 2h1y cropping system showed no significant difference with an average value of 14 763 kg ha 1 yr 1 but it was significantly higher than those of 3h2y 12 081 kg ha 1 yr 1 and 1h1y 7915 kg ha 1 yr 1 table 5 a high crop yield increased the wue for 2h1y 2 30 kg m 3 compared with 3h2y 2 17 kg m 3 and 1h1y 1 64 kg m 3 the wue under different water managements for 2h1y was mainly affected by eta which can be arranged as follows 2h1y ri 2h1y wq 2h1y pf given that the irrigation water was extracted from groundwater the item of irrigation minus dra in table 5 represents the net water use nwu the range of nwu for 2h1y fp 2h1y wq 2h1y ri 3h2y and 1h1y was 113 393 62 337 3 236 20 190 51 113 mm respectively table 5 the positive value for 2h1y fp 2h1y wq and 2h1y ri cropping systems indicated the net groundwater consumption although the value of nwu was negative 20 mm for 3h2y in 2006 it was also difficult to prevent groundwater level decline in the long timescale nevertheless nwu was negative in two years for the 1h1y cropping system which could be the alternative choice only when the economic benefit is not the first option 3 3 groundwater levels simulation it is important to validate the simulated nwu by comparing the predicted and measured groundwater levels yang et al 2015a in this study the validated whcns model was applied to simulate the annual nwu under different cropping systems from 1999 to 2008 the values were expressed as the groundwater level decline by using the method described in section 2 4 considering that the cropping system crop varieties and irrigation practices were almost unchanged from 1999 to 2008 so the recent ten years were selected to validate the predicted dynamics of the groundwater levels in the study fig 5 a shows that the measured groundwater level started to decline nearly from 1995 at the beginning of the intensive double cropping system was recommended in the ncp wu et al 2002 the predicted decreasing trend of groundwater levels under the 2h1y fp cropping system matched well with the measured values fig 5a it indicated that the annual nwu was simulated by whcns model was considered as acceptable therefore the model can be used to predict the groundwater level decline under different cropping systems the simulated groundwater levels under different cropping systems are shown in fig 5a the decline rates of the 2h1y wq 2h1y ri 3h2y 1h1y spm and 1h1y sm were 0 25 0 22 0 10 0 01 and 0 07 m yr 1 respectively fig 5a among different cropping systems the groundwater levels of 2h1y fp decreased faster than those other cropping systems at a decline rate of 0 33 m yr 1 for different water management practices under the 2h1y system the groundwater table decreased fast even for the reduced water input treatment 2h1y ri suggested that groundwater level could not prevent the decline without changing the current system the annual nwu changes with different weather conditions and different cropping systems are illustrated in fig 5b the average annual nwus for different cropping systems ranged from 44 to 180 mm yr 1 and nwu had a close relationship with the annual yield the average annual yields were 15 853 14 953 13 547 10 905 8 856 and 8178 kg ha 1 for 2h1y fp 2h1y wq 2h1y ri 3h2y 1h1y spm and 1h1y sm respectively fig 5c the mean annual crop yields will be reduced by 26 2 40 1 and 44 7 when cropping systems are changed from 2h1y to 3h2y 1h1y spm and 1h1y sm respectively 3 4 scenario analysis figs 6 a and 6b show the simulated results of scenario 1 which reduce winter wheat planting area to prevent groundwater level decline with the decrease in winter wheat planting area the decline rate of groundwater level slows down fig 6a groundwater levels stopped falling when the winter wheat planting area was decreased by approximately 76 for the 2h1y ri system a larger un planting area was required for the patterns of 2h1y fp and 2h1y wq fig 6b the appropriate water management mitigated the decline in groundwater level to a certain extent moreover with reduced winter wheat planting area wheat yields are also reduced by more than 76 at scenario 1 table 6 except for reducing the wheat planting area scenario 2 tried to explore an appropriate fallow cultivation pattern fig 6c shows that the average rates of groundwater decline for 2h1y ri under different fallow patterns of cp 3p1f 2p1f and 1p1f were 0 22 0 13 0 08 and 0 01 m yr 1 respectively the 1p1f cropping system was also a good method to maintain sustainable groundwater resource but resulted in markedly decreasing of the annual crop yield from 13 547 to 6834 kg ha 1 the groundwater levels of 2h1y fp and 2h1y wq maintained a slight decline rate under the fallow patterns 1p1f whereas 2h1y ri can realize groundwater neutral fig 6d it indicated that the improved water management practice had a benefit to adopting fallow season both scenario 1 and scenario 2 maintained the groundwater level by converting the current cropping systems however the external water inputs were ignored for scenario 3 with increasing β value from 0 to 1 the status of groundwater level was changed from a declining to an increasing trend the change in groundwater levels was close to zero when the βvalue increased to 0 5 and 0 6 for 2h1y ri and 2h1y wq respectively fig 6e and 6f this finding indicated that snwt needs to provide at least 50 of the total amount of irrigation water under the current cropping system to prevent the decline in groundwater level while maintaining the current crop yield table 6 lists the results of the economic analysis of different groundwater neutral cropping systems the neutral cropping systems included three scenarios for 2h1y ri scenario 1 scenario 2 and scenario 3 and two 1h1y systems spm and sm which were described in section 3 2 the income of maize and wheat was calculated by multiplying the yield by the price considering that the irrigation water was directly pumped from the wells for scenario 1 scenario 2 1h1y spm and 1h1y sm farmers need to pay for approximately 0 8 per cubic meter for the groundwater the production costs listed in table 6 is the annual cost of labor and field practices for the different cropping systems including sowing fertilization and machine yang et al 2015 an increased intensification corresponds to an increased production cost as shown in table 6 the average annual net income was 13 780 9 923 12 328 and 11 040 ha 1 yr 1 for scenario 1 scenario 2 1h1y spm and 1h1y sm respectively table 6 scenario 1 had the highest economic income without access to the external water resources however the net income for scenario 3 had a close relationship with water price the price of non residential water from the snwt project increased to 9 0 m 3 in the latest local government work report the government of hebei province 2017 considering the annual fluctuation in snwt water price we calculated the annual net incomes of scenario 3 under different water prices and listed in table 6 the average annual net income for scenario 3 decreased from 17 478 to 8678 ha 1 yr 1 due to the increase in water price from 4 to 14 m 3 the annual net income of scenario 3 13 958 ha 1 yr 1 was very close to that of scenario 1 when the water price is approximately 8 m 3 the annual net income of 2h1y spm 12 328 ha 1 and 2h1y sum 11 040 ha 1 cropping systems were relatively low compared with that of scenario 1 13 780 ha 1 it indicated that the secenario 3 system had a better economic benefit than scenario 1 only when the water price is less than 8 m 3 4 discussions in this study we explored options to achieve food security and groundwater sustainability in the ncp our simulations indicated that reducing the winter wheat planting area adopting fallow season and using external water from swnt project could be effective measures to mitigate the decline in groundwater level while maintaining high yield in the ncp however the targets for optimization should be considered below we discussed the feasibility of these measures to stop the decline in groundwater level and analyzed the economic costs to make the groundwater level neutral while maintaining a relatively high income the discussion only focused on cereal yield due to the importance of cereals in china other cash crops such as vegetables and fruits were not considered in this study 4 1 effect of water regimes on wue and crop yield optimizing the water input can effectively improve wue and crop yield sun et al 2011 li et al 2015 in this study the annual et decreased from 723 to 599 mm yr 1 upon reducing the irrigation rate from 432 to 120 mm yr 1 among the 2h1y systems the 2h1y ri had the lowest annual et with a relatively high annual crop yield 14 085 kg ha 1 which made its wue the highest our findings agree with those of many previous studies for example li et al 2015 found that the wue of optimal irrigation practice was approximately 2 2 kg m 3 which was significantly higher than that of farmer practices 1 8 kg m 3 sun et al 2011 reported that the annual wue of four different cropping systems in the ncp ranged between 1 3 1 9 kg m 3 depending on water inputs soil type and climates in this study the wue of 2h1y ri 2 4 kg m 3 was higher than that of 2h1y fp 2 2 kg m 3 and 2h1y wq 2 3 kg m 3 the optimized water management practices usually maintained the crop yield while reducing et yang et al 2015a reported that the et for the double cropping system ranged from 641 to 808 mm yr 1 at an irrigation rate of 330 mm yr 1 in the luancheng county of the ncp van oort et al 2016 reported a decrease in et from 790 to 548 mm yr 1 when the irrigation rate changed from 345 to 44 mm yr 1 in the xinji county of the ncp these findings indicate that the improved water regime may enhance the wue and crop yield to a certain extent however according to our simulations it remains difficult to stop the decline in groundwater levels by utilizing these options 4 2 decline in groundwater level and crop yield under different cropping systems the 2h1y cropping system of ww sm makes full use of light and heat resources in the region however nearly two thirds of precipitation occurred during the summer june august in the ncp which is not synchronized with winter wheat growth qin et al 2015 sun et al 2015 some studies proposed that irrigation in the summer maize season was not necessary whereas approximately 300 mm was necessary for winter wheat sun et al 2011 sun et al 2015 analyzed the crop irrigation water requirements under different precipitation patterns in the ncp the results illustrated that precipitation pattern was a key factor affecting the wue irrigation was not necessary for maize growth but at least 247 mm of irrigation water was required for maintaining winter wheat growth in this study the nwu for 2h1y was significantly larger than that of 3h2y and 1h1y which was mainly caused by more water consumption for winter wheat the nwu values of were expressed as groundwater level dynamics indicating the effect of cropping systems on groundwater levels yang et al 2015a b yang et al 2015a applied this method to simulate the groundwater levels dynamics under different cropping systems and the results showed that the fastest decline occurred under the current 2h1y system with a rate of approximately 1 m yr 1 this phenomenon was also found in this study the decline rate of 1h1y spm was larger than that of 1h1y sm usually the sowing and harvesting dates of summer maize are mid june and early october respectively whereas spring maize is sown at late april and harvested at early october van oort et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 spring maize had a longer growth period and larger biomass than those of summer maize in the ncp hence the nwu for 1h1y spm was higher than that of 1h1y sm sun et al 2011 reported that only the 1h1y system had the potential to maintain the groundwater levels in the ncp but the annual crop yield was greatly reduced van oort et al 2016 reported that the total crop yield would decrease by 44 compared with the current pattern if make the groundwater sustainably in the long timescale in the ncp xiao et al 2017 demonstrated that the 1h1y system prevented the decline in groundwater level in the luancheng county in the ncp but decreased 50 4 of crop yield compared with the current 2h1y system these findings were close to our results 4 3 developing groundwater neutral cropping systems recently van oort et al 2016 explored various groundwater neutral cropping systems based on the current 2h1y system by using the apsim model and showed that the groundwater neutral total grain yield per year was lower than 9300 kg ha 1 in the ncp with grain yield reduction of 44 compared with the current 2h1y system these designed cropping systems were mainly implemented by changing the crop sequence and irrigation practice in our study a relatively high crop yield of 9909 kg ha 1 table 6 could be achieved through by reducing 76 of wheat planting area suggesting its potential way to keep groundwater neutral in addition the production costs were markedly decreased moreover the production costs were reduced from 5790 to 3761 ha 1 as the decrease of wheat planting area table 6 actually reducing the wheat planting area has been encouraged by the government in recent years some pilot projects setup in 15 provinces in china ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china 2018 hence reducing the wheat planting area is a good way to develop the groundwater neutral cropping systems in the ncp among all the groundwater neutral systems the scenario 3 2h1y ri had the best economic benefit for farmers when the water price is less than 8 m 3 table 6 the first phase of snwt project was finished in 2014 and the total volume of water that is projected to be transferred into the ncp is 7 0 7 5 billion m3 yr 1 including approximately 1 2 billion m3 yr 1 into beijing approximately 1 0 billion m3 yr 1 into tianjin and approximately 3 0 billion m3 yr 1 into the hebei province yang et al 2010 cao et al 2013 considering there the 0 21 million km2 of cropland in the ncp snwt water only meet a small proportion of the agricultural water demand the maximum amount of irrigation water was approximately 35 mm per year with the application of all snwt in the agricultural irrigation however at least 88 mm irrigation water was needed for 2h1y ri to prevent groundwater further decline according to the simulations moreover the snwt water mainly provides for the urban domestic water use the distribution of snwt water use among different sectors is also a problem zheng et al 2010 cao et al 2013 this study focused on optimizing the current cropping system however other water saving technologies were not included sun et al 2012 proposed that plastic film and concrete mulching were more efficient to enhance the wue without yield loss than straw mulching liu et al 2013 suggested that the traditional surface irrigation should be replaced by sprinkler irrigation for winter wheat cultivation in the ncp these methods need further studies in addition a simple method was adopted to predict the dynamics in groundwater levels in this study which ignored the possible lateral recharge from the reservoirs or the taihang mountain the whcns model could be coupled with groundwater models mike she modflow etc to analyze the response of the regional groundwater levels to various cropping systems in the future styczen and storm 1993 xu et al 2012 moreover the spatial variation of soil properties weather condition different crop rotations and field management practices were not included in this study the effects of different groundwater neutral systems on regional food production and the allocation of water resources must be further explored 5 conclusions in this study we explored the options for sustaining groundwater and food security in the ncp the most important cereal production base of china the results showed that the whcns model performed well in modeling soil water content lai dry matter and crop yield under different cropping systems with the nse 0 4 and ia 0 8 the predicted groundwater levels also coincided with the observed data these results indicated that the whcns model coupled with simple methods can predict the decline in groundwater in the ncp the methods can be applied to other aquifers after validation the simulated results indicate that both 2h1y and 3h2y cropping systems had negative nwu values which lead to the decline in groundwater level for different water levels the reduced water input cropping system 2h1y ri had the highest wue with a relatively high grain yield three scenarios were explored to prevent the decline in groundwater level in the ncp the first scenario made the groundwater level neutral by reducing 76 of the winter wheat planting area however the annual crop yield may be reduced by 27 from 13 547 to 9909 kg ha 1 second fallow was adopt to sustain the groundwater level but resulted in 50 yield reduction from 13 547 to 6834 kg ha 1 for the last scenario the snwt project needs to provide at least 50 of the total amount of irrigation 130 mm yr 1 water to prevent the decline in groundwater level while maintaining the current crop yield under the 2h1y system however the last option can only be feasible if the water price was less than 8 m 3 our results suggest that reducing the winter wheat planting area especially for the low yield cropland may be a good option to prevent further decline in the groundwater level while ensuring food security and the income of millions of local farmers

11217,the application of animal manure in agricultural production is common around the world nevertheless the effects of surface applied liquid manures on soil properties are not well investigated the purpose of this research was to use x ray computed tomography to assess near soil surface porosity and to evaluate the thickness of the sealing caused by physical and chemical mechanisms after liquid dairy manure ldm application in clayey and sandy clay loam soils the treatments included application of ldm with 4 3 total solids to determine physical and chemical mechanisms and application of ldm with 0 total solids filtered to determine the chemical mechanism of surface sealing image analysis obtained by x ray microtomography was performed before ldm application and 24 h and 7 days after ldm application porosity was quantified for each 1 mm layer of the soil soil porosity was reduced mainly in the first 5 mm of depth and this reduction was more distinct in the first 1 mm layer independent

radiogram was created for each image the distances between source object camera were adjusted to produce images with a pixel size of 12 89 μm the rotation step was 0 4 over 360 and it took approximately 3 h to complete a scan the acquisition of tomographic images cross sections was performed in two stages the first stage consisted of the acquisition of images in various angular projections of the sample along a rotation of 360 with accurate rotational steps the second stage was the reconstruction of images of cross sections from the images of the angled projections through the feldkamp cone beam volumetric reconstruction algorithm all images in this work had a resolution of 12 89 μm after obtaining the reconstructed density data from micro ct images were processed for further analysis first the images were filtered to reduce noise and then segmented to pores solid and manure phases which enabled quantitative investigations of the pores the tomographic sections were converted to grey scales and through the binarization process it was possible to separate phases of different densities in which the number of distinguishable grey shades could vary from 0 to 255 in segmentation grey scale histograms were used to manually select the threshold grey scale values to distinguish the manure phase in the image it was used the grey scale 50 to 255 grey scale lower than

first 1 mm layer in the treatments before application of ldm and 24 h and 7 days after application of ldm with 4 3 total solids to clayey soil fig 1a and sandy clay loam soil fig 1b in the clayey soil fig 1a the total volume of the first 1 mm layer was 1931 mm3 and the pore volumes were 1283 mm3 66 4 954 mm3 49 3 and 1228 mm3 63 5 for the treatments before ldm 24 h and 7 days after ldm application respectively the pore volumes occupied by ldm particles were 330 86 mm3 26 and 55 29 mm3 4 3 for 24 h and 7 days after manure application for the sandy clay loam soil fig 1b the pore volume filled with ldm was similar to that of clayey soil about 25 in the 24 h and 7 4 in the 7 days after ldm application samples when analysing the change of porosity at a depth of 10 mm fig 2 we observed a significantly greater change in the first 2 mm from data collected 24 h after ldm application in both soils the decrease in porosity when comparing the before ldm and the 24 h after ldm data was around 25 and 20 in the first and second mm respectively at a depth of 3 5 mm the decrease in porosity was around 11 and the decrease was less than 5 below a depth of 5 mm the porosity 7 days after ldm application decreased by less than 7 in all depths in both soils when compared with the treatment before ldm application comparing the manured treatments the porosity of the soil 7 days after ldm application was greater than the porosity 24 h after manure application especially in the first 2 mm fig 2 3 2 chemical mechanism of surface sealing application of ldm with 0 total solids fig 3 illustrates the changes in the 1 mm layer in the treatments before ldm application 24 h and 7 days after ldm application with 0 total solids applied to the clayey soil fig 3a and the sandy clay loam soil fig 3b for the clayey soil the total volume of the first mm was 1606 mm3 and the pore volume was of 23 8 22 6 and 23 0 for the treatments before ldm application 24 h and 7 days after ldm application respectively in sandy clay loam soil the pore volume was 18 5 17 6 and 17 5 for before ldm application 24 h and 7 days after ldm application respectively the change of soil porosity with ldm application without solids was similar in both soils the decrease in porosity in the first mm after manure application as compared to before ldm application was 5 1 at 24 h and 3 5 at 7 days after ldm application for the clayey soil and 4 5 and 5 1 for the sandy clay loam changes in porosity in the clayey soil after ldm application without solids i e chemical sealing mechanism were less than 5 in the first 3 mm for 24 h and 7 days after the ldm treatments there were no detectable changes in soil porosity beyond a depth of 3 mm in the clayey soil fig 4 a in the sandy clay loam soil fig 4b changes in porosity by chemical mechanisms were observed in all depths and the decrease of porosity was less than 6 for 24 h and 7 days after ldm application 4 discussion previous studies have shown that liquid manure application to soil surfaces decreased water infiltration and increased runoff cherobim et al 2017 2015 roberts and clanton 2000 but the underlying mechanisms inducing surface sealing were not fully elucidated in this study we measured volumetric soil porosity in each 1 mm layer up to a soil depth of 10 mm to understand the mechanisms governing soil surface sealing after liquid manure application the results indicate that the application of ldm 4 3 solids caused soil surface sealing clogging the pores by fine particles and modifying soil porosity mainly in the first 5 mm of depth with greater differences at in the first mm independent of the soil texture figs 1 and 2 armenise et al 2018 studying soil seal formation under simulated rainfall detected seal thickness values from 0 6 to 5 4 mm a greater contribution of physical mechanisms acting on the sealing process is expected due to the clogging of pores by suspended organic particles and by the high viscosity of the liquid manure barrington et al 1987 detar 1979 most clogging occurred in the treatment of 24 h after ldm application seven days after ldm application pore clogging was decreased indicating the importance of having an interval between ldm application and the following rainfall event to minimise the effect of surface sealing and to avoid problems with reduced water infiltration cherobim et al 2018 working with the same soils described in this study observed that the sealing index at 24 h after ldm application compared with 7 days after ldm 9 4 total solids was 91 greater in clayey soil and 77 in sandy clay loam soil the recovery in porosity values close to before ldm application with 7 days after manure application can be explained by the drying process of the manure chang et al 1974 edwards and daniel 1993 cherobim et al 2018 working with re saturated soil samples 7 days after manure application obtained the hydraulic conductivity very similar to the treatment before ldm application which means that the dehydration of manure causes a long term benefit on recovering the initial soil porosity the saturated hydraulic conductivity 24 h after ldm application was much lower than that 7 days after ldm one explanation could be that during the drying process the organic particles will migrate to the inner pores which improve the organo mineral complex the negative surface charges on the organic compounds are attracted electrostatically by the positive charges of the minerals of the clay fraction mainly by fe feoh2 and al aloh2 oxides the formation of polar covalent bonds between the organic carboxylic or phenolic functional groups and the fe and al oxides mainly in the inner sphere complex coward et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 wagai et al 2013 can be strong enough and do not allow the manure organic particles to fill again the pores with the re saturation such a recovery may also be affected by biological activities that promote degradation of volatile solids more biodegradable than other solids present in the solid content of the liquid manure zhang and westerman 1997 the changes in soil porosity after the application of ldm without solids filtered manure were small figs 3 and 4 this indicates that the isolated effect of the chemical mechanism clay dispersion was not strong enough to cause potential soil surface sealing however the action of the chemical mechanism in the sealing process may still be important and depends on the soil type ph and the content of dispersing elements in the manure barrington et al 1987 we expected some degree of chemical sealing after ldm treatment without solids due to the high ph values and the presence of dispersing elements in the manure i e na and k table 2 data obtained after 24 h and 7 days overlap supporting the interpretation of dispersion as the mechanism of surface sealing since the drying process dehydration over 7 days would not cause changes in soil porosity the na and k ions due their low valence promote a distension of the diffuse double layer of the ions adsorbed at the negative electrical charges cation exchange capacity of the soil colloids resulting in repellency between adjacent clay particles and humic compounds therefore the soil colloids remain dispersed and may move through the soil clogging the pore spaces and promoting surface sealing bradford and torkzaban 2008 irvine and reid 2001 in addition to the dispersing elements liquid manures non humified organic matter contain large amounts of carboxyls per atom of carbon 17 2 22 7 r coo cooh mmol g 1 c ohno et al 2007 therefore application of manure to the soil increase the superficial negative charge increasing clay dispersion and reducing soil aggregation benites and mendonça 1998 tavares filho et al 2010 barbosa et al 2015 conducted a study with aggregation and clay dispersion of an oxisol treated with swine manure and found that manure application modified dispersible clay contents and aggregation processes they observed that after manure application the dispersible clay content was increased and maximum dispersion was observed 15 days after application the long term effect 7 days may be important because the soluble organic compounds may feed native microbial populations and cause biological sealing armenise et al 2018 also the slaking process by adding liquid manure to air dried soil samples could decrement soil porosity due to the disintegration of aggregates bradford and huang 1992 our results indicate that the chemical change in porosity clay dispersion was relatively small when compared to the physical change clogging pores by organic particles from manure overall the decrease in soil porosity by ldm application 24 h after the application in the first mm of the soil was 80 due to physical and 20 due to chemical mechanisms 5 conclusions soil sealing promoted by liquid dairy manure application was predominant in the first mm of the soil layer and occurred to a depth of over 5 mm at 24 h after ldm 4 3 solids application in clayey and sandy clay loam soils the sealing was about 4 times greater at 24 h than at 7 days after ldm application and was caused mainly by physical mechanisms 80 due to the clogging of pores by organic particles from the manure around 25 of the pore volume of the first mm were occupied by ldm particles at 24 h after manure application soil surface sealing by chemical mechanisms due clay dispersion was present but was relatively smaller compared to physical sealing processes the decrease in porosity after ldm application without solids was around 5 computed tomography was an effective method to evaluate porosity changes and soil sealing surface processes caused by liquid dairy manure application

bonds between the organic carboxylic or phenolic functional groups and the fe and al oxides mainly in the inner sphere complex coward et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 wagai et al 2013 can be strong enough and do not allow the manure organic particles to fill again the pores with the re saturation such a recovery may also be affected by biological activities that promote degradation of volatile solids more biodegradable than other solids present in the solid content of the liquid manure zhang and westerman 1997 the changes in soil porosity after the application of ldm without solids filtered manure were small figs 3 and 4 this indicates that the isolated effect of the chemical mechanism clay dispersion was not strong enough to cause potential soil surface sealing however the action of the chemical mechanism in the sealing process may still be important and depends on the soil type ph and the content of dispersing elements in the manure barrington et al 1987 we expected some degree of chemical sealing after ldm treatment without solids due to the high ph values and the presence of dispersing elements in the manure i e na and k table 2 data obtained after 24 h and 7 days overlap supporting the interpretation of dispersion as the mechanism of surface sealing since the drying process dehydration over 7 days would not cause changes in soil porosity the na and k ions due their low valence promote a distension of the diffuse double layer of the ions adsorbed at the negative electrical charges cation exchange capacity of the soil colloids resulting in repellency between adjacent clay particles and humic compounds therefore the soil colloids remain dispersed and may move through the soil clogging the pore spaces and promoting surface sealing bradford and torkzaban 2008 irvine and reid 2001 in addition to the dispersing elements liquid manures non humified organic matter contain large amounts of carboxyls per atom of carbon 17 2 22 7 r coo cooh mmol g 1 c ohno et al 2007 therefore application of manure to the soil increase the superficial negative charge increasing clay dispersion and reducing soil aggregation benites and mendonça 1998 tavares filho et al 2010 barbosa et al 2015 conducted a study with aggregation and clay dispersion of an oxisol treated with swine manure and found that manure application modified dispersible clay contents and aggregation processes they observed that after manure application the dispersible clay content was increased and maximum dispersion was observed 15 days after application the long term effect 7 days may be important because the soluble organic compounds may feed native microbial populations and cause biological sealing armenise et al 2018 also the slaking process by adding liquid manure to air dried soil samples could decrement soil porosity due to the disintegration of aggregates bradford and huang 1992 our results indicate that the chemical change in porosity clay dispersion was relatively small when compared to the physical change clogging pores by organic particles from manure overall the decrease in soil porosity by ldm application 24 h after the application in the first mm of the soil was 80 due to physical and 20 due to chemical mechanisms 5 conclusions soil sealing promoted by liquid dairy manure application was predominant in the first mm of the soil layer and occurred to a depth of over 5 mm at 24 h after ldm 4 3 solids application in clayey and sandy clay loam soils the sealing was about 4 times greater at 24 h than at 7 days after ldm application and was caused mainly by physical mechanisms 80 due to the clogging of pores by organic particles from the manure around 25 of the pore volume of the first mm were occupied by ldm particles at 24 h after manure application soil surface sealing by chemical mechanisms due clay dispersion was present but was relatively smaller compared to physical sealing processes the decrease in porosity after ldm application without solids was around 5 computed tomography was an effective method to evaluate porosity changes and soil sealing surface processes caused by liquid dairy manure application

growth and physiological activity of olive can be temporary or permanent and may impact olive production sustainability especially in southern mediterranean areas tunisia has a mediterranean climate with high temperatures and low summer rainfall thus water stress problems are likely to be more severe for cultivated olive trees in addition the reduction in the availability of good quality irrigation water will increase the use of saline water olive trees are able to tolerate low soil water availability and quality and develop physiological adaptations to cope with water and salt stress however these adaptation strategies are limited and permanent damages can be observed the permanent effects caused to olive leaves due to drought and the capacity of irrigation with saline water to avoid these impacts is not well known the aim of this work was to compare olive leaves performance after a severe drought with and without irrigation and to assess recovering capacities after a rainy period moreover irrigation water quality effects were also evaluated the results showed that photosynthetic rate was very low for rainfed plants during drought as compared to irrigated ones after re watering rainfed trees photosynthetic rate was only 55 of that of trees irrigated with fresh water irrigation with saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 reduced drought impact by increasing photosynthesis by 55 but remained lower than that of fresh water by 23 thus olive leaves were unable to recover their whole photosynthetic capacity after being exposed to severe water or salt stress furthermore young leaves had the same photosynthetic capacity at the beginning this indicated that olive leaves lost permanently half of their photosynthetic activity during to drought without irrigation the use of saline water reduced this gap to 23 as compared to fresh water keywords olea europaea drought rainy period photosynthesis olive water status olive recovery capacity 1 introduction the mediterranean basin is the largest area in the world having specific climatic conditions suitable for olive cultivation however this region is likely to face severe impacts due to climate change tanasijevica et al 2014 the mediterranean region is expected to have an overall reduction of annual precipitation of 39 1 55 1 mm and an increase of air temperature of 1 57 0 27 c from 0 84 to 2 31 c inducing an increase of annual reference evapotranspiration of 92 3 42 1 mm gargouri et al 2010 saadi et al 2015 the agricultural production has to adapt to this situation for sustainability ghrab et al 2008 water shortage is known to induce many physiological changes in plants aref et al 2013 indeed the phenological stages of vegetative growth flowering and fruit production are highly sensitive to water deficit moriana et al 2003 2012 ghrab et al 2005 2013 fernandez 2013 furthermore drought involves alterations of morphological and anatomical characteristics at the leaf level it has been reported that water stress frequently decreased leaf water status inducing low leaf water potential and relative water content this effect depends mainly on plant species and water stress severity aref et al 2013 the olive tolerates severe drought conditions with a series of adaptation mechanisms chartzoulakis et al 1999 these adjustments lead to changes in leaf water status and stomatal closure resulting in a reduction in photosynthetic rate hence the leaf water status affects the efficacy of photosystem ii psii activity and consequently the limitation of photosynthesis fini et al 2013 loreto et al 2003 and centritto et al 2003 perceived that the reduction of photosynthesis could potentially be due to a decrease in both stomatal and mesophyll conductance stomatal control is the major physiological factor in the optimization of water use in drought conditions giorio et al 1999 yordanov et al 2003 lefi et al 2004 zlatev and yordanov 2004 ben hamed et al 2016 fernandez et al 1997 and moriana et al 2002 noticed that olive trees can reduce excessive water loss by closing their stomata consequently the storage and diffusion of co2 into the leaf is limited flexas et al 2006 biochemically reduction of functional rubisco or to inhibition of functional activity of psii may limit photosynthesis lawlor and cornic 2002 changes in leaf anatomical characteristics are known to alter the co2 conductance diffusion components from the substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation and thus contribute to the maintenance of photosynthetic rates even with the low stomatal conductance chartzoulakis et al 1999 evans and loreto 2000 thus climate change will result in an increase of irrigation demand masmoudi et al 2010 in these areas agriculture faces enhanced land and water resources degradation over extraction of groundwater soil salinization and erosion ghrab et al 2008 this is mainly due to the development of intensive orchard using poor water quality abdel latef and chaoxing 2014 indeed olive is considered a moderately saline tolerant species due to scarce fresh water resources in the mediterranean basin irrigation with saline water ec 5 10 ds m 1 is often practiced nevertheless early rainfalls allow the removal of accumulated salinity from the root zone which allows plant growth ghrab et al 2013 salinity affects shoot growth and number of flowers and fruits while the effects on yield depend on the salt concentration ghrab et al 2013 olive trees use several mechanisms of tolerance to salt accumulation salt tolerance is related to the capacity of olive to accumulate salt in the leaf vacuoles or to the control of net salt import to the shoot chartzoulakis et al 2002 ghrab et al 2013 salt stressed olive plants faces a reduction in mesophyll conductance to co2 diffusion this phenomenon is as rapid and reversible as for stomatal conductance moreover the decrease of chloroplast co2 content due to low stomatal and mesophyll conductance reduces photosynthesis a process called diffusional limitations under water stress the potential to recover are a crucial component of a plant s response miyashita et al 2005 indeed the recovery capacity determines plant establishment in the future many researchers have asserted that after re watering olive recovers normal water status with leaf water potential and stomatal conductance similar to those of irrigated trees fernandez et al 1997 trentacoste et al 2018 conversely stomatal conductance exhibited the slowest recovery while the mechanism is not well known it has been linked to lower leaf water potential brodribb and cochard 2009 and to the accumulation of abscisic acid aba during water withholding which stands against stomatal conductance recovery lovisolo et al 2008 photosynthesis recovery depends on the rate and degree of photosynthesis inhibition during water shortage and also on plant species involved flexas et al 2009 it varies from rapid and complete recovery under moderate stress to depressed or never complete after severe stress chaves et al 2009 although olive tree response to water and salt stresses was widely studied the impacts of long drought in field conditions with regards to temporary and permanent damages on leaf photosynthetic activity quantification and capacity of irrigation with saline water ec 7 5 dsm 1 to alleviate them were not assessed these damages are likely to reduce plant growth and production potential tunisia is among countries with limited water resources an irrigation experiment was conducted in sfax region southern tunisia to evaluate the combined effect of drought and irrigation with saline water on olive trees previous researches in the same experimental field than this work were carried since 2003 leaded to evaluate deficit irrigation approaches with the use of saline water 6 7 ds m 1 its impacts on olive tree and adaptation mechanisms mainly physiological ones ghrab et al 2005 2013 and 2014 three irrigation treatments i control full irrigated ii dry rain fed and iii prd partial root zone drying were applied in addition prd was composed of two treatments prd30 and prd15 which received 50 of etc with an alternate irrigation switched every 30 and 15 days respectively ghrab et al 2005 partial root zone drying irrigation technique prd induced a slight reduction in pre dawn and stem water potential with the most important yield reduction was observed for the rainfed dry treatment oil content and quality improve with the increasing deficits for irrigated treatments which resulted in the saving of up to 50 of water requirements ghrab et al 2005 2013 ghrab et al 2013 2014 showed that prd irrigation technique application could be used with low quality of water in sandy deep soil to improve productivity without important accumulation of salts soil texture and mediterranean climatic conditions affected the impact of saline water use management for irrigation the restriction by half 50 of the water supply switched every month between wet and dry root zone caused a slight reduction of tree water status and cumulative yield 11 over the four year period of monitoring soil salinity presented seasonal variations affected by the irrigation water applied in this sandy soil salts were leached during the wet season and salinity of soil was kept to levels that were not harmful to olive trees ghrab et al 2013 2014 nevertheless the efficacy of irrigation with saline water to alleviate drought impacts on olive as compared to fresh water and rainfed conditions was not assessed the actual work was conducted in the same orchard using rainfed and full irrigated 100 etc with saline water treatment ec 7 5 ds m 1 in addition to a new treatment that corresponded to full irrigated with fresh water tap water ec 2 46 ds m 1 it focused on the possible effects of drought and water scarcity on olive tree water status and physiological activity these effects can be temporary or permanent and may impact olive production sustainability especially in southern mediterranean area olive trees are able to develop physiological adaptations to water stress although these adaptation strategies are limited and permanent damages can be observed irrigation can overcome this shortage though the permanent damages caused to olive leaves due to a severe drought and the capacity of irrigation with different water qualities to avoid these damages is not well known in this context this study addresses the issues and impact of water shortage on olive trees by investigating the physiological behavior production and growth parameters of olive tree during and after drought the capacity of olive trees to recover their performance was also evaluated thus the major aim of this work was to test how drought and salinity affected olive tree water status rwc content el and leaf water potential estimation ψl and the evolution of gas exchange parameters such as gs transpiration e and photosynthetic rate pn in addition to leaf chlorophyll pigment content moreover it focused on the assessment of the impacts of severe drought in field conditions on olive tree and the efficacy of irrigation with saline water ec 7 5 dsm 1 to mitigate it finally the recovery capacity of photosynthetic activity after rainy period re watering by 68 8 mm of rain was evaluated for rainfed and saline irrigation as compared to irrigation with saline water for this reason three treatments were installed both of them irrigated with tap ec 2 46 ds m 1 or saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 and the third without irrigation the drought severity and length were estimated using standardized precipitation index the evaluation was based on leaf gas exchange photosynthesis leaf water status rwc and el pigments and shoots growth and production in addition leaf water potential was estimated the objective of this work is to compare olive leave activities after a severe drought with and without irrigation and to assess recovering capacities after a rainy period 68 8 mm in addition efficacy of saline water as compared to fresh water was assessed field experiment was conducted on 25 years old olive trees olea europaea l cv chemlali grown on sandy deep soil this experimental design was installed in 2003 to assess efficacy of deficit irrigation on olive tree ghrab et al 2013 2014 and was modified for the purpose of this work integrating fresh water irrigation and drought assessment the evolution of gas exchange parameters pn e and gs wue chlorophyll chl and plant water status rwc were followed and leaf water potential ψl was estimated at the end of a severe drought period and after re watering for rainfed and fully irrigated trees with tap and saline waters newly sprouted leaves activities were considered as initial situation for every treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and water irrigation approach the experiments were conducted in an orchard at the olive institute in the region of sfax 34 43 n 10 41 e three irrigation treatments were installed in march 2015 and modified an experimental design installed in 2003 ghrab et al 2013 by adding irrigation with fresh water there was no properly re watering treatment was applied but rewatering was done by 68 8 mm rain that filled soil water holding capacity of 5 5 field capacity and wilting point of 8 8 and 3 3 respectively ghrab et al 2013 the region is characterized by an arid climate of mediterranean type sandy deep soil 49 7 sand 7 clay 43 3 silt the mean annual precipitation and reference evapotranspiration eto were 220 and 1383 mm respectively with marked dry summers the orchard was planted with twenty five year old olive trees olea europaea l cv chemlali at 4 m x 4 m spacing 625 trees ha 1 and drip irrigated standard agricultural practices in the region were applied irrigation was supplied by two dripper lines on each row of olive trees located 0 5 m from the trunk using low quality ground water ec 7 5 ds m 1 saline water composition was 1130 mg l na 1112 3 mg l cl 24 mg l k 2 16 mg l nh4 and 40 51 mg l no3 and ph of 7 35 the ground water table depth was below 2 5 m in order to assess the impact of the irrigation with the saline ground water a treatment irrigated with tap water ec 2 46 ds m 1 was added tap water composition was na 367 5 mg l cl 592 07 mg l k 13 mg l nh4 0 504 mg l and no3 2 356 mg l and ph of 8 02 2 1 1 treatments applied and re watering technique the actual experiment design with three irrigation treatments was installed in march 2015 1 rain fed olive trees were grown under rainfed conditions without any irrigation supply 2 fi fully irrigated that applied daily the necessary saline water ec 7 5 dsm 1 to match crop evapotranspiration etc 3 tw fully irrigated that applied daily the necessary tap water ec 2 46 dsm 1 to match crop evapotranspiration etc the drought was evaluated starting end and severity using spi mckee et al 1993 1995 soro et al 2014 basing on that length of drought was determined the end of drought was due to rainfall during a severe drought two treatments were irrigated to cover etc the first one was with saline water fi ec 7 5 ds m 1 and the second was with tap water tw ec 2 46 ds m 1 a third treatment rain fed was installed without irrigation and did not receive other water than rain the amount of received rainfall during a severe drought was very low keeping the soil dry indeed soil water holding capacity was 5 5 when considering a depth of 60 cm the required amount of water to fill this capacity is 429 m3 ha corresponding to 43 mm since october 2015 the receiving rain water was less than the etc leading to soil drying thus during all the severe drought period water was not available in soil at the end of drought september 2016 68 8 mm were received overlapping the climatic demand and filling a part of water holding capacity thus since september 2016 re watering was achieved by natural rainfall 68 8 mm 10 trees were drip irrigated with tap water tw while 10 trees were drip irrigated with saline water ec 7 5 ds m and the third treatment was composed by 10 trees under rain fed conditions and measures were taken after severe drought of 10 months in 16 july 2016 after re watering in 24 october 2016 for adult and young leaves the evolution of gas exchange parameters pn e and gs wue chlorophyll chl and plant water status rwc were followed and leaf water potential ψl was estimated 2 1 2 plant sampling and experimental manipulation field experiment was conducted on 26 years old olive trees olea europaea l cv chemlali grown on sandy deep soil 10 trees were drip irrigated with tap water tw ec 2 46 ds m while 10 others were under rain fed conditions dry and also 10 trees were drip irrigated with saline water fi ec 7 5 ds m measures were taken after severe drought of 10 months in 16 july 2016 and one month after heavy rain of 68 8 mm in 24 october 2016 for adult and young leaves three replications were taken per treatment at each sampling date leaves were taken all around the trees and five shoots for every tree were selected to be similar in potential yield and canopy and considered for the different measurements surveys and quantifying the effect of drought and salinity on the evolution of gas exchange parameters pn e gs wue chlorophyll chl content and plant water status rwc el leaf water potential ψl was estimated using gs one month after rainfall measurements were done on adult leaves and new leaves these later served to assess the leaf capacity before facing stresses 2 1 3 etc determination and water supply reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated with penman monteith equation using daily data from a nearby automatic weather station the seasonal eto values varied from 53 to 165 4 mm with a total of 1382 7 mm table 1 the crop evapotranspiration etc was estimated using fao method applying the crop coefficient kc for olive trees fao 56 allen et al 1998 the monthly etc varied from 48 to 105 mm with frequent warm months effective precipitation ep considered as 80 of total precipitation ranged between 0 and 41 2 mm monthly crop evapotranspiration etc of the olive trees was calculated using the formula etc kc eto where eto is the reference evapotranspiration calculated with the penman monteith equation fao 56 allen et al 1998 and kc is the crop factor with monthly values of 0 45 in july august drought period and 0 65 on october november after rainy period daily weather data recorded at the weather station of the national institute of meteorology inm located about 5 km from the experimental site were used to estimate eto 2 1 4 spi determination the environmental conditions in the study area were characterized by a severe water deficit standardized precipitation index spi was calculated monthly from october 2015 to january 2017 to estimate meteorological drought mckee et al 1993 1995 spi aims to describe the major events of different types of drought observed in our study area table 2 precipitation occurred during autumn and winter seasons when the evaporative demand was low monthly applied irrigation water ia ranged between 11 1 and 75 mm for fi and tw treatments respectively with annual total of 533 7 mm the spi developed by mckee et al 1993 1995 is only based on precipitation data the index has an advantage of being easily calculated having modest data requirements and being independent of the magnitude of mean precipitation and hence it is comparable over a range of climatic zones it is calculated by fitting historical precipitation data one of the significant advantages of this index is that it can be calculated for different timescales to monitor meteorological droughts with respect to severity duration onset extent and end actual research based on the calculation of standardized precipitation index spi on a rainfall time series of 27 years from 1980 to 2017 the main input parameter is the monthly rainfall in mm to provide a more representative month as possible of the variable climatic conditions the spi index is expressed mathematically as the ratio of difference between the annual rainfall of the year i pi and the average rainfall of the series on the timescale considered pm and standard deviation of the series on the timescale considered s soro et al 2014 spi pi pm s 2 2 plants water status relative water content rwc was measured on youngest and fully expanded leaves five leaves per plant of a similar age and position were detached with the petiole three replicate trees were used per each treatment at each sampling date during drought 16 july 2016 and one month after a following rainy period 24 october 2016 leaves were excised before dawn weighed fresh fw and were immediately immersed in distilled water in a glass tube and immediately sealed after 48 h in dim light the leaves were weighted to obtain the turgid weight tw the dry weight dw was then measured after oven drying at 75 c for 48 h and rwc was calculated as described by laouar 1977 rwc fw dw tw dw x 100 2 3 electrolyte leakage el electrolyte leakage el values were measured as described by lutts et al 1996 fresh leaf samples were washed with distilled water to remove surface adhered electrolytes each leaf was cut into nine discs of equal sizes and put into test tubes containing 10 ml distilled water and incubated at room temperature on a rotary shaker for 24 h subsequently the initial electrical conductivity of the medium ec1 was assessed the samples were placed in an oven 90 c for 30 min then they were cooled at 25 c and the second electrical conductivity ec2 was measured electrolyte leakage el was calculated using the following formula el ec1 ec2 x 100 2 4 gas exchange and leaf water potential measurements gas exchange measurements were carried out on youngest and fully expanded leaves often healthy leaves and at the same physiological age the determination of leaf net co2 assimilation rate pn and stomatal conductance gs were determined on three leaves per plant with three replicate trees for each treatments from 9 00 h to 13 h with a lca 4 portable photosynthesis system adc bio scientific ltd hoddes don uk these measurements were made with the following specifications ambient co2 concentration 390 μmol mol 1 average temperature of leaf chamber was 39 2 c average par at leaf surface was 1181 02 μmol m 2 s 1 intrinsic water use efficiency wue was calculated as the ratio of pn over gs maseyk et al 2008 leaf water potential ψl was estimated and reported the average values and standard deviation from relations with stomatal conductance gs according to wahbi et al 2005 guerfel et al 2009 boughalleb and hajlaoui 2010 and masmoudi

determination of chlorophyll and carotenoids concentration for total chlorophyll and carotenoid analyses five leaf discs of fresh leaves of comparable physiological age adult and young were ground in 5 ml of 100 acetone solution using a pestle and a mortar after filtration extracts were adjusted to 20 ml with 100 acetone solution and pigment contents were determined spectrophotometrically according to the method of hartmut and buschmann 1987 2 6 leaf mineral content analyses na cl samples for leaf mineral contents were collected in july 16th 2016 mineral content analyses were carried out on dry leaves obtained after a drying at 70 c until weight stabilization the mineralization of these samples was achieved by incineration at 450 c and dissolution of obtained ash in 1 n nitric acid solution hno3 samples were processed using standard procedures aoac 1990 the sodium na content was measured using the flame emission photometry jenway pfp7 bibby scientific limited staffordshire uk chlorides cl content was determined by titration with 0 1 n silver nitrate agno3 in the presence of potassium dichromate according to a modified colorimetric method of mohr mathieu and pieltain 2003 all the values reported represent the means of at least three replicates and were expressed as percentage of dry weight dw for statistical analysis of data each three average value was considered as a replicate 2 7 shoot growth growth was measured at bud break and then monthly until the end of the growth season pre dormancy stage shoots were tagged at the beginning of the study january 2016 when trees were in dormancy and shoot growth was measured from march to october 2016 growth measurements of current year shoots were made on eight healthy shoots from three trees of each treatment placed at different directions around the canopy the lengths of all apical and axillary shoots were measured 2 8 olive yield yield per tree was measured at harvest on 10 trees per treatment olive fruits were harvested by hand on december 2016 olive yield was recorded and average production was reported in kg tree 2 9 statistical analysis one way anova analysis was applied to examine water availability and quality effects on leaf water status shoot growth and gas exchange using spss 13 0 for windows spss inc chicago il usa significantly different means were separated using the duncan s multiple range test at p 0 05 significance level 3 results the climate at the experimental site is basically an arid mediterranean type characterized by low minimal temperature at the beginning of the crop cycle on average 3 c for january and february 2016 high maximum temperature of about 39 c in summer during olive growth low and irregular rainfall with an accumulated annual value of around 123 7 mm and a high evaporative demand with an accumulated annual evapotranspiration around 1382 7 mm 3 1 drought occurrence spi was used to determine length and severity of drought and calculated in order to distinguish between dry and wet months and the drought occurred when a succession of three dry months was registered ben abdelmalek et al 2016 thus drought conditions are accepted when the spi was below 1 and ended when the spi becomes positive the classes of spi index are subdivided into moderate severe and extreme for both dry and wet periods as shown in table 2 spi indicated a long dry period from october 2015 to august 2016 indeed it ranged between 1 and 0 for nine months indicating moderate drought while the drought was severe for two months on 2015 such as december 1 and march 1 06 table 3 after that dry period september 2016 was classified as moderately wet with spi of 0 63 followed by 68 8 mm of rain a moderately dry month and then one moderately wet november and one extremely wet december 2016 with spi of 2 79 based on these results the drought period was from october 2015 to august 2016 for this reason two periods were identified and were used for physiological records and sampling for biochemical analyses these two periods were beginning of october 2015 to august 2016 that corresponded to the last month of a long drought and the end of october 2016 that corresponded to the end of drought and one month after re watering by 68 8 mm of rainfall in september 2016 3 2 effects of drought on plant water status 3 2 1 relative water content rwc since the leaf relative water content rwc allows determining the actual leaf water retention under unlimited water supply it can indicate water status in plants li et al 2010 the determination of the rwc in leaves of olive plants subjected to the different water treatments showed significant differences p 0 05 during drought between rainfed and irrigated trees independently of water quality fi and tw rainfed trees had significantly lower rwc 66 64 compared to fi 83 08 and tw 80 99 however after rainy period no significant differences were detected between treatments with values ranging between 77 74 and 80 5 for young leaves and 78 27 and 82 25 for mature leaves fig 1 thus rwc was almost the same independently from the type of leaves adult or young 3 2 2 electrolyte leakage el electrolyte leakage is considered as a reliable indicator of the oxidative stress resulting from abiotic constraints ben hamed et al 2012 the measurement of electrolyte leakage in leaves from plants subjected to different treatments showed that el was significantly higher under rain fed conditions during drought 76 96 as compared to fi 62 75 and tw 61 09 with differences between irrigated trees at the same sampling date fig 2 after heavy rainfall 68 8 mm the el decreased for all the treatments however el was significantly higher for rain fed treatment and tw 39 74 and 37 22 as compared to fi 29 82 in mature leaves conversely no significant differences were detected between treatments for leaves sprouted after rainy period and el ranged between 29 82 and 31 20 for all the treatments on the other hand the decrease of el was gradual for tw where highest el value was recorded during drought followed by that recorded in mature leaves after re watering and the lowest was that of young leaves in contrary the el drop was high for rain fed and fi for these treatments the highest values were those of mature leaves during drought and the lowest values were those recorded after receiving 68 8 mm of rain equally for young and mature leaves 3 3 effects of drought and re watering on leaf water potential gas exchange and intrinsic water use efficiency 3 3 1 leaf water potential ψl leaf water potential remained almost constant for mature leaves for every treatment before and after rain table 4 however irrigated treatments had a converse trend for young leaves as compared to rain fed trees indeed young leaves showed lower ψl than mature ones in irrigated conditions while ψl was higher for young leaves in rainfed conditions during the severe drought period ψl of rain fed trees was 4 86 mpa that was significantly lower than that of fi trees 3 8 mpa which was significantly lower than tw 3 48 mpa after re watering by 68 8 mm of rain ψl did not show any significant variation but it decreased slightly for rain fed 4 5 mpa and fi 3 66 mpa rain fed trees had significantly lower ψl than the other treatments young leaves had the same ψl for all the treatments it ranged between 4 02 rain fed and 4 3 mpa tw 3 3 2 leaf gas exchange parameters 3 3 2 1 stomatal conductance gs stomatal conductance gs during a drought period ranged between 8 24 mmol h20 m 2s 1 in rainfed plants and 170 34 mmol h20 m 2s 1 for tw respectively rain fed treatment was significantly lower than fi that was significantly lower than tw after heavy rain of 68 8 mm young and mature leaves showed different behavior in mature leaves rain fed treatment had significantly lowest gs 48 94 mmol h20 m 2s 1 as compared to the irrigated treatments which had gs ranging between 147 7 fi and 158 1 tw mmol h20 m 2s 1 conversely no significant differences were observed between treatments in young leaves for gs that varied between 72 92 mmol h20 m 2s 1 tw and 105 91 mmol h20 m 2s 1 rain fed gs did not show significant differences between drought period and after receiving rain 68 8 mm in mature leaves for all the treatments however young leaves had higher gs for rainfed treatment as compared to mature leaves before and after re watering conversely gs of young leaves was lower than mature leaves for irrigated treatments 3 3 2 2 net photosynthesis rate pn during drought pn was significantly lower as compared to irrigated treatments table 4 indeed pn of rainfed treatment was 3 92 μmol co2 m ²s 1 while it was 15 47 and 19 41 μmol co2 m ²s 1 for fi and tw respectively after receiving 68 8 mm of rain pn increased equally for mature and young leaves in rainfed conditions reaching 10 09 and 12 15 μmol co2 m ²s 1 respectively conversely pn of fi trees did not vary after re watering while it was higher in mature leaves 21 9 μmol co2 m ²s 1 than young leaves 12 46 μmol co2 m ²s 1 for tw moreover in irrigated treatments photosynthetic rate was the same independently of water quality and leaf age irrigation with saline water reduced the drought impact by increasing pn by 60 but remained under that with tw treatment by 20 during severe drought however after rain the improvement of leaf water status was accompanied by 55 recovery capacity of photosynthetic activity for rain fed treatment reaching values of 10 09 μmol co2 m 2s 1 while pn in fi were significantly p 0 05 similar to the irrigated plants with tap water at the same period the relationship between photosynthetic rate pn and stomatal conductance gs fig 3 indicates that all treatments maintained a high pn and high gs during severe drought and after re watering periods 3 3 2 3 transpiration e during drought transpiration was significantly lower for rained treatment 0 61 mmol h2o m 2s 1 compared to irrigated trees however trees irrigated with saline water had lower e 6 08 mmol h2o m 2s 1 than those irrigated with tap water 8 47 mmol h2o m 2s 1 after heavy rain 68 8 mm rainfed mature leaves had significantly lower e than irrigated treatments while no differences were detected for young leaves moreover e decreased after re watering for irrigated treatments and the decrease was marked for young leaves while it increased for rain fed treatment 3 3 3 intrinsic water use efficiency wue the intrinsic water use efficiency exhibited significant differences p 0 05 between rained plants and irrigated ones fi and tw during drought periods during the water stress rainfed trees maintained the highest wue 0 56 μmol co2 mmol h2o during severe drought wue of fi and tw were 90 and 80 respectively higher than rain fed treatment however after heavy rain of 68 8 mm no significant differences p 0 05 were detected between treatments during this period wue ranged between 0 12 and 0 26 μmol co2 mmol h2o 3 3 4 total chlorophyll chl a b and carotenoid contents car significant effects of water status and irrigation method were noticed on leaf total chlorophyll chl a b contents indeed during severe drought period all plants maintained low chlorophyll content which ranged between 0 91 0 87 and 1 24 mg g for rain fed fi and tw treatments respectively with no significant differences p 0 05 fig 4 however after heavy rain of 68 8 mm chlorophyll content increased for all the treatments and ranged between 2 68 4 29 and 3 98 mg g the rain fed plants showed significantly lower increase 66 in chl content compared to irrigated treatments fi and tw no significant effect of salinity on chl content was observed in fi as compared to tw treatments conversely the young leaves of the three treatments had the same chlorophyll content about 4 5 mg g during the severe drought period rain fed and fi trees showed the lowest leaf carotenoid contents ranging between 0 19 and 0 20 mg g fig 5 conversely tw had significantly p 0 05 higher carotenoid content reaching 0 29 mg g no changes were observed after re watering in mature leaves for all the treatments in contrary young leaves exhibited the same carotenoid contents for all the treatments of about 0 29 mg g 3 3 5 leaf mineral content na cl both sodium and chloride concentration increased for fi and in rain fed conditions leaf na concentration was higher during drought for fi 0 7 than tap water 0 21 and rain fed 0 34 fig 6 after rainy period the same trend was observed with the highest na contents for rainfed followed by fi and tw with significant differences between all the treatments and without differences between adult and young leaves fig 6 leaf chloride concentration showed the same trend during and after drought for the three treatments indeed the lowest values were recorded during drought and increased after rain in addition young leaves had higher concentrations than adult ones the lowest values were recorded for tw followed by fi and rainfed treatments 3 3 6 effect of drought and salinity on plant growth development and production the elongation of olive shoots subjected to different water treatments are shown in fig 7 rain fed treatment led to very low shoot growth 0 2 cm and production 5 76 12 4 kg tree during the whole experimentation period as compared to fi and tw treatments saline water irrigation ec 7 5 ds m slowed significantly p 0 05 growth rate during severe drought period as compared to tap water treatment tw however fi induced a significant growth increase as compared to rain fed treatments accompanied with a higher production 16 6 75 kg tree thus irrigation with saline water reduced the drought impact by increasing elongation by 90 but remained lower that with tw by 50 tw had lower production 10 8 6 kg tree than fi a gradual increase of growth was marked in plants irrigated with saline water fi and tap water tw to reach by the end of experimentation 9 03 and 9 7 cm respectively after heavy rain 68 8 mm irrigated trees with saline water had more important growth level similar to tw thus by the end of the experimentation both of the irrigated treatments have the same shoot growth with no significant differences p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 effects of drought and saline water on olive gas exchanges according to the results obtained in this study the analyses of photosynthetic parameters were affected by drought net photosynthesis pn was highly altered in rainfed trees as compared to irrigated ones in fact a significant p 0 05 decrease was recorded in rainfed plants about 3 92 μmol of co2 m 2s 1 this coincided with a decrease in stomatal conductance gs and the lowest values of leaf water potential ψl during the drought period the decrease in stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate due to water stress on is in agreement with other studies which reported a similar reduction in leaf photosynthetic rate with the reduction in leaf stomatal conductance a similar trend has also been reported in pistachio trees abbaspour et al 2012 ben hamed et al 2016 and olive trees cv chemlali guerfel et al 2009 this indicates that stomatal closure is one of the factors limiting co2 uptake under water shortage which was also found by fernandez 2013 in fact the reduction in co2 assimilation in rain fed plants may reduce the leaf mesophyll conductance mesophyll conduction is likely to be reduced due to tissues shrinkage causing morphological modification of intercellular space this can also be due to biochemical or cell membrane alterations therefore the stomatal limitation of photosynthesis through stomatal closure can be considered as a primary event followed by respective changes of the photosynthetic reaction as drought severity intensifies after re watering water stress persistently affected photosynthetic activity indeed the increase of the assimilation rates of rain fed trees after re watering indicated the improvement of intercellular co2 concentration which was associated with a gradual recovery of photosynthetic capacity however this recovery was limited to 55 as compared to fi and tw thus drought caused permanent damages to leaf photosynthetic capacity in addition during drought and even after rewatering fi mature leaves were not able be as efficient as tw ones however young leaves had the same photosynthetic capacity independently from the treatment this indicated that initially all the leaves had the same capacity even for plant suffering drought or salinity then drought or salt stress induced leaf capacity alteration and even after re watering they were not able to recover their initial performance hence drought and salt stresses alter the leaf capacity in an irreversible way if their severity is very intense it is important to notice that the use of saline water mitigated the impact of drought however this alleviation didn t reached reach full capacity since a part corresponding to 23 was lost due to salinity even after rewatering without irrigation olive leaves lost permanently half of their photosynthetic activity during severe drought the use of saline water ec 7 5 ds m reduced this gap to 23 as compared to fresh water this can be explained by many basic physiological and biochemical mechanisms attributed to photosynthetic inhibition by water and salt stress intensity indeed during drought for rainfed and fi stomatal conductance was reduced significantly reducing gas exchange and photosynthetic activity diffusional resistances in the gaseous phase of co2 transport pathway from ambient air to carboxylation sites due to gs and mesophyll damage were reported by flexas et al 2012 and fernandez 2013 in olive tree and ben hamed et al 2016 in pistachio after re watering raindfed trees were not able to fully recover gs and consequently pn in contrary fi trees recovered stomatal conductance while photosynthetic activity was not fully recovered as compared to fw this can be explained by the fact that some impairment either of photochemical or biochemical processes other than rubisco ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase which greatly depends on photoinhibition in olive these have already been suggested by fernandez 2013 in olive tree and sapeta et al 2013 and ben hamed et al 2016 in pistachio the impact of drought on stomatal conductance indicates the failure of stomata to recover upon a rewatering period this suggests that the control mechanism of stomatal opening and closing was affected by the water deficit imposed photosynthetic recovery depends largely on previous water stress severity the regulation of gs after rewatering may be explained by a recovery of leaf specific hydraulic conductivity the sequential decreases of pn and psii under drought are thought to be caused by the close linkage between the activity of psii and photosynthesis chaves and oliveira 2004 this was most marked when co2 assimilation was limited by the decrease in stomatal conductance gs that can be considered as an important protective mechanism in olive trees under drought and salt stress this result was confirmed by a significant relationship between pn and gs there was a strong correlation r² 0 63 0 74 and 0 76 for rain fed fi and tw respectively 4 2 effects of drought and saline water on olive water status intrinsic water use efficiency changed significantly with increased drought indeed constant pn is estimated for decreasing gs this is a key trait for the adaptation of olive to drought and explains the higher wue recorded in rainfed plants than irrigated ones irrigated plants had constant stomatal conductance before and after rain converse to rainfed trees that had low gs during drought and increased immediately after re watering but lower than that of irrigated trees therefore irrigated trees showed better vegetative growth and yield thus even though olive trees maintained high wue under drought in rain fed conditions physiological efficiency was very low limiting plant growth and production potential the leaf water status showed that leaf water potential ψl decreased significantly under severe drought for rainfed plants as compared to irrigated ones for fi and tw treatments leaf water potential was estimated using gs and results were considered to draw trends and raise differences between treatments and not fully reported the water status of leaves the obtained results indicated that the status of irrigated trees was better than that of rainfed ones in addition it was lower for trees irrigated with saline water than those irrigated with fresh water in fact the minimum ψl in the present study was 4 86 mpa registered for rainfed plants this demonstrated the impact of dry and saline conditions on water status of olive tree however the observed low leaf water potentials were not directly linked to leaf water status this decline revealed a similar reduction in leaf photosynthetic activity which is in agreement with other studies perez martin et al 2014 nevertheless leaf rwc was low in rainfed trees as compared to irrigated ones that maintained the same values this may be the result of effective control of stomatal opening through chemical signals particularly the abscisic acid aba synthesized by roots in response to the dehydration of soil moisture which was also considered by kholová et al 2010 further maintaining rwc at 66 64 in rainfed trees under severe drought should allow olive to maintain minimal cell turgidity reflecting a great capacity of osmotic adjustment indeed this state will induce simultaneous gas exchange and pn decline moreover pn gs and rwc were significantly correlated this illustrated the response of pn to decreasing rwc and ψl induced by decreasing the water supply to the roots so decreasing rwc decreased gs and pn although at a small value of rwc gs may reach a minimum but pn may continue to decrease lawlor and cornic 2002 boussadia et al 2008 rwc was relatively high for all the treatments during drought with significantely lower values for rainfed treatment after rewatering all the treatments had the same values indicating for both cases a good cell water status this is suggesting modifications of leaf structure in response to water stress not only improve resistance of leaf cells to collapse but also bring about changes in tissue elasticity these adjustments have also been reported by oertli et al 1990 and guerfel et al 2009 bacelar et al 2006 found an increase in the cell wall elasticity in olive tree under low water conditions which may reflect changes in cell wall composition munoz et al 1993 joly and zaerr 1987 explained that more elastic cell walls can shrink more easily when subjected to stress helping to maintain a higher turgor pressure and protecting cell walls from rupturing this was confirmed by el of 76 96 62 75 and 61 08 for rain fed fi and tw respectively under severe drought after rewatering el was reduced to a range between 29 82 and 39 74 for all treatments on the other hand rigid cells may help to maintain lower water potential at a given volume than elastic cells patakas et al 2002 this can result in an increase in the gradient in water potential between the soil and the plant thereby promoting more effective water uptake from drying soils and or accelerating recovery after watering bowman and roberts 1985 guerfel et al 2009 additionally cell membrane stability has been widely used to express stress tolerance and higher membrane stability could be correlated with abiotic stress tolerance bajji et al 2001 in fact our findings showed a significant increase in el on rain fed plants at severe drought period compared to irrigated ones fi and tw this may be due to the fact that water shortage increases el also confirmed by bajji et al 2001 the comparison of the leaf water status during drought and after rewatering between treatments indicated that olive had good water status rwc low el and for both of irrigated treatments before rain relative water content was kept high even at maximum stress it increased after rain reaching those of irrigated ones therefore the re watering leads to a total resumption of initial water status which showed that restoring plant water is reversible and easy to fully recover moreover olive tree water status was not affected by salinity stress but drought reduced leaf turgor even if all plants had a low water potential this indicated that the trees suffered water shortage and rain fed plants were more efficient for water use for photosynthesis than irrigated ones therefore the olive trees water status has been put in evidence by rwc the correlation between stomatal mesophyll and leaf hydraulic conductance and the timing of each during regulation under severe drought provided novel insights showing that a decline of leaf conductance is the earliest response to decreasing water availability and they propose that it triggers the later decline of stomatal gs and mesophyll conductance which reported also in rice by wang et al 2018 flexas et al 2018 while the use of saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 reduced drought impact by increasing water status rwc by 18 but remained similar to fresh water ec 2 46 ds m 1 4 3 effects on olive physiological performance the analysis of studied physiological parameters may clarify the different strategies of olive trees to respond to water and salt stress under water stress olive had moderate reduction in co2 assimilation rate high wue and decreased chlorophyll content with decreasing leaf water potential chlorophyll depletion can be attributed to the sensitivity of this pigment to increasing environmental stresses especially to salinity and drought which was also been reported by other researchers moran et al 1994 younis et al 2000 guerfel et al 2009 water shortage decreases the vegetative growth the use of saline water reduced the impact of drought by 45 on shoot development but remained lower than that of plants irrigated with tap water tw after re watering moreover irrigation with saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 reduced drought impact by increasing production by 64 but remained higher than that of fresh water by 38 nevertheless it is difficult to draw conclusions for olive production since olive tree is alternate bearing tree and at least two bearing seasons are necessary for that negative effect of salinity was previously reported on pistachio ben hamed and lefi 2015 growth and development could be decreased with the increased degree of salinity and duration of imposed saline water irrigation when compared to tap water treatment tw similar findings were reported also on other species carr 2014 irrigation with saline water 7 5 ds m 1 ec reduced the ability of plants to take up water as indicated by a significant limitation of transpiration and low leaf water status and this quickly caused reductions in growth rate munns 2002 an accumulation of na ions was observed in the tissues of all olives tree during a severe drought period as salinity increased na concentration in the leaves of all tested cultivar increased gradually indeed tissue sodium concentration was greater in leaves of trees irrigated with saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 rainfed trees were classified second with regards to the concentration of na in the leaves this may be explained by the salt ascending from near saline water table due to soil desiccation during drought the low values observed for tw are explained by salt leaching by fresh water na concentration in leaves was 0 33 in rainfed trees that corresponds to the level observed by kchaou et al 2010 without toxicity on chemlali olive tree however the na concentration was 0 7 for fi trees this value is linked with toxicity effects kchaou et al 2010 tw had low level of na in leaves 0 21 indicating that there was no salinity stress chloride concentration in leaves of plant of the three treatments ranged between 0 067 and 0 83 these concentrations are within the normal range of concentration of cl in olive leaves bartolini et al 1991 however the rainfed treatment had lowers concentrations indicating a limitation of cl absorption due to lack of water in addition irrigation with saline water did not affect the concentration of cl in olive leaves this may be due to the limitation of transport of this element to leaves kchaou et al 2010 the toxicity effects of na on olive leaves may explain the reduction of gas exchange observed in fi treatment fernandez 2013 olive shoot growth reduction under salt stress can be explained by the reduction of gas exchange rates gs pn and e and stem specific hydraulic conductivity and contraction due to progressive inability of roots munns 2002 to absorb from the soil the needed water for normal growth due to water scarcity or salinity after rewatering apical and axillary shoot lengths were the same for both of the irrigated treatments independently from water quality however some studies claimed that irrigation with the high salinity water 12 ds m 1 induces growth inhibition in pistachio trees tounsi mehdi et al 2017 in contrary growth of rainfed remained weak even after rewatering this may be due to the permanent limitation of photosynthetic activity of mature leaves 5 conclusions rainfed olive trees showed declines in total chlorophyll contents leaf water potential and photosynthetic gas exchange parameters were observed during a drought period irrigation with saline water reduced this declines but did not reached the levels observed for trees irrigated by tap water conversely olive trees maintained a good water status and relative water content after heavy rain of 68 8 mm photosynthetic gas exchange gs pn and e for rainfed trees were partially recovered but did not reach the same level for trees irrigated with saline and tap water olive trees were able to resist water and salt stresses however they were not able to totally recover their physiological performance after re watering moreover young leaves had similar physiological traits at the beginning and they lose their physiological capacity due to the constraining environment thus olive trees developed physiological and structural adaptations to reduce water loss at the leaf level these adaptations caused permanent damages to leaf activity during drought photosynthetic activity of rainfed trees was 97 8 lesser than tap water irrigated trees irrigation with saline water reduced this gap but was 20 3 under tap water after rewatering raifed trees recovered only 55 of photosynthetic activity as compared to tap water while that of trees irrigated with saline water kept the same gap as compared to trees irrigated with tap water thus drought caused permanent damages to photosynthetic capacity up to 45 while irrigation with saline water reduced this gap to 20 without variation

growth and physiological activity of olive can be temporary or permanent and may impact olive production sustainability especially in southern mediterranean areas tunisia has a mediterranean climate with high temperatures and low summer rainfall thus water stress problems are likely to be more severe for cultivated olive trees in addition the reduction in the availability of good quality irrigation water will increase the use of saline water olive trees are able to tolerate low soil water availability and quality and develop physiological adaptations to cope with water and salt stress however these adaptation strategies are limited and permanent damages can be observed the permanent effects caused to olive leaves due to drought and the capacity of irrigation with saline water to avoid these impacts is not well known the aim of this work was to compare olive leaves performance after a severe drought with and without irrigation and to assess recovering capacities after a rainy period moreover irrigation water quality effects were also evaluated the results showed that photosynthetic rate was very low for rainfed plants during drought as compared to irrigated ones after re watering rainfed trees photosynthetic rate was only 55 of that of trees irrigated with fresh water irrigation with saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 reduced drought impact by increasing photosynthesis by 55 but remained lower than that of fresh water by 23 thus olive leaves were unable to recover their whole photosynthetic capacity after being exposed to severe water or salt stress furthermore young leaves had the same photosynthetic capacity at the beginning this indicated that olive leaves lost permanently half of their photosynthetic activity during to drought without irrigation the use of saline water reduced this gap to 23 as compared to fresh water keywords olea europaea drought rainy period photosynthesis olive water status olive recovery capacity 1 introduction the mediterranean basin is the largest area in the world having specific climatic conditions suitable for olive cultivation however this region is likely to face severe impacts due to climate change tanasijevica et al 2014 the mediterranean region is expected to have an overall reduction of annual precipitation of 39 1 55 1 mm and an increase of air temperature of 1 57 0 27 c from 0 84 to 2 31 c inducing an increase of annual reference evapotranspiration of 92 3 42 1 mm gargouri et al 2010 saadi et al 2015 the agricultural production has to adapt to this situation for sustainability ghrab et al 2008 water shortage is known to induce many physiological changes in plants aref et al 2013 indeed the phenological stages of vegetative growth flowering and fruit production are highly sensitive to water deficit moriana et al 2003 2012 ghrab et al 2005 2013 fernandez 2013 furthermore drought involves alterations of morphological and anatomical characteristics at the leaf level it has been reported that water stress frequently decreased leaf water status inducing low leaf water potential and relative water content this effect depends mainly on plant species and water stress severity aref et al 2013 the olive tolerates severe drought conditions with a series of adaptation mechanisms chartzoulakis et al 1999 these adjustments lead to changes in leaf water status and stomatal closure resulting in a reduction in photosynthetic rate hence the leaf water status affects the efficacy of photosystem ii psii activity and consequently the limitation of photosynthesis fini et al 2013 loreto et al 2003 and centritto et al 2003 perceived that the reduction of photosynthesis could potentially be due to a decrease in both stomatal and mesophyll conductance stomatal control is the major physiological factor in the optimization of water use in drought conditions giorio et al 1999 yordanov et al 2003 lefi et al 2004 zlatev and yordanov 2004 ben hamed et al 2016 fernandez et al 1997 and moriana et al 2002 noticed that olive trees can reduce excessive water loss by closing their stomata consequently the storage and diffusion of co2 into the leaf is limited flexas et al 2006 biochemically reduction of functional rubisco or to inhibition of functional activity of psii may limit photosynthesis lawlor and cornic 2002 changes in leaf anatomical characteristics are known to alter the co2 conductance diffusion components from the substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation and thus contribute to the maintenance of photosynthetic rates even with the low stomatal conductance chartzoulakis et al 1999 evans and loreto 2000 thus climate change will result in an increase of irrigation demand masmoudi et al 2010 in these areas agriculture faces enhanced land and water resources degradation over extraction of groundwater soil salinization and erosion ghrab et al 2008 this is mainly due to the development of intensive orchard using poor water quality abdel latef and chaoxing 2014 indeed olive is considered a moderately saline tolerant species due to scarce fresh water resources in the mediterranean basin irrigation with saline water ec 5 10 ds m 1 is often practiced nevertheless early rainfalls allow the removal of accumulated salinity from the root zone which allows plant growth ghrab et al 2013 salinity affects shoot growth and number of flowers and fruits while the effects on yield depend on the salt concentration ghrab et al 2013 olive trees use several mechanisms of tolerance to salt accumulation salt tolerance is related to the capacity of olive to accumulate salt in the leaf vacuoles or to the control of net salt import to the shoot chartzoulakis et al 2002 ghrab et al 2013 salt stressed olive plants faces a reduction in mesophyll conductance to co2 diffusion this phenomenon is as rapid and reversible as for stomatal conductance moreover the decrease of chloroplast co2 content due to low stomatal and mesophyll conductance reduces photosynthesis a process called diffusional limitations under water stress the potential to recover are a crucial component of a plant s response miyashita et al 2005 indeed the recovery capacity determines plant establishment in the future many researchers have asserted that after re watering olive recovers normal water status with leaf water potential and stomatal conductance similar to those of irrigated trees fernandez et al 1997 trentacoste et al 2018 conversely stomatal conductance exhibited the slowest recovery while the mechanism is not well known it has been linked to lower leaf water potential brodribb and cochard 2009 and to the accumulation of abscisic acid aba during water withholding which stands against stomatal conductance recovery lovisolo et al 2008 photosynthesis recovery depends on the rate and degree of photosynthesis inhibition during water shortage and also on plant species involved flexas et al 2009 it varies from rapid and complete recovery under moderate stress to depressed or never complete after severe stress chaves et al 2009 although olive tree response to water and salt stresses was widely studied the impacts of long drought in field conditions with regards to temporary and permanent damages on leaf photosynthetic activity quantification and capacity of irrigation with saline water ec 7 5 dsm 1 to alleviate them were not assessed these damages are likely to reduce plant growth and production potential tunisia is among countries with limited water resources an irrigation experiment was conducted in sfax region southern tunisia to evaluate the combined effect of drought and irrigation with saline water on olive trees previous researches in the same experimental field than this work were carried since 2003 leaded to evaluate deficit irrigation approaches with the use of saline water 6 7 ds m 1 its impacts on olive tree and adaptation mechanisms mainly physiological ones ghrab et al 2005 2013 and 2014 three irrigation treatments i control full irrigated ii dry rain fed and iii prd partial root zone drying were applied in addition prd was composed of two treatments prd30 and prd15 which received 50 of etc with an alternate irrigation switched every 30 and 15 days respectively ghrab et al 2005 partial root zone drying irrigation technique prd induced a slight reduction in pre dawn and stem water potential with the most important yield reduction was observed for the rainfed dry treatment oil content and quality improve with the increasing deficits for irrigated treatments which resulted in the saving of up to 50 of water requirements ghrab et al 2005 2013 ghrab et al 2013 2014 showed that prd irrigation technique application could be used with low quality of water in sandy deep soil to improve productivity without important accumulation of salts soil texture and mediterranean climatic conditions affected the impact of saline water use management for irrigation the restriction by half 50 of the water supply switched every month between wet and dry root zone caused a slight reduction of tree water status and cumulative yield 11 over the four year period of monitoring soil salinity presented seasonal variations affected by the irrigation water applied in this sandy soil salts were leached during the wet season and salinity of soil was kept to levels that were not harmful to olive trees ghrab et al 2013 2014 nevertheless the efficacy of irrigation with saline water to alleviate drought impacts on olive as compared to fresh water and rainfed conditions was not assessed the actual work was conducted in the same orchard using rainfed and full irrigated 100 etc with saline water treatment ec 7 5 ds m 1 in addition to a new treatment that corresponded to full irrigated with fresh water tap water ec 2 46 ds m 1 it focused on the possible effects of drought and water scarcity on olive tree water status and physiological activity these effects can be temporary or permanent and may impact olive production sustainability especially in southern mediterranean area olive trees are able to develop physiological adaptations to water stress although these adaptation strategies are limited and permanent damages can be observed irrigation can overcome this shortage though the permanent damages caused to olive leaves due to a severe drought and the capacity of irrigation with different water qualities to avoid these damages is not well known in this context this study addresses the issues and impact of water shortage on olive trees by investigating the physiological behavior production and growth parameters of olive tree during and after drought the capacity of olive trees to recover their performance was also evaluated thus the major aim of this work was to test how drought and salinity affected olive tree water status rwc content el and leaf water potential estimation ψl and the evolution of gas exchange parameters such as gs transpiration e and photosynthetic rate pn in addition to leaf chlorophyll pigment content moreover it focused on the assessment of the impacts of severe drought in field conditions on olive tree and the efficacy of irrigation with saline water ec 7 5 dsm 1 to mitigate it finally the recovery capacity of photosynthetic activity after rainy period re watering by 68 8 mm of rain was evaluated for rainfed and saline irrigation as compared to irrigation with saline water for this reason three treatments were installed both of them irrigated with tap ec 2 46 ds m 1 or saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 and the third without irrigation the drought severity and length were estimated using standardized precipitation index the evaluation was based on leaf gas exchange photosynthesis leaf water status rwc and el pigments and shoots growth and production in addition leaf water potential was estimated the objective of this work is to compare olive leave activities after a severe drought with and without irrigation and to assess recovering capacities after a rainy period 68 8 mm in addition efficacy of saline water as compared to fresh water was assessed field experiment was conducted on 25 years old olive trees olea europaea l cv chemlali grown on sandy deep soil this experimental design was installed in 2003 to assess efficacy of deficit irrigation on olive tree ghrab et al 2013 2014 and was modified for the purpose of this work integrating fresh water irrigation and drought assessment the evolution of gas exchange parameters pn e and gs wue chlorophyll chl and plant water status rwc were followed and leaf water potential ψl was estimated at the end of a severe drought period and after re watering for rainfed and fully irrigated trees with tap and saline waters newly sprouted leaves activities were considered as initial situation for every treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and water irrigation approach the experiments were conducted in an orchard at the olive institute in the region of sfax 34 43 n 10 41 e three irrigation treatments were installed in march 2015 and modified an experimental design installed in 2003 ghrab et al 2013 by adding irrigation with fresh water there was no properly re watering treatment was applied but rewatering was done by 68 8 mm rain that filled soil water holding capacity of 5 5 field capacity and wilting point of 8 8 and 3 3 respectively ghrab et al 2013 the region is characterized by an arid climate of mediterranean type sandy deep soil 49 7 sand 7 clay 43 3 silt the mean annual precipitation and reference evapotranspiration eto were 220 and 1383 mm respectively with marked dry summers the orchard was planted with twenty five year old olive trees olea europaea l cv chemlali at 4 m x 4 m spacing 625 trees ha 1 and drip irrigated standard agricultural practices in the region were applied irrigation was supplied by two dripper lines on each row of olive trees located 0 5 m from the

mckee et al 1993 1995 soro et al 2014 basing on that length of drought was determined the end of drought was due to rainfall during a severe drought two treatments were irrigated to cover etc the first one was with saline water fi ec 7 5 ds m 1 and the second was with tap water tw ec 2 46 ds m 1 a third treatment rain fed was installed without irrigation and did not receive other water than rain the amount of received rainfall during a severe drought was very low keeping the soil dry indeed soil water holding capacity was 5 5 when considering a depth of 60 cm the required amount of water to fill this capacity is 429 m3 ha corresponding to 43 mm since october 2015 the receiving rain water was less than the etc leading to soil drying thus during all the severe drought period water was not available in soil at the end of drought september 2016 68 8 mm were received overlapping the climatic demand and filling a part of water holding capacity thus since september 2016 re watering was achieved by natural rainfall 68 8 mm 10 trees were drip irrigated with tap water tw while 10 trees were drip irrigated with saline water ec 7 5 ds m and the third treatment was composed by 10 trees under rain fed conditions and measures were taken after severe drought of 10 months in 16 july 2016 after re watering in 24 october 2016 for adult and young leaves the evolution of gas exchange parameters pn e and gs wue chlorophyll chl and plant water status rwc were followed and leaf water potential ψl was estimated 2 1 2 plant sampling and experimental manipulation field experiment was

of the national institute of meteorology inm located about 5 km from the experimental site were used to estimate eto 2 1 4 spi determination the environmental conditions in the study area were characterized by a severe water deficit standardized precipitation index spi was calculated monthly from october 2015 to january 2017 to estimate meteorological drought mckee et al 1993 1995 spi aims to describe the major events of different types of drought observed in our study area table 2 precipitation occurred during autumn and winter seasons when the evaporative demand was low monthly applied irrigation water ia ranged between 11 1 and 75 mm for fi and tw treatments respectively with annual total of 533 7 mm the spi developed by mckee et al 1993 1995 is only based on precipitation data the index has an advantage of being easily calculated having modest data requirements and being independent of the magnitude of mean precipitation and hence it is comparable over a range of climatic zones it is calculated by fitting historical precipitation data one of the significant advantages of this index is that it can be calculated for different timescales to monitor meteorological droughts with respect to severity duration onset extent and end actual research based on the calculation of standardized precipitation index spi on a rainfall time series of 27 years from 1980 to 2017 the main input parameter is the monthly rainfall in mm to provide a more representative month as possible of the variable climatic conditions the spi index is expressed mathematically as the ratio of

determination of chlorophyll and carotenoids concentration for total chlorophyll and carotenoid analyses five leaf discs of fresh leaves of comparable physiological age adult and young were ground in 5 ml of 100 acetone solution using a pestle and a mortar after filtration extracts were adjusted to 20 ml with 100 acetone solution and pigment contents were determined spectrophotometrically according to the method of hartmut and buschmann 1987 2 6 leaf mineral content analyses na cl samples for leaf mineral contents were collected in july 16th 2016 mineral content analyses were carried out on dry leaves obtained after a drying at 70 c until weight stabilization the mineralization of these samples was achieved by incineration at 450 c and dissolution of obtained ash in 1 n nitric acid solution hno3 samples were processed using standard procedures aoac 1990 the sodium na content was measured using the flame emission photometry jenway pfp7 bibby scientific limited staffordshire

2003 all the values reported represent the means of at least three replicates and were expressed as percentage of dry weight dw for statistical analysis of data each three average value was considered as a replicate 2 7 shoot growth growth was measured at bud break and then monthly until the end of the growth season pre dormancy stage shoots were tagged at the beginning of the study january 2016 when trees were in dormancy and shoot growth was measured from march to october 2016 growth measurements of current year shoots were made on eight healthy shoots from three trees of each treatment placed at different directions around the canopy the lengths of all apical and axillary shoots were measured 2 8 olive yield yield per tree was measured at harvest on 10 trees per treatment olive fruits were harvested by hand on december 2016 olive yield was recorded and average production was reported in kg tree 2 9 statistical analysis one way anova analysis was applied to examine water availability and quality effects on leaf water status shoot growth and gas exchange using spss 13 0 for windows spss inc chicago il usa significantly different means were separated using the duncan s multiple range test at p 0 05 significance level 3 results the climate at the experimental site is basically an arid mediterranean type characterized by low minimal temperature at the beginning of the crop cycle on average 3 c for january and february 2016 high maximum temperature of about 39 c in summer during olive growth low and irregular rainfall with an accumulated annual value of around 123 7 mm and a high evaporative demand with an accumulated annual evapotranspiration around 1382 7 mm 3 1 drought occurrence spi was used to determine length and severity of drought and calculated in order to distinguish between dry and wet months and the drought occurred when a succession of three dry months was registered ben abdelmalek et al 2016 thus drought conditions are accepted when the spi was below 1 and ended when the spi becomes positive the classes of spi index are subdivided into moderate severe and extreme for both dry and wet periods as shown in table 2 spi indicated a long dry period from october 2015 to august 2016 indeed it ranged between 1 and 0 for nine months indicating moderate drought while the drought was severe for two months on 2015 such as december 1 and march 1 06 table 3 after that dry period september 2016 was classified as moderately wet with spi of 0 63 followed by 68 8 mm of rain a moderately dry month and then one moderately wet november and one extremely wet december 2016 with spi of 2 79 based on these results the drought period was from october 2015 to august 2016 for this reason two periods were identified and were used for physiological records and sampling for biochemical analyses these two periods were beginning of october 2015 to august 2016 that corresponded to the last month of a long drought and the end of october 2016 that corresponded to the end of drought and one month after re watering by 68 8 mm of rainfall in september 2016 3 2 effects of drought on plant water status 3 2 1 relative water content rwc since the leaf relative water content rwc allows determining the actual leaf water retention under unlimited water supply it can indicate water status in plants li et al 2010 the determination of the rwc in leaves of olive plants subjected to the different water treatments showed significant differences p 0 05 during drought between rainfed and irrigated trees independently of water quality fi and tw rainfed trees had significantly lower rwc 66 64 compared to fi 83 08 and tw 80 99 however after rainy period no significant differences were detected between treatments with values ranging between 77 74 and 80 5 for young leaves and 78 27 and 82 25 for mature leaves fig 1 thus rwc was almost the same independently from the type of leaves adult or young 3 2 2 electrolyte leakage el electrolyte leakage is considered as a reliable indicator of the oxidative stress resulting from abiotic constraints ben hamed et al 2012 the measurement of electrolyte leakage in leaves from plants subjected to different treatments showed that el was significantly higher under rain fed conditions during drought 76 96 as compared to fi 62 75 and tw 61 09 with differences between irrigated trees at the same sampling date fig 2 after heavy rainfall 68 8 mm the el decreased for all the treatments however el was significantly higher for rain fed treatment and tw 39 74 and 37 22 as compared to fi 29 82 in mature leaves conversely no significant differences were detected between treatments for leaves sprouted after rainy period and el ranged between 29 82 and 31 20 for all the treatments on the other hand the decrease of el was gradual for tw where highest el value was recorded during drought followed by that recorded in mature leaves after re watering and the lowest was that of young leaves in contrary the el drop was high for rain fed and fi for these treatments the highest values were those of mature leaves during drought and the lowest values were those recorded after receiving 68 8 mm of rain equally for young and mature leaves 3 3 effects of drought and re watering on leaf water potential gas exchange and intrinsic water use efficiency 3 3 1 leaf water potential ψl leaf water potential remained almost constant for mature leaves for every treatment before and after rain table 4 however irrigated treatments had a converse trend for young leaves as compared to rain fed trees indeed young leaves showed lower ψl than mature ones in irrigated conditions while ψl was higher for young leaves in rainfed conditions during the severe drought period ψl of rain fed trees was 4 86 mpa that was significantly lower than that of fi trees 3 8 mpa which was significantly lower than tw 3 48 mpa after re watering by 68 8 mm of rain ψl did not show any significant variation but it decreased slightly for rain fed 4 5 mpa and fi 3 66 mpa rain fed trees had significantly lower ψl than the other treatments young leaves had the same ψl for all the treatments it ranged between 4 02 rain fed and 4 3 mpa tw 3 3 2 leaf gas exchange parameters 3 3 2 1 stomatal conductance gs stomatal conductance gs during a drought period ranged between 8 24 mmol h20 m 2s 1 in rainfed plants and 170 34 mmol h20 m 2s 1 for tw respectively rain fed treatment was significantly lower than fi that was significantly lower than tw after heavy rain of 68 8 mm young and mature leaves showed different behavior in mature leaves rain fed treatment had significantly lowest gs 48 94 mmol h20 m 2s 1 as compared to the irrigated treatments which had gs ranging between 147 7 fi and 158 1 tw mmol h20 m 2s 1 conversely no significant differences were observed between treatments in young leaves for gs that varied between 72 92 mmol h20 m 2s 1 tw and 105 91 mmol h20 m 2s 1 rain fed gs did not show significant differences between drought period and after receiving rain 68 8 mm in mature leaves for all the treatments however young leaves had higher gs for rainfed treatment as compared to mature leaves before and after re watering conversely gs of young leaves was lower than mature leaves for irrigated treatments 3 3 2 2 net photosynthesis rate pn during drought pn was significantly lower as compared to irrigated treatments table 4 indeed pn of rainfed treatment was 3 92 μmol co2 m ²s 1 while it was 15 47 and 19 41 μmol co2 m ²s 1 for fi and tw respectively after receiving 68 8 mm of rain pn increased equally for mature and young leaves in rainfed conditions reaching 10 09 and 12 15 μmol co2 m ²s 1 respectively conversely pn of fi trees did not vary after re watering while it was higher in mature leaves 21 9 μmol co2 m ²s 1 than young leaves 12 46 μmol co2 m ²s 1 for tw moreover in irrigated treatments photosynthetic rate was the same independently of water quality and leaf age irrigation with saline water reduced the drought impact by increasing pn by 60 but remained under that with tw treatment by 20 during severe drought however after rain the improvement of leaf water status was accompanied by 55 recovery capacity of photosynthetic activity for rain fed treatment reaching values of 10 09 μmol co2 m 2s 1 while pn in fi were significantly p 0 05 similar to the irrigated plants with tap water at the same period the relationship between photosynthetic rate pn and stomatal conductance gs fig 3 indicates that all treatments maintained a high pn and high gs during severe drought and after re watering periods 3 3 2 3 transpiration e during drought transpiration was significantly lower for rained treatment 0 61 mmol h2o m 2s 1 compared to irrigated trees however trees irrigated with saline water had lower e 6 08 mmol h2o m 2s 1 than those irrigated with tap water 8 47 mmol h2o m 2s 1 after heavy rain 68 8 mm rainfed mature leaves had significantly lower e than irrigated treatments while no differences were detected for young leaves moreover e decreased after re watering for irrigated treatments and the decrease was marked for young leaves while it increased for rain fed treatment 3 3 3 intrinsic water use efficiency wue the intrinsic water use efficiency exhibited significant differences p 0 05 between rained plants and irrigated ones fi and tw during drought periods during the water stress rainfed trees maintained the highest wue 0 56 μmol co2 mmol h2o during severe drought wue of fi and tw were 90 and 80 respectively higher than rain fed treatment however after heavy rain of 68 8 mm no significant differences p 0 05 were detected between treatments during this period wue ranged between 0 12 and 0 26 μmol co2 mmol h2o 3 3 4 total chlorophyll chl a b and carotenoid contents car significant effects of water status and irrigation method were noticed on leaf total chlorophyll chl a b contents indeed during severe drought period all plants maintained low chlorophyll content which ranged between 0 91 0 87 and 1 24 mg g for rain fed fi and tw treatments respectively with no significant differences p 0 05 fig 4 however after heavy rain of 68 8 mm chlorophyll content increased for all the treatments and ranged between 2 68 4 29 and 3 98 mg g the rain fed plants showed significantly lower increase 66 in chl content compared to irrigated treatments fi and tw no significant effect of salinity on chl content was observed in fi as compared to tw treatments conversely the young leaves of the three treatments had the same chlorophyll content about 4 5 mg g during the severe drought period rain fed and fi trees showed the lowest leaf carotenoid contents ranging between 0 19 and 0 20 mg g fig 5 conversely tw had significantly p 0 05 higher carotenoid content reaching 0 29 mg g no changes were observed after re watering in mature leaves for all the treatments in contrary young leaves exhibited the same carotenoid contents for all the treatments of about 0 29 mg g 3 3 5 leaf mineral content na cl both sodium and chloride concentration increased for fi and in rain fed conditions leaf na concentration was higher during drought for fi 0 7 than tap water 0 21 and rain fed 0 34 fig 6 after rainy period the same trend was observed with the highest na contents for rainfed followed by fi and tw with significant differences between all the treatments and without differences between adult and young leaves fig 6 leaf chloride concentration showed the same trend during and after drought for the three treatments indeed the lowest values were recorded during drought and increased after rain in addition young leaves had higher concentrations than adult ones the lowest values were recorded for tw followed by fi and rainfed treatments 3 3 6 effect of drought and salinity on plant growth development and production the elongation of olive shoots subjected to different water treatments are shown in fig 7 rain fed treatment led to very low shoot growth 0 2 cm and production 5 76 12 4 kg tree during the whole experimentation period as compared to fi and tw treatments saline water irrigation ec 7 5 ds m slowed significantly p 0 05 growth rate during severe drought period as compared to tap water treatment tw however fi induced a significant growth increase as compared to rain fed treatments accompanied with a higher production 16 6 75 kg tree thus irrigation with saline water reduced the drought impact by increasing elongation by 90 but remained lower that with tw by 50 tw had lower production 10 8 6 kg tree than fi a gradual increase of growth was marked in plants irrigated with saline water fi and tap water tw to reach by the end of experimentation 9 03 and 9 7 cm respectively after heavy rain 68 8 mm irrigated trees with saline water had more important growth level similar to tw thus by the end of the experimentation both of the irrigated treatments have the same shoot growth with no significant differences p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 effects of drought and saline water on olive gas exchanges according to the results obtained in this study the analyses of photosynthetic parameters were affected by drought net photosynthesis pn was highly altered in rainfed trees as compared to irrigated ones in fact a significant p 0 05 decrease was recorded in rainfed plants about 3 92 μmol of co2 m 2s 1 this coincided with a decrease in stomatal conductance gs and the lowest values of leaf water potential ψl during the drought period the decrease in stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate due to water stress on is in agreement with other studies which reported a similar reduction in leaf photosynthetic rate with the reduction in leaf stomatal conductance a similar trend has also been reported in pistachio trees abbaspour et al 2012 ben hamed et al 2016 and olive trees cv chemlali guerfel et al 2009 this indicates that stomatal closure is one of the factors limiting co2 uptake under water shortage which was also found by fernandez 2013 in fact the reduction in co2 assimilation in rain fed plants may reduce the leaf mesophyll conductance mesophyll conduction is likely to be reduced due to tissues shrinkage causing morphological modification of intercellular space this can also be due to biochemical or cell membrane alterations therefore the stomatal limitation of photosynthesis through stomatal closure can be considered as a primary event followed by respective changes of the photosynthetic reaction as drought severity intensifies after re watering water stress persistently affected photosynthetic activity indeed the increase of the assimilation rates of rain fed trees after re watering indicated the improvement of intercellular co2 concentration which was associated with a gradual recovery of photosynthetic capacity however this recovery was limited to 55 as compared to fi and tw thus drought caused permanent damages to leaf photosynthetic capacity in addition during drought and even after rewatering fi mature leaves were not able be as efficient as tw ones however young leaves had the same photosynthetic capacity independently from the treatment this indicated that initially all the leaves had the same capacity even for plant suffering drought or salinity then drought or salt stress induced leaf capacity alteration and even after re watering they were not able to recover their initial performance hence drought and salt stresses alter the leaf capacity in an irreversible way if their severity is very intense it is important to notice that the use of saline water mitigated the impact of drought however this alleviation didn t reached reach full capacity since a part corresponding to 23 was lost due to salinity even after rewatering without irrigation olive leaves lost permanently half of their photosynthetic activity during severe drought the use of saline water ec 7 5 ds m reduced this gap to 23 as compared to fresh water this can be explained by many basic physiological and biochemical mechanisms attributed to photosynthetic inhibition by water and salt stress intensity indeed during drought for rainfed and fi stomatal conductance was reduced significantly reducing gas exchange and photosynthetic activity diffusional resistances in the gaseous phase of co2 transport pathway from ambient air to carboxylation sites due to gs and mesophyll damage were reported by flexas et al 2012 and fernandez 2013 in olive tree and ben hamed et al 2016 in pistachio after re watering raindfed trees were not able to fully recover gs and consequently pn in contrary fi trees recovered stomatal conductance while photosynthetic activity was not fully recovered as compared to fw this can be explained by the fact that some impairment either of photochemical or biochemical processes other than rubisco ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase which greatly depends on photoinhibition in olive these have already been suggested by fernandez 2013 in olive tree and sapeta et al 2013 and ben hamed et al 2016 in pistachio the impact of drought on stomatal conductance indicates the failure of stomata to recover upon a rewatering period this suggests that the control mechanism of stomatal opening and closing was affected by the water deficit imposed photosynthetic recovery depends largely on previous water stress severity the regulation of gs after rewatering may be explained by a recovery of leaf specific hydraulic conductivity the sequential decreases of pn and psii under drought are thought to be caused by the close linkage between the activity of psii and photosynthesis chaves and oliveira 2004 this was most marked when co2 assimilation was limited by the decrease in stomatal conductance gs that can be considered as an important protective mechanism in olive trees under drought and salt stress this result was confirmed by a significant relationship between pn and gs there was a strong correlation r² 0 63 0 74 and 0 76 for rain fed fi and tw respectively 4 2 effects of drought and saline water on olive water status intrinsic water use efficiency changed significantly with increased drought indeed constant pn is estimated for decreasing gs this is a key trait for the adaptation of olive to drought and explains the higher wue recorded in rainfed plants than irrigated ones irrigated plants had constant stomatal conductance before and after rain converse to rainfed trees that had low gs during drought and increased immediately after re watering but lower than that of irrigated trees therefore irrigated trees showed better vegetative growth and yield thus even though olive trees maintained high wue under drought in rain fed conditions physiological efficiency was very low limiting plant growth and production potential the leaf water status showed that leaf water potential ψl decreased significantly under severe drought for rainfed plants as compared to irrigated ones for fi and tw treatments leaf water potential was estimated using gs and results were considered to draw trends and raise differences between treatments and not fully reported the water status of leaves the obtained results indicated that the status of irrigated trees was better than that of rainfed ones in addition it was lower for trees irrigated with saline water than those irrigated with fresh water in fact the minimum ψl in the present study was 4 86 mpa registered for rainfed plants this demonstrated the impact of dry and saline conditions on water status of olive tree however the observed low leaf water potentials were not directly linked to leaf water status this decline revealed a similar reduction in leaf photosynthetic activity which is in agreement with other studies perez martin et al 2014 nevertheless leaf rwc was low in rainfed trees as compared to irrigated ones that maintained the same values this may be the result of effective control of stomatal opening through chemical signals particularly the abscisic acid aba synthesized by roots in response to the dehydration of soil moisture which was also considered by kholová et al 2010 further maintaining rwc at 66 64 in rainfed trees under severe drought should allow olive to maintain minimal cell turgidity reflecting a great capacity of osmotic adjustment indeed this state will induce simultaneous gas exchange and pn decline moreover pn gs and rwc were significantly correlated this illustrated the response of pn to decreasing rwc and ψl induced by decreasing the water supply to the roots so decreasing rwc decreased gs and pn although at a small value of rwc gs may reach a minimum but pn may continue to decrease lawlor and cornic 2002 boussadia et al 2008 rwc was relatively high for all the treatments during drought with significantely lower values for rainfed treatment after rewatering all the treatments had the same values indicating for both cases a good cell water status this is suggesting modifications of leaf structure in response to water stress not only improve resistance of leaf cells to collapse but also bring about changes in tissue elasticity these adjustments have also been reported by oertli et al 1990 and guerfel et al 2009 bacelar et al 2006 found an increase in the cell wall elasticity in olive tree under low water conditions which may reflect changes in cell wall composition munoz et al 1993 joly and zaerr 1987 explained that more elastic cell walls can shrink more easily when subjected to stress helping to maintain a higher turgor pressure and protecting cell walls from rupturing this was confirmed by el of 76 96 62 75 and 61 08 for rain fed fi and tw respectively under severe drought after rewatering el was reduced to a range between 29 82 and 39 74 for all treatments on the other hand rigid cells may help to maintain lower water potential at a given volume than elastic cells patakas et al 2002 this can result in an increase in the gradient in water potential between the soil and the plant thereby promoting more effective water uptake from drying soils and or accelerating recovery after watering bowman and roberts 1985 guerfel et al 2009 additionally cell membrane stability has been widely used to express stress tolerance and higher membrane stability could be correlated with abiotic stress tolerance bajji et al 2001 in fact our findings showed a significant increase in el on rain fed plants at severe drought period compared to irrigated ones fi and tw this may be due to the fact that water shortage increases el also confirmed by bajji et al 2001 the comparison of the leaf water status during drought and after rewatering between treatments indicated that olive had good water status rwc low el and for both of irrigated treatments before rain relative water content was kept high even at maximum stress it increased after rain reaching those of irrigated ones therefore the re watering leads to a total resumption of initial water status which showed that restoring plant water is reversible and easy to fully recover moreover olive tree water status was not affected by salinity stress but drought reduced leaf turgor even if all plants had a low water potential this indicated that the trees suffered water shortage and rain fed plants were more efficient for water use for photosynthesis than irrigated ones therefore the olive trees water status has been put in evidence by rwc the correlation between stomatal mesophyll and leaf hydraulic conductance and the timing of each during regulation under severe drought provided novel insights showing that a decline of leaf conductance is the earliest response to decreasing water availability and they propose that it triggers the later decline of stomatal gs and mesophyll conductance which reported also in rice by wang et al 2018 flexas et al 2018 while the use of saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 reduced drought impact by increasing water status rwc by 18 but remained similar to fresh water ec 2 46 ds m 1 4 3 effects on olive physiological performance the analysis of studied physiological parameters may clarify the different strategies of olive trees to respond to water and salt stress under water stress olive had moderate reduction in co2 assimilation rate high wue and decreased chlorophyll content with decreasing leaf water potential chlorophyll depletion can be attributed to the sensitivity of this pigment to increasing environmental stresses especially to salinity and drought which was also been reported by other researchers moran et al 1994 younis et al 2000 guerfel et al 2009 water shortage decreases the vegetative growth the use of saline water reduced the impact of drought by 45 on shoot development but remained lower than that of plants irrigated with tap water tw after re watering moreover irrigation with saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 reduced drought impact by increasing production by 64 but remained higher than that of fresh water by 38 nevertheless it is difficult to draw conclusions for olive production since olive tree is alternate bearing tree and at least two bearing seasons are necessary for that negative effect of salinity was previously reported on pistachio ben hamed and lefi 2015 growth and development could be decreased with the increased degree of salinity and duration of imposed saline water irrigation when compared to tap water treatment tw similar findings were reported also on other species carr 2014 irrigation with saline water 7 5 ds m 1 ec reduced the ability of plants to take up water as indicated by a significant limitation of transpiration and low leaf water status and this quickly caused reductions in growth rate munns 2002 an accumulation of na ions was observed in the tissues of all olives tree during a severe drought period as salinity increased na concentration in the leaves of all tested cultivar increased gradually indeed tissue sodium concentration was greater in leaves of trees irrigated with saline water ec 7 5 ds m 1 rainfed trees were classified second with regards to the concentration of na in the leaves this may be explained by the salt ascending from near saline water table due to soil desiccation during drought the low values observed for tw are explained by salt leaching by fresh water na concentration in leaves was 0 33 in rainfed trees that corresponds to the level observed by kchaou et al 2010 without toxicity on chemlali olive tree however the na concentration was 0 7 for fi trees this value is linked with toxicity effects kchaou et al 2010 tw had low level of na in leaves 0 21 indicating that there was no salinity stress chloride concentration in leaves of plant of the three treatments ranged between 0 067 and 0 83 these concentrations are within the normal range of concentration of cl in olive leaves bartolini et al 1991 however the rainfed treatment had lowers concentrations indicating a limitation of cl absorption due to lack of water in addition irrigation with saline water did not affect the concentration of cl in olive leaves this may be due to the limitation of transport of this element to leaves kchaou et al 2010 the toxicity effects of na on olive leaves may explain the reduction of gas exchange observed in fi treatment fernandez 2013 olive shoot growth reduction under salt stress can be explained by the reduction of gas exchange rates gs pn and e and stem specific hydraulic conductivity and contraction due to progressive inability of roots munns 2002 to absorb from the soil the needed water for normal growth due to water scarcity or salinity after rewatering apical and axillary shoot lengths were the same for both of the irrigated treatments independently from water quality however some studies claimed that irrigation with the high salinity water 12 ds m 1 induces growth inhibition in pistachio trees tounsi mehdi et al 2017 in contrary growth of rainfed remained weak even after rewatering this may be due to the permanent limitation of photosynthetic activity of mature leaves 5 conclusions rainfed olive trees showed declines in total chlorophyll contents leaf water potential and photosynthetic gas exchange parameters were observed during a drought period irrigation with saline water reduced this declines but did not reached the levels observed for trees irrigated by tap water conversely olive trees maintained a good water status and relative water content after heavy rain of 68 8 mm photosynthetic gas exchange gs pn and e for rainfed trees were partially recovered but did not reach the same level for trees irrigated with saline and tap water olive trees were able to resist water and salt stresses however they were not able to totally recover their physiological performance after re watering moreover young leaves had similar physiological traits at the beginning and they lose their physiological capacity due to the constraining environment thus olive trees developed physiological and structural adaptations to reduce water loss at the leaf level these adaptations caused permanent damages to leaf activity during drought photosynthetic activity of rainfed trees was 97 8 lesser than tap water irrigated trees irrigation with saline water reduced this gap but was 20 3 under tap water after rewatering raifed trees recovered only 55 of photosynthetic activity as compared to tap water while that of trees irrigated with saline water kept the same gap as compared to trees irrigated with tap water thus drought caused permanent damages to photosynthetic capacity up to 45 while irrigation with saline water reduced this gap to 20 without variation

flows were computed by multiplying the flow quantities t yr 1 by their respective virtual water contents m3 t 1 results showed that virtual water of all food commodities imported to tamale and ouagadougou were 514 and 2105 million m3 yr 1 respectively out of which 68 and 40 were re exported to other regions of the country the data also showed major seasonal variation in virtual water flows across the year reflecting their dominating role in local diets cereals contributed most to the total virtual water inflows in both cities southern ghana is the major net virtual water importer from tamale through cereals legumes vegetables and livestock the northern region of ghana on the other hand is a net exporter of virtual water in all food groups apart from fruits in ouagadougou large

silva et al 2016 but information is lacking about such flows for ssa one of the few exceptions is drechsel et al 2007 who attempted to estimate the rural urban food and water flows and the resulting nutrient and water related urban footprint or environmental burden in the four west african cities of accra kumasi tamale ghana and ouagadougou burkina faso the authors collected a comprehensive dataset through market surveys of food flows combined with household and street surveys to assess consumption patterns our study followed their approach in a comparative study of tamale and ouagadougou two fast growing cities in west africa this was accomplished by quantifying and mapping agricultural commodity trade flows in different seasons to better assess food provisioning risks and water resource use and planning 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area this study was conducted in the west african cities of tamale regional capital in northern ghana and ouagadougou capital city in central burkina faso fig 1 both cities are located in the west african savannah zone with a unimodal rainfall regime whereby major rainfall occurs between august and september tamale is in the guinea savannah with a mean annual precipitation of 1111 mm whereby january is the driest month with 2 mm and mean annual temperature is 27 9 c climate data com 2016 ouagadougou lies in the sudanian savannah climatic zone with a mean annual precipitation of 788 mm and an annual temperature of 28 2 c the rainy season in ouagadougou is shorter may to september than in tamale april to october climate data com 2016 a large proportion of the urban households in the two cities are involved in agriculture 36 for ouagadougou and 57 for tamale even though soils are considered highly degraded and with poor inherent soil fertility argenti and marocchino 2005 gss 2014 tully et al 2015 cultivation systems in the savannah zone are largely rain fed and irrigation only plays a role near cities where water is available year round the northern region of ghana is the country s source of grains with an important production of maize zea mays l rice oryza sativa l sorghum sorghum bicolor moench and millet pennisetum glaucum l alongside with yams dioscorea cayenensis subsp rotundata poir j miège also important is the production of cattle sheep and goats karbo and agyare 2002 yiridoe et al 2006 just like ghana sorghum sorghum bicolor moench millet and maize are the main products from farmers of burkina faso fao 2014 lettuce cabbage and green leafy vegetables such as roselle hibiscus sabdariffa l and amaranth amaranthus l are grown in brassica oleracea the dry season with other exotic vegetables cultivated throughout the year wang et al 2009 shakya et al 2014 2 2 methodology to capture flows of unprocessed food items a quantitative approach was employed using road and market surveys karg et al 2016 with the help of enumerators data of unprocessed food were recorded on all routes accessing the two cities under study the data collection period of six days corresponds to the traditional periodic market system in the two cities mckim 1972 in tamale data were collected in collaboration with the ghana police service and or customs division at existing road checkpoints three major roads were surveyed for 24 h day while two minor roads were surveyed during daylight for 12 h day in ouagadougou enumerators were positioned at toll gates located on all the seven access roads to the city apart from one minor road ouagadougou pabré where data were collected for 12 h day data were collected for 24 h day at all other toll gates the police 1 1 the ghana police has different units for public and traffic protection the unit we worked with included the barrier duty men and also the motor traffic and transport unit read more about them from http www graphic com gh features features police units responsibilities and duties html along one of the roads tamale savelugu we worked with the customs division which had a checkpoint for controlling the smuggling of goods and or customs officers tamale ghana and other officers in charge of the toll gates ouagadougou burkina faso assisted in stopping vehicles and facilitated access to the drivers driver s assistants and or to traders all means of transport including donkey carts motorcycle and bicycles were captured prior to the survey enumerators were trained in data collection and management of problem situations such as when vehicles could not be stopped or when drivers were unwilling to give information in such cases vehicle registration numbers were recorded and the quantity of food was estimated apart from the road survey inflows and outflows of food were recorded at the main wholesale market in tamale aboabo market 2 2 this analysis was possible for the central wholesale aboabo market which links the other markets in the study area on the other hand ouagadougou has numerous markets without one main central market linking the others for 24 h day during the study period with five other markets savelugu katinga kumbungu nyankpala and tampion the tamale market is part of a cycle within the larger periodic market system in north eastern ghana mckim 1972 during the respective market days trucks transport food products purchased by local traders from these five markets to tamale due to the large number of transported products it would have been difficult to accurately record the quantity and type of products circulating on the road records of such trucks were therefore taken from the market when they were un loaded the road and market surveys were conducted simultaneously to complement each other data collected through the survey were i the type of foodstuff ii its quantity and iii its source and destination during analysis data were aggregated to represent regions the six day data collection period was scheduled at the end of the two production seasons corresponding to the peak season end of rainy season and the lean season end of dry season in tamale the survey was carried out for two consecutive years while in ouagadougou the survey was conducted in one year additionally a monthly market foodshed survey was conducted to ascertain the availability of a specific food commodity in this survey every third trader 33 of food traders in the market was interviewed to record the food commodities s he was trading in and the origin of the commodity the aboabo and the central market of tamale were visited for this survey while in ouagadougou seven markets tampouy larlé sankaryare dassasgho cité an ii katre paag la yiri were surveyed considering that data was collected for a period of six days only annual food supply was extrapolated by relying on the monthly market survey literature data and interviews with key stakeholders including ministry of food and agriculture officers and market group leaders it was assumed that all available commodities found on the market during the monthly surveys were also transported during the survey in similar quantities as during our main survey period 3 data management a postgresql database was used for data entry source and destination of food flows were assigned to geo referenced locations all recorded quantities were converted to fresh weight by assessing unit weight per transport volume such as sacks and boxes karg et al 2016 3 1 data sources and analysis estimating virtual water fluxes the virtual water flows vwfs for tamale and ouagadougou were calculated by multiplying the flow quantity by the respective virtual water content of the commodities following approaches outlined by hoekstra and hung 2002 and sun et al 2013 the virtual water content vwc of a crop at a location was computed as the ratio of total water used for the production of a specific crop to the total yield of crop produced at that location v w c c l c w r c l y i e l d c l where cwr m3 yr 1 denotes crop water requirement representing the volume of water used at the farm level for the production of a crop c at a given location l data of water requirements 3 3 water requirement likewise yields of a specific crop may vary depending on the growing season soil crop variety and individual management irrigation type to estimate the virtual water content of a crop this study utilized average water requirements per year and national yield averages the assumptions employed by this study as a result of the unavailability of accurate data will likely lead to under or overestimation of the virtual water flows of selected food commodities which is hard to quantify results were compared with existing data in the literature to make sure they are not out of range for the different crops were obtained from chapagain and hoekstra 2004 and virtual water content of livestock was obtained from mekonnen and hoekstra 2010a b accumulated crop evapotranspiration etc mm day 1 hoekstra and hung 2005 sun et al 2013 over a

was used at the time of the study yield data were available only until 2014 therefore average yields for a period of 10 years 2005 2014 were used in the computation subsequently virtual water flow was

were used to categorize the different food commodities recorded from this study and used for data analysis 4 results 4 1 food commodity trade data from this study showed that on a daily basis tamale imported on average 608 t of the selected food commodities table 1 during the low supply season lean and 744 t during the high supply season peak season fig 2 out of these between 40 to 70 were exported again in the lean and peak seasons with the remaining being stocked or consumed within the urban area cereals maize rice millet and sorghum accounted for 38 of the inflows and 57 of the outflows in ouagadougou 1843 and 2535 t of food entered the city on a daily basis in the lean and peak seasons respectively fig 3 out of this quantity 34 was re exported from ouagadougou irrespective of the season in both seasons cereals accounted for 65 of the inflows and 70 of the outflows the results from the monthly market survey showed that most food commodities were available in the market throughout the year and originated from diverse sources data not shown in particular vegetables had a diverse origin reflecting their perishable nature the northern region served as a major source of most food available in the markets of tamale aboabo and central market irrespective of the month of the year food commodities that were not found in off season periods include some root and tuber crops sweet potato ipomea batatas l lam potatos solanum tuberosum l carrot daucus carota l and avocado persea americana mill and fruits watermelon citrullus lanatus thunb matsum nakai pawpaw carica papaya l and pineapple ananas comosus l in ouagadougou apart from cassava avocado and pawpaw most food commodities were available throughout the year 4 2 virtual water content the virtual water content of the food commodities considered varied between the two countries ranging from 200 15000 m3 t 1 for ghana and 300 9000 m3 t 1 for burkina faso table 2 cattle sheep rice groundnut and chilli pepper capsicum l were among the food commodities with the highest virtual water content in both locations while lettuce okra abelmoschus esculentus l moench and cabbage were among the commodities with the lowest virtual water content table 2 4 3 imported virtual water total annual volumes of water required for the production of the food commodities coming to tamale and ouagadougou were 514 and 2105 million m3 respectively table 3 in tamale cereals contributed half of the total imported annual virtual water flows followed by legumes 18 livestock 16 vegetables 9 root tuber and other staples 4 and fruits 4 most of the recorded food commodities originated from different regions in ghana but some food commodities were also imported from burkina faso for tomato and cattle and niger for onion allium cepa l in the lean season 91 million m3 of virtual water was imported in cereals from the northern region of ghana to tamale while this amount rose to 101 million m3 during the peak season these values represent 37 of the total virtual water flow of all food commodities to the city irrespective of the season within the specific food groups 73 of the virtual water from vegetables were imported from ghana s northern region during the peak season while only 34 of the flows were imported within the region in the lean season central ghana including ashanti brong ahafo eastern and western regions provided mainly fruits to tamale serving as origin of 75 of the virtual water inflows in fruits in the lean and 50 in the peak season tables 4 and 5 in ouagadougou the total imported virtual water was estimated at 2 1 billion m3 yr 1 cereals contributed 70 legumes 11 livestock 8 fruits 5 vegetables 4 and root tuber and other staples 1 in the lean season 185 million m3 representing 21 of the season s total virtual water flows came from ivory coast 18 and togo 2 and niger 1 ivory coast was exporting on average about 350 t of rice per day it should be noted that most of this amount was not produced in ivory coast but in asia apart from root tubers and other staples 27 in the lean season and vegetables 17 in the peak season the administrative region of ouagadougou contributed to the virtual water flow less than 4 of any food group major amounts came from hauts bassins central west and boucle du mouhoun regions western burkina faso tables 6 and 7 4 4 exported virtual water an average daily weight of 268 and 511 t of food was exported from tamale in the lean and peak seasons respectively fig 2 the exported quantities in ouagadougou on the other hand averaged 620 t in the lean and 889 t in the peak season fig 3 based on the virtual water content of food commodities at these two locations the total annual exported virtual water of all food commodities amounted to 287 million m3 for tamale and 848 million m3 for ouagadougou of this virtual water over 60 were exported in the peak cereals legumes and livestock contributed over 90 of the vwfs in both cities a high proportion of food exports and hence virtual water in tamale was directed to central and southern ghana a total of 45 and 65 of the virtual water in cereals were exported to greater accra region in the lean and peak season respectively fruits were redistributed to the northern region with 89 and 37 in both seasons throughout the year 40 50 of the livestock were exported to the ashanti region while a similar portion was traded within the northern region in the peak season but less 15 in the lean season in ouagadougou the virtual water export out of the country was higher than in tamale in the individual food groups between 25 70 lean season and 40 78 peak season of the virtual water exports in vegetables legumes and livestock went to benin ivory coast ghana mali niger and togo throughout the year ghana received the highest virtual water export from ouagadougou with the exception of livestock specifically in the peak season the major destination of virtual water export in legumes 47 and vegetables 64 was ghana in the same season 25 of virtual water in livestock was exported to ghana and 50 to benin across seasons 60 of the virtual water export in cereals occured towards the central administrative regions of burkina faso centre central west central north and central east north and sahel regions for fruits half of the total virtual water in the lean season was exported to central west central east and east region for root tubers and other staples four central regions north west east and plateau and the east region received 92 of the total virtual water in the lean season with the central west region alone receiving 79 of the total virtual water for the peak season 4 5 virtual water balance the net virtual water balance in relation to flows from and to the study cities tamale or ouagadougou was calculated as the difference between the virtual water imports of a city and its export ouagadougou had a total annual net import of 1260 106 m3 yr 1 representing 850 m3 per capita tamale on the other hand had a total annual net import of 227 106 m3 representing 610 m3 yr 1 per capita greater accra region of ghana had the highest net virtual import related to cereals legumes and vegetables while ashanti region recorded the highest net virtual import mainly from livestock from tamale table 8 in ouagadougou large flows of virtual water were imported in cereals specifically rice from asian countries through ivory coast followed by sources from western burkina faso the main net exports in fruits came from the hauts bassins region the centre west region had the highest net virtual export in legumes with ghana being the main net virtual importer data not shown 5 discussion the observed differences in the virtual water content between the results of the current study and those of earlier ones chapagain and hoekstra 2004 hoekstra and hung 2005 drechsel et al 2007 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 likely reflect differences in years climatic conditions and yield variation as well as agricultural efficiencies among the countries estimates by chapagain and hoekstra 2004 were based on yields and water requirements of crops between 1997 2001 while the data of chapagain and hoekstra 2010 covered the period of 1996 2005 the values reported by this study utilized data from 2005 2014 sun et al 2013 attributed variations in the virtual water content of maize 759 1050 m3 t 1 and rice 1131 1472 m3 t 1 in different regions of china to differences in climatic conditions crop yield and management between the studied locations differences could also be due to our estimates of the virtual water contents of agricultural produce the virtual water contents of the studied commodities were 30 60 higher in ouagadougou than in tamale which likely reflects higher evapotranspiration rates in burkina faso during the hot dry season november may of the sahel than in northern ghana jenness et al 2007 sadick et al 2007 schendel et al 2007 wang et al 2007 given the importation of some food commodities from international sources such as onion and rice their virtual water contents were estimated based on the yield and water requirement of the producing countries as indicated by karg et al 2016 for rice about 20 tamale and 90 ouagadougou of the flows were imported from outside national boundaries in the case of ouagadougou over 80 of the rice was channelled through ivory coast in the last decade between 75 88 of the rice imported to ghana burkina faso and ivory coast came from thailand india myanmar pakistan united states and vietnam fao 2017 for this reason the mean virtual water content of producing rice in these countries was used in the computation of the virtual water flows that were imported from ivory coast and other international locations the crop related virtual water flows reported by drechsel et al 2007 indicated vwfs that were only half of those recorded in our study this may reflect urbanization induced increases in vwfs however also the method of estimating vwfs by drechsel et al 2007 could have contributed to the differences observed the largest contributors to the virtual water trade in both cities were rice and maize which are major staples becquey et al 2010 karg et al 2016 apart from livestock cereals have the highest virtual water content of all food commodities and thus usually cause the largest virtual water flows the virtual water flows showed seasonal variations following the differences in the magnitude of trade per season during the peak season the total virtual water flows exceeded the lean season virtual water flows by 17 in tamale and 43 in ouagadougou similar data of seasonal variation between food commodities were presented by drechsel et al 2007 due to the climatic conditions in the sub region regional agricultural production for most food commodities is seasonal food stocking a common practice in the two cities and their source communities guarantees the continuous flow of certain storable food commodities such as cereals which would have otherwise been unavailable in off seasons hoekstra 2003 it must be stated that such flows from city storehouses could lead to an overestimation of the exported virtual water this study revealed that irrespective of seasons in most food groups the imported virtual water for tamale came from the rural hinterland of the northern region exceptions are for fruit and vegetables that mainly came from central ghana and in some instances were imported from outside of ghana especially tomato and onions food trade between cities regions and nations is a common practice and plays a central role in preventing the effects of national food shortages boosting agricultural growth in surplus zones and mitigating the consequences of shortages in deficit ones world bank 2012 the northern regions of ghana are considered water scarce compared with the country s central and southern parts with their abundant water resources notwithstanding about one third to half of the total virtual water in food commodities traded to central and southern ghana are from the north rockström et al 2009 pointed out that water scarcity and rainfall variability in the midst of human pressure on water resources for food production in the savannah regions may increasingly lead to dry spells often accompanied by floods if key agricultural water resilience strategies are not explored these include besides the increased use of more efficient irrigation techniques and improved soil fertility the shift of more water efficient crops to areas of water scarcity using principles of vwf allan 1998 chapagain and hoekstra 2003 hoekstra and hung 2005 the case of virtual water trade in food commodities from the water constraint northern ghana to the central and southern parts of ghana is inconsistent with such a virtual water saving strategy this situation is similar to the approach reported by guan and hubacek 2007 from china where water abundant southern regions imported water intensive commodities like agricultural crops and processed food from north china as observed by guan and hubacek 2007 the large flow of virtual water from northern to southern ghana especially in cereals could likely be attributed to the ability of the food commodities to withstand the climatic and soil conditions of the region while maize grows well in all ecological zones of ghana adu et al 2014 sorghum and millet are mostly cultivated in the guinean and sudanian savannah zones due to their resilience to drought high temperatures and low soil fertility darfour and rosentrater 2016 in ouagadougou the diverse sources of food and therefore virtual water import were expected due to its central location and status as the national capital unlike tamale the sources of food supply from both water secure regions western and eastern burkina faso and water constrained regions northern burkina faso allows the city to be relatively resilient to water related shocks in food supply battersby 2014 the western region of burkina faso is considered to be the country s breadbasket with more fertile soils and an annual precipitation of 800 1200 mm gray 1999 this area alone comprising boucle du mouchoun hauts bassins cascades and central west supplied almost half of the total imported virtual water from all food commodities to the city of ouagadougou the water constrained regions of north central north and sahel on the other hand contributed virtual water through livestock especially cattle in these areas the production period is short given an annual precipitation of less than 600 mm and agriculture is thus less diversified funk et al 2012 results from this study showed that the per capita net virtual water import of all food commodities was with 852 m3 yr 1 in ouagadougou 40 higher than in tamale both values are within the per capita virtual water consumption of developing nations which ranges between 500 3800 m3 yr 1 per capita hoekstra and mekonnen 2011 this higher net import in ouagadougou could be attributed to the sahelian conditions requiring more virtual water in crop production per person based on the minimum domestic household water required per day chenoweth 2008 and population the imported virtual water represents 190 times the annual water needs of the two cities the net imports do not entirely reflect the consumption because stocks were not taken into account there is evidence of large stocks in both cities especially in ouagadougou as a major trade hub which certainly affects the per capita virtual water consumption between the cities during times of sale and purchase of grains 6 conclusions while season affects virtual water flows with evidently higher flows in the peak season food stocks allow a continuous trade of food commodities our study allows to analyse the quantity and origin of virtual water used in the food supply to two west african cities and underlines the dominant role of cereals in these flows different national sources for the different food groups including both water secure western and eastern burkina faso and water constrained regions northern burkina faso allow the city of ouagadougou compared with tamale to be more resilient to water related and food supply shocks given the common water scarcity in the study region alternatives to exporting highly water demanding crops to more humid areas should be explored conflict of interest all authors declare to have no conflict of

capture flows of unprocessed food items a quantitative approach was employed using road and market surveys karg et al 2016 with the help of enumerators data of unprocessed food were recorded on all routes accessing the two cities under study the data collection period of six days corresponds to the traditional periodic market system in the two cities mckim 1972 in tamale data were collected in collaboration with the ghana police service and or customs division at existing road checkpoints three major roads were surveyed for 24 h day while two minor roads were surveyed during daylight for 12 h day in ouagadougou enumerators were positioned at toll gates located on all the seven access roads to the city apart from one minor road ouagadougou pabré where data were collected for 12 h day data were collected for 24 h day at all other toll gates the police 1 1 the ghana police has different units for public and traffic protection the unit we worked with included the barrier duty men and also the motor traffic and transport unit read more about them from http www graphic com gh features features police units responsibilities and duties html along one of the roads tamale savelugu we worked with the customs division which had a checkpoint for controlling the smuggling of goods and or customs officers tamale ghana and other officers in charge of the toll gates ouagadougou burkina faso assisted in stopping vehicles and facilitated access to the drivers driver s assistants and or to traders all means of transport including donkey carts motorcycle and bicycles were captured prior to the survey enumerators were trained in data collection and management of problem situations such as when vehicles could not be stopped or when drivers were unwilling to give information in such cases vehicle registration numbers were recorded and the quantity of food was estimated apart from the road survey inflows and outflows of food were recorded at the main wholesale market in tamale aboabo market 2 2 this analysis was possible for the central wholesale aboabo market which links the other markets in the study area on the other hand ouagadougou has numerous markets without one main central market linking the others for 24 h day during the study period with five other markets savelugu katinga kumbungu nyankpala and tampion the tamale market is part of a cycle within the larger periodic market system in north eastern ghana mckim 1972 during the respective market days trucks transport food products purchased by local traders from these five markets to tamale due to the large number of transported products it would have been difficult to accurately record the quantity and type of products circulating on the road records of such trucks were therefore taken from the market when they were un loaded the road and market surveys were conducted simultaneously to complement each other data collected through the survey were i the type of foodstuff ii its quantity and iii its source and destination during analysis data were aggregated to represent regions the six day data collection period was scheduled at the end of the two production seasons corresponding to the peak season end of rainy season and the lean season end of dry season in tamale the survey was carried out for two consecutive years while in ouagadougou the survey was conducted in one year additionally a monthly market foodshed survey was conducted to ascertain the availability of a specific food commodity in this survey every third trader 33 of food traders in the market was interviewed to record the food commodities s he was trading in and the origin of the commodity the aboabo and the central market of tamale were visited for this survey while in ouagadougou seven markets tampouy larlé sankaryare dassasgho cité an ii katre paag la yiri were surveyed considering that data was collected for a period of six days only annual food supply was extrapolated by relying on the monthly market survey literature data and interviews with key stakeholders including ministry of food and agriculture officers and market group leaders it was assumed that all available commodities found on the market during the monthly surveys were also transported during the survey in similar quantities as during our main survey period 3 data management a postgresql database was used for data entry source and destination of food flows were assigned to geo referenced locations all recorded quantities were converted to fresh weight by assessing unit weight per transport volume such as sacks and boxes karg et al 2016 3 1 data sources and analysis estimating virtual water fluxes the virtual water flows vwfs for tamale and ouagadougou were calculated by multiplying the flow quantity by the respective virtual water content of the commodities following approaches outlined by hoekstra and hung 2002 and sun et al 2013 the virtual water content vwc of a crop at a location was computed as the ratio of total water used for the production of a specific crop to the total yield of crop produced at that location v w c c l c w r c l y i e l d c l where cwr m3 yr 1 denotes crop water requirement representing the volume of water used at the farm level for the production of a crop c at a given location l data of water requirements 3 3 water requirement likewise yields of a specific crop may vary depending on the growing season soil crop variety and individual management irrigation type to estimate the virtual water content of a crop this study utilized average water requirements per year and national yield averages the assumptions employed by this study as a result of the unavailability of accurate data will likely lead to under or overestimation of the virtual water flows of selected food commodities which is hard to quantify results were compared with existing data in the literature to make sure they are not out of range for the different crops were obtained from chapagain and hoekstra 2004 and virtual water content of livestock was obtained from mekonnen and hoekstra 2010a b accumulated crop evapotranspiration etc mm day 1 hoekstra and hung 2005 sun et al 2013 over a

series data of the food and agriculture organization statistical database online faostat fao 2017 in case yield data for a crop were not available in faostat a regional west african countries average was used at the time of the study yield data were available only until 2014 therefore average yields for a period of 10 years 2005 2014 were used in the computation subsequently virtual water flow was computed by multiplying the quantities of food flows by the respective virtual water content m3 ton 1 of the commodity v w f l e l i c t q l e l i c t v w c l e l i where q denotes the quantities of

were used to categorize the different food commodities recorded from this study and used for data analysis 4 results 4 1 food commodity trade data from this study showed that on a daily basis tamale imported on average 608 t of the selected food commodities table 1 during the low supply season lean and 744 t during the high supply season peak season fig 2 out of these between 40 to 70 were exported again in the lean and peak seasons with the remaining being stocked or consumed within the urban area cereals maize rice millet and sorghum accounted for 38 of the inflows and 57 of the outflows in ouagadougou 1843 and 2535 t of food entered the city on a daily basis in the lean and peak seasons respectively fig 3 out of this quantity 34 was re exported from ouagadougou irrespective of the season in both seasons cereals accounted for 65 of the inflows and 70 of the outflows the results from the monthly market survey showed that most food commodities were available in the market throughout the year and originated from diverse sources data not shown in particular vegetables had a diverse origin reflecting their perishable nature the northern region served as a major source of most food available in the markets of tamale aboabo and central market irrespective of the month of the year food commodities that were not found in off season periods include some root and tuber crops sweet potato ipomea batatas l lam potatos solanum tuberosum l carrot daucus carota l and avocado persea americana mill and fruits watermelon citrullus lanatus thunb matsum nakai pawpaw carica papaya l and pineapple ananas comosus l in ouagadougou apart from cassava avocado and pawpaw most food commodities were available throughout the year 4 2 virtual water content the virtual water content of the food commodities considered varied between the two countries ranging from 200 15000 m3 t 1 for ghana and 300 9000 m3 t 1 for burkina faso table 2 cattle sheep rice groundnut and chilli pepper capsicum l were among the food commodities with the highest virtual water content in both locations while lettuce okra abelmoschus esculentus l moench and cabbage were among the commodities with the lowest virtual water content table 2 4 3 imported virtual water total annual volumes of water required for the production of the food commodities coming to tamale and ouagadougou were 514 and 2105 million m3 respectively table 3 in tamale cereals contributed half of the total imported annual virtual water flows followed by legumes 18 livestock 16 vegetables 9 root tuber and other staples 4 and fruits 4 most of the recorded food commodities originated from different regions in ghana but some food commodities were also imported from burkina faso for tomato and cattle and niger for onion allium cepa l in the lean season 91 million m3 of virtual water was imported in cereals from the northern region of ghana to tamale while this amount rose to 101 million m3 during the peak season these values represent 37 of the total virtual water flow of all food commodities to the city irrespective of the season within the specific food groups 73 of the virtual water from vegetables were imported from ghana s northern region during the peak season while only 34 of the flows were imported within the region in the lean season central ghana including ashanti brong ahafo eastern and western regions provided mainly fruits to tamale serving as origin of 75 of the virtual water inflows in fruits in the lean and 50 in the peak season tables 4 and 5 in ouagadougou the total imported virtual water was estimated at 2 1 billion m3 yr 1 cereals contributed 70 legumes 11 livestock 8 fruits 5 vegetables 4 and root tuber and other staples 1 in the lean season 185 million m3 representing 21 of the season s total virtual water flows came from ivory coast 18 and togo 2 and niger 1 ivory coast was exporting on average about 350 t of rice per day it should be noted that most of this amount was not produced in ivory coast but in asia apart from root tubers and other staples 27 in the lean season and vegetables 17 in the peak season the administrative region of ouagadougou contributed to the virtual water flow less than 4 of any food group major amounts came from hauts bassins central west and boucle du mouhoun regions western burkina faso tables 6 and 7 4 4 exported virtual water an average daily weight of 268 and 511 t of food was exported from tamale in the lean and peak seasons respectively fig 2 the exported quantities in ouagadougou on the other hand averaged 620 t in the lean and 889 t in the peak season fig 3 based on the virtual water content of food commodities at these two locations the total annual exported virtual water of all food commodities amounted to 287 million m3 for tamale and 848 million m3 for ouagadougou of this virtual water over 60 were exported in the peak cereals legumes and livestock contributed over 90 of the vwfs in both cities a high proportion of food exports and hence virtual water in tamale was directed to central and southern ghana a total of 45 and 65 of the virtual water in cereals were exported to greater accra region in the lean and peak season respectively fruits were redistributed to the northern region with 89 and 37 in both seasons throughout the year 40 50 of the livestock were exported to the ashanti region while a similar portion was traded within the northern region in the peak season but less 15 in the lean season in ouagadougou the virtual water export out of the country was higher than in tamale in the individual food groups between 25 70 lean season and 40 78 peak season of the virtual water exports in vegetables legumes and livestock went to benin ivory coast ghana mali niger and togo throughout the year ghana received the highest virtual water export from ouagadougou with the exception of livestock specifically in the peak season the major destination of virtual water export in legumes 47 and vegetables 64 was ghana in the same season 25 of virtual water in livestock was exported to ghana and 50 to benin across seasons 60 of the virtual water export in cereals occured towards the central administrative regions of burkina faso centre central west central north and central east north and sahel regions for fruits half of the total virtual water in the lean season was exported to central west central east and east region for root tubers and other staples four central regions north west east and plateau and the east region received 92 of the total virtual water in the lean season with the central west region alone receiving 79 of the total virtual water for the peak season 4 5 virtual water balance the net virtual water balance in relation to flows from and to the study cities tamale or ouagadougou was calculated as the difference between the virtual water imports of a city and its export ouagadougou had a total annual net import of 1260 106 m3 yr 1 representing 850 m3 per capita tamale on the other hand had a total annual net import of 227 106 m3 representing 610 m3 yr 1 per capita greater accra region of ghana had the highest net virtual import related to cereals legumes and vegetables while ashanti region recorded the highest net virtual import mainly from livestock from tamale table 8 in ouagadougou large flows of virtual water were imported in cereals specifically rice from asian countries through ivory coast followed by sources from western burkina faso the main net exports in fruits came from the hauts bassins region the centre west region had the highest net virtual export in legumes with ghana being the main net virtual importer data not shown 5 discussion the observed differences in the virtual water content between the results of the current study and those of earlier ones chapagain and hoekstra 2004 hoekstra and hung 2005 drechsel et al 2007 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 likely reflect differences in years climatic conditions and yield variation as well as agricultural efficiencies among the countries estimates by chapagain and hoekstra 2004 were based on yields and water requirements of crops between 1997 2001 while the data of chapagain and hoekstra 2010 covered the period of 1996 2005 the values reported by this study utilized data from 2005 2014 sun et al 2013 attributed variations in the virtual water content of maize 759 1050 m3 t 1 and rice 1131 1472 m3 t 1 in different regions of china to differences in climatic conditions crop yield and management between the studied locations differences could also be due to our estimates of the virtual water contents of agricultural produce the virtual water contents of the studied commodities were 30 60 higher in ouagadougou than in tamale which likely reflects higher evapotranspiration rates in burkina faso during the hot dry season november may of the sahel than in northern ghana jenness et al 2007 sadick et al 2007 schendel et al 2007 wang et al 2007 given the importation of some food commodities from international sources such as onion and rice their virtual water contents were estimated based on the yield and water requirement of the producing countries as indicated by karg et al 2016 for rice about 20 tamale and 90 ouagadougou of the flows were imported from outside national boundaries in the case of ouagadougou over 80 of the rice was channelled through ivory coast in the last decade between 75 88 of the rice imported to ghana burkina faso and ivory coast came from thailand india myanmar pakistan united states and vietnam fao 2017 for this reason the mean virtual water content of producing rice in these countries was used in the computation of the virtual water flows that were imported from ivory coast and other international locations the crop related virtual water flows reported by drechsel et al 2007 indicated vwfs that were only half of those recorded in our study this may reflect urbanization induced increases in vwfs however also the method of estimating vwfs by drechsel et al 2007 could have contributed to the differences observed the largest contributors to the virtual water trade in both cities were rice and maize which are major staples becquey et al 2010 karg et al 2016 apart from livestock cereals have the highest virtual water content of all food commodities and thus usually cause the largest virtual water flows the virtual water flows showed seasonal variations following the differences in the magnitude of trade per season during the peak season the total virtual water flows exceeded the lean season virtual water flows by 17 in tamale and 43 in ouagadougou similar data of seasonal variation between food commodities were presented by drechsel et al 2007 due to the climatic conditions in the sub region regional agricultural production for most food commodities is seasonal food stocking a common practice in the two cities and their source communities guarantees the continuous flow of certain storable food commodities such as cereals which would have otherwise been unavailable in off seasons hoekstra 2003 it must be stated that such flows from city storehouses could lead to an overestimation of the exported virtual water this study revealed that irrespective of seasons in most food groups the imported virtual water for tamale came from the rural hinterland of the northern region exceptions are for fruit and vegetables that mainly came from central ghana and in some instances were imported from outside of ghana especially tomato and onions food trade between cities regions and nations is a common practice and plays a central role in preventing the effects of national food shortages boosting agricultural growth in surplus zones and mitigating the consequences of shortages in deficit ones world bank 2012 the northern regions of ghana are considered water scarce compared with the country s central and southern parts with their abundant water resources notwithstanding about one third to half of the total virtual water in food commodities traded to central and southern ghana are from the north rockström et al 2009 pointed out that water scarcity and rainfall variability in the midst of human pressure on water resources for food production in the savannah regions may increasingly lead to dry spells often accompanied by floods if key agricultural water resilience strategies are not explored these include besides the increased use of more efficient irrigation techniques and improved soil fertility the shift of more water efficient crops to areas of water scarcity using principles of vwf allan 1998 chapagain and hoekstra 2003 hoekstra and hung 2005 the case of virtual water trade in food commodities from the water constraint northern ghana to the central and southern parts of ghana is inconsistent with such a virtual water saving strategy this situation is similar to the approach reported by guan and hubacek 2007 from china where water abundant southern regions imported water intensive commodities like agricultural crops and processed food from north china as observed by guan and hubacek 2007 the large flow of virtual water from northern to southern ghana especially in cereals could likely be attributed to the ability of the food commodities to withstand the climatic and soil conditions of the region while maize grows well in all ecological zones of ghana adu et al 2014 sorghum and millet are mostly cultivated in the guinean and sudanian savannah zones due to their resilience to drought high temperatures and low soil fertility darfour and rosentrater 2016 in ouagadougou the diverse sources of food and therefore virtual water import were expected due to its central location and status as the national capital unlike tamale the sources of food supply from both water secure regions western and eastern burkina faso and water constrained regions northern burkina faso allows the city to be relatively resilient to water related shocks in food supply battersby 2014 the western region of burkina faso is considered to be the country s breadbasket with more fertile soils and an annual precipitation of 800 1200 mm gray 1999 this area alone comprising boucle du mouchoun hauts bassins cascades and central west supplied almost half of the total imported virtual water from all food commodities to the city of ouagadougou the water constrained regions of north central north and sahel on the other hand contributed virtual water through livestock especially cattle in these areas the production period is short given an annual precipitation of less than 600 mm and agriculture is thus less diversified funk et al 2012 results from this study showed that the per capita net virtual water import of all food commodities was with 852 m3 yr 1 in ouagadougou 40 higher than in tamale both values are within the per capita virtual water consumption of developing nations which ranges between 500 3800 m3 yr 1 per capita hoekstra and mekonnen 2011 this higher net import in ouagadougou could be attributed to the sahelian conditions requiring more virtual water in crop production per person based on the minimum domestic household water required per day chenoweth 2008 and population the imported virtual water represents 190 times the annual water needs of the two cities the net imports do not entirely reflect the consumption because stocks were not taken into account there is evidence of large stocks in both cities especially in ouagadougou as a major trade hub which certainly affects the per capita virtual water consumption between the cities during times of sale and purchase of grains 6 conclusions while season affects virtual water flows with evidently higher flows in the peak season food stocks allow a continuous trade of food commodities our study allows to analyse the quantity and origin of virtual water used in the food supply to two west african cities and underlines the dominant role of cereals in these flows different national sources for the different food groups including both water secure western and eastern burkina faso and water constrained regions northern burkina faso allow the city of ouagadougou compared with tamale to be more resilient to water related and food supply shocks given the common water scarcity in the study region alternatives to exporting highly water demanding crops to more humid areas should be explored conflict of interest all authors declare to have no conflict of
