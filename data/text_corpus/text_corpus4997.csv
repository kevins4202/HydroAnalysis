24985,we developed the rity 2 phenology model for the spatial and temporal simulation of the seasonal development of ips typographus based on the phenips model and the data of integrated nowcasting through comprehensive analysis inca many parts of phenips were improved with innovative approaches and a new model was developed european spruce bark beetle phenology was monitored at eight study sites in 2017 and 2018 along with air and bark temperature measurements rity 2 predictions are based on air temperature from the inca system which is used to calculate the effective bark temperature for beetle development an innovative procedure was introduced which finds most appropriate spring threshold from which calculation of the phenological model initiates the onset of norway spruce infestation in spring was estimated using a lower threshold of 14 5 c for flight activity and a mean thermal sum of 53 0 degree days dd from 7th march onward the rate of brood development was calculated from the cumulative effective thermal sum of 30 min temperature data using upper and lower temperature thresholds of 38 9 and 8 3 c respectively and a nonlinear function for validation we compared the timing of phenological events in the field with predicted events using both 30 minute recorded data from trap logs in the field and hourly data from inca the onset of spring swarming was estimated with a mean absolute error of 2 4 days the onset of infestation was predicted with a mean absolute error of 4 7 days the observed onset of emergence of filial beetles was estimated with a mean error of 0 5 dd the model is calculated according to three scenarios that simulate different stand conditions rity 2 explicitly considers the strong effects of regional topography and can be used for precise monitoring of the actual state of bark beetle development at the specific model cell with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km additionally rity 2 simulates the number of generations which is necessary to assess the potential impact of bark beetle outbreaks at the regional scale the model was successfully incorporated into two web applications that serve as tools for the timely deployment of pheromone traps and trap trees for european spruce bark beetle monitoring the possible application of the rity 2 model for the whole of central europe using data from the inca system is discussed keywords european spruce bark beetle ecological modelling trapping inca voltinism population dynamics 1 introduction the european spruce bark beetle ips typographus l is one of the most economically important forest pests in europe wermelinger 2004 it s importance was lately reminded by catastrophic damage to norway spruce picea abies l h karst in the period 2015 2017 in slovenia resulting in the sanitary felling of 5 8 mio m3 of trees zgs 2016 2017 2018 the dramatic increase in sanitary felling due to european spruce bark beetle followed a catastrophic ice storm that damaged a large part of slovenia in 2014 nagel et al 2016 affecting 9 3 mio m3 of trees zgs 2017 it is well documented that outbreaks of i typographus are especially common after extreme weather events windthrow snow breakage ice storms etc wermelinger 2004 komonen et al 2011 kausrud et al 2012 de groot et al 2018 management of bark beetles requires continuous monitoring of their population pheromone traps are commonly used for monitoring the abundance of i typographus wermelinger 2004 faccoli and stergulc 2004 established that the correlation between spring may to mid june captures in pheromone traps and spruce damage allows the determination of a reliable risk damage threshold about 5 000 beetles trap in spring in the southern alps in italy and at the same time reduces the monitoring period and general costs in comparison to trap trees a similar technique for assessing the risk of bark beetle outbreak is used in slovenian forestry where the threshold is 9 000 beetles trap in spring rs 2009 this method of risk assessment requires pheromone traps to be set up in timely manner so as not to miss the onset of swarming it is also necessary to know the length of the monitoring period in practice pheromone traps are often set up too late after spring swarming has already begun and it is not clear how long to monitor the traps therefore a tool is needed to predict the onset of spring swarming and completion of development of the first filial generation which determines how long the monitoring should last additionally to assess the likelihood of mass outbreaks in time appropriate monitoring tools need to accurately predict the actual developmental process of the bark beetle population and the number of bark beetle generations per year such a tool or model would need to address the spatiotemporal dynamics of the bark beetle population and its temperature dependant phenology including timing and the number of all filial and sister generations one model that meets all of these criteria is the phenips model developed by baier et al 2007 the model was validated for a central european population of i typographus and has been used as an online tool for predicting bark beetle development in austria baier et al 2009 and germany baier et al 2012 later phenips was independently validated in the czech republic berec et al 2013 and has been included in various risk assessment frameworks seidl et al 2007 hlásny et al 2011 temperli et al 2013 pasztor et al 2014 mezei et al 2017 the first attempt to implement the phenips model in slovenian forestry was made by ogris 2017a as the model was not validated or calibrated for slovenian conditions its accuracy and reliability in slovenia remained unclear the first implementation of phenips generally followed its original calculation procedure however several major changes were incorporated and consequently it was given a different acronym i e rity 1 the main difference between phenips and rity 1 is the data source for air temperature phenips obtains air temperature data from its own topoclimatic model using daily regression coefficients elevation and estimated daily sum of solar radiation baier et al 2007 whereas rity 1 uses interpolated air temperature generated by the inca system integrated nowcasting through comprehensive analysis haiden et al 2011 kann et al 2012 the inca system has been developed for use in mountainous terrain analysis and nowcasting fields include temperature humidity wind amount and type of precipitation cloudiness and global radiation the analysis component of the system combines surface station data with remote sensing data cloudiness in such a way that observations at the station locations are reproduced while the remote sensing data provide the spatial structure for the interpolation the nowcasting component employs classical correlation based motion vectors derived from previous consecutive analyses another difference between phenips and rity 1 is in the calculation of bark temperature phenips uses a complex set of equations with several variables including estimated solar radiation air temperature and a non linear function for temperatures above optimum rity 1 uses a simple linear model provided by nw fva 2010 to transform air temperature into bark temperature the aim of this study was to calibrate validate implement and improve phenips which will enable simulation and prediction of i typographus phenology with high spatial and temporal resolution based on the inca dataset we included the prediction of the onset of spring swarming onset of infestation re emergence of parental beetles and the number and emergence time of filial and sister broods to validate the model we compared the recorded air temperature bark temperature flight activity and developmental progress in trap logs at various altitudes and relief aspects with phenological events predicted by the model the implementation drew from the experience gained through the development of rity 1 the result is rity 2 a validated calibrated and improved model for the optimization of monitoring and risk assessment of i typographus outbreaks we introduced an innovative procedure which finds most appropriate spring threshold from which calculation of the phenological model initiates and improves the accuracy of the phenological model in estimating onset of swarming and onset of infestation furthermore inca enables simulations and predictions of i typographus phenology with high spatial and temporal resolution that considers local differences in climate variability 2 materials and methods 2 1 modelling procedure the modelling procedure was performed in the following order 1 field studies were set up which acquired data for model validation and calibration 2 linear models for air and bark temperature were developed using linear regression 3 validation of daily and cumulative effective thermal sums 4 modelling spring swarming and onset of infestation 4 1

marshes in the dinaric alps in 2018 and in the vicinity of lake bled in 2018 the timing of spring swarming of i typographus was recorded during two consecutive years 2017 2018 using flight barrier traps witatrap witasek pflanzenschutz gmbh feldkirchen in kärnten austria baited with pheroprax basf se ludwigshafen germany the traps were placed at four sites in 2017 vodice kamnik brode and prevala and eight sites in 2018 medvedica turjak erjavčev laz mokrc vorenčkojca blejski grad višce and drajžnik at different elevations one trap per site table 1 we counted the number of captured beetles at two to three day intervals until major swarming 100 captured beetles compared to the previous count to observe the onset of tree colonization and brood development we used eight trap logs felled at eight different sites in 2017 and 2018 one trap log per site trap log is pruned trap tree table 1 the length of the trap logs measured from 12 8 to 35 0 m average 28 2 m and diameter at breast height measured from 21 to 46 cm average 35 cm the trap logs were placed under the canopy in shade half shade conditions we inspected every trap log for the possible presence of overwintering beetles no entrance holes were found in freshly felled logs at weekly intervals newly bored entrance holes were identified by fresh frass and marked with coloured tacks and numbered consecutively at the same time breeding systems under the marked entrance holes were inspected by removing pieces of bark the most advanced developmental stage of offspring was recorded as soon as the brood reached the pupal or teneral stage two chunks length 40 70 cm were removed from the trap log and transferred into two plant growth chambers rk 1000 ch kambič d o o semič slovenia for daily observation of emerging filial beetles in the first plant growth chamber logs were kept at 23 0 3 c 70 relative humidity and long day photoperiods of 16 h light and 8 h dark settings in the second chamber were identical except for temperature which was set to 28 0 3 c the actual temperature and relative humidity in each of the plant growth chambers were recorded with two sensors at 30 min interval voltcraft dl 120th conrad electronic se germany relative air humidity and temperature at pheromone trap and trap log sites were recorded at 30 min intervals using sht21 sensors sensirion ag switzerland placed into a solar radiation shield 2 m above ground likewise we recorded bark temperature at 30 min intervals at the crown base of each trap log at four positions around the trunk top bottom and lateral sides using thermistor sensors ntcle305e4103sb vishay intertechnology inc all sensors were connected to a compact and multi purpose ftp data logger laboratory for electronic devices slovenian forestry institute slovenia the data were transferred automatically via gprs signal and were thus available in real time using the eemis sfi web application ames d o o and slovenian forestry institute slovenia 2 3 modelling temperatures 2 3 1 air temperature the air temperature 2 m above the ground was measured at every study site every 30 min as explained in section 2 2 in the application of the rity 2 model interpolated air temperature from the inca system was used haiden et al 2011 ogris 2017a b analysis and nowcasting contain several meteorological parameters of which we used only air temperature 2 m above the ground the update frequency of air temperature from the inca system is 1 h minimum mean and maximum daily air temperatures from the inca system were used in the rity 2 model the linear regression models for minimum mean and maximum daily air temperatures in the forest stand were calculated using measured air temperature at eight study sites in the forest stands as the target variable and interpolated air temperature from the inca system as the source variable estimates of minimum mean and maximum daily air temperatures in forest stands were then calculated using the appropriate regression coefficients 2 3 2 bark temperature to estimate daily minimum mean and maximum bark temperatures we used linear regression analysis with observed air temperature as the source variable and measured bark temperature as the target variable mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse were checked with two methods differing with respect to where the predicted bark temperature was modelled from 1 recorded air temperature at the site and 2 modelled air temperature see section 2 3 1 the latter method was used for mae calculation due to the additive effect of the modelled temperature in the final rity 2 model 2 3 3 daily effective thermal sums the daily and cumulative effective thermal sums for bark beetle development were calculated from the difference between the daily mean bark temperature and the lower developmental threshold dtl 8 3 c within the range of dtl and optimum temperature to 30 4 c wermelinger and seifert 1998 to avoid overestimating the effective thermal sum at bark temperatures above to we corrected the estimated daily thermal sums by calculating the effective bark temperature sum of a nonlinear model eq 1 baier et al 2007 for validation of the thermal sums we estimated bark temperatures using the formulas available in table 2 and table 3 the cumulative effective thermal sum was calculated over the entire study period 2 4 modelling the phenology of i typographus 2 4 1 modelling spring swarming and the onset of infestation to predict the onset of spring swarming and infestation we compared the observed onset of trap catches and trap log infestation with the observed thermal conditions for flight activity additionally the observed onset of spring swarming and host tree colonization by i typographus was compared with the cumulative thermal sum of the maximum air temperature above dtl accumulated from the latest date onwards using estimated temperature data baier et al 2007 set 1st april as the date threshold for the calculation of this thermal sum however according to slovenian records the onset of spring swarming and host tree colonization can occur as early as the beginning of march jurc 2008 ogris 2012 probably due to the lower latitude and influence of the mediterranean climate therefore we could not set 1st april as the starting date of the thermal sum calculation the latest date for calculation of the cumulative thermal sum for the onset of spring swarming and host tree colonization was determined with an iteration procedure in which the lowest mean absolute error of the predicted onset of spring swarming and host tree colonization was achieved 2 4 2 modelling brood development in order to describe the relation between the developmental rate of i typographus and temperature we used both a linear function with only dtl see eq a 7 and a nonlinear function as proposed by wermelinger and seifert 1998 and used by baier et al 2007 effective temperatures for development from the egg stage to the emergence of mature filial beetles were adapted using to and dtl and upper developmental thresholds dtu 38 9 c effective temperature teff was estimated using a nonlinear function with the assumption that the relative developmental rate increases linearly within the range of dtl and to and that the relative developmental rate is equal to 1 at to fig 1 for temperatures outside the lower and upper temperature thresholds t dtl and t dtu teff was set to zero the effective temperature between to and dtu was calculated with eq 1 the parameters of which were estimated by baier et al 2007 by means of nonlinear regression analysis 1 teff to dtl exp α t exp α tmax tmax t β γ where α 0 02876507 β 3 5922336 γ 1 24657367 tmax 40 9958913 teff 0 when t dtl and t dtu a thermal sum of 557 dd is required for the total development of i typographus baier et al 2007 relative thermal sums for the egg larval pupal and maturation feeding stages are 9 3 37 0 10 4 and 43 3 respectively wermelinger and seifert 1998 the phenology model also calculates the formation of sister broods sister broods or re emergence is a phenomenon common to the spruce bark beetle and several other species of the scolytinae subfamily davídková and doležal 2017 after mating the female deposits the first brood it may then re emerge and after regeneration feeding re enter the same or a different tree to produce one or more so called sister broods anderbrant and löfqvist 1988 wermelinger and seifert 1999 re emergence means that females finish ovipositon re emerge from a gallery system and replenish their energy reserves by so called regeneration feeding in phloem wermelinger and seifert 1999 we used a relative thermal sum of 50 expressed as a percentage of the thermal sum required for total development i e 278 5 dd for modelling the re emergence of parental beetles eq a 13 baier et al 2007 a conceptual diagram summarizing the main steps of the rity 2 model calculation is presented in fig 2 detailed description of the model computation along with the formulae is given in appendix a 2 5 simulation and mapping of phenology using rity 2 spatial modelling and mapping of the phenology and potential development of i typographus in slovenia was conducted for the period 2016 2018 for each grid cell 1000 m 1000 m n 18 873 where norway spruce is present the onset of swarming onset of infestation development rate and number of generations were calculated based on estimated daily minimum mean and maximum air temperatures and the daily thermal sum of effective bark temperature see appendix a fig 2 the phenology of i typographus was simulated with three scenarios using minimum mean and maximum daily temperatures labelled as the min avg and max scenarios respectively 2 6 model validation to validate the estimated minimum mean and maximum air temperature we used recorded air temperature data measured at each study site validation of the time series of observed and estimated temperatures was done by computing the mean error me the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse for validation of air temperatures hourly temperature data from the inca system were used thermal sums of estimated bark temperatures were validated using the relative ratios of predicted and observed sums relative percentage mean error to determine the accuracy of the phenological model we compared the effective thermal sum computed with eq 1 using 30 min recorded bark temperatures at the date of imago emergence with the thermal sum required for the total development of one generation k 557 dd wermelinger and seifert 1998 netherer 2003 for validation of the predicted onset of emergence of filial beetles calculated from inca data we compared the estimated effective thermal sum at the date of emergence predicted by the model with k additionally a validation was done on the difference between daily and hourly temperature data on this basis a decision was made whether to use daily or hourly temperature data for model calculation the development rate was calculated with the min avg and max scenarios according to the btmin btavg and btmax effective bark temperatures respectively eqs a 4 a 9 the onset of swarming and infestation was always calculated using original uncorrected daily maximum air temperatures from the inca imax eqs a 10 and a 11 2 7 statistics data management and gis statistical analyses were performed using the r software environment for statistical computing r core team 2018 the following libraries were used within r rodbc ripley and lapsley 2017 desctools signorell et al 2018 and raster hijmans 2016 linear relations were analysed using linear regression analysis a one sample kolmogorov smirnov test was applied to verify normal distribution of test variables pairs of means were compared using the paired sample t test deviations of the mean of a single variable from a specified test value were tested by the one sample t test we used microsoft sql server 2016 as a database for modelling and calculation of thermal sums for predicting phenological events mapping was done with the esri arcmap 10 6 1 graphs were drawn with microsoft excel for office 365 16 0 3 results 3 1 climatic model 3 1 1 air temperature measured daily minimum mean and maximum air temperatures were lower than the modelled air temperatures from the inca system by 18 19 and 14 on average respectively table 2 the estimated minimum mean and maximum air temperatures correlated significantly with the observed values p 0 001 the variance explained r2 with the linear models was high and ranged between 0 88 and 0 96 the mean absolute error mae was lowest for estimated daily maximum air temperature 1 07 c and highest for estimated daily minimum air temperature 1 67 c estimated daily minimum mean and maximum air temperatures showed a root mean square error of 2 19 1 59 and 1 46 c respectively the grand mean of the ratio between the sum of estimated versus recorded daily minimum mean and maximum air temperatures was 100 81 100 04 and 99 55 respectively 3 1 2 bark temperature observed bark temperatures at the eight trap logs showed highly significant correlations to air temperatures table 3 the variance explained with the linear models was high for the daily minimum and mean bark temperatures r 2 0 93 p 0 001 however the linear model for the daily maximum bark temperature explained a lower but still moderately high proportion of the variance r 2 0 70 and the relation to the observed daily maximum air temperature was still significant p 0 001 the mean absolute error mae for the daily minimum and daily mean bark temperatures was 0 82 and 0 60 c respectively the mae for the daily maximum bark temperature was higher i e 2 20 c based on these results the daily minimum mean and maximum bark temperatures were estimated using the equations given in table 3 additionally the mae was checked with modelled air temperatures table 2 the mae for daily minimum and daily mean bark temperature was approx twice as high i e 1 60 and 1 14 c respectively table 3 the mae of daily maximum bark temperature was slightly higher in comparison to the linear model from observed daily maximum air temperature 2 58 c furthermore a similar analysis for hourly data was performed table 3 the variance explained with the linear models was also high for the hourly minimum mean and maximum bark temperatures r 2 0 84 p 0 001 but was lower in comparison to the daily data moreover mae and rmse were higher for the hourly models in comparison to the daily models therefore daily models for temperature calculation were used for rity 2 3 1 3 daily effective thermal sum the estimated daily effective thermal sum showed a mean absolute error of 0 83 dd 0 87 dd and 0 98 dd for minimum mean and maximum bark temperatures respectively table 4 the correlation between the estimated and observed daily thermal sum was relatively high for minimum mean and maximum bark temperatures r2 0 89 0 88 and 0 85 respectively the modelled cumulative effective thermal sum for the whole study period showed a mean absolute error of 42 7 dd 50 0 dd and 61 7 dd for minimum mean and maximum bark temperatures respectively table 4 the variability explained between the estimated and observed cumulative thermal sum was low and not significant mean cumulative observed and estimated thermal sums did not differ significantly table 5 the mean ratio between the estimated and observed thermal sums ranged from 96 5 to 98 9 table 5 3 2 phenology model of ips typographus 3 2 1 spring swarming and onset of infestation bark beetles were captured in pheromone traps when the daily mean maximum air temperature atmax exceeded 16 4 c our observations indicate that i typographus initiated flight activity at a daily minimum observed atmax of 13 0 c which corresponds to the interpolated air temperature from the inca imax of 14 5 c the latter was used as the threshold for the phenological model calculation see appendix a major flight the first day with a catch 100 individuals than that of last counting occurred on days when atmax was above 19 9 c the first attacks of i typographus on trap logs in spring were observed at a mean atmax of 19 3 1 4 c initial infestation of trap logs occurred 7 52 days after the onset of swarming table 6 the longest gap of 52 days between onset of swarming and onset of infestation occurred at the highest location prevala locations with lower elevation had lower delay of initial infestation after onset of swarming i e 7 17 days table 1 and table 6 the earliest onset of swarming occurred at the vodice location which had the lowest altitude on 16 03 2017 therefore the accumulation of thermal sum needed for initial swarming had to start before that date the lowest mean absolute error for the prediction of the onset of swarming and infestation was determined with an iterative procedure the latest lowest mae was achieved on 7th march and stayed almost constant to 1st february fig 3 therefore we selected the 7th march as spring threshold from which calculation of the phenological model initiates besides the lower air temperature thresholds for flight activity and initial colonization of trees atmax 16 4 and 19 3 c respectively which may occur occasionally on warmer days during the winter period other factors might prevent hibernating beetles to resume their reproductive activities too early in the season our observations indicate that flight activity is initiated when the thermal sum atmax 8 3 c accumulated from the 7th march onwards was on average 53 0 11 6 dd the first colonization of trap logs was observed when the thermal sum reached 155 6 54 2 dd table 6 the estimated thermal sum atmax 8 3 c for the onset of swarming and infestation was calculated directly from the daily maximum air temperature from the inca system imax without transformation using linear models from table 2 eqs a 10 and a 11 for validation of the onset of swarming and infestation we compared the observed thermal sum with referenced values provided by baier et al 2007 the thermal sum for the onset of swarming 53 0 dd was not significantly different from the test value of 60 54 dd t 1 436 d f 11 p 0 179 similarly the thermal sum for the onset of infestation 155 6 dd was not significantly different from the test value of 140 26 dd t 0 727 d f 5 p 0 500 using the accumulated thermal sum in combination with the flight activity and date threshold the onset of spring swarming was estimated with a mean absolute error of 2 4 days and the onset of trap log colonization in spring was estimated with an mae of 4 7 days table 6 the difference between the observed and predicted onset of swarming of 12 pheromone traps was 5 days earlier at minimum and 5 days later at maximum the difference between the observed and predicted onset of infestation of 6 trap logs was 10 days earlier at minimum and 6 days later at maximum table 6 3 2 2 brood development all four trap logs felled in 2017 were colonized and two of the four trap logs felled in 2018 were attacked by i typographus table 6 however the trap log from the mokrc location had only 15 entrance holes all of which were used for monitoring of development stages although only five trap logs were monitored until the emergence of filial beetles altogether 13 sample chunks were monitored in the growth chambers at two constant temperatures 23 c and 28 c every day with different onsets of infestation for validation of brood development rate we compared the observed onset of emergence of filial beetles with the thermal sum of 30 min measured bark temperatures at four positions around the trunk eqs a 7 a 9 the thermal sum at the time of emergence was not significantly different from the test value k 557 dd for both observed and predicted emergence from hourly and daily data p 0 05 table 7 the mean deviations me of the calculated thermal sum from the required thermal sum 557 dd ranged from 7 2 to 13 7 dd for hourly data and 0 5 to 1 0 dd for daily data table 7 therefore daily air temperature was used to calculate the phenological model see appendix a 3 2 3 modelling developmental stages the duration of three developmental stages was observed i e egg larval and a combination of the pupal and teneral adult stages the relative duration of the developmental stage of i typographus was calculated with regard to the thermal sum required for total development k 557 dd the mean duration of egg larvae and combined pupae teneral adult development was 7 4 34 2 and 58 4 respectively table 8 in accordance with the reference values provided by wermelinger and seifert 1998 the mean difference for the duration of the egg stage was 2 0 shorter the larval stage was 2 8 shorter and the combination of pupal and maturation feeding was 4 8 longer table 8 thus the phenology model was calculated with reference values for the duration of the developmental stages 4 discussion rity 2 is based on the phenips model the rity 2 model was validated and calibrated with field studies carried out in 2017 and 2018 there are several differences between rity 1 rity 2 and phenips which are presented in the table 9 rity 2 has 102 6 dd and phenips has 79 7 dd gap between onset of swarming and onset of infestation the rity 2 larger gap between onset of swarming and onset of infestation could be simply a consequence of high variability of the data i e 95 confidence interval for onset of infestation was 54 2 dd which is more than twice as the gap between rity 2 and phenips i e 22 8 dd table 9 it is imperative to consider that our study sites were carefully selected to simulate a typical stand environment which is shaded or half shaded by canopy therefore the equations for the calculation of air and bark temperatures eqs a 1 a 6 correspond to and are only valid for shaded half shaded conditions by comparison first version of phenips used the maximum incoming radiation for computation of temperatures without consideration of shading by the canopy baier et al 2007 phenips simulates the maximum number of possible generations whereas rity 2 uses three scenarios min avg and max to simulate different conditions in the forest stand the min and max scenarios are considered as extreme possible development rates of i typographus the slowest and the fastest respectively in the future rity 2 could be upgraded to include relevant scenarios that would reflect shade and other conditions of specific site furthermore our study had a small sample consisting of 12 pheromone traps and only eight trap logs felled at different locations with different elevations aspects and slopes furthermore the trap logs were located in only two of the six biogeographical regions dinaric and pre alpine an additional set of pheromone traps were set up in the alpine region in 2018 although slovenia is relatively small in area it is comprised of the alpine pre alpine dinaric pre dinaric pre pannonian and submediterranean biogeographical regions all of which have their own climatic conditions and typical forest habitat types zupančič et al 1987 we were therefore not able to fully capture the overall variability of the spatiotemporal dynamics of i typographus in slovenia we believe that a larger sample that would consider all biogeographical regions in slovenia equally would give somewhat different thresholds and parameters of rity 2 following the same calibration procedure both phenips and rity 2 can be used at any location however regional specific thresholds need to be calibrated and validated to reflect specific conditions of the region we used the linear and nonlinear functions from phenips for simulating bark beetle development baier et al 2007 the nonlinear function is based on quantitative experimental data on developmental thresholds and thermal sums wermelinger and seifert 1998 1999 netherer 2003 this allowed accurate simulation of both preimaginal development and maturation of young adults mean relative error 0 2 table 7 furthermore the duration of developmental stages and completion of preimaginal development was predicted accurately by the model at the end of the growing season since only the adult stage of i typographus can successfully survive cold winters faccoli 2002 netherer 2003 štefková et al 2017 determination of the status of brood development i e uncompleted generations at the end of the season allows us to predict the winter survival rate of local populations temperature regulate the onset of swarming in the spring however the mechanism regulating the end of winter diapause is not yet sufficiently clear doležal and sehnal 2007 koštál et al 2011 schebeck et al 2017 generally the onset of swarming occurs before 1st april in slovenia therefore the accumulation of the thermal sum must begin before that date we used an iterative procedure for determining the lowest mean absolute error for prediction of the onset of swarming and infestation the latest lowest mae was achieved on 7th march and stayed constant to 1st february fig 3 therefore the 7th march was chosen as spring threshold from which calculation of the phenological model initiates in bavaria southern germany zang et al 2015 developed an interesting alternative method for prediction of the onset of spring swarming their model uses plant phenology by employing the two phenological phases of the first flowering of the common snowdrop galanthus nivalis l and leaf budburst of horse chestnut aesculus hippocastanum l which proved to be more robust and accurate than the thermal sum based forecast generally our observations showed better results when we used daily temperature data as opposed to hourly data table 3 daily minimum and mean bark temperatures yielded a lower mean absolute error and root mean square error compared to hourly data only daily maximum bark temperature had a higher mae and rmse than hourly data the thermal sum for total development was again more accurately predicted with daily temperature data table 7 better results were achieved with daily temperature data due to generalization of the diurnal variation of temperature however only a linear model was tested we believe that better results could be achieved for hourly data with a non linear model e g sinusoidal function provided by pal arya 1988 as bark temperature always includes a time lag with respect to air temperature air temperatures measured at 2 m above ground in the forest at eight study sites were 14 20 lower than temperatures in the open analysed by the inca table 2 fowells 1948 conducted a study on the vertical temperature profile of coniferous forest average maximum temperature decreases with increasing height and average minimum temperature increases with increasing height therefore the cumulative thermal sum was generally underestimated by 1 1 3 5 in the avg scenario table 5 fig b1 which suggests that the rity 2 prediction of the development rate is slower than observed in order to cover all possibilities and to avoid possible underestimations the min avg and max scenarios are calculated with the model additionally small differences between the calculation of air temperatures in the forest and air temperatures in the open provided by inca 14 20 lower see regression coefficient b in linear models presented in table 2 result in relatively large differences in the cumulative thermal sum between different scenarios in the min scenario 20 lower air temperature this may indicate one filial generation per year and in the max scenario 14 lower air temperature four generations per year fig b3 therefore point based and site specific predictions require fine tuning to achieve higher probability estimates point based and site specific predictions are dealt with in phenips whereas rity 2 solves this problem by employing the three different scenarios used for calculation of the phenological model as previously mentioned the most probable development rate is 1 1 3 5 faster than the avg scenario many aspects of phenips and rity 2 could be further improved for instance diapause initiation is implemented in a very strict manner where only day length 14 5 h is considered even though it is well known that facultative diapause is induced by photoperiod that can be modified by temperature doležal and sehnal 2007 schebeck et al 2017 additionally the model could be improved with procedures which would consider brood development in november or even in december before first day of freezing and brood developing during winter however all those critical aspects of phenips could not be considered and improved in rity 2 due to the project resources limitations but stay opportunities for implementation in future versions of the model we developed two public web applications of rity 2 the first is point based and produces a chart of relative thermal sums of the predicted development of i typographus according to the min avg and max scenarios for any location in slovenia ogris 2018a similar to fig b1 the second web application is spatial and produces several maps in a time series of the predicted development of i typographus for the whole region of slovenia ogris 2018b the maps show the onset of spring swarming onset of infestation of different broods development of developmental stages of spruce bark beetle for several filial and sister broods and number of filial and sister broods for any chosen date e g fig b2 the source codes for both applications are publicly available ogris 2019a b we developed rity 2 to improve the efficiency of bark beetle monitoring from the onset of swarming until the end of the first generation which are both locally specific the model is calculated every day from 7th march to 31st october and predicts key dates seven days in advance which allows the timely set up and removal of traps an automatic e messaging system was developed to inform 14 regional and 69 local units of the slovenia forest service about the predicted onset of swarming and completion of first filial generation e mail to each of regional and local units of the slovenia forest service is sent every day from 7th march to 31st october and includes a table with predicted dates onset of swarming and completion of first filial generation and two maps a map for the predicted onset of swarming and a map for the predicted end of development of the first filial brood these maps help the slovenia forest service to set up and remove pheromone traps in a timely manner as this is important for evaluation of i typographus population abundance at the trap location when the catch in the trap from the beginning of spring swarming until the end of the first generation exceeds 9 000 beetles an outbreak is imminent and an attack on healthy host trees can be expected rs 2009 once the risk threshold has been overcome several control strategies can be applied i e increasing the number of traps mass trapping setting up trap trees conducting a more careful survey of spruce forests and eventually cutting recently attacked trees via sanitation programmes faccoli and stergulc 2004 2006 all of these actions are carried out to keep i typographus populations at endemic levels thus avoiding outbreaks and subsequent damage rity 2 can be applied for assessing the likelihood of outbreaks by modelling the regional potential development of the bark beetle for simulation of the maximum number of generations additionally the utilization of detailed data on air temperature for modelling bark temperatures provides a precise monitoring of the actual state of bark beetle development at the specific model grid cell easy application of the rity 2 model for the whole of central europe with data from the inca system could be performed data from the inca system enable model outputs with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km and cover an area from central france in the west to central bulgaria in the east and from central greece in the south to central lithuania in the north rity 2 uses a three day prediction of numerical weather model aladin 2016 and extrapolates the trend to seven days to predict future development of i typographus a similar procedure could be used for the whole of central europe as the inca system also includes global radiation as an output variable it is possible to use the phenips procedure to calculate air temperature from global radiation finally comparison of the rity 2 procedure direct use of air temperature and the phenips procedure air temperature from global radiation should be performed to reveal the impact on the prediction accuracy of the phenological model funding this work was supported by the ministry of agriculture forestry and food and the slovenian

development and can successfully hibernate as young adults therefore initiated generations with relative thermal sums 0 6 are ignored when calculating the total number of potential generations per year additionally the model is calculated only for grid cells containing appropriate host trees norway spruce for i typographus appendix b b 1 demonstration of the phenology model using the daily data output of the inca system the timing of the key phenological events in the bark beetle life cycle was simulated for the study area with the modelling procedures of rity 2 see eqs a 10 a 15 these include the 1 onset of swarming 2 onset of infestation start of development 3 cumulative sum of effective bark temperature of parental sister and filial generations and finally 4 total number of generations the accuracy of our model in estimating bark beetle phenology is demonstrated by comparison between the recorded and predicted developmental conditions effective thermal sum and between the observed and predicted developmental stage of the beetles in trap trees at two selected sites vodice and brode in 2017 fig b1 the first site is located in a lowland area 330 m a s l the second site is located in the kamnik savinja alps at an altitude of 830 m and a wnw aspect table 1 using daily inca estimated air temperatures for analysis of bark beetle development at trap logs the estimated thermal sum at the time of emergence showed a lower variability than calculated with hourly recorded data however the mean value calculated from the inca system was not significantly different from the required thermal sum for total development test value k 557 dd and deviated by 1 0 dd table 7 at the vodice location the rity 2 model predicted two filial broods and two sister broods fig b1 both filial broods and the first sister brood completed the total development cycle however the second sister brood reached 66 of the relative thermal sum required for total development by the end of october 2017 indicating the teneral adult developmental stage and the start of maturation feeding since the second sister brood exceeded 60 of the relative thermal sum required for total development the model assumes that this brood will successfully overwinter and will conclude development in the spring the predicted onset of swarming coincided with the observed onset of swarming however the predicted onset of infestation was one day later than observed the estimated start time of the egg and larval developmental stages was two and eight days later than observed respectively the predicted pupal developmental stage initiated two days earlier than observed the model predicted two filial brood and one sister brood at the higher elevation location at brode fig b1 however for the second filial brood that started development on 27th july 2017 development already stopped on 18th october at 65 of the relative thermal sum and remained at that level until the end of the october therefore the second filial brood at this location was estimated to overwinter successfully the predicted onset of swarming was four days later than observed and the predicted onset of infestation was six days later than observed the delay was even more evident later the predicted egg larval and pupal developmental stages started six eight and ten days later than observed respectively the point based comparison revealed high conformity between the phenological events predicted by the model at the local trap logs this indicates the possibility to precisely compute local temperature conditions inside the bark with the model the higher deviations between observed and predicted events might be due to uncertainties in weekly control intervals and to variability in beetle life processes that are not temperature dependent however the application of rity 2 using detailed data of site specific conditions can detect relevant differences in the phenology of i typographus the predicted onset of swarming was initiated on 1 5 of the model area before 15 03 2017 fig b2b the onset of swarming in 2017 was most frequently predicted between 15 03 and 31 03 90 7 of the study area in 2018 the onset of swarming was initiated later in the season in 60 of the model area the predicted onset of swarming occurred between 01 04 and 15 04 2018 before 15 03 2018 the onset of swarming was predicted on only 0 1 of the model area between 15 03 and 31 03 2018 the onset of swarming was predicted on 20 7 of the model area fig b2b the model enables the spatial prediction of developmental stages for seven days in advance fig b2 c shows an example for 01 07 for both 2017 and 2018 the most prevalent developmental stage on 01 07 was estimated by the model to be the maturation feeding stage at 63 6 and 49 4 of the model area in 2017 and 2018 respectively the imago stage was predicted on 7 2 and 25 2 of the model area in 2017 and 2018 respectively fig b2c the development rate was calculated with the min avg and max scenarios according to the three effective bark temperatures eqs a 4 a 6 and a 7 a 9 where the avg scenario corresponds to shade half shade stand conditions there were distinct differences in the predicted number of filial generations per year given by the different scenarios in the min scenario only one generation per year was prevalent in both 2017 and 2018 fig b3 however in 2018 two generations of i typographus were already present on 35 8 of the model area with appropriate hosts whereas in 2017 two generations were completed on only 3 7 of the model area in the avg scenario two filial generations were completed on 73 4 and 78 8 of the model area in 2017 and 2018 respectively fig b2a and fig b3 up to three generations per year were predicted by the avg scenario however three generations were completed on only up to 0 2 of the model area in both 2017 and 2018 in the max scenario four generations per year were frequently predicted by the model but three generations were most often completed in this scenario in the max scenario the thermal sum required for completion of three generations accumulated on 51 6 and 59 7 of the model area in 2017 and 2018 respectively fig

24985,we developed the rity 2 phenology model for the spatial and temporal simulation of the seasonal development of ips typographus based on the phenips model and the data of integrated nowcasting through comprehensive analysis inca many parts of phenips were improved with innovative approaches and a new model was developed european spruce bark beetle phenology was monitored at eight study sites in 2017 and 2018 along with air and bark temperature measurements rity 2 predictions are based on air temperature from the inca system which is used to calculate the effective bark temperature for beetle development an innovative procedure was introduced which finds most appropriate spring threshold from which calculation of the phenological model initiates the onset of norway spruce infestation in spring was estimated using a lower threshold of 14 5 c for flight activity and a mean thermal sum of 53 0 degree days dd from 7th march onward the rate of brood development was calculated from the cumulative effective thermal sum of 30 min temperature data using upper and lower temperature thresholds of 38 9 and 8 3 c respectively and a nonlinear function for validation we compared the timing of phenological events in the field with predicted events using both 30 minute recorded data from trap logs in the field and hourly data from inca the onset of spring swarming was estimated with a mean absolute error of 2 4 days the onset of infestation was predicted with a mean absolute error of 4 7 days the observed onset of emergence of filial beetles was estimated with a mean error of 0 5 dd the model is calculated according to three scenarios that simulate different stand conditions rity 2 explicitly considers the strong effects of regional topography and can be used for precise monitoring of the actual state of bark beetle development at the specific model cell with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km additionally rity 2 simulates the number of generations which is necessary to assess the potential impact of bark beetle outbreaks at the regional scale the model was successfully incorporated into two web applications that serve as tools for the timely deployment of pheromone traps and trap trees for european spruce bark beetle monitoring the possible application of the rity 2 model for the whole of central europe using data from the inca system is discussed keywords european spruce bark beetle ecological modelling trapping inca voltinism population dynamics 1 introduction the european spruce bark beetle ips typographus l is one of the most economically important forest pests in europe wermelinger 2004 it s importance was lately reminded by catastrophic damage to norway spruce picea abies l h karst in the period 2015 2017 in slovenia resulting in the sanitary felling of 5 8 mio m3 of trees zgs 2016 2017 2018 the dramatic increase in sanitary felling due to european spruce bark beetle followed a catastrophic ice storm that damaged a large part of slovenia in 2014 nagel et al 2016 affecting 9 3 mio m3 of trees zgs 2017 it is well documented that outbreaks of i typographus are especially common after extreme weather events windthrow snow breakage ice storms etc wermelinger 2004 komonen et al 2011 kausrud et al 2012 de groot et al 2018 management of bark beetles requires continuous monitoring of their population pheromone traps are commonly used for monitoring the abundance of i typographus wermelinger 2004 faccoli and stergulc 2004 established that the correlation between spring may to mid june captures in pheromone traps and spruce damage allows the determination of a reliable risk damage threshold about 5 000 beetles trap in spring in the southern alps in italy and at the same time reduces the monitoring period and general costs in comparison to trap trees a similar technique for assessing the risk of bark beetle outbreak is used in slovenian forestry where the threshold is 9 000 beetles trap in spring rs 2009 this method of risk assessment requires pheromone traps to be set up in timely manner so as not to miss the onset of swarming it is also necessary to know the length of the monitoring period in practice pheromone traps are often set up too late after spring swarming has already begun and it is not clear how long to monitor the traps therefore a tool is needed to predict the onset of spring swarming and completion of development of the first filial generation which determines how long the monitoring should last additionally to assess the likelihood of mass outbreaks in time appropriate monitoring tools need to accurately predict the actual developmental process of the bark beetle population and the number of bark beetle generations per year such a tool or model would need to address the spatiotemporal dynamics of the bark beetle population and its temperature dependant phenology including timing and the number of all filial and sister generations one model that meets all of these criteria is the phenips model developed by baier et al 2007 the model was validated for a central european population of i typographus and has been used as an online tool for predicting bark beetle development in austria baier et al 2009 and germany baier et al 2012 later phenips was independently validated in the czech republic berec et al 2013 and has been included in various risk assessment frameworks seidl et al 2007 hlásny et al 2011 temperli et al 2013 pasztor et al 2014 mezei et al 2017 the first attempt to implement the phenips model in slovenian forestry was made by ogris 2017a as the model was not validated or calibrated for slovenian conditions its accuracy and reliability in slovenia remained unclear the first implementation of phenips generally followed its original calculation procedure however several major changes were incorporated and consequently it was given a different acronym i e rity 1 the main difference between phenips and rity 1 is the data source for air temperature phenips obtains air temperature data from its own topoclimatic model using daily regression coefficients elevation and estimated daily sum of solar radiation baier et al 2007 whereas rity 1 uses interpolated air temperature generated by the inca system integrated nowcasting through comprehensive analysis haiden et al 2011 kann et al 2012 the inca system has been developed for use in mountainous terrain analysis and nowcasting fields include temperature humidity wind amount and type of precipitation cloudiness and global radiation the analysis component of the system combines surface station data with remote sensing data cloudiness in such a way that observations at the station locations are reproduced while the remote sensing data provide the spatial structure for the interpolation the nowcasting component employs classical correlation based motion vectors derived from previous consecutive analyses another difference between phenips and rity 1 is in the calculation of bark temperature phenips uses a complex set of equations with several variables including estimated solar radiation air temperature and a non linear function for temperatures above optimum rity 1 uses a simple linear model provided by nw fva 2010 to transform air temperature into bark temperature the aim of this study was to calibrate validate implement and improve phenips which will enable simulation and prediction of i typographus phenology with high spatial and temporal resolution based on the inca dataset we included the prediction of the onset of spring swarming onset of infestation re emergence of parental beetles and the number and emergence time of filial and sister broods to validate the model we compared the recorded air temperature bark temperature flight activity and developmental progress in trap logs at various altitudes and relief aspects with phenological events predicted by the model the implementation drew from the experience gained through the development of rity 1 the result is rity 2 a validated calibrated and improved model for the optimization of monitoring and risk assessment of i typographus outbreaks we introduced an innovative procedure which finds most appropriate spring threshold from which calculation of the phenological model initiates and improves the accuracy of the phenological model in estimating onset of swarming and onset of infestation furthermore inca enables simulations and predictions of i typographus phenology with high spatial and temporal resolution that considers local differences in climate variability 2 materials and methods 2 1 modelling procedure the modelling procedure was performed in the following order 1 field studies were set up which acquired data for model validation and calibration 2 linear

marshes in the dinaric alps in 2018 and in the vicinity of lake bled in 2018 the timing of spring swarming of i typographus was recorded during two consecutive years 2017 2018 using flight barrier traps witatrap witasek pflanzenschutz gmbh feldkirchen in kärnten austria baited with pheroprax basf se ludwigshafen germany the traps were placed at four sites in 2017 vodice kamnik brode and prevala and eight sites in 2018 medvedica turjak erjavčev laz mokrc vorenčkojca blejski grad višce and drajžnik at different elevations one trap per site table 1 we counted the number of captured beetles at two to three day intervals until major swarming 100 captured beetles compared to the previous count to observe the onset of tree colonization and brood development we used eight trap logs felled at eight different sites in 2017 and 2018 one trap log per site trap log is pruned trap tree table 1 the length of the trap logs measured from 12 8 to 35 0 m average 28 2 m and diameter at breast height measured from 21 to 46 cm average 35 cm the trap logs were placed under the canopy in shade half shade conditions we inspected every trap log for the possible presence of overwintering beetles no entrance holes were found in freshly felled logs at weekly intervals newly bored entrance holes were identified by fresh frass and marked with coloured tacks and numbered consecutively at the same time breeding systems under the marked entrance holes were inspected by removing pieces of bark the most advanced developmental stage of offspring was recorded as soon as the brood reached the pupal or teneral stage two chunks length 40 70 cm were removed from the trap log and transferred into two plant growth chambers rk 1000 ch kambič d o o semič slovenia for daily observation of emerging filial beetles in the first plant growth chamber logs were kept at 23 0 3 c 70 relative humidity and long day photoperiods of 16 h light and 8 h dark settings in the second chamber were identical except for temperature which was set to 28 0 3 c the actual temperature and relative humidity in each of the plant growth chambers were recorded with two sensors at 30 min interval voltcraft dl 120th conrad electronic se germany relative air humidity and temperature at pheromone trap and trap log sites were recorded at 30 min intervals using sht21 sensors sensirion ag switzerland placed into a solar radiation shield 2 m above ground likewise we recorded bark temperature at 30 min intervals at the crown base of each trap log at four positions around the trunk top bottom and lateral sides using thermistor sensors ntcle305e4103sb vishay intertechnology inc all sensors were connected to a compact and multi purpose ftp data logger laboratory for electronic devices slovenian forestry institute slovenia the data were transferred automatically via gprs signal and were thus available in real time using the eemis sfi web application ames d o o and slovenian forestry institute slovenia 2 3 modelling temperatures 2 3 1 air temperature the air temperature 2 m above the ground was measured at every study site every 30 min as explained in section 2 2 in the application of the rity 2 model interpolated air temperature from the inca system was used haiden et al 2011 ogris 2017a b analysis and nowcasting contain several meteorological parameters of which we used only air temperature 2 m above the ground the update frequency of air temperature from the inca system is 1 h minimum mean and maximum daily air temperatures from the inca system were used in the rity 2 model the linear regression models for minimum mean and maximum daily air temperatures in the forest stand were calculated using measured air temperature at eight study sites in the forest stands as the target variable and interpolated air temperature from the inca system as the source variable estimates of minimum mean and maximum daily air temperatures in forest stands were then calculated using the appropriate regression coefficients 2 3 2 bark temperature to estimate daily minimum mean and maximum bark temperatures we used linear regression analysis with observed air temperature as the source variable and measured bark temperature as the target variable mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse were checked with two methods differing with respect to where the predicted bark temperature was modelled from 1 recorded air temperature at the site and 2 modelled air temperature see section 2 3 1 the latter method was used for mae calculation due to the additive effect of the modelled temperature in the final rity 2 model 2 3 3 daily effective thermal sums the daily and cumulative effective thermal sums for bark beetle development were calculated from the difference between the daily mean bark temperature and the lower developmental threshold dtl 8 3 c within the range of dtl and optimum temperature to 30 4 c wermelinger and seifert 1998 to avoid overestimating the effective thermal sum at bark temperatures above to we corrected the estimated daily thermal sums by calculating the effective bark temperature sum of a nonlinear model eq 1 baier et al 2007 for validation of the thermal sums we estimated bark temperatures using the formulas available in table 2 and table 3 the cumulative effective thermal sum was calculated over the entire study period 2 4 modelling the phenology of i typographus 2 4 1 modelling spring swarming and the onset of infestation to predict the onset of spring swarming and infestation we compared the observed onset of trap catches and trap log infestation with the observed thermal conditions for flight activity additionally the observed onset of spring swarming and host tree colonization by i typographus was compared with the cumulative thermal sum of the maximum air temperature above dtl accumulated from the latest date onwards using estimated temperature data baier et al 2007 set 1st april as the date threshold for the calculation of this thermal sum however according to slovenian records the onset of spring swarming and host tree colonization can occur as early as the beginning of march jurc 2008 ogris 2012 probably due to the lower latitude and influence of the mediterranean climate therefore we could not set 1st april as the starting date of the thermal sum calculation the latest date for calculation of the cumulative thermal sum for the onset of spring swarming and host tree colonization was determined with an iteration procedure in which the lowest mean absolute error of the predicted onset of spring swarming and host tree colonization was achieved 2 4 2 modelling brood development in order to describe the relation between the developmental rate of i typographus and temperature we used both a linear function with only dtl see eq a 7 and a nonlinear function as proposed by wermelinger and seifert 1998 and used by baier et al 2007 effective temperatures for development from the egg stage to the emergence of mature filial beetles were adapted using to and dtl and upper developmental thresholds dtu 38 9 c effective temperature teff was estimated using a nonlinear function with the assumption that the relative developmental rate increases linearly within the range of dtl and to and that the relative developmental rate is equal to 1 at to fig 1 for temperatures outside the lower and upper temperature thresholds t dtl and t dtu teff was set to zero the effective temperature between to and dtu was calculated with eq 1 the parameters of which were estimated by baier et al 2007 by means of nonlinear regression analysis 1 teff to dtl exp α t exp α tmax tmax t β γ where α 0 02876507 β 3 5922336 γ 1 24657367 tmax 40 9958913 teff 0 when t dtl and t dtu a thermal sum of 557 dd is required for the total development of i typographus baier et al 2007 relative thermal sums for the egg larval pupal and maturation feeding stages are 9 3 37 0 10 4 and 43 3 respectively wermelinger and seifert 1998 the phenology model also calculates the formation of sister broods sister broods or re emergence is a phenomenon common to the spruce bark beetle and several other species of the scolytinae subfamily davídková and doležal 2017 after mating the female deposits the first brood it may then re emerge and after regeneration feeding re enter the same or a different tree to produce one or more so called sister broods anderbrant and löfqvist 1988 wermelinger and seifert 1999 re emergence means that females finish ovipositon re emerge from a gallery system and replenish their energy reserves by so called regeneration feeding in phloem wermelinger and seifert 1999 we used a relative thermal sum of 50 expressed as a percentage of the thermal sum required for total development i e 278 5 dd for modelling the re emergence of parental beetles eq a 13 baier et al 2007 a conceptual diagram summarizing the main steps of the rity 2 model calculation is presented in fig 2 detailed description of the model computation along with the formulae is given in appendix a 2 5 simulation and mapping of phenology using rity 2 spatial modelling and mapping of the phenology and potential development of i typographus in slovenia was conducted for the period 2016 2018 for each grid cell 1000 m 1000 m n 18 873 where norway spruce is present the onset of swarming onset of infestation development rate and number of generations were calculated based on estimated daily minimum mean and maximum air temperatures and the daily thermal sum of effective bark temperature see appendix a fig 2 the phenology of i typographus was simulated with three scenarios using minimum mean and maximum daily temperatures labelled as the min avg and max scenarios respectively 2 6 model validation to validate the estimated minimum mean and maximum air temperature we used recorded air temperature data measured at each study site validation of the time series of observed and estimated

were used thermal sums of estimated bark temperatures were validated using the relative ratios of predicted and observed sums relative percentage mean error to determine the accuracy of the phenological model we compared the effective thermal sum computed with eq 1 using 30 min recorded bark temperatures at the date of imago emergence with the thermal sum required for the total development of one generation k 557 dd wermelinger and seifert 1998 netherer 2003 for validation of the predicted onset of emergence of filial beetles calculated from inca data we compared the estimated effective thermal sum at the date of emergence predicted by the model with k additionally a validation was done on the difference between daily and hourly temperature data on this basis a decision was made whether to use daily or hourly temperature data for model calculation the development rate was calculated with the min avg and max scenarios according to the btmin btavg and btmax effective bark temperatures respectively eqs a 4 a 9 the onset of swarming and infestation was always calculated using original uncorrected daily maximum air temperatures from the inca imax eqs a 10 and a 11 2 7 statistics data management and gis statistical analyses were performed using the r software environment for statistical computing r core team 2018 the following libraries were used within r rodbc ripley and lapsley 2017 desctools signorell et al 2018 and raster hijmans 2016 linear relations were analysed using linear regression analysis a one sample kolmogorov smirnov test was applied to verify normal distribution of test variables pairs of means were compared using the paired sample t test deviations of the mean of a single variable from a specified test value were tested by the one sample t test we used microsoft sql server 2016 as a database for modelling and calculation of thermal sums for predicting phenological events mapping was done with the esri arcmap 10 6 1 graphs were drawn with microsoft excel for office 365 16 0 3 results 3 1 climatic model 3 1 1 air temperature measured daily minimum mean and maximum air temperatures were lower than the modelled air temperatures from the inca system by 18 19 and 14 on average respectively table 2 the estimated minimum mean and maximum air temperatures correlated significantly with the observed values p 0 001 the variance explained r2 with the linear models was high and ranged between 0 88 and 0 96 the mean absolute error mae was lowest for estimated daily maximum air temperature 1 07 c and highest for estimated daily minimum air temperature 1 67 c estimated daily minimum mean and maximum air temperatures showed a root mean square error of 2 19 1 59 and 1 46 c respectively the grand mean of the ratio between the sum of estimated versus recorded daily minimum mean and maximum air temperatures was 100 81 100 04 and 99 55 respectively 3 1 2 bark temperature observed bark temperatures at the eight trap logs showed highly significant correlations to air temperatures table 3 the variance explained with the linear models was high for the daily minimum and mean bark temperatures r 2 0 93 p 0 001 however the linear model for the daily maximum bark temperature explained a lower but still moderately high proportion of the variance r 2 0 70 and the relation to the observed daily maximum air temperature was still significant p 0 001 the mean absolute error mae for the daily minimum and daily mean bark temperatures was 0 82 and 0 60 c respectively the mae for the daily maximum bark temperature was higher i e 2 20 c based on these results the daily minimum mean and maximum bark temperatures were estimated using the equations given in table 3 additionally the mae was checked with modelled air temperatures table 2 the mae for daily minimum and daily mean bark temperature was approx twice as high i e 1 60 and 1 14 c respectively table 3 the mae of daily maximum bark temperature was slightly higher in comparison to the linear model from observed daily maximum air temperature 2 58 c furthermore a similar analysis for hourly data was performed table 3 the variance explained with the linear models was also high for the hourly minimum mean and maximum bark temperatures r 2 0 84 p 0 001 but was lower in comparison to the daily data moreover mae and rmse were higher for the hourly models in comparison to the daily models therefore daily models for temperature calculation were used for rity 2 3 1 3 daily effective thermal sum the estimated daily effective thermal sum showed a mean absolute error of 0 83 dd 0 87 dd and 0 98 dd for minimum mean and maximum bark temperatures respectively table 4 the correlation between the estimated and observed daily thermal sum was relatively high for minimum mean and maximum bark temperatures r2 0 89 0 88 and 0 85 respectively the modelled cumulative effective thermal sum for the whole study period showed a mean absolute error of 42 7 dd 50 0 dd and 61 7 dd for minimum mean and maximum bark temperatures respectively table 4 the variability explained between the estimated and observed cumulative thermal sum was low and not significant mean cumulative observed and estimated thermal sums did not differ significantly table 5 the mean ratio between the estimated and observed thermal sums ranged from 96 5 to 98 9 table 5 3 2 phenology model of ips typographus 3 2 1 spring swarming and onset of infestation bark beetles were captured in pheromone traps when the daily mean maximum air temperature atmax exceeded 16 4 c our observations indicate that i typographus initiated flight activity at a daily minimum observed atmax of 13 0 c which corresponds to the interpolated air temperature from the inca imax of 14 5 c the latter was used as the threshold for the phenological model calculation see appendix a major flight the first day with a catch 100 individuals than that of last counting occurred on days when atmax was above 19 9 c the first attacks of i typographus on trap logs in spring were observed at a mean atmax of 19 3 1 4 c initial infestation of trap logs occurred 7 52 days after the onset of swarming table 6 the longest gap of 52 days between onset of swarming and onset of infestation occurred at the highest location prevala locations with lower elevation had lower delay of initial infestation after onset of swarming i e 7 17 days table 1 and table 6 the earliest onset of swarming occurred at the vodice location which had the lowest altitude on 16 03 2017 therefore the accumulation of thermal sum needed for initial swarming had to start before that date the lowest mean absolute error for the prediction of the onset of swarming and infestation was determined with an iterative procedure the latest lowest mae was achieved on 7th march and stayed almost constant to 1st february fig 3 therefore we selected the 7th march as spring threshold from which calculation of the phenological model initiates besides the lower air temperature thresholds for flight activity and initial colonization of trees atmax 16 4 and 19 3 c respectively which may occur occasionally on warmer days during the winter period other factors might prevent hibernating beetles to resume their reproductive activities too early in the season our observations indicate that flight activity is initiated when the thermal sum atmax 8 3 c accumulated from the 7th march onwards was on average 53 0 11 6 dd the first colonization of trap logs was observed when the thermal sum reached 155 6 54 2 dd table 6 the estimated thermal sum atmax 8 3 c for the onset of swarming and infestation was calculated directly from the daily maximum air temperature from the inca system imax without transformation using linear models from table 2 eqs a 10 and a 11 for validation of the onset of swarming and infestation we compared the observed thermal sum with referenced values provided by baier et al 2007 the thermal sum for the onset of swarming 53 0 dd was not significantly different from the test value of 60 54 dd t 1 436 d f 11 p 0 179 similarly the thermal sum for the onset of infestation 155 6 dd was not significantly different from the test value of 140 26 dd t 0 727 d f 5 p 0 500 using the accumulated thermal sum in combination with the flight activity and date threshold the onset of spring swarming was estimated with a mean absolute error of 2 4 days and the onset of trap log colonization in spring was estimated with an mae of 4 7 days table 6 the difference between the observed and predicted onset of swarming of 12 pheromone traps was 5 days earlier at minimum and 5 days later at maximum the difference between the observed and predicted onset of infestation of 6 trap logs was 10 days earlier at minimum and 6 days later at maximum table 6 3 2 2 brood development all four trap logs felled in 2017 were colonized and two of the four trap logs felled in 2018 were attacked by i typographus table 6 however the trap log from the mokrc location had only 15 entrance holes all of which were used for monitoring of development stages although only five trap logs were monitored until the emergence of filial beetles altogether 13 sample chunks were monitored in the growth chambers at two constant temperatures 23 c and 28 c every day with different onsets of infestation for validation of brood development rate we compared the observed onset of emergence of filial beetles with the thermal sum of 30 min measured bark temperatures at four positions around the trunk eqs a 7 a 9 the thermal sum at the time of emergence was not significantly different from the test value k 557 dd for both observed and predicted emergence from hourly and daily data p 0 05 table 7 the mean deviations me of the calculated thermal sum from the required thermal sum 557 dd ranged from 7 2 to 13 7 dd for hourly data and 0 5 to 1 0 dd for daily data table 7 therefore daily air temperature was used to calculate the phenological model see appendix a 3 2 3 modelling developmental stages the duration of three developmental stages was observed i e egg larval and a combination of the pupal and teneral adult stages the relative duration of the developmental stage of i typographus was calculated with regard to the thermal sum required for total development k 557 dd the mean duration of egg larvae and combined pupae teneral adult development was 7 4 34 2 and 58 4 respectively table 8 in accordance with the reference values provided by wermelinger and seifert 1998 the mean difference for the duration of the egg stage was 2 0 shorter the larval stage was 2 8 shorter and the combination of pupal and maturation feeding was 4 8 longer table 8 thus the phenology model was calculated with reference values for the duration of the developmental stages 4 discussion rity 2 is based on the phenips model the rity 2 model was validated and calibrated with field studies carried out in 2017 and 2018 there are several differences between rity 1 rity 2 and phenips which are presented in the table 9 rity 2 has 102 6 dd and phenips has 79 7 dd gap between onset of swarming and onset of infestation the rity 2 larger gap between onset of swarming and onset of infestation could be simply a consequence of high variability of the data i e 95 confidence interval for onset of infestation was 54 2 dd which is more than twice as the gap between rity 2 and phenips i e 22 8 dd table 9 it is imperative to consider that our study sites were carefully selected to simulate a typical stand environment which is shaded or half shaded by canopy therefore the equations for the calculation of air and bark temperatures eqs a 1 a 6 correspond to and are only valid for shaded half shaded conditions by comparison first version of phenips used the maximum incoming radiation for computation of temperatures without consideration of shading by the canopy baier et al 2007 phenips simulates the maximum number of possible generations whereas rity 2 uses three scenarios min avg and max to simulate different conditions in the forest stand the min and max scenarios are considered as extreme possible development rates of i typographus the slowest and the fastest respectively in the future rity 2 could be upgraded to include relevant scenarios that would reflect shade and other conditions of specific site furthermore our study had a small sample consisting of 12 pheromone traps and only eight trap logs felled at different locations with different elevations aspects and slopes furthermore the trap logs were located in only two of the six biogeographical regions dinaric and pre alpine an additional set of pheromone traps were set up in the alpine region in 2018 although slovenia is relatively small in area it is comprised of the alpine pre alpine dinaric pre dinaric pre pannonian and submediterranean biogeographical regions all of which have their own climatic conditions and typical forest habitat types zupančič et al 1987 we were therefore not able to fully capture the overall variability of the spatiotemporal dynamics of i typographus in slovenia we believe that a larger sample that would consider all biogeographical regions in slovenia equally would give somewhat different thresholds and parameters of rity 2 following the same calibration procedure both phenips and rity 2 can be used at any location however regional specific thresholds need to be calibrated and validated to reflect specific conditions of the region we used the linear and nonlinear functions from phenips for simulating bark beetle development baier et al 2007 the nonlinear function is based on quantitative experimental data on developmental thresholds and thermal sums wermelinger and seifert 1998 1999 netherer 2003 this allowed accurate simulation of both preimaginal development and maturation of young adults mean relative error 0 2 table 7 furthermore the duration of developmental stages and completion of preimaginal development was predicted accurately by the model at the end of the growing season since only the adult stage of i typographus can successfully survive cold winters faccoli 2002 netherer 2003 štefková et al 2017 determination of the status of brood development i e uncompleted generations at the end of the season allows us to predict the winter survival rate of local populations temperature regulate the onset of swarming in the spring however the mechanism regulating the end of winter diapause is not yet sufficiently clear doležal and sehnal 2007 koštál et al 2011 schebeck et al 2017 generally the onset of swarming occurs before 1st april in slovenia therefore the accumulation of the thermal sum must begin before that date we used an iterative procedure for determining the lowest mean absolute error for prediction of the onset of swarming and infestation the latest lowest mae was achieved on 7th march and stayed constant to 1st february fig 3 therefore the 7th march was chosen as spring threshold from which calculation of the phenological model initiates in bavaria southern germany zang et al 2015 developed an interesting alternative method for prediction of the onset of spring swarming their model uses plant phenology by employing the two phenological phases of the first flowering of the common snowdrop galanthus nivalis l and leaf budburst of horse chestnut aesculus hippocastanum l which proved to be more robust and accurate than the thermal sum based forecast generally our observations showed better results when we used daily temperature data as opposed to hourly data table 3 daily minimum and mean bark temperatures yielded a lower mean absolute error and root mean square error compared to hourly data only daily maximum bark temperature had a higher mae and rmse than hourly data the thermal sum for total development was again more accurately predicted with daily temperature data table 7 better results were achieved with daily temperature data due to generalization of the diurnal variation of temperature however only a linear model was tested we believe that better results could be achieved for hourly data with a non linear model e g sinusoidal function provided by pal arya 1988 as bark temperature always includes a time lag with respect to air temperature air temperatures measured at 2 m above ground in the forest at eight study sites were 14 20 lower than temperatures in the open analysed by the inca table 2 fowells 1948 conducted a study on the vertical temperature profile of coniferous forest average maximum temperature decreases with increasing height and average minimum temperature increases with increasing height therefore the cumulative thermal sum was generally underestimated by 1 1 3 5 in the avg scenario table 5 fig b1 which suggests that the rity 2 prediction of the development rate is slower than observed in order to cover all possibilities and to avoid possible underestimations the min avg and max scenarios are calculated with the model additionally small differences between the calculation of air temperatures in the forest and air temperatures in the open provided by inca 14 20 lower see regression coefficient b in linear models presented in table 2 result in relatively large differences in the cumulative thermal sum between different scenarios in the min scenario 20 lower air temperature this may indicate one filial generation per year and in the max scenario 14 lower air temperature four generations per year fig b3 therefore point based and site specific predictions require fine tuning to achieve higher probability estimates point based and site specific predictions are dealt with in phenips whereas rity 2 solves this problem by employing the three different scenarios used for calculation of the phenological model as previously mentioned the most probable development rate is 1 1 3 5 faster than the avg scenario many aspects of phenips and rity 2 could be further improved for instance diapause initiation is implemented in a very strict manner where only day length 14 5 h is considered even though it is well known that facultative diapause is induced by photoperiod that can be modified by temperature doležal and sehnal 2007 schebeck et al 2017 additionally the model could be improved with procedures which would consider brood development in november or even in december before first day of freezing and brood developing during winter however all those critical aspects of phenips could not be considered and improved in rity 2 due to the project resources limitations but stay opportunities for implementation in future versions of the model we developed two public web applications of rity 2 the first is point based and produces a chart of relative thermal sums of the predicted development of i typographus according to the min avg and max scenarios for any location in slovenia ogris 2018a similar to fig b1 the second web application is spatial and produces several maps in a time series of the predicted development of i typographus for the whole region of slovenia ogris 2018b the maps show the onset of spring swarming onset of infestation of different broods development of developmental stages of spruce bark beetle for several filial and sister broods and number of filial and sister broods for any chosen date e g fig b2 the source codes for both applications are publicly available ogris 2019a b we developed rity 2 to improve the efficiency of bark beetle monitoring from the onset of swarming until the end of the first generation which are both locally specific the model is calculated every day from 7th march to 31st october and predicts key dates seven days in advance which allows the timely set up and removal of traps an automatic e messaging system was developed to inform 14 regional and 69 local units of the slovenia forest service about the predicted onset of swarming and completion of first filial generation e mail to each of regional and local units of the slovenia forest service is sent every day from 7th march to 31st october and includes a table with predicted dates onset of swarming and completion of first filial generation and two maps a map for the predicted onset of swarming and a map for the predicted end of development of the first filial brood these maps help the slovenia forest service to set up and remove pheromone traps in a timely manner as this is important for evaluation of i typographus population abundance at the trap location when the catch in the trap from the beginning of spring swarming until the end of the first generation exceeds 9 000 beetles an outbreak is imminent and an attack on healthy host trees can be expected rs 2009 once the risk threshold has been overcome several control strategies can be applied i e increasing the number of traps mass trapping setting up trap trees conducting a more careful survey of spruce forests and eventually cutting recently attacked trees via sanitation programmes faccoli and stergulc 2004 2006 all of these actions are carried out to keep i typographus populations at endemic levels thus avoiding outbreaks and subsequent damage rity 2 can be applied for assessing the likelihood of outbreaks by modelling the regional potential development of the bark beetle for simulation of the maximum number of generations additionally the utilization of detailed data on air temperature for modelling bark temperatures provides a precise monitoring of the actual state of bark beetle development at the specific model grid cell easy application of the rity 2 model for the whole of central europe with data from the inca system could be performed data from the inca system enable model outputs with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km and cover an area from central france in the west to central bulgaria in the east and from central greece in the south to central lithuania in the north rity 2 uses a three day prediction of numerical weather model aladin 2016 and extrapolates the trend to seven days to predict future development of i typographus a similar procedure could be used for the whole of central europe as the inca system also includes global radiation as an output variable it is possible to use the phenips procedure to calculate air temperature from global radiation finally comparison of the rity 2 procedure direct use of air temperature and the phenips procedure air temperature from global radiation should be performed to reveal the impact on the prediction accuracy of the phenological model funding this work was supported by the ministry of agriculture forestry and food and the slovenian

development and can successfully hibernate as young adults therefore initiated generations with relative thermal sums 0 6 are ignored when calculating the total number of potential generations per year additionally the model is calculated only for grid cells containing appropriate host trees norway spruce for i typographus appendix b b 1 demonstration of the phenology model using the daily data output of the inca system the timing of the key phenological events in the bark beetle life cycle was simulated for the study area with the modelling procedures of rity 2 see eqs a 10 a 15 these include the 1 onset of swarming 2 onset of infestation start of development 3 cumulative sum of effective bark temperature of parental sister and filial generations and finally 4 total number of generations the accuracy of our model in estimating bark beetle phenology is demonstrated by comparison between the recorded and predicted developmental conditions effective thermal sum and between the observed and predicted developmental stage of the beetles in trap trees at two selected sites vodice and brode in 2017 fig b1 the first site is located in a lowland area 330 m a s l the second site is located in the kamnik savinja alps at an altitude of 830 m and a wnw aspect table 1 using daily inca estimated air temperatures for analysis of bark beetle development at trap logs the estimated thermal sum at the time of emergence showed a lower variability than calculated with hourly recorded data however the mean value calculated from the inca system was not significantly different from the required thermal sum for total development test value k 557 dd and deviated by 1 0 dd table 7 at the vodice location the rity 2 model predicted two filial broods and two sister broods fig b1 both filial broods and the first sister brood completed the total development cycle however the second sister brood reached 66 of the relative thermal sum required for total development by the end of october 2017 indicating the teneral adult developmental stage and the start of maturation feeding since the second sister brood exceeded 60 of the relative thermal sum required for total development the model assumes that this brood will successfully overwinter and will conclude development in the spring the predicted onset of swarming coincided with the observed onset of swarming however the predicted onset of infestation was one day later than observed the estimated start time of the egg and larval developmental stages was two and eight days later than observed respectively the predicted pupal developmental stage initiated two days earlier than observed the model predicted two filial brood and one sister brood at the higher elevation location at brode fig b1 however for the second filial brood that started development on 27th july 2017 development already stopped on 18th october at 65 of the relative thermal sum and remained at that level until the end of the october therefore the second filial brood at this location was estimated to overwinter successfully the predicted onset of swarming was four days later than observed and the predicted onset of infestation was six days later than observed the delay was even more evident later the predicted egg larval and pupal developmental stages started six eight and ten days later than observed respectively the point based comparison revealed high conformity between the phenological events predicted by the model at the local trap logs this indicates the possibility to precisely compute local temperature conditions inside the bark with the model the higher deviations between observed and predicted events might be due to uncertainties in weekly control intervals and to variability in beetle life processes that are not temperature dependent however the application of rity 2 using detailed data of site specific conditions can detect relevant differences in the phenology of i typographus the predicted onset of swarming was initiated on 1 5 of the model area before 15 03 2017 fig b2b the onset of swarming in 2017 was most frequently predicted between 15 03 and 31 03 90 7 of the study area in 2018 the onset of swarming was initiated later in the season in 60 of the model area the predicted onset of swarming occurred between 01 04 and 15 04 2018 before 15 03 2018 the onset of swarming was predicted on only 0 1 of the model area between 15 03 and 31 03 2018 the onset of swarming was predicted on 20 7 of the model area fig b2b the model enables the spatial prediction of developmental stages for seven days in advance fig b2 c shows an example for 01 07 for both 2017 and 2018 the most prevalent developmental stage on 01 07 was estimated by the model to be the maturation feeding stage at 63 6 and 49 4 of the model area in 2017 and 2018 respectively the imago stage was predicted on 7 2 and 25 2 of the model area in 2017 and 2018 respectively fig b2c the development rate was calculated with the min avg and max scenarios according to the three effective bark temperatures eqs a 4 a 6 and a 7 a 9 where the avg scenario corresponds to shade half shade stand conditions there were distinct differences in the predicted number of filial generations per year given by the different scenarios in the min scenario only one generation per year was prevalent in both 2017 and 2018 fig b3 however in 2018 two generations of i typographus were already present on 35 8 of the model area with appropriate hosts whereas in 2017 two generations were completed on only 3 7 of the model area in the avg scenario two filial generations were completed on 73 4 and 78 8 of the model area in 2017 and 2018 respectively fig b2a and fig b3 up to three generations per year were predicted by the avg scenario however three generations were completed on only up to 0 2 of the model area in both 2017 and 2018 in the max scenario four generations per year were frequently predicted by the model but three generations were most often completed in this scenario in the max scenario the thermal sum required for completion of three generations accumulated on 51 6 and 59 7 of the model area in 2017 and 2018 respectively fig

24986,accurate predictions of weed seed dispersal are important for spatial modelling of weed population dynamics however there are few multi year data sets available and they are seldom analysed well here we gathered together and re examined population growth and seed spread data from three grass weed species over 3 years using a new seed spread function in the simulation model somer it was possible to accurately parametrise population growth and seed spread to replicate the field data of apera spica venti apesv and bromus sterilis brost in contrast the greatest increases in alopecurus myosuroides alomy numbers occurred in the direction of machinery movement which could not be predicted using this function a probability sum exponential type function gave an excellent fit to the field data for apesv and brost with changes in seed spread distances due to species differences wind and shading from the hedge accommodated by alterations in the scale shape and wind dispersal parameters here we describe a method of parametrising the probability function from within a stochastic simulation working within the simulation allowed empirical population size data sets to be successfully parameterised without mathematical integration this function is fully explained with stochastic simulated examples and fitted to various two dimensional longitudinal data sets enough detail to enable its parametrisation including simplification within a majority of spatial stochastic population models is included keywords spatial population models simulation crop weeds two

of a field based on the current spatial weed distribution within the field sswm requires accurate weed maps even better sswm is possible if the locations and density of the current season s annual weeds can be predicted prior to their emergence however predicting weed germinations is difficult cardina et al 1997 the locations of germinating weed seeds are impacted by a multitude of factors weed seed dispersal is influenced by the phenology of the weed species including shedding date walsh and powles 2014 plant height walsh et al 2016 and seed characteristics reuss et al 2001 in addition external factors such as crop choice the environment and anthropogenic processes colbach et al 2000 cousens et al 2008 metcalfe et al 2018 can have significant effects on weed seed dispersal analysis of the interactions between weed phenology and these various external factors will highlight significant factors for each species in determining the final dispersal patterns of its seeds blanco moreno et al 2006 once these interactions have been quantified the emphasis within subsequent weed prediction modelling can be adjusted to incorporate only the most relevant factors here we focus on predicting the spread of three annual grass weeds within a wheat crop a longitudinal dataset was used consisting of tiller counts of the weeds alopecurus myosuroides alomy apera spica venti apesv and bromus sterilis brost which had been recorded annually for 3 years this analysis attempted to match this data by investigating interactions between the effects of a sheltering hedge and directional wind which have varying degrees of importance to seed spread depending on the phenology of the weed species a recent review of weed seed dispersal found that very few studies incorporated directional wind bullock et al 2017 although bullock et al 2003 did identify interactions between wind harvest date and seed dispersal direction for the grassland plant rhinanthus minor in addition very few studies have fitted parameters to weed seed spread using empirical data at the population compared to individual level which was identified as an important consideration by chapman and gray 2012 measuring and analysing seed spread at the population level is much simpler when the field is subdivided into small square cells the use of cells means that there will be a discrete number of places for the seeds to land however typically seed spread is parameterised as distance travelled using a continuous one dimensional equation predicting seed spread between discrete two dimensional cells means that initial continuous one dimensional equations are first parameterised and then mathematically integrated colbach and sache 2001 metcalfe et al 2018 whilst the addition of wind and shelter belts can add further mathematical complexity wang et al 2001 there are alternatives to the use of mathematical integration to analyse seed spread in two dimensions when seed spread radiates from a point simpler equations have been used across either circular angles or hexagonal cells gonzález andújar et al 1999 paice et al 1998 however our desire to incorporate both square cells and longitudinal population based data means that the required two dimensional seed spread equation needed to be more complex fortunately the initial longitudinal dataset measured changes in population size tiller counts in discrete two dimensional cells meaning this data could be replicated using simulation modelling the equations could then be parameterised whilst running within a simulation model thereby removing the need for later mathematical integration our aim here is to parameterise two dimensional seed spread within a population model we will maximise fit to spatial data which was previously recorded over 3 years using a stochastic spatial population model thereby avoiding the need for mathematical integration we will fit the equation to each of the three weed species alomy apesv and brost each with quite different phenologies and dispersal characteristics finally we aim to add the parameterisation of a both directional wind and a sheltering hedgerow and study their influence on the spread of seed from these three weed species 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental background for 3½ years from autumn 1997 the spread of three grass weed species alomy apesv and brost within sequential winter wheat crops was recorded at flakkebjerg zealand in denmark christensen 2000 heisel et al 2002 records were kept of their annual spatial spread across 420 m2 of wheat fields at two sites with hedgerows that are referred to here as the less sheltered and more sheltered sites each species was broadcast sown in a separate plot in autumn 1997 in a row approx 1 m wide and 21 m long next to the hedgerows with 10 m between each plot appendix a the less sheltered site had a hedgerow running in an east west direction parallel to most winds on the south side of the plots at the more sheltered site the hedgerow ran in the north south direction and was on the predominantly windward side of the site christensen 2000 during the 3½ years of the experiment the plots were neither ploughed nor sprayed for weeds after the initial sowing of the weed seeds each years wheat crop was sown using no till techniques and cut and bailed after weed seed dispersal heisel et al 2002 a later harvesting date was used to maximise natural weed seed dispersal although some weed seed appears to have been still unshed and spread during the mowing process fig 1 a total of three plots one for each species within each field 6 plots in total are examined here tiller numbers were recorded within 420 cells of 1 m2 for dates see appendix a with records kept out to 20 m from the hedgerow plots were 21 by 20 m meaning that any spread beyond the 20 m was not recorded weeds were originally counted within one random 0 25 m2 sample within each cell with counts recorded on a log type scale fig 1 it was assumed both in that record keeping and in these simulations that there were no annual weeds growing within the hedgerows these published christensen 2000 heisel et al 2002 and unpublished historical records were combined to produce data appendix b which we could then attempt to replicate using the spatial population model the records examined more closely within this paper are row averages on the same log type scale calculated for each row parallel to the hedge for both the empirical data and the spatial simulations using row averages for comparisons between the empirical data and the simulations allowed us to account for stochastic variability within rows fig 1 we used the more detailed information available from the more sheltered site fig 1 in addition annual 1997 2001 birds eye views of all three grass weed species for both fields were also assembled from original records and are included for completeness fig 1 more realistic row averages were calculated by first converting the log type values into estimated weed counts which were combined using an arithmetic mean row averages were calculated for data from november 1997 and june 1998 and used to calculate the increase in weed counts over this period 2 2 somer model this research uses somer a stochastic simulation model which spatially divides the weed population the resulting spatial sub populations allow the addition of crop dependent seed and pollen spread localised inter and intra specific competition and also weed seed collection dispersal and destruction during crop harvest somerville et al 2017b we aimed to replicate the yearly row tiller averages for the more sheltered site utilising somer in order to parametrise weed seed spread of alomy apesv and brost within a winter wheat crop simulations using somer ran for 3 years using the tiller counts conducted in june 1998 as the initial populations the simulation model used here is described more fully in somerville et al 2017b each 420 m2 plot was replicated using sub populations based in cells which were created by overlaying a checker board type design the probability of seed spreading between cells was based on intercellular distances the probability of seeds being retained within each home cell was estimated by assuming that weeds within the home cell were an average distance of half the cell width away from any seed settling position within that same home cell individual probability maps were designed for seed spread from each cell showing where its seeds were more likely or less likely to be deposited throughout the plot the sum of each cell s seed spread probability map equalled one when we included seed lost over the edges of the 420 m2 plots any seed determined to have landed outside the plot was removed from the simulations the biological parameters of the three weed species and the wheat crop used in the simulations were based on previously assembled data with minor alterations to allow the original growth curves to be replicated table 1 2 3 seed production and competition for all three weed species sequential weed germinations influenced seed production levels fitness with the earliest germinating weeds cohort 1 producing more seeds than later germinating cohorts table 2 end of year weed counts generated within somer are used stochastically to produce the next year s seeds somerville et al 2017b however for this particular application the end of year counts were tiller numbers rather than weed numbers links between plant number tiller number and seed production are highly variable dalbiès dulout and doré 2001 moss 1985 for this field we found that doubling production levels accounted for these differences across all three weed species within the somer model weed seed production each year for alomy and apesv weeds was calculated using a hyperbolic competition function firbank and watkinson 1986 somerville et al 2017a seed production per square metre for each of the four weed cohorts i 1 4 was calculated thus 1a s e e d p r o d u c t i o n i 2 m a x i m u m p o s s i b l e p r o d u c t i o n d e n s i t y i f i t n e s s i 1 j 1 5 d e n s i t y j f i t n e s s j where the weed cohorts are also represented by j 1 4 and for the crop j 5 in addition f i t n e s s 5 included a competition coefficient to account for the differences in fitness between wheat and the weed species unfortunately replicating the empirical brost data using eq 1a after testing a wide variety of biological parameters as well as alternative scale and shape parameters proved impossible therefore for brost a slightly more complex competition function was necessary eq 1b the competition function for brost was based on results in kleemann and gill 2009 and is explained further in appendix c seed production for all of the four brost cohorts i 1 4 within each cell was calculated from a log normal distribution where x i 1 4 d e n s i t y i f i t n e s s i 1b s e e d p r o d u c t i o n x 2 877 1 2 π 1 4 x 100 e x p l o g x 100 3 1 2 2 1 4 2 2 4 seed spread calculations 2 4 1 seed spread probability function the two dimensional seed spread probabilities calculated for these simulations are based on the summation of an exponential type function eq 2 an exponential type function is very generic with the k parameter controlling the functions shape for example k 1 is an exponential function and k 2 gives a gaussian curve an exponential type function was used here firstly because it fit the data well secondly similar functions have been found useful previously to parametrise seed spread for different weed species colbach et al 2018 and finally because the biological realism of using a summed exponential type function for seed spread is strong as maximal seed reception is predefined here at 100 and minimal seed reception is predefined at zero motulsky and christopoulos 2004 alternative seed spread equations using the negative binomial distribution gonzález andújar and saavedra 2003 the exponential distribution and the gaussian distribution wang et al 2008 were considered but did not fulfil these criteria in addition these distributions are less adaptable as they contain only one independent variable whereas here we use two variables which allows wider adaptability for different species and environments work on two dimensional seed spread probabilities using an exponential type dispersal function was conducted by sagnard et al 2007 2011 here we take this work further by allowing seed to spread to unsampled areas including areas beyond the bounds of the plot alternative seed spread parametrisations were tested against a variety of population growth parameters with an aim to produce annual changes between graphs of grass weed spread which most closely replicated the annual spatial spread recorded in the original more sheltered field based results the probability of seeds being spread between cells was estimated for different seed spread parameterisations and at two alternate cell sizes of 1 m2 and ½ m2 the smaller cell sizes of ½ m2 were used in these results as some species spread their seeds less than one metre each year from each source cell c 00 seed spread into cell c i j was defined with a two parameter exponential function eq 2 which is used here to simulate the stochastic dispersal of 100 of the seed produced by these annual weeds 2 p i j e λ d i j k x y e λ d x y k where i is distance in the x direction and j is distance in the y direction λ is the scale parameter k is the shape parameter and the distance between c 00 and c i j is d i j i 2 j 2 alterations in the seed spread function to allow for greater or lesser seed spread distances were achieved by altering the scale parameter λ and the shape parameter k of eq 2 due to interactions between these two parameters and the stochastic nature of the simulations two parameter analysis was chosen to parameterise eq 2 this two parameter analysis was conducted using each year s data for each species in spring 1998 at the end of the first growing season the weeds were spread in a strip over two metres wide the model was parametrised with the initial seeds in rows 1 5 when rows in the model were ½ m wide the best shape and scale parameters could be determined for spread from each of these five rows minimising least square difference the second year weeds were also in rows 6 25 as apesv had spread out to 12 5 m so further analysis determined the shape and spread parameters for these additional rows which was then built on to predict the following year s weed locations and densities probable anthropogenic dispersal seen in brost in 1999 at arrow a in fig 1 was incorporated into the simulations by depositing 5 of the seeds produced in 1998 further from the hedge these seeds were dispersed 6 m from the hedge in a strip 2 3 m wide and 8 10 m long anthropogenic seed dispersal may also have occurred the next year as new outbreaks can be seen at a distance of 15 21 m from the hedgerow brost 2000 the cause of these tillers recorded at 15 21 m from the hedge in 2000 is unknown and they were not incorporated into the simulations 2 4 2 truncation distances eq 2 was designed to work with a finite number of equally sized cells which meant that a maximum truncated seed spread distance was required fig 2 the maximum seed spread truncation distance used for cells at different distances from the hedgerow varied between 35 and 50 m truncation meant that for any two cells c 00 and c i j where d i j is greater than the truncation distance the probability of seed moving between these two cells was zero a truncation distance of 35 m meant that some ground outside the 420 m2 plots was also included in these calculations to allow for seed loss over the boundary fig 2c at scale and shape parametrisations less than one truncation distances of 50 m were used because the maximum internal distance in these plots was 29 m the shape of the dispersal curve in the region beyond 29 m was immaterial even at very high dispersal rates λ 0 5 and k 0 6 the probability of seed loss outside the plot 0 03 did not change when the truncation distance in eq 2 varied from 35 m to 100 m due to this invariance we assumed that distributions within 29 m of the source would not change appreciably if a truncation maximum distance of 35 m was used table 3 to study the effect of changing the truncation distance two denominators x y e λ d x y k were calculated for eq 2 using two different truncation distances the proportional difference between these two sums indicated the probability of seeds being spread into the area between the two truncation distances table 3 eq 2 allowed any truncation distance to be chosen including truncation distances exceeding the maximum radius of the plot figs 2b 3 c once a truncation distance was chosen and the probabilities were calculated the seed from each cell were then stochastically distributed according to these probabilities using the rmultinom function in the hmisc package harrell and dupont 2018 in r however when using the rmultinom function it was necessary to include as one of the probabilities the probability of seed loss from the plot once a truncation distance was chosen then a network of cells was designed which entirely covered this area out to the truncation distance around a central cell fig 2a c e then the denominator of eq 2 x y e λ d x y k was calculated using all cells within that group p x y was then the probability of seed spreading between any two cells which were d x y apart all cells which were the same distance from the hedgerow within the same row had identical seed spread probabilities which were invariant over time meaning that cells nearer the corners dispersed more seed outside the plot particularly when high dispersal rates were used 2 4 3 the effect of wind changing the scale and shape parameters in eq 2 allowed for greater dispersal distances for seed released in rows further from the hedge however this increase was insufficient to fully replicate apesv spread in this field meaning that an equation describing wind dispersal needed to be designed wind was considered as a force acting on seed dispersal with stronger forces acting on the weeds which grew further from the hedgerow in addition hedgerows create eddies which reduce the directional effect of wind close to the hedge particularly for denser hedgerows takahashi 1978 wang et al 2001 parameterisation of wind dispersal at distances from the hedgerow was based on graphs in wang et al 2001 the average hedgerow dimensions at the more sheltered site over the period of this study have been estimated at height h 1 3 m width w 3 h and porosity n 0 3 personal communication from farmer and the shedding height of apesv was estimated at z 0 8 m both a logistic aicc 171 and a sigmoid aicc 169 were fitted to the chosen curve the logistic function used eq 3 was implemented to reflect these parameters with decreases in wind strength occurring closer to the hedgerow the utilised logistic function for the directional wind speed w s p for seed dispersal from the simulated row r p when 8 r p 42 was 3 w s p 0 935 w i n d s p e e d 1 exp 8 35 r p 6 20 the average july wind speed of 4 2 m s 1 was used in all simulations plauborg 2019 the wind was assumed to be more turbulent within 4 m 8 simulated rows of the hedge wang et al 2001 and the directional effect in eq 3 was reduced accordingly a linear function was used to join the wind dispersal at 4 m rp 8 to a zero zero reading at d 0 assuming an easterly wind the apparent east to west distance for seed dispersal from row p to row q will be influenced by the real east to west distance from row p to row q the directional wind speed w s p and a further factor to account for the time the apesv seeds are in the air the lift and drag named here as the wind dispersal factor w d f fig 3 it is assumed that w p w d f is unitless 4a a p p a r e n t d i s t a n c e s e w p q r e a l d i s t a n c e e w p q 1 w s p w d f 4b a p p a r e n t d i s t a n c e s w e p q r e a l d i s t a n c e w e p q 1 w s p w d f where the ew calculations alter distances measured from east to west and will affect seeds dispersing more to the west and we calculations alter distances measured from west to east and will affect seeds travelling more to the east 3 results and discussion 3 1 increase in weed numbers november 1997 june 1998 initial weed counts for year one were completed in november autumn 1997 by the time of the first tiller count in june spring 1998 the numbers had increased table 4 and their distributions were more widespread fig 1 importantly this change in weed distribution was due solely to delayed seed germination and possible secondary seed movement chambers and macmahon 1994 as no new seeds were produced during this period the alomy numbers changed the least increasing 3 9 times with apesv exhibiting an intermediate increase by 4 7 times and the brost numbers increasing the most 5 3 times at the more sheltered site and 10 5 times at the less sheltered site from a much smaller initial population the increases in numbers and decreases in patchiness are measured over a single winter and are site specific meaning they are difficult to compare to other studies wallgren and avholm 1978 found strong spring germination but also found large inter year differences for both apesv and alomy in contrast brost germination can be inhibited by light hilton 1982 which may have slowed germination in the first year of this study appendix c in addition a change from counting seedlings in november to counting tillers in june was instigated christensen 2000 which further decreases the value of these as comparable results 3 2 growth and spread of alomy weeds june 1998 june 2001 during 1998 1999 and 2000 alomy weeds spread less than either apesv or brost fig 1 implying minimal wind assisted seed dispersal and meaning that alomy patches are fairly stable over time this replicates studies of alomy over longer time periods wilson and brain 1991 and more widespread areas freckleton et al 2018 alomy has relatively heavy seeds with a thousand kernel weight tkw of two grams and small awns melander 2011 which minimises wind borne transport although some alomy seed movement occurred in the less sheltered field prior to the counts completed in 2000 fig 1 it is unknown whether this was due to dispersal by wind animals or anthropogenic processes spread of this alomy population could not be successfully modelled using this two parameter exponential type function as the increase in weed numbers in already infested rows including new weeds in hitherto empty cells far outweighed the increase in weed numbers in newly infested rows that is sideways spread in the direction of machinery movement was much greater than spread away from the hedge out into the field it is also possible that crosswind forces close to the hedgerow wang et al 2001 facilitated this seed movement 3 3 growth and spread of apesv weeds june 1998 june 2001 during 1998 1999 and 2000 the apesv weeds spread further than either the alomy or the brost weeds aided by wind assisted seed dispersal the apesv tillers were taller than the wheat christensen 2000 and have light seeds tkw 0 1 g melander 2011 which probably increased seed spread minimised intraspecific competition and facilitated population growth melander 1993 in 1998 most of the seeds were produced within 1 5 m of the hedge and spread minimally although small numbers of seeds ended up further from the hedge this minimal initial spread was replicated by using larger parameters to simulate seed spread from these weeds which all grew within 1 5 m of the hedge in contrast in 1999 apesv plants and seed release occurred much further from the hedge the seeds spread much further in 1999 which could be replicated using different scale and shape parameters to control dispersal for seeds produced further than 1 5 m from the hedge it was not necessary to change the parameters used to simulate spread from plants within 1 5 of the hedgerow in 1998 in all instances it was unnecessary to change the parameters assigned to each row to simulate the seed spread in different years table 4 the wind dispersal factor of wdf was also unchanged between years figs 2 4 using wdf 1 equates to approximately a halving of the distance to rows on the windward side of the central row and a doubling of the apparent distance to rows on the leeward side of the central row from the central row of the plot fig 3 in contrast modelling and experiments by chapman and gray 2012 and wang et al 2008 found weed seeds typically travelled less than 5 m when windblown however their studies did not include an accompanying dense wheat crop which possibly provided additional lift by 2000 the apesv seeds were dispersed throughout the plot and probably much further which meant spread from 2000 to 2001 was impossible to parametrise with this function minimising the spread of weed seeds within a field has been identified as important in maximising crop production gonzález andújar et al 1999 figures in nordmeyer 2009 show annual movement of apesv patches of over 25 m without hedgerows and both negative and positive correlations over time the hedgerow in this field was very useful for slowing seed movement from field borders however the effect on apesv seed growing further from the hedgerow may be minimal 3 4 growth and spread of brost weeds june 1998 june 2001 during 1998 1999 and 2000 the brost dispersal distance was less than the alomy dispersal excepting that a small number of brost seeds were dispersed further during 1998 probably due to anthropogenic processes fig 1 in addition the brost seed spread further when their parent plant was located further from the hedge similar hedgerow sheltering and anthropogenic seed movement have been observed for brost in the uk rew et al 1996 brost seeds are very heavy tkw 6 4 g but possess awns melander 2011 which aid their movement 3 5 the effect of the sheltering hedge and wind direction in these field trials the seeds produced close to the hedgerows travelled less distance than seeds produced further from the hedge which implies that for all three species seed travel is decreased close to hedgerows the seed spread parameters of each row were dependent on its distance from the hedge but were equal in all directions except for the apesv spread in fig 4a which included increasing strength directional wind the results in fig 5b 5c did not include directional wind but did have steadily increasing seed dispersal further from the hedge except at a dead spot which was 1 5 2 m from the hedge where spread for both apera and brost was less table 4 the distance of the dead spot from the hedge was similar for these two diverse species and is here at least independent of weed biology similar dead spots have been recorded in other windbreak studies where distance porosity and width are critical factors takahashi 1978 wang et al 2001 in addition to this non directional increase at greater distance from the hedge increasing directional wind assisted seed dispersal was also used to more accurately simulate the spread of apesv fig 4a but was not necessary in brost simulations the use of reduced directional wind spread rates within 3 5 of the hedgerow coincides with turbulence discussed in wang et al 2001 however the apesv was probably tracked over insufficient distances 21 m to yield unfettered directional data meaning that the wind spread values wdf calculated here could well be exceeded in a more open field these results illustrate the usefulness of hedgerows surrounding cropped land even for reducing spread of unawned heavy seeds such as brost as well as their previously determined role in maintaining diverse fried et al 2008 and beneficial storkey and neve 2018 weed communities hedgerows could be very useful in slowing the spread of seeds from field borders particularly in unfavourable winds 3 6 the seed spread function and cell sizes seed spread was accurately simulated by using a truncated probability sum of an exponential type function eq 2 the same direct parameterisation technique of a similar two dimensional function has been used previously to model pollen spread within a stochastic spatial model somerville and renton 2015 somerville et al 2017b in those papers when biological pollen spread distances were altered changes in the scale parameter λ were sufficient to enable accurate regressions here it was also necessary to alter the shape parameter k and also add wind dispersal to the apesv simulation to allow for differences in seed spread when plants were located further from the hedgerow further work to parameterise seed spread for other species and other crops when more temporal and spatial datasets become available is warranted in datasets without hedges it is envisaged that a single parameterisation per species would be determined additionally in subsequent simulations an alternative to e λ d i j k could be parameterised using probability sum type function such as eq 2 in a simulation model like somer for example an exponential function e λ d i j has been used to simulate seed spread in a probability sum type function gonzález andújar 1995 a viable alternative to the exponential function also with only one variable for modelling seed spread is the gaussian curve e λ d i j 2 either equation could be fitted to temporal spatial datasets in a similar fashion to eq 2 within a simulation model however the use of two parameters allowing changes in both the scale and shape of the curve may be warranted when more variable environmental conditions exist the use of the smaller cells with an area of 0 5 m2 in the simulations was advantageous due to the smaller annual spread distances of some species it is likely that a maximum measure for cell width needed to be close to the minimal distance seed travels within one year in order to accurately simulate seed spread conversely the minimum measure for cell width needs to be large enough to capture the majority of inter species competition from a single weed plant growing within a cropped field somerville et al 2017b other research has examined wind dispersal where the peak distribution is at some distance from the parent plant resulting in crater shaped distribution curves greene and johnson 1989 wang et al 2008 in contrast the distributions used here were all cone shaped with the peak distribution centred on the home cell crater shaped distribution curves have been linked to species with well attached seeds which exhibit a minimal detachment speed requirement greene and johnson 1989 however detachment does not appear to be an issue for apesv avholm and wallgren 1976 due to the limited size of these plots wider dispersal limited reproductive efficacy both in the trials where weeds outside the plots were sprayed and within the simulations due to a loss of seed from the plots when the seeds were more widely dispersed they were more likely to land outside the confines of the plot further simulations on wind spread in small areas could use a wrapping technique to counter this seed loss somerville et al 2017b the objective of this study was to parameterise a two dimensional seed spread function using empirical population size datasets incorporating a new seed spread function in the simulation model somer made it possible to accurately parametrise population growth and seed spread a suitable equation for directional wind was identified and parameterised including the effect of a sheltering hedgerow directional wind was a necessary component of simulating the spread of apesv seeds but was not able to improve simulations of brost seed spread however including an increasing non directional wind strength at greater distances from the hedge excluding a dead spot at 1 5 2 metres from this hedge was necessary for both species parameterising a truncated probability sum function within the simulations made it possible to accurately replicate the empirical longitudinal datasets methods of parameterising seed spread functions using empirical population data will become more important in the future as more longitudinal in situ datasets become available funding the work was supported by the danish innovation fund who sponsor the project roboweedmaps 2017 2020 conflict of interest none appendix a original field work plan for the hedgerow project a 1 purpose the purpose of the field work was to replicate the spatial spread of three grass weeds from newly established hedgerows the test species were sown along the hedgerow of 2 sites at the research center flakkebjerg in 1997 the east west hedgerow the less sheltered site was a 160 m long and 3 row spruce planting and the north south hedgerow the more sheltered site was approx 100 m long and 4 m wide a 3 year old planting consisting of deciduous trees and bushes a 2 experimental plots at both sites 3 test plots were allocated an area of 21 20 m 21 m parallel to the hedgerow a gap of 10 m was used between each of the three test plots fig a1 each plot was divided into 420 cells of 1 m2 the weed species were spread in the first metre along the hedgerow in a mixture of soil before the winter wheat was sown wheat was sown with a rotary harrow immediately after ploughing in the first year table a1 winter wheat was grown each year in the 4 year trial period the test plots were not ploughed throughout the test period and weed control was not carried out however weed control was carried out outside the 21 20 m test plots including in the gaps to avoid weeds spreading into the test plots a 3 weed counts spring and autumn records of the numbers of each weed species were made in a 0 25 m2 square however only the individual species sown within that plot was recorded from 1999 onwards the grass tillers were counted after the wheat had tillered as they then protruded over the wheat and the counts became more accurate appendix b preliminary investigations on the raw data b 1 replicating the starting conditions of the experiment necessary factors for accurately simulating these results 1 the effect of the physical structure of the hedgerow on seed spread 2 the effect of directional wind on seed spread 3 the starting seed populations a the number of seeds initially spread along the edge of the plot b the initial seed locations were they placed in row zero outside the assessed area or within row one c the time of seed placement were the grass weed sown at the start of year one or during an earlier year zero were the plants counted in year one the progeny of those initial seeds or were they adult plants which grew from those initial seeds results of these preliminary investigations 1 the physical structure of the hedgerow did affect seed spread so that it was necessary to have more restrictive seed spread parameters for subpopulations closer to the hedge table 4 2 there were duplicated experiential records available from 2000 and 2001 gathered in two separate fields for each of the three weeds at the more sheltered site which supplied all the records used within this paper the hedgerow was along the windward side of the plots the apesv weeds at both sites had saturated the plot by 2000 fig 1 meaning that wind direction by then was immaterial the brost seeds were spread by anthropogenic processes at least twice fig 1 both alomy and brost show denser plot wide dispersal in 2001 at the less sheltered site compared to 2001 at the more sheltered site which hints at wind assisted dispersal in both these species however the variation in alomy and brost dispersal patterns between plots may also be due to inadvertent seed dispersal by anthropogenic processes 3 the initial population of weed seeds was scattered manually along the hedge line although records of the size location and age of this initial seed bank deposits were not unearthed in any detail 4 it was assumed that any seeds later spreading to and growing within the hedgerow would not produce and spread sufficient quantities of seed to affect this study 5 the year two weed counts from spring 1998 were used to calculate the starting populations however earlier weed counts also existed from november 1997 these early season weed counts had a very different relationship to reproductive output and separate increase rates were calculated accordingly table 4 6 of the three species examined here the brost grass seemed particularly sensitive to anthropogenic seed dispersal within this origional field trial b 2 interspecific competition unfortunately competition from other weed species occurred in later years of these simulations in addition 2001 was a low yielding year in many of the subpopulations fig 1 weed tiller numbers dropped between 2000 and 2001 b 3 anthropogenic seed dispersal bands of darker colour in the brost more sheltered site have been highlighted and explained as anthropogenic seed dispersal fig 1 the accidental anthropogenic seed dispersal the crop was late harvested cut and bailed going into 1999 was included in the simulations as a specific event simulating the collection of just 5 of all seed produced in rows closer to the hedgerow in late 1998 and their subsequent deposit in the striped area indicated by arrow a in fig 1 in early 1999 resulted in a replication of the desired bump in fig 4 however additional accidental anthropogenic dispersal events in later year s were not included in the simulations as they were spatially separate from the main weed infestation on the right side of the plots and could therefore be ignored when tracking typical seed movement on the left side of the plots appendix c brost competition based on results in kleemann and gill 2009 kleemann and gill 2009 in table 4 recorded both weed density and seed production m 2 for populations of brori bromus rigidus growing in competition here we re assembled their data specific to wheat competition to show changes in seed production per plant seeds plant when growing in wheat at different weed densities fig c1 we found that seeds plant increased at increasing weed densities until a maximum was reached and then declined a lognormal function eq 1b summarised the data for weed densities less than 55 m 2 a minimal value of 11 3 seeds plant was used the number of seeds per plant was then randomly sampled using a normal distribution and multiplied by the number of plants per cell to give seed production per cell for brost 
24986,accurate predictions of weed seed dispersal are important for spatial modelling of weed population dynamics however there are few multi year data sets available and they are seldom analysed well here we gathered together and re examined population growth and seed spread data from three grass weed species over 3 years using a new seed spread function in the simulation model somer it was possible to accurately parametrise population growth and seed spread to replicate the field data of apera spica venti apesv and bromus sterilis brost in contrast the greatest increases in alopecurus myosuroides alomy numbers occurred in the direction of machinery movement which could not be predicted using this function a probability sum exponential type function gave an excellent fit to the field data for apesv and brost with changes in seed spread distances due to species differences wind and shading from the hedge accommodated by alterations in the scale shape and wind dispersal parameters here we describe a method of parametrising the probability function from within a stochastic simulation working within the simulation allowed empirical population size data sets to be successfully parameterised without mathematical integration this function is fully explained with stochastic simulated examples and fitted to various two dimensional longitudinal data sets enough detail to enable its parametrisation including simplification within a majority of spatial stochastic population models is included keywords spatial population models simulation crop weeds two dimension 1 introduction annual grass weeds are a serious issue in northern european cropping systems with their management in autumn sown crops a particularly demanding problem moss 2017 the effective management of grass weeds is becoming more difficult due to increasing concerns about herbicides heap 2018 kudsk et al 2018 one solution to help reduce herbicide use whilst still maintaining effective weed control is the incorporation of site specific weed management site specific weed management sswm involves the application of weed control measures typically herbicides to selected parts of a field based on the current spatial weed distribution within the field sswm requires accurate weed maps even better sswm is possible if the locations and density of the current season s annual weeds can be predicted prior to their emergence however predicting weed germinations is difficult cardina et al 1997 the locations of germinating weed seeds are impacted by a multitude of factors weed seed dispersal is influenced by the phenology of the weed species including shedding date walsh and powles 2014 plant height walsh et al 2016 and seed characteristics reuss et al 2001 in addition external factors such as crop choice the environment and anthropogenic processes colbach et al 2000 cousens et al 2008 metcalfe et al 2018 can have significant effects on weed seed dispersal analysis of the interactions between weed phenology and these various external factors will highlight significant factors for each species in determining the final dispersal patterns of its seeds blanco moreno et al 2006 once these interactions have been quantified the emphasis within subsequent weed prediction modelling can be adjusted to incorporate only the most relevant factors here we focus on predicting the spread of three annual grass weeds within a wheat crop a longitudinal dataset was used consisting of tiller counts of the weeds alopecurus myosuroides alomy apera spica venti apesv and bromus sterilis brost which had been recorded annually for 3 years this analysis attempted to match this data by investigating interactions between the effects of a sheltering hedge and directional wind which have varying degrees of importance to seed spread depending on the phenology of the weed species a recent review of weed seed dispersal found that very few studies incorporated directional wind bullock et al 2017 although bullock et al 2003 did identify interactions between wind harvest date and seed dispersal direction for the grassland plant rhinanthus minor in addition very few studies have fitted parameters to weed seed spread using empirical data at the population compared to individual level which was identified as an important consideration by chapman and gray 2012 measuring and analysing seed spread at the population level is much simpler when the field is subdivided into small square cells the use of cells means that there will be a discrete number of places for the seeds to land however typically seed spread is parameterised as distance travelled using a continuous one dimensional equation predicting seed spread between discrete two dimensional cells means that initial continuous one dimensional equations are first parameterised and then mathematically integrated colbach and sache 2001 metcalfe et al 2018 whilst the addition of wind and shelter belts can add further mathematical complexity wang et al 2001 there are alternatives to the use of mathematical integration to analyse seed spread in two dimensions when seed spread radiates from a point simpler equations have been used across either circular angles or hexagonal cells gonzález andújar et al 1999 paice et al 1998 however our desire to incorporate both square cells and longitudinal population based data means that the required two dimensional seed spread equation needed to be more complex fortunately the initial longitudinal dataset measured changes in population size tiller counts in discrete two dimensional cells meaning this data could be replicated using simulation modelling the equations could then be parameterised whilst running within a simulation model thereby removing the need for later mathematical integration our aim here is to parameterise two dimensional seed spread within a population model we will maximise fit to spatial data which was previously recorded over 3 years using a stochastic spatial population model thereby avoiding the need for mathematical integration we will fit the equation to each of the three weed species alomy apesv and brost each with quite different phenologies and dispersal characteristics finally we aim to add the parameterisation of a both directional wind and a sheltering hedgerow and study their influence on the spread of seed from these three weed species 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental background for 3½ years from autumn 1997 the spread of three grass weed species alomy apesv and brost within sequential winter wheat crops was recorded at flakkebjerg zealand in denmark christensen 2000 heisel et al 2002 records were kept of their annual spatial spread across 420 m2 of wheat fields at two sites with hedgerows that are referred to here as the less sheltered and more sheltered sites each species was broadcast sown in a separate plot in autumn 1997 in a row approx 1 m wide and 21 m long next to the hedgerows with 10 m between each plot appendix a the less sheltered site had a hedgerow running in an east west direction parallel to most winds on the south side of the plots at the more sheltered site the hedgerow ran in the north south direction and was on the predominantly windward side of the site christensen 2000 during the 3½ years of the experiment the plots were neither ploughed nor sprayed for weeds after the initial sowing of the weed seeds each years wheat crop was sown using no till techniques and cut and bailed after weed seed dispersal heisel et al 2002 a later harvesting date was used to maximise natural weed seed dispersal although some weed seed appears to have been still unshed and spread during the mowing process fig 1 a total of three plots one for each species within each field 6 plots in total are examined here tiller numbers were recorded within 420 cells of 1 m2 for dates see appendix a with records kept out to 20 m from the hedgerow plots were 21 by 20 m meaning that any spread beyond the 20 m was not recorded weeds were originally counted within one random 0 25 m2 sample within each cell with counts recorded on a log type scale fig 1 it was assumed both in that record keeping and in these simulations that there were no annual weeds growing within the hedgerows these published christensen 2000 heisel et al 2002 and unpublished historical records were combined to produce data appendix b which we could then attempt to replicate using the spatial population model the records examined more closely within this paper are row averages on the same log type scale calculated for each row parallel to the hedge for both the empirical data and the spatial simulations using row averages for comparisons between the empirical data and the simulations allowed us to account for stochastic variability within rows fig 1 we used the more detailed information available from the more sheltered site fig 1 in addition annual 1997 2001 birds eye views of all three grass weed species for both fields were also assembled from original records and are included for completeness fig 1 more realistic row averages were calculated by first converting the log type values into estimated weed counts which were combined using an arithmetic mean row averages were calculated for data from november 1997 and june 1998 and used to calculate the increase in weed counts over this period 2 2 somer model this research uses somer a stochastic simulation model which spatially divides the weed population the resulting spatial sub populations allow the addition of crop dependent seed and pollen spread localised inter and intra specific competition and also weed seed collection dispersal and destruction during crop harvest somerville et al 2017b we aimed to replicate the yearly row tiller averages for the more sheltered site utilising somer in order to parametrise weed seed spread of alomy apesv and brost within a winter wheat crop simulations using somer ran for 3 years using the tiller counts conducted in june 1998 as the initial populations the simulation model used here is described more fully in somerville et al 2017b each 420 m2 plot was replicated using sub populations based in cells which were created by overlaying a checker board type design the probability of seed spreading between cells was based on intercellular distances the probability of seeds being retained within each home cell was estimated by assuming that weeds within the home cell were an average distance of half the cell width away from any seed settling position within that same home cell individual probability maps were designed for seed spread from each cell showing where its seeds were more likely or less likely to be deposited throughout the plot the sum of each cell s seed spread probability map equalled one when we included seed lost over the edges of the 420 m2 plots any seed determined to have landed outside the plot was removed from the simulations the biological parameters of the three weed species and the wheat crop used in the simulations were based on previously assembled data with minor alterations to allow the original growth curves to be replicated table 1 2 3 seed production and competition for all three weed species sequential weed germinations influenced seed production levels fitness with the earliest germinating weeds cohort 1 producing more seeds than later germinating cohorts table 2 end of year weed counts generated within somer are used stochastically to produce the next year s seeds somerville et al 2017b however for this particular application the end of year counts were tiller numbers rather than weed numbers links between plant number tiller number and seed production are highly variable dalbiès dulout and doré 2001 moss 1985 for this field we found that doubling production levels accounted for these differences across all three weed species within the somer model weed seed production each year for alomy and apesv weeds was calculated using a hyperbolic competition function firbank and watkinson 1986 somerville et al 2017a seed production per square metre for each of the four weed cohorts i 1 4 was calculated thus 1a s e e d p r o d u c t i o n i 2 m a x i m u m p o s s i b l e p r o d u c t i o n d e n s i t y i f i t n e s s i 1 j 1 5 d e n s i t y j f i t n e s s j where the weed cohorts are also represented by j 1 4 and for the crop j 5 in addition f i t n e s s 5 included a competition coefficient to account for the differences in fitness between wheat and the weed species unfortunately replicating the empirical brost data using eq 1a after testing a wide variety of biological parameters as well as alternative scale and shape parameters proved impossible therefore for brost a slightly more complex competition function was necessary eq 1b the competition function for brost was based on results in kleemann and gill 2009 and is explained further in appendix c seed production for all of the four brost cohorts i 1 4 within each cell was calculated from a log normal distribution where x i 1 4 d e n s i t y i f i t n e s s i 1b s e e d p r o d u c t i o n x 2 877 1 2 π 1 4 x 100 e x p l o g x 100 3 1 2 2 1 4 2 2 4 seed spread calculations 2 4 1 seed spread probability function the two dimensional seed spread probabilities calculated for these simulations are based on the summation of an exponential type function eq 2 an exponential type function is very generic with the k parameter controlling the functions shape for example k 1 is an exponential function and k 2 gives a gaussian curve an exponential type function was used here firstly because it fit the data well secondly similar functions have been found useful previously to parametrise seed spread for different weed species colbach et al 2018 and finally because the biological realism of using a summed exponential type function for seed spread is strong as maximal seed reception is predefined here at 100 and minimal seed reception is predefined at zero motulsky and christopoulos 2004 alternative seed spread equations using the negative binomial distribution gonzález andújar and saavedra 2003 the exponential distribution and the gaussian distribution wang et al 2008 were considered but did not fulfil these criteria in addition these distributions are less adaptable as they contain only one independent variable whereas here we use two variables which allows wider adaptability for different species and environments work on two dimensional seed spread probabilities using an exponential type dispersal function was conducted by sagnard et al 2007 2011 here we take this work further by allowing seed to spread to unsampled areas including areas beyond the bounds of the plot alternative seed spread parametrisations were tested against a variety of population growth parameters with an aim to produce annual changes between graphs of grass weed spread which most closely replicated the annual spatial spread recorded in the original more sheltered field based results the probability of seeds being spread between cells was estimated for different seed spread parameterisations and at two alternate cell sizes of 1 m2 and ½ m2 the smaller cell sizes of ½ m2 were used in these results as some species spread their seeds less than one metre each year from each source cell c 00 seed spread into cell c i j was defined with a two parameter exponential function eq 2 which is used here to simulate the stochastic dispersal of 100 of the seed produced by these annual weeds 2 p i j e λ d i j k x y e λ d x y k where i is distance in the x direction and j is distance in the y direction λ is the scale parameter k is the shape parameter and the distance between c 00 and c i j is d i j i 2 j 2 alterations in the seed spread function to allow for greater or lesser seed spread distances were achieved by altering the scale parameter λ and the shape parameter k of eq 2 due to interactions between these two parameters and the stochastic nature of the simulations two parameter analysis was chosen to parameterise eq 2 this two parameter analysis was conducted using each year s data for each species in spring 1998 at the end of the first growing season the weeds were spread in a strip over two metres wide the model was parametrised with the initial seeds in rows 1 5 when rows in the model were ½ m wide the best shape and scale parameters could be determined for spread from each of these five rows minimising least square difference the second year weeds were also in rows 6 25 as apesv had spread out to 12 5 m so further analysis determined the shape and spread parameters for these additional rows which was then built on to predict the following year s weed locations and densities probable anthropogenic dispersal seen in brost in 1999 at arrow a in fig 1 was incorporated into the simulations by depositing 5 of the seeds produced in 1998 further from the hedge these seeds were dispersed 6 m from the hedge in a strip 2 3 m wide and 8 10 m long anthropogenic seed dispersal may also have occurred the next year as new outbreaks can be seen at a distance of 15 21 m from the hedgerow brost 2000 the cause of these tillers recorded at 15 21 m from the hedge in 2000 is unknown and they were not incorporated into the simulations 2 4 2 truncation distances eq 2 was designed to work with a finite number of equally sized cells which meant that a maximum truncated seed spread distance was required fig 2 the maximum seed spread truncation distance used for cells at different distances from the hedgerow varied between 35 and 50 m truncation meant that for any two cells c 00 and c i j where d i j is greater than the truncation distance the probability of seed moving between these two cells was zero a truncation distance of 35 m meant that some ground outside the 420 m2 plots was also included in these calculations to allow for seed loss over the boundary fig 2c at scale and shape parametrisations less than one truncation distances of 50 m were used because the maximum internal distance in these plots was 29 m the shape of the dispersal curve in the region beyond 29 m was immaterial even at very high dispersal rates λ 0 5 and k 0 6 the probability of seed loss outside the plot 0 03 did not change when the truncation distance in eq 2 varied from 35 m to 100 m due to this invariance we assumed that distributions within 29 m of the source would not change appreciably if a truncation maximum distance of 35 m was used table 3 to study the effect of changing the truncation distance two denominators x y e λ d x y k were calculated for eq 2 using two different truncation distances the proportional difference between these two sums indicated the probability of seeds being spread into the area between the two truncation distances table 3 eq 2 allowed any truncation distance to be chosen including truncation distances exceeding the maximum radius of the plot figs 2b 3 c once a truncation distance was chosen and the probabilities were calculated the seed from each cell were then stochastically distributed according to these probabilities using the rmultinom function in the hmisc package harrell and dupont 2018 in r however when using the rmultinom function it was necessary to include as one of the probabilities the probability of seed loss from the plot once a truncation distance was chosen then a network of cells was designed which entirely covered this area out to the truncation distance around a central cell fig 2a c e then the denominator of eq 2 x y e λ d x y k was calculated using all cells within that group p x y was then the probability of seed spreading between any two cells which were d x y apart all cells which were the same distance from the hedgerow within the same row had identical seed spread probabilities which were invariant over time meaning that cells nearer the corners dispersed more seed outside the plot particularly when high dispersal rates were used 2 4 3 the effect of wind changing the scale and shape parameters in eq 2 allowed for greater dispersal distances for seed released in rows further from the hedge however this increase was insufficient to fully replicate apesv spread in this field meaning that an equation describing wind dispersal needed to be designed wind was considered as a force acting on seed dispersal with stronger forces acting on the weeds which grew further from the hedgerow in addition hedgerows create eddies which reduce the directional effect of wind close to the hedge particularly for denser hedgerows takahashi 1978 wang et al 2001 parameterisation of wind dispersal at distances from the hedgerow was based on graphs in wang et al 2001 the average hedgerow dimensions at the more sheltered site over the period of this study have been estimated at height h 1 3 m width w 3 h and porosity n 0 3 personal communication from farmer and the shedding height of apesv was estimated at z 0 8 m both a logistic aicc 171 and a sigmoid aicc 169 were fitted to the chosen curve the logistic function used eq 3 was implemented to reflect these parameters with decreases in wind strength occurring closer to the hedgerow the utilised logistic function for the directional wind speed w s p for seed dispersal from the simulated row r p when 8 r p 42 was 3 w s p 0 935 w i n d s p e e d 1 exp 8 35 r p 6 20 the average july wind speed of 4 2 m s 1 was used in all simulations plauborg 2019 the wind was assumed to be more turbulent within 4 m 8 simulated rows of the hedge wang et al 2001 and the directional effect in eq 3 was reduced accordingly a linear function was used to join the wind dispersal at 4 m rp 8 to a zero zero reading at d 0 assuming an easterly wind the apparent east to west distance for seed dispersal from row p to row q will be influenced by the real east to west distance from row p to row q the directional wind speed w s p and a further factor to account for the time the apesv seeds are in the air the lift and drag named here as the wind dispersal factor w d f fig 3 it is assumed that w p w d f is unitless 4a a p p a r e n t d i s t a n c e s e w p q r e a l d i s t a n c e e w p q 1 w s p w d f 4b a p p a r e n t d i s t a n c e s w e p q r e a l d i s t a n c e w e p q 1 w s p w d f where the ew calculations alter distances measured from east to west and will affect seeds dispersing more to the west and we calculations alter distances measured from west to east and will affect seeds travelling more to the east 3 results and discussion 3 1 increase in weed numbers november 1997 june 1998 initial weed counts for year one were completed in november autumn 1997 by the time of the first tiller count in june spring 1998 the numbers had increased table 4 and their distributions were more widespread fig 1 importantly this change in weed distribution was due solely to delayed seed germination and possible secondary seed movement chambers and macmahon 1994 as no new seeds were produced during this period the alomy numbers changed the least increasing 3 9 times with apesv exhibiting an intermediate increase by 4 7 times and the brost numbers increasing the most 5 3 times at the more sheltered site and 10 5 times at the less sheltered site from a much smaller initial population the increases in numbers and decreases in patchiness are measured over a single winter and are site specific meaning they are difficult to compare to other studies wallgren and avholm 1978 found strong spring germination but also found large inter year differences for both apesv and alomy in contrast brost germination can be inhibited by light hilton 1982 which may have slowed germination in the first year of this study appendix c in addition a change from counting seedlings in november to counting tillers in june was instigated christensen 2000 which further decreases the value of these as comparable results 3 2 growth and spread of alomy weeds june 1998 june 2001 during 1998 1999 and 2000 alomy weeds spread less than either apesv or brost fig 1 implying minimal wind assisted seed dispersal and meaning that alomy patches are fairly stable over time this replicates studies of alomy over longer time periods wilson and brain 1991 and more widespread areas freckleton et al 2018 alomy has relatively heavy seeds with a thousand kernel weight tkw of two grams and small awns melander 2011 which minimises wind borne transport although some alomy seed movement occurred in the less sheltered field prior to the counts completed in 2000 fig 1 it is unknown whether this was due to dispersal by wind animals or anthropogenic processes spread of this alomy population could not be successfully modelled using this two parameter exponential type function as the increase in weed numbers in already infested rows including new weeds in hitherto empty cells far outweighed the increase in weed numbers in newly infested rows that is sideways spread in the direction of machinery movement was much greater than spread away from the hedge out into the field it is also possible that crosswind forces close to the hedgerow wang et al 2001 facilitated this seed movement 3 3 growth and spread of apesv weeds june 1998 june 2001 during 1998 1999 and 2000 the apesv weeds spread further than either the alomy or the brost weeds aided by wind assisted seed dispersal the apesv tillers were taller than the wheat christensen 2000 and have light seeds tkw 0 1 g melander 2011 which probably increased seed spread minimised intraspecific competition and facilitated population growth melander 1993 in 1998 most of the seeds were produced within 1 5 m of the hedge and spread minimally although small numbers of seeds ended up further from the hedge this minimal initial spread was replicated by using larger parameters to simulate seed spread from these weeds which all grew within 1 5 m of the hedge in contrast in 1999 apesv plants and seed release occurred much further from the hedge the seeds spread much further in 1999 which could be replicated using different scale and shape parameters to control dispersal for seeds produced further than 1 5 m from the hedge it was not necessary to change the parameters used to simulate spread from plants within 1 5 of the hedgerow in 1998 in all instances it was unnecessary to change the parameters assigned to each row to simulate the seed spread in different years table 4 the wind dispersal factor of wdf was also unchanged between years figs 2 4 using wdf 1 equates to approximately a halving of the distance to rows on the windward side of the central row and a doubling of the apparent distance to rows on the leeward side of the central row from the central row of the plot fig 3 in contrast modelling and experiments by chapman and gray 2012 and wang et al 2008 found weed seeds typically travelled less than 5 m when windblown however their studies did not include an accompanying dense wheat crop which possibly provided additional lift by 2000 the apesv seeds were dispersed throughout the plot and probably much further which meant spread from 2000 to 2001 was impossible to parametrise with this function minimising the spread of weed seeds within a field has been identified as important in maximising crop production gonzález andújar et al 1999 figures in nordmeyer 2009 show annual movement of apesv patches of over 25 m without hedgerows and both negative and positive correlations over time the hedgerow in this field was very useful for slowing seed movement from field borders however the effect on apesv seed growing further from the hedgerow may be minimal 3 4 growth and spread of brost weeds june 1998 june 2001 during 1998 1999 and 2000 the brost dispersal distance was less than the alomy dispersal excepting that a small number of brost seeds were dispersed further during 1998 probably due to anthropogenic processes fig 1 in addition the brost seed spread further when their parent plant was located further from the hedge similar hedgerow sheltering and anthropogenic seed movement have been observed for brost in the uk rew et al 1996 brost seeds are very heavy tkw 6 4 g but possess awns melander 2011 which aid their movement 3 5 the effect of the sheltering hedge and wind direction in these field trials the seeds produced close to the hedgerows travelled less distance than seeds produced further from the hedge which implies that for all three species seed travel is decreased close to hedgerows the seed spread parameters of each row were dependent on its distance from the hedge but were equal in all directions except for the apesv spread in fig 4a which included increasing strength directional wind the results in fig 5b 5c did not include directional wind but did have steadily increasing seed dispersal further from the hedge except at a dead spot which was 1 5 2 m from the hedge where spread for both apera and brost was less table 4 the distance of the dead spot from the hedge was similar for these two diverse species and is here at least independent of weed biology similar dead spots have been recorded in other windbreak studies where distance porosity and width are critical factors takahashi 1978 wang et al 2001 in addition to this non directional increase at greater distance from the hedge increasing directional wind assisted seed dispersal was also used to more accurately simulate the spread of apesv fig 4a but was not necessary in brost simulations the use of reduced directional wind spread rates within 3 5 of the hedgerow coincides with turbulence discussed in wang et al 2001 however the apesv was probably tracked over insufficient distances 21 m to yield unfettered directional data meaning that the wind spread values wdf calculated here could well be exceeded in a more open field these results illustrate the usefulness of hedgerows surrounding cropped land even for reducing spread of unawned heavy seeds such as brost as well as their previously determined role in maintaining diverse fried et al 2008 and beneficial storkey and neve 2018 weed communities hedgerows could be very useful in slowing the spread of seeds from field borders particularly in unfavourable winds 3 6 the seed spread function and cell sizes seed spread was accurately simulated by using a truncated probability sum of an exponential type function eq 2 the same direct parameterisation technique of a similar two dimensional function has been used previously to model pollen spread within a stochastic spatial model somerville and renton 2015 somerville et al 2017b in those papers when biological pollen spread distances were altered changes in the scale parameter λ were sufficient to enable accurate regressions here it was also necessary to alter the shape parameter k and also add wind dispersal to the apesv simulation to allow for differences in seed spread when plants were located further from the hedgerow further work to parameterise seed spread for other species and other crops when more temporal and spatial datasets become available is warranted in datasets without hedges it is envisaged that a single parameterisation per species would be determined additionally in subsequent simulations an alternative to e λ d i j k could be parameterised using probability sum type function such as eq 2 in a simulation model like somer for example an exponential function e λ d i j has been used to simulate seed spread in a probability sum type function gonzález andújar 1995 a viable alternative to the exponential function also with only one variable for modelling seed spread is the gaussian curve e λ d i j 2 either equation could be fitted to temporal spatial datasets in a similar fashion to eq 2 within a simulation model however the use of two parameters allowing changes in both the scale and shape of the curve may be warranted when more variable environmental conditions exist the use of the smaller cells with an area of 0 5 m2 in the simulations was advantageous due to the smaller annual spread distances of some species it is likely that a maximum measure for cell width needed to be close to the minimal distance seed travels within one year in order to accurately simulate seed spread conversely the minimum measure for cell width needs to be large enough to capture the majority of inter species competition from a single weed plant growing within a cropped field somerville et al 2017b other research has examined wind dispersal where the peak distribution is at some distance from the parent plant resulting in crater shaped distribution curves greene and johnson 1989 wang et al 2008 in contrast the distributions used here were all cone shaped with the peak distribution centred on the home cell crater shaped distribution curves have been linked to species with well attached seeds which exhibit a minimal detachment speed requirement greene and johnson 1989 however detachment does not appear to be an issue for apesv avholm and wallgren 1976 due to the limited size of these plots wider dispersal limited reproductive efficacy both in the trials where weeds outside the plots were sprayed and within the simulations due to a loss of seed from the plots when the seeds were more widely dispersed they were more likely to land outside the confines of the plot further simulations on wind spread in small areas could use a wrapping technique to counter this seed loss somerville et al 2017b the objective of this study was to parameterise a two dimensional seed spread function using empirical population size datasets incorporating a new seed spread function in the simulation model somer made it possible to accurately parametrise population growth and seed spread a suitable equation for directional wind was identified and parameterised including the effect of a sheltering hedgerow directional wind was a necessary component of simulating the spread of apesv seeds but was not able to improve simulations of brost seed spread however including an increasing non directional wind strength at greater distances from the hedge excluding a dead spot at 1 5 2 metres from this hedge was necessary for both species parameterising a truncated probability sum function within the simulations made it possible to accurately replicate the empirical longitudinal datasets methods of parameterising seed spread functions using empirical population data will become more important in the future as more longitudinal in situ datasets become available funding the work was supported by the danish innovation fund who sponsor the project roboweedmaps 2017 2020 conflict of interest none appendix a original field work plan for the hedgerow project a 1 purpose the purpose of the field work was to replicate the spatial spread of three grass weeds from newly established hedgerows the test species were sown along the hedgerow of 2 sites at the research center flakkebjerg in 1997 the east west hedgerow the less sheltered site was a 160 m long and 3 row spruce planting and the north south hedgerow the more sheltered site was approx 100 m long and 4 m wide a 3 year old planting consisting of deciduous trees and bushes a 2 experimental plots at both sites 3 test plots were allocated an area of 21 20 m 21 m parallel to the hedgerow a gap of 10 m was used between each of the three test plots fig a1 each plot was divided into 420 cells of 1 m2 the weed species were spread in the first metre along the hedgerow in a mixture of soil before the winter wheat was sown wheat was sown with a rotary harrow immediately after ploughing in the first year table a1 winter wheat was grown each year in the 4 year trial period the test plots were not ploughed throughout the test period and weed control was not carried out however weed control was carried out outside the 21 20 m test plots including in the gaps to avoid weeds spreading into the test plots a 3 weed counts spring and autumn records of the numbers of each weed species were made in a 0 25 m2 square however only the individual species sown within that plot was recorded from 1999 onwards the grass tillers were counted after the wheat had tillered as they then protruded over the wheat and the counts became more accurate appendix b preliminary investigations on the raw data b 1 replicating the starting conditions of the experiment necessary factors for accurately simulating these results 1 the effect of the physical structure of the hedgerow on seed spread 2 the effect of directional wind on seed spread 3 the starting seed populations a the number of seeds initially spread along the edge of the plot b the initial seed locations were they placed in row zero outside the assessed area or within row one c the time of seed placement were the grass weed sown at the start of year one or during an earlier year zero were the plants counted in year one the progeny of those initial seeds or were they adult plants which grew from those initial seeds results of these preliminary investigations 1 the physical structure of the hedgerow did affect seed spread so that it was necessary to have more restrictive seed spread parameters for subpopulations closer to the hedge table 4 2 there were duplicated experiential records available from 2000 and 2001 gathered in two separate fields for each of the three weeds at the more sheltered site which supplied all the records used within this paper the hedgerow was along the windward side of the plots the apesv weeds at both sites had saturated the plot by 2000 fig 1 meaning that wind direction by then was immaterial the brost seeds were spread by anthropogenic processes at least twice fig 1 both alomy and brost show denser plot wide dispersal in 2001 at the less sheltered site compared to 2001 at the more sheltered site which hints at wind assisted dispersal in both these species however the variation in alomy and brost dispersal patterns between plots may also be due to inadvertent seed dispersal by anthropogenic processes 3 the initial population of weed seeds was scattered manually along the hedge line although records of the size location and age of this initial seed bank deposits were not unearthed in any detail 4 it was assumed that any seeds later spreading to and growing within the hedgerow would not produce and spread sufficient quantities of seed to affect this study 5 the year two weed counts from spring 1998 were used to calculate the starting populations however earlier weed counts also existed from november 1997 these early season weed counts had a very different relationship to reproductive output and separate increase rates were calculated accordingly table 4 6 of the three species examined here the brost grass seemed particularly sensitive to anthropogenic seed dispersal within this origional field trial b 2 interspecific competition unfortunately competition from other weed species occurred in later years of these simulations in addition 2001 was a low yielding year in many of the subpopulations fig 1 weed tiller numbers dropped between 2000 and 2001 b 3 anthropogenic seed dispersal bands of darker colour in the brost more sheltered site have been highlighted and explained as anthropogenic seed dispersal fig 1 the accidental anthropogenic seed dispersal the crop was late harvested cut and bailed going into 1999 was included in the simulations as a specific event simulating the collection of just 5 of all seed produced in rows closer to the hedgerow in late 1998 and their subsequent deposit in the striped area indicated by arrow a in fig 1 in early 1999 resulted in a replication of the desired bump in fig 4 however additional accidental anthropogenic dispersal events in later year s were not included in the simulations as they were spatially separate from the main weed infestation on the right side of the plots and could therefore be ignored when tracking typical seed movement on the left side of the plots appendix c brost competition based on results in kleemann and gill 2009 kleemann and gill 2009 in table 4 recorded both weed density and seed production m 2 for populations of brori bromus rigidus growing in competition here we re assembled their data specific to wheat competition to show changes in seed production per plant seeds plant when growing in wheat at different weed densities fig c1 we found that seeds plant increased at increasing weed densities until a maximum was reached and then declined a lognormal function eq 1b summarised the data for weed densities less than 55 m 2 a minimal value of 11 3 seeds plant was used the number of seeds per plant was then randomly sampled using a normal distribution and multiplied by the number of plants per cell to give seed production per cell for brost 
24987,eco models have shown great potential in the field of water eutrophication research we use the information visualization technology of citespace to present a systematic review of published literature on the application of eco models to eutrophication from 1968 2018 in total 2099 references from the web of science wos core collection were analyzed using the citespace software bibliometric methods and documents combing methods to determine the hotspots frontiers and development trends in the application of eco models to eutrophication according to our analysis ecological models in the field of water eutrophication are applied to the baltic sea agricultural phosphorus use particulate nitrogen input risk assessment net ecosystem production competition patterns biological factors semi enclosed marine systems chlorophyll fluorescence parameters evolving conceptual models and nutrient transfer the eco models range from dimension models to time dependent dynamic models moreover the recent trend of close coupling between modeling and the acquisition of new types of experimental data i e remote sensing high frequency field sensors provides a higher prediction ability of ecological models keywords eutrophication ecological models citespace knowledge mapping 1 introduction eutrophication is one of the most challenging environmental problems faced by surface water bodies today li et al 2017 according to the latest data on 107 important lakes reservoirs issued by the ministry of ecology and environment of china 10 of the important 107 lakes reservoirs in china were nutritional status 61 7 lakes reservoirs belonged to middle nutritional status 25 of them were mild eutrophication status and 6 of them were moderate eutrophication status ministry of ecological environment of the people s republic of china mee 2019 estimates from published studies reveal that approximately 30 billion tons of polluted water will be discharged directly into these lakes and that by 2030 all urban lakes and most medium sized lakes in urban rural fringe areas of china may be facing water eutrophication yang et al 2008 since the first eutrophication model the vollenweider vol model appeared in 1968 the application of ecological models has developed rapidly the applicability of these ecosystem models spans a wide range of temporal and spatial scales ranging from zero dimensional to three dimensional eco models have received significant attention from the academic community in previous studies mooij et al 2010 bhagowati and ahamad 2018 representative reviews have mostly been based on summaries of the relevant literature with no measurement methods introduced vinçon and casenave 2019 here the application of eco models in water eutrophication is summarized the knowledge mapping method of literature measurement has specific advantages in the analysis of research contents methods and trends knowledge mapping can reveal the development trends of specific research fields by using mathematical and statistical methods within a limited time frame we are able to visualize the shape of knowledge mapping intuitively in view of the great potential of the application of ecological models in the field of water eutrophication it is helpful for beginners to master the application of research results of ecological models in a comprehensive and systematic way as soon as possible the bibliographic data used for this article are culled from the web of science wos produced by thomson reuters the web of science database of the institute for scientific information isi is one of the world s largest and most comprehensive libraries of integrated academic information resources it provides users an online portal to a number of resources including the science citation index expanded sci expanded social sciences citation index ssci conference proceedings citation index science cpci s conference proceedings citation index social science humanities cpci ssh current chemical reactions ccr expanded and index chemicus ic although each of these citation databases is massive in size and scope not all journals or articles are indexed recent statistics suggest that the multidisciplinary coverage of the web of science encompasses over 50 000 scholarly books 12 000 journals and 160 000 conference proceedings visualization analysis includes multiple perspective co citation network mapping self organizing mapping social network analysis mapping multi dimensional scaling mapping and timeline knowledge mapping among other things for many visual analysis systems based on a citation network the knowledge map generated using citespace is one of the most recognized technologies in the international knowledge metrology circle chen et al 2010 chen 2006 citespace has been used in more than 60 fields such as computer science information science and medicine through data mining processing metrology drawing and other steps the citespace software realizes the graphical expression of knowledge frameworks structures interactions cross overs derivations and other internal links it integrates clustering analysis social network analysis and multi dimensional scale analysis it also can detect and analyze the evolving trends in the research frontiers of the corresponding disciplines as well as the relationship between the research frontiers and their knowledge base this review uses the knowledge visualization analysis software citespace and traditional literature combing to clarify the frontiers hot spots development trends and communication tracks of ecological models in the field of water eutrophication research in this study we aim to analyze the research on the application of ecological models for eutrophication from both global and individual perspectives based on online databases and with the use of scientiﬁc knowledge mapping software this review includes the trends in literature output star papers and topics of research focus and describes the emerging trends in research on the application of ecological models in water eutrophication the aim of this review is to improve the application level of ecological models in the field of water eutrophication and to better serve environmental water science research 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection given its long time span and the quantity and quality of entries the isi web of science database provides a guarantee for the reliability of raw data in visual analysis yu et al 2010 moreover the quality of literature retrieval determines the accuracy of the knowledge map analysis and the accurate construction of the search query is the premise of accurate data acquisition in the search process it is necessary to control the literature into the purview excessive purview will introduce irrelevant literature which will pollute the retrieval results whereas too small a purview will filter out relevant literature and reduce the comprehensiveness of search results therefore the search type needs to be adjusted according to the search results so that the search results are as comprehensive and accurate as possible here the search criteria are subject model and ecosystem and eutrophication to cover the development history of ecological models for eutrophication the retrieval time span was set from 1968 to 2018 after screening each piece of data is downloaded as a full record text format in total 2099 valid publications were extracted finally the output file format of the rename is download txt 2 2 data analysis with the accelerated development of information networks scholars can analyze a subject by visualization analysis of subject knowledge by drawing a scientific knowledge map of literature data information in this study citespace is selected as the main analysis software however it can only outline the whole research field and not extract in depth literature details therefore based on the analysis results of citespace and the traditional literature combing method we performed critical reading of the relevant literature to clarify the frontiers focus topics development trends and communication trajectories of ecological modeling in the field of water eutrophication 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of publication outputs according to a publication s annual distribution statistics and subject classification visualization map a preliminary understanding of the ecological models for eutrophication is formed on the one hand relevant research progress can be grouped into three phases the ﬁrst phase was from 1968 to 1990 with research still in its infancy only eight papers were published in this 22 year period by web of science database for the search criteria model and ecosystem and eutrophication accounting for only 0 38 of the total output in this period the average paper output was about only one paper ever 3 years the second phase was from 1991 to 2010 when there was a significant increase in the number of published papers in total 842 papers were published accounting for 40 11 of the total papers on average 42 papers were issued yearly the third phase was from 2011 to 2017 in the past 7 years 1249 articles accounting for 59 50 of the total were issued and an average of 106 articles were issued yearly fig 1 on the other hand looking at the number of papers published in various countries and regions most applied research is performed in north america united states of america and canada and asia mostly in china eutrophication models developed in western europe the netherlands italy switzerland and germany and northern europe finland the uk norway sweden and denmark also received special attention fig 2 since the 21 st century research on the application of ecological models has entered the phase of high speed development and the number published papers in the field of eutrophication has shown a blowout trend furthermore there has been a signiﬁcant increase in modeling studies conducted on chinese applications of eutrophication models particularly since 2010 hou et al 2004 huang et al 2012 li et al 2014 in recent times eco modeling has become an effective tool for eutrophication control in terms of its better predictive capacity the popular state of knowledge about water eutrophication and advances in eco models will be of great use for future research 3 2 cooperation network analysis the results of the co occurrence network analysis indicate that there is a partial cooperative relationship among authors co occurrence network analysis does not only provide references for evaluating academic influence but also facilitates the discovery of scholars and institutions worthy of attention the size of the nodes in the network reflects the number of letters sent by an author country region or institution and the links indicate their intrinsic relationships 3 2 1 author analysis through the analysis of the structural characteristics of the author of a communication and his her cooperative network a core author group and its cooperative relationship in this field can be determined after converting 2099 valid literature data it is imported to the citespace software and an authors clustered knowledge map is generated fig 3 table 1 the number and size of nodes in fig 3 represent the co occurrence frequency of core author groups the number and size of lines reflect the cooperation relationship and cooperation intensity of authors they constitute the knowledge map of author groups and cooperation networks there are 350 nodes 255 links and the network density is 0 0042 as can be seen from the graph the application of ecological models in the field of eutrophication can be divided into four core research teams a paerl h w wooij w m janse j h jeppessn e trolle d van nes e h b paerl h w perry e s ludsin s a c arhonditsis g b ramin m shimoda y and d meier h e m neumann t savchuk o p ellola k andersson h c in terms of co occurrence frequency the top two authors are arhonditsis g b and mooij w m with co occurrence times of 21 and 17 respectively these represent the most important scholars in the application of ecological models for eutrophication and lay the academic foundation in this field their publications account for 5 96 of the total number of papers in the past three years wang h maar m liu x zhang y wang r bakker e s and zhang y l have had high numbers of publications statistics show that 43 scholars have published more than five papers as first authors accounting for 15 67 of the total number of papers this shows that the authors contributions are relatively high and core authors contribute a lot to the literature from the point of view of the author s cooperative network the application of ecological models is characterized by a small concentration and large dispersion at present several core research teams have been formed but the strength of the links between the research teams is weak and academic exchanges are infrequent in fact since 1960s many papers on lake eutrophication have been published e g from the group of sven e jorgensen which should be far more than 20 however from 1968 to 1990 only eight papers were shown in the present search results because we use model and ecosystem and eutrophication as the search topic in web of science database since the scientific nature of knowledge mapping is rooted in the data foundation it is a key issue to accurately and comprehensively retrieve all the documents of the subject to be studied in order to avoid the problem of abuse and misuse due to improper data retrieval strategy poor image performance and shallow application level when using the visual mapping software citespace we should pay attention to data retrieval methods and have a clear statement in research papers in addition to using data from the existing database we should also try to collect the mining data based on the problem to be studied 3 2 2 institutions analysis citespace is used to analyze the distribution of research power actual contribution and cooperation among the institutions in the field of eutrophication the citespace atlas contains 311 nodes and 927 connection lines table 2 and fig 4 according to the data analysis the highest number of papers is from the chinese academy of sciences 76 papers if we add 22 university of chinese academy of sciences univ chinese acad sci articles there are 98 articles which is much higher than other institutions among the top 20 agencies seven are from the united states namely univresity of maryland us epa us geological survey university of washington national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa university of wisconsin and smithsonian environmental research center with a total of 204 articles followed by china with five institutions namely chinese academy of sciences university of chinese acadamy of sciences nanjing university peking university and beijing normal university with a total of 150 articles about 50 to 100 articles were published by three swedish institutions namely stockholm university uppsala university and swedish university of agricultural sciences with a total of 93 articles fewer than 50 articles were published by the netherlands canada finland and france at the same time it can be seen from table 2 that the application of ecological models in the field of eutrophication is mainly concentrated in 399 university documents followed by research institutes environmental protection departments and other institutions the following institutions published more than 25 papers through such literature search chinese academy of sciences stockholm university aarhus university university of maryland wageningen university us epa us geological survey and university of toronto among which stockholm university was the first rank with as many as 52 papers then followed by aarhus university with 50 papers university of maryland with 48 papers wageningen university with 41papers university toronto with 27 papers etc see table 2 among them the number of papers published by the above universities reached 7 91 of the total chinese academy of sciences stockholm university and aarhus university contributed for 7 0 of the total number of papers the number of institutions with more than 20 papers accounted for 85 96 of the top 20 institutions contributed 24 7 of all papers this indicates that eutrophication research is relatively concentrated in fewer institutions meanwhile in terms of cooperation intensity the centrality of the chinese academy of sciences is only 0 12 whereas that of stockholm university is 0 23 and that of aarhus university is 0 26 specifically through the analysis of the relevant literature of the these main institutions it is found that there is less cooperation between the various agencies and that it is less intense further interdisciplinary cross regional cooperation between countries is poor and the formation of a network of cooperative institutions is mainly dominated by the author s academic relationship for example the most prolific agency the chinese acad sci has few connections with other agencies moreover these results show that there are relatively few links between chinese institutions themselves reveals that most chinese research institutions conduct research independently this is not conducive to the sustainable development of the application of ecological models in china therefore academic exchanges within china need to be strengthened 3 3 hot research topics on ecological models in the field of water eutrophication the distribution and evolution of research topics can intuitively reflect changes in focus areas analytical perspectives and research methods at different times co citation as a refined expression of the research topic of academic papers can reveal the internal relationships of knowledge within disciplines to a certain extent co citation analysis expresses the relationship between documents by the frequency of being cited by other documents simultaneously that is to say two documents are cited by other documents simultaneously the higher the frequency of citation the closer the relationship this means that the subjects of two documents are more similar the analysis of clustering and key nodes in the clustering of co cited networks can reveal the knowledge structure knowledge base and evolutionary characteristics of the research frontier as well as the literature which plays a key role in the evolution process in total 368 nodes and 901 connections were obtained as shown in fig 5 on one hand the central area of the network shows a dense red circle this indicates a high level of burst references which indicates a signiﬁcant increase in citations from other years eleven different hot clusters were obtained through cluster analysis the detailed feature information is shown in table 3 in the following a brief analysis of the speciﬁc research groups was made and the central or burst literature in each cluster was presented in the order of its respective id according to the relevant to water ecological model we select 8 among 11 clusters to make detailed explanation on the other hand highly cited authors table 4 appearing on the citation frequency of the cited paper and the important nodes that appear on the important nodes represent the basis of applied research on the ecological model 3 3 1 cluster id 0 baltic sea the baltic sea which is a marginal sea of the atlantic ocean enclosed by denmark estonia finland latvia lithuania sweden northeast germany poland russia and the north and central european plain has been in a state of eutrophication meier 2007 in 1992 the countries of the baltic region signed the helsinki convention on the protection for the marine environment of the baltic sea area convention to promote ecological restoration and preserve the ecological balance in the baltic sea region the convention requires contracting parties individually or jointly to agree to take all appropriate legislative administrative or other relevant measures to prevent and eliminate pollution contracting parties uniformly used a multi parameter multi indicator modeling tool called heat 3 0 helcom eutrophication assessment tool 3 0 hermanni et al 2010 pyhälä et al 2014 using a systematic quantitative method combined with the relative uncertainty of different indices the state parties use the change coefficient to analyze the reliability change in eutrophication status evaluations fleming et al 2015 meanwhile denmark uses the mike21 mike3 model to carry out daily water forecasting such as flow velocity and direction wave period wave height and direction salinity temperature dissolved oxygen and changing of chlorophyll concentration and publishes 36 h accurate forecasting to the public on the internet erichsen and rasch 2002 asmala and saikku analyzed the presence of nitrogen and phosphorus in rainbow trout and the domestic consumption of trout they found that one fiftieth of nitrogen and phosphorus input into trout culture entered human food consumption while up to 70 of nitrogen and phosphorus were remitted to the baltic sea which induced eutrophication pollution of water bodies in the baltic region asmala and saikku 2010 the purpose of these studies was to estimate whether current monitoring data are enough to assess the eutrophication situation in the baltic sea josefson et al 2009 3 3 2 cluster id 3 risk assessment eco modeling is an economic and effective tool for estimating and managing the environmental fate and ecological risk of chemicals ang et al 2001 ecological risk assessment era evaluates the likelihood that adverse ecological effects may occur or are occurring because of exposure to one or more stressors us epa 1998 it can be used to better understand risk management and decision making to meet the protection objectives and requirements of water pollution related laws and regulations the aquatox model is perhaps the most comprehensive model available park et al 2008 as can be seen by comparison with other representative dynamic models being used for risk assessment it has been widely used in the ecological risk assessment of organochlorine pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons polychlorinated biphenyls and phenolic compounds in water bodies through the food mesh module mcknight et al 2010 karaaslan 2017 the model can accurately calculate the concentration of pollutants in the food chain it is also used to assess the direct and indirect effects of toxic stress in complex aquatic ecosystems lombardo et al 2015 the model is simple with a flexible structure and it provides a variety of analysis tools that are easy to use park et al 2008 sourisseau et al 2008 nair et al 2015 although the model is designed to promote the development of new applications and scenarios most model application studies focus on the ecological risk assessment of toxic substances based on food webs and lack the evaluation index of water pollution by the epiphytic community zhang et al 2013a b recently however panagiotis et al provided a set of amore dss tools for analyzing and integrating exposure and effect information to assess the risk of species living on specific contaminated aquatic systems based on potential harmful components isigonis et al 2019 aquatox is a useful tool for investigating the relative importance of direct toxicity and ecological interactions however it is difficult to apply aquatox to prospective chemical risk assessment at this stage owing to potential model uncertainties and practical limitations of on site scale assessment therefore the improvement in quantitative monitoring of feeding preferences and abundance over time of the most representative species in each functional group will be of great help to re determine the parameterization and calibration of the model grechi et al 2016 3 3 3 cluster id 5 competition pattern the researchers used complex ecological models to explain the competition patterns and structural changes of phytoplankton plant communities under nutrient enrichment conditions it is far more difficult though essential to delineate when and where resource competition is important and the patterns of species composition and characteristics that result as such researchers have repeatedly tried to develop the principle of competitive exclusion to explain the species diversity of floating communities the various arguments cited can be grouped into three broad categories 1 food web interactions favor species coexistence 2 resource based competition entails tradeoffs and growth strategies and 3 spatiotemporal variability zhao et al 2008 carleton et al 2009 hansen et al 2017 at the same time competition is one of the driving forces of zooplankton population succession this is influenced by many factors such as individual size food habits food type and nutritional quality temperature food concentration and initial density and the population structure size liu 2007 eco models tend to combine physics chemistry and biology they mainly study the energy flow material circulation and information flow in the system and its steady state regulation mechanism ecological models highlight the impact of physical and biological interaction mechanisms on the dynamics of complex ecosystems liu et al 2003 based on a hydrodynamic the ecological model uses a material transfer equation to describe the biological and chemical state variables the source term is coupled to represent the biological process while physical factors such as hydrology and meteorology as the driving force of the whole system appear in the initial and boundary conditions there is a competitive relationship among plankton yang 2010 in the ecological model there are three phytoplankton functional groups diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria which differ in resource competition strategies nitrogen phosphorus light temperature and metabolic rates as well as in their morphological characteristics sedimentation rate shading effect arhonditsis and brett 2005a zhao et al 2008 simultaneously because complex models project species competition to more niche dimensions the model by arhonditsis et al simultaneously examines the effects of functional characteristics abiotic conditions and food web interactions on observed structural changes in phytoplankton communities arhonditsis and brett 2005b academic studies have shown that the close and positive relationship between diatoms fast growing species with excellent phosphorus dynamics and horned animals p rich animals reduces grazing pressure on other residents of phytoplankton communities zhao et al 2008 and large zooplankton herbivores can reduce the sensitivity of phytoplankton to external disturbances cottingham and schindler 2000 cottingham et al 2004 3 3 4 cluster id 6 biological factors biological factors are important constraints on ecological models wetland ecosystems and lake ecosystems can constrain water biomass from each other after harvesting a large number of aquatic plants in grassy lakes the biomass of algae produced at a given nutrient supply level can be strongly altered owing to the lack or absence of aquatic plants smith 2003 in typical nutrient lakes janse et al studied the physical lake water depth lake size sediment type etc chemical and biological factors life cycle growth and death parameters of the steady state transition between clear water clear water state dominated by aquatic plants and turbid state dominated by phytoplankton in a shallow lake ecosystem through the shallow lake model pclake janse et al 1998 janse 2005 therefore the control of algae growth and reproduction should not only control the condition of reducing nutrient load but also increase the amount of aquatic flora scholz starke et al simulated the dynamics of biotic green blue diatoms and abiotic components of the three gorges reservoir tgr ecosystem hydrodynamics nutrients scholz starke et al 2018 the results showed that blue green algae have a p half saturation rate of 0 03 mg l and n half saturation rate of 0 4 mg l whereas green algae have half saturation rates of 0 05 mg n l and 0 006 mg p l respectively wang et al 2013 accordingly blue green algae usually compete better than other algae in n limitation or o2 deﬁciency situations xin et al 2017 the co2 exchange volume of a wetland ecosystem is influenced by environmental factors such as temperature humidity radiation and rainfall biological factors biomass and leaf area index and hydrological processes which show obvious characteristics of daily dynamics as well as seasonal and interannual dynamic changes hao et al 2011 zhong et al 2016 of course a simplified vertical migration of plankton is added to the box model and the multi dimensional field model baird et al 2004 fujii et al 2002 the complex multidimensional model can qualitatively study the effects of thermocline density cline and the vertical movement of plankton on plankton biomass yang 2010 beckmann and hense simulated the mechanism of the vertical movement of phytoplankton considering both the external mechanism of various gradients in the water environment and the energy and nutrient storage of phytoplankton as the internal mechanism beckmann and hense 2004 however because the current active behavior and population changes of the organisms themselves and the ecosystem response has not been clearly understood there are limitations to an in depth understanding of the field of water eutrophication 3 3 5 cluster id 7 semi enclosed marine a semi enclosed marine is similar to other coastal waters at the junction of open seas and inland areas therefore in addition to the effects of human activity freshwater inputs from river runoff and water exchange with open seas affect the material composition and lead to the transmission of semi enclosed marine material and the immature development of the system barausse et al 2009 the coastline and shape of the bay the seabed topography the topography around the bay and the wind field on the water surface have a decisive influence on the simulation results for water levels especially in a semi enclosed bay area where the bay mouth is consistent with the wind direction the longer the wind blows the greater the uncertainty shi et al 2011 for the flow rate the surface velocity is most affected by the uncertainty followed by underlying parameters middle parameters are the least affected dhi 2011 in recent decades many scholars have proposed and adopted different transport time scales to study the convection diffusion transport process in anti enclosed waters these scholars have sought to clarify the material components that play a key role in water quality and the ecosystem and in the evolution process of semi enclosed bays based on the ecosystem level monsen et al 2002 yuan et al 2007 cucco et al 2009 ranjbar and zaker 2016 jokinen et al 2018 meng et al 2018 arhonditsis et al tried to quantify the effects of seasonal rainfall events on the dynamics of a semi enclosed marine environment using integrated simulation methods the response function was modified by estimating the nutrient flux from non point sources to study the effects of seasonal rainfall events on the dynamics of the semi enclosed marine environment in gera bay lesvos island greece yang jie studied the characteristics of water transport in semi enclosed bays and the characteristics of water exchange with foreign waters the movement of a water body and the material composition in semi enclosed bays can be revealed based on the temporal and spatial characteristics of water environmental parameters further on this basis the cycle modules of marine ecosystems can be established including plankton as the main body such as nitrogen and phosphorus yang 2010 defne et al used the coupled model of the regional ocean simulation system roms and water quality analysis simulation program wasp to simulate the effects of seasonal rainfall events on the environmental dynamics of the semi enclosed barnegat bay the results indicated that the spatial and temporal dispersion of nutrient distribution had significant differences defne et al 2017 3 3 6 cluster id 8 chlorophyll fluorescence parameters cyanobacteria have been the subject of eutrophication related model studies since the 1990s patterson et al 1994 cui et al 2016 rolighed et al 2016 algae reproduction in freshwater ecosystems is a serious concern for ecosystems and human health because it reduces the quality and quantity of plants and animal habitats disrupts food web dynamics and produces oxygen deprived areas and toxins paerl et al 2011 miller et al 2017 researchers have invested ample effort and resources in predicting algae reproduction the predictions involve the use of quantitative indicators environmental drivers and mathematical models one of the most widely used models for predicting cyanobacteria outbreaks is the parameter model wong et al 2007 gill et al 2017 chlorophyll fluorescence parameters cfpars are the main indicators for evaluating photosystem efficiency and photosynthetic capacity of algae misra et al 2012 they have been widely used to determine the photosynthetic efficiency of phytoplankton and assess the growth range wang et al 2018a b for example the baltic operational oceanographic system boos is a real time oceanic observation system combining environmental budget models for algal bloom in the baltic sea with seasonal water projections wang 2016 gorham et al 2017 mohrholz et al 2015 hernandez et al 2015 artificial neural networks anns provide a choice of parametric forecast models where some environmental factors act as input variables to determine the evolution of algal blooms and predict cell densities of freshwater phytoplankton varieties bosse et al 2019 urquhart et al 2017 easthope and howard 1999 analytical methods include cross correlation generalized additive models and satellite remote sensing forecasting techniques although some ecological models have good predictive accuracy all of these methods are time consuming laborious and computationally complex wong et al 2007 baig et al 2017 the accuracy of these methods also depends on the selection of a set of appropriate parameters and models according to different lake conditions nutritional status and local meteorological and hydrological conditions therefore previous studies have emphasized the need for simple fast and geographically unrestricted methods to predict algal reproduction at the same time fluorescence parameters can capture the physiological characteristics of algae the model created by fluorescence parameters has considerable ability to predict early blooming warnings baig et al 2017 wang et al 2018a b 3 3 7 cluster id 10 evolving conceptual model depending on how the ecosystem is represented mathematically we can distinguish several classes of models mooij et al 2010 scarnecchia and jorgensen 1995 models are generally ﬁrst separated into two classes static type models and dynamic models bryhn and håkanson 2007 bryhn 2009 fornarelli et al 2013 for example the vollenweider vol model is a simple static regression model for predicting tp concentration in water the model uses a steady state assumption assuming that the lake accepts stable nutrient input for a long time and calculates tp concentration from specific parameters set by a specific lake even though milstead uses the input output model and constructs the maximum depth and volume of lakes to improve the prediction accuracy hu et al 2016 the vollenweider vol model still has a large error compared with other complex dynamic models hu et al 2016 milstead et al 2013 examples of complex dynamic models include the efdc model ce qual 2w model dyresm caedym model aquatox model pclake model and wasp complex dynamic models can be used to trace paleoclimate to reproduce the exchange of ecosystem materials and to assess climate change in the future fig 6 with improvements in computing power multi model coupling has been applied to these ecological models kong et al 2015 for example the pclake model can be used in combination with a statistical correlation model according to actual needs to reduce the sources of uncertainty in the use of a single model kong et al 2015 ruihong et al 2017 bruggeman and bolding 2014 trolle et al combined the dyresm caedym protech and pclake models to reduce the uncertainties of a single model in the prediction process trolle et al 2014 2012 the results show that in the prediction of complex climate change the prediction value of the multi model combination is evidently better than that of the single model trolle et al 2014 2012 van gerven et al 2015 janssen et al coupled pclake with delft3d delwaq using a developed database approach to modeling datm and they used spatial ecosystem bifurcation analysis seba technology to predict large shallow lakes the results show that spatial pattern distribution has differences in determining the nutrient load and the chlorophyll a content of large shallow lakes janssen et al 2017 fig 6 3 3 8 cluster id 11 nutrient transfer as an ecological model can reproduce the observed trends of the variables considered we evaluate the characteristics of nutrient transfer and retention through the main dynamic processes involved in nutrient dynamics billen et al 2007 nutrient salts are mainly transferred from the basin to surface water along three different routes 1 superficial runoff is the major source of particulate material originating from soil erosion although the associated water fluxes are minor 2 sub surface runoff is characterized by water flows with low residence time in the watershed and a composition reflecting that of the sub root water within the different land use classes of the catchment 3 base flow corresponds to the discharge of the aquifers with long residence times and its composition in terms of the nutrients reflects the past 100 years of land use in the watershed billen et al 2007 vander et al 2010 woodward et al 2016 phosphorus is mainly transferred from catchment area to surface water by inorganic phosphorus through surface runoff nitrogen migrates mainly to surface water by solution thieu et al tried an approach linking global empirical modeling of nutrient transfer from the source to the river with a sub regional spatially distributed and process based approach of instream retention to assess the rationality of nutrient transfer in rivers thieu et al 2010 4 conclusions and prospects 4 1 conclusions 1 ecological models developed in the 1960s were static models of total phosphorus and salt basin nutrient load in the water body the most typical of which is the vollenweider vol model static models are simple easy to learn and can quickly calculate or control the nutrient concentration required for eutrophication of water bodies the biggest drawback of static models is that the calculation error is large 2 since the 1990s ecological modeling has seen the development of multi dimensional and time dependent models dynamic models can simulate water eutrophication more comprehensively and can represent different stages and degrees of water eutrophication compared with static models dynamic models are more systematic and reasonable and have strong comprehensive evaluation ability 3 from the perspective of knowledge structure and thematic evolution in trends in ecological modeling the frontier and hotspot areas of ecological model research and application in the 21 st century involve the impact of eutrophication on the ecosystem the impact of nutrient cycling on the ecological environment the impact of climate change and the management of eutrophic water bodies 4 2 prospects researchers from all over the world are working hard to improve the application of ecological models to maximize their function and better serve research in the field of water environment science at present ecological models are being developed based on the following aspects 1 multi model combination to reduce the sources of uncertainty in the use of single models ecological models can be used in conjunction with statistical models according to actual need 2 simplify calibration model parameters in the calibration process the input parameters are simplified and the model is calibrated by automatic calibration tools compared with the traditional manual calibration program the automatic calibration software has the advantages of speed high calibration efficiency and high number of parameter iterations it is suitable for complex dynamic models 3 increase early warning research for ecological models a long term automatic monitoring and data sharing mechanism is established to fit the simulation results well with the observation results during the monitoring and sampling process the sampling sites and times have artificial selectivity and the uncertainty of measurement results increases and owing to the lack of field data some processes of the model cannot be accurately simulated in actual operation 4 in recent years more and more ecological models have focused on modeling the functional characteristics of dominant species typically these model research objectives are related to the assessment of medium term projections and long term evolution of water eutrophication under the influence of global change urbanization greenhouse effect population growth etc to give ecological models more accurate prediction ability strong

prediction ability of ecological models keywords eutrophication ecological models citespace knowledge mapping 1 introduction eutrophication is one of the most challenging environmental problems faced by surface water bodies today li et al 2017 according to the latest data on 107 important lakes reservoirs issued by the ministry of ecology and environment of china 10 of the important 107 lakes reservoirs in china were nutritional status 61 7 lakes reservoirs belonged to middle nutritional status 25 of them were mild eutrophication status and 6 of them were moderate eutrophication status ministry of ecological environment of the people s republic of china mee 2019 estimates from published studies reveal that approximately 30 billion tons of polluted water will be discharged directly into these lakes and that by 2030 all urban lakes and most medium sized lakes in urban rural fringe areas of china may be facing water eutrophication yang et al 2008 since the first eutrophication model the vollenweider vol model appeared in 1968 the application of ecological models has developed rapidly the applicability of these ecosystem models spans a wide range of temporal and spatial scales ranging from zero dimensional to three dimensional eco models have received significant attention from the academic community in previous studies mooij et al 2010 bhagowati and ahamad 2018 representative reviews have mostly been based on summaries of the relevant literature with no measurement methods introduced vinçon and casenave 2019 here the application of eco models in water eutrophication is summarized the knowledge mapping method of literature measurement has specific advantages in the analysis of research contents methods and trends knowledge mapping can reveal the development trends of specific research fields by using mathematical and statistical methods within a limited time frame we are able to visualize the shape of knowledge mapping intuitively in view of the great potential of the application of ecological models in the field of water eutrophication it is helpful for beginners to master the application of research results of ecological models in a comprehensive and systematic way as soon as possible the bibliographic data used for this article are culled from the web of science wos produced by thomson reuters the web of science database of the institute for scientific information isi is one of the world s largest and most comprehensive libraries of integrated academic information resources it provides users an online portal to a number of resources including the science citation index expanded sci expanded social sciences citation index ssci conference proceedings citation index science cpci s conference proceedings citation index social science humanities cpci ssh current chemical reactions ccr expanded and index chemicus ic although each of these citation databases is massive in size and scope not all journals or articles are indexed recent statistics suggest that the multidisciplinary coverage of the web of science encompasses over 50 000 scholarly books 12 000 journals and 160 000 conference proceedings visualization analysis includes multiple perspective co citation network mapping self organizing mapping social network analysis mapping multi dimensional scaling mapping and timeline knowledge mapping among other things for many visual analysis systems based on a citation network the knowledge map generated using citespace is one of the most recognized technologies in the international knowledge metrology circle chen et al 2010 chen 2006 citespace has been used in more than 60 fields such as computer science information science and medicine through data mining processing metrology drawing and other steps the citespace software realizes the graphical expression of knowledge frameworks structures interactions cross overs derivations and other internal links it integrates clustering analysis social network analysis and multi dimensional scale analysis it also can detect and analyze the evolving trends in the research frontiers of the corresponding disciplines as well as the relationship between the research frontiers and their knowledge base this review uses the knowledge visualization analysis software citespace and traditional literature combing to clarify the frontiers hot spots development trends and communication tracks of ecological models in the field of water eutrophication research in this study we aim to analyze the research on the application of ecological models for eutrophication from both global and individual perspectives based on online databases and with the use of scientiﬁc knowledge mapping software this review includes the trends in literature output star papers and topics of research focus and describes the emerging trends in research on the application of ecological models in water eutrophication the aim of this review is to improve the application level of ecological models in the field of water eutrophication and to better serve environmental water science research 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection given its long time span and the quantity and quality of entries the isi web of science database provides a guarantee for the reliability of raw data in visual analysis yu et al 2010 moreover the quality of literature retrieval determines the accuracy of the knowledge map analysis and the accurate construction of the search query is the premise of accurate data acquisition in the search process it is necessary to control the literature into the purview excessive purview will introduce irrelevant literature which will pollute the retrieval results whereas too small a purview will filter out relevant literature and reduce the comprehensiveness of search results therefore the search type needs to be adjusted according to the search results so that the search results are as comprehensive and accurate as possible here the search criteria are subject model and ecosystem and eutrophication to cover the development history of ecological models for eutrophication the retrieval time span was set from 1968 to 2018 after screening each piece of data is downloaded as a full record text format in total 2099 valid publications were extracted finally the output file format of the rename is download txt 2 2 data analysis with the accelerated development of information networks scholars can analyze a subject by visualization analysis of subject knowledge by drawing a scientific knowledge map of literature data information in this study citespace is selected as the main analysis software however it can only outline the whole research field and not extract in depth literature details therefore based on the analysis results of citespace and the traditional literature combing method we performed critical reading of the relevant literature to clarify the frontiers focus topics development trends and communication trajectories of ecological modeling in the field of water eutrophication 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of publication outputs according to a publication s annual distribution statistics and subject classification visualization map a preliminary understanding of the ecological models for eutrophication is formed on the one hand relevant research progress can be grouped into three phases the ﬁrst phase was from 1968 to 1990 with research still in its infancy only eight papers were published in this 22 year period by web of science database for the search criteria model and ecosystem and eutrophication accounting for only 0 38 of the total output in this period the average paper output was about only one paper ever 3 years the second phase was from 1991 to 2010 when there was a significant increase in the number of published papers in total 842 papers were published accounting for 40 11 of the total papers on average 42 papers were issued yearly the third phase was from 2011 to 2017 in the past 7 years 1249 articles accounting for 59 50 of the total were issued and an average of 106 articles were issued yearly fig 1 on the other hand looking at the number of papers published in various countries and regions most applied research is performed in north america united states of america and canada and asia mostly in china eutrophication models developed in western europe the netherlands italy switzerland and germany and northern europe finland the uk norway sweden and denmark also received special attention fig 2 since the 21 st century research on the application of ecological models has entered the phase of high speed development and the number published papers in the field of eutrophication has shown a blowout trend furthermore there has been a signiﬁcant increase in modeling studies conducted on chinese applications of eutrophication models particularly since 2010 hou et al 2004 huang et al 2012 li et al 2014 in recent times eco modeling has become an effective tool for eutrophication control in terms of its better predictive capacity the popular state of knowledge about water eutrophication and advances in eco models will be of great use for future research 3 2 cooperation network analysis the results of the co occurrence network analysis indicate that there is a partial cooperative relationship among authors co occurrence network analysis does not only provide references for evaluating academic influence but also facilitates the discovery of scholars and institutions worthy of attention the size of the nodes in the network reflects the number of letters sent by an author country region or institution and the links indicate their intrinsic relationships 3 2 1 author analysis through the analysis of the structural characteristics of the author of a communication and his her cooperative network a core author group and its cooperative relationship in this field can be determined after converting 2099 valid literature data it is imported to the citespace software and an authors clustered knowledge map is generated fig 3 table 1 the number and size of nodes in fig 3 represent the co occurrence frequency of core author groups the number and size of lines reflect the cooperation relationship and cooperation intensity of authors they constitute the knowledge map of author groups and cooperation networks there are 350 nodes 255 links and the network density is 0 0042 as can be seen from the graph the application of ecological models in the field of eutrophication can be divided into four core research teams a paerl h w wooij w m janse j h jeppessn e trolle d van nes e h b paerl h w perry e s ludsin s a c arhonditsis g b ramin m shimoda y and d meier h e m neumann t savchuk o p ellola k andersson h c in terms of co occurrence frequency the top two authors are arhonditsis g b and mooij w m with co occurrence times of 21 and 17 respectively these represent the most important scholars in the application of ecological models for eutrophication and lay the academic foundation in this field their publications account for 5 96 of the total number of papers in the past three years wang h maar m liu x zhang y wang r bakker e s and zhang y l have had high numbers of publications statistics show that 43 scholars have published more than five papers as first authors accounting for 15 67 of the total number of papers this shows that the authors contributions are relatively high and core authors contribute a lot to the literature from the point of view of the author s cooperative network the application of ecological models is characterized by a small concentration and large dispersion at present several core research teams have been formed but the strength of the links between the research teams is weak and academic exchanges are infrequent in fact since 1960s many papers on lake eutrophication have been published e g from the group of sven e jorgensen which should be far more than 20 however from 1968 to 1990 only eight papers were shown in the present search results because we use model and ecosystem and eutrophication as the search topic in web of science database since the scientific nature of knowledge mapping is rooted in the data foundation it is a key issue to accurately and comprehensively retrieve all the documents of the subject to be studied in order to avoid the problem of abuse and misuse due to improper data retrieval strategy poor image performance and shallow application level when using the visual mapping software citespace we should pay attention to data retrieval methods and have a clear statement in research papers in addition to using data from the existing database we should also try to collect the mining data based on the problem to be studied 3 2 2 institutions analysis citespace is used to analyze the distribution of research power actual contribution and cooperation among the institutions in the field of eutrophication the citespace atlas contains 311 nodes and 927 connection lines table 2 and fig 4 according to the data analysis the highest number of papers is from the chinese academy of sciences 76 papers if we add 22 university of chinese academy of sciences univ chinese acad sci articles there are 98 articles which is much higher than other institutions among the top 20 agencies seven are from the united states namely univresity of maryland us epa us geological survey university of washington national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa university of wisconsin and smithsonian environmental research center with a total of 204 articles followed by china with five institutions namely chinese academy of sciences university of chinese acadamy of sciences nanjing university peking university and beijing normal university with a total of 150 articles about 50 to 100 articles were published by three swedish institutions namely stockholm university uppsala university and swedish university of agricultural sciences with a total of 93 articles fewer than 50 articles were published by the netherlands canada finland and france at the same time it can be seen from table 2 that the application of ecological models in the field of eutrophication is mainly concentrated in 399 university documents followed by research institutes environmental protection departments and other institutions the following institutions published more than 25 papers through such literature search chinese academy of sciences stockholm university aarhus university university of maryland wageningen university us epa us geological survey and university of toronto among which stockholm university was the first rank with as many as 52 papers then followed by aarhus university with 50 papers university of maryland with 48 papers wageningen university with 41papers university toronto with 27 papers etc see table 2 among them the number of papers published by the above universities reached 7 91 of the total chinese academy of sciences stockholm university and aarhus university contributed for 7 0 of the total number of papers the number of institutions with more than 20 papers accounted for 85 96 of the top 20 institutions contributed 24 7 of all papers this indicates that eutrophication research is relatively concentrated in fewer institutions meanwhile in terms of cooperation intensity the centrality of the chinese academy of sciences is only 0 12 whereas that of stockholm university is 0 23 and that of aarhus university is 0 26 specifically through the analysis of the relevant literature of the these main institutions it is found that there is less cooperation between the various agencies and that it is less intense further interdisciplinary cross regional cooperation between countries is poor and the formation of a network of cooperative institutions is mainly dominated by the author s academic relationship for example the most prolific agency the chinese acad sci has few connections with other agencies moreover these results show that there are relatively few links between chinese institutions themselves reveals that most chinese research institutions conduct research independently this is not conducive to the sustainable development of the application of ecological models in china therefore academic exchanges within china need to be strengthened 3 3 hot research topics on ecological models in the field of water eutrophication the distribution and evolution of research topics can intuitively reflect changes in focus areas analytical perspectives and research methods at different times co citation as a refined expression of the research topic of academic papers can reveal the internal relationships of knowledge within disciplines to a certain extent co citation analysis expresses the relationship between documents by the frequency of being cited by other documents simultaneously that is to say two documents are cited by other documents simultaneously the higher the frequency of citation the closer the relationship this means that the subjects of two documents are more similar the analysis of clustering and key nodes in the clustering of co cited networks can reveal the knowledge structure knowledge base and evolutionary characteristics of the research frontier as well as the literature which plays a key role in the evolution process in total 368 nodes and 901 connections were obtained as shown in fig 5 on one hand the central area of the network shows a dense red circle this indicates a high level of burst references which indicates a signiﬁcant increase in citations from other years eleven different hot clusters were obtained through cluster analysis the detailed feature information is shown in table 3 in the following a brief analysis of the speciﬁc research groups was made and the central or burst literature in each cluster was presented in the order of its respective id according to the relevant to water ecological model we select 8 among 11 clusters to make detailed explanation on the other hand highly cited authors table 4 appearing on the citation frequency of the cited paper and the important nodes that appear on the important nodes represent the basis of applied research on the ecological model 3 3 1 cluster id 0 baltic sea the baltic sea which is a marginal sea of the atlantic ocean enclosed by denmark estonia finland latvia lithuania sweden northeast germany poland russia and the north and central european plain has been in a state of eutrophication meier 2007 in 1992 the countries of the baltic region signed the helsinki convention on the protection for the marine environment of the baltic sea area convention to promote ecological restoration and preserve the ecological balance in the baltic sea region the convention requires contracting parties individually or jointly to agree to take all appropriate legislative administrative or other relevant measures to prevent and eliminate pollution contracting parties uniformly used a multi parameter multi indicator modeling tool called heat 3 0 helcom eutrophication assessment tool 3 0 hermanni et al 2010 pyhälä et al 2014 using a systematic quantitative method combined with the relative uncertainty of different indices the state parties use the change coefficient to analyze the reliability change in eutrophication status evaluations fleming et al 2015 meanwhile denmark uses the mike21 mike3 model to carry out daily water forecasting such as flow velocity and direction wave period wave height and direction salinity temperature dissolved oxygen and changing of chlorophyll concentration and publishes 36 h accurate forecasting to the public on the internet erichsen and rasch 2002 asmala and saikku analyzed the presence of nitrogen and phosphorus in rainbow trout and the domestic consumption of trout they found that one fiftieth of nitrogen and phosphorus input into trout culture entered human food consumption while up to 70 of nitrogen and phosphorus were remitted to the baltic sea which induced eutrophication pollution of water bodies in the baltic region asmala and saikku 2010 the purpose of these studies was to estimate whether current monitoring data are enough to assess the eutrophication situation in the baltic sea josefson et al 2009 3 3 2 cluster id 3 risk assessment eco modeling is an economic and effective tool for estimating and managing the environmental fate and ecological risk of chemicals ang et al 2001 ecological risk assessment era evaluates the likelihood that adverse ecological effects may occur or are occurring because of exposure to one or more stressors us epa 1998 it can be used to better understand risk management and decision making to meet the protection objectives and requirements of water pollution related laws and regulations the aquatox model is perhaps the most comprehensive model available park et al 2008 as can be seen by comparison with other representative dynamic models being used for risk assessment it has been widely used in the ecological risk assessment of organochlorine pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons polychlorinated biphenyls and phenolic compounds in water bodies through the food mesh module mcknight et al 2010 karaaslan 2017 the model can accurately calculate the concentration of pollutants in the food chain it is also used to assess the direct and indirect effects of toxic stress in complex aquatic ecosystems lombardo et al 2015 the model is simple with a flexible structure and it provides a variety of analysis tools that are easy to use park et al 2008 sourisseau et al 2008 nair et al 2015 although the model is designed to promote the development of new applications and scenarios most model application studies focus on the ecological risk assessment of toxic substances based on food webs and lack the evaluation index of water pollution by the epiphytic community zhang et al 2013a b recently however panagiotis et al provided a set of amore dss tools for analyzing and integrating exposure and effect information to assess the risk of species living on specific contaminated aquatic systems based on potential harmful components isigonis et al 2019 aquatox is a useful tool for investigating the relative importance of direct toxicity and ecological interactions however it is difficult to apply aquatox to prospective chemical risk assessment at this stage owing to potential model uncertainties and practical limitations of on site scale assessment therefore the improvement in quantitative monitoring of feeding preferences and abundance over time of the most representative species in each functional group will be of great help to re determine the parameterization and calibration of the model grechi et al 2016 3 3 3 cluster id 5 competition pattern the researchers used complex ecological models to explain the competition patterns and structural changes of phytoplankton plant communities under nutrient enrichment conditions it is far more difficult though essential to delineate when and where resource competition is important and the patterns of species composition and characteristics that result as such researchers have repeatedly tried to develop the principle of competitive exclusion to explain the species diversity of floating communities the various arguments cited can be grouped into three broad categories 1 food web interactions favor species coexistence 2 resource based competition entails tradeoffs and growth strategies and 3 spatiotemporal variability zhao et al 2008 carleton et al 2009 hansen et al 2017 at the same time competition is one of the driving forces of zooplankton population succession this is influenced by many factors such as individual size food habits food type and nutritional quality temperature food concentration and initial density and the population structure size liu 2007 eco models tend to combine physics chemistry and biology they mainly study the energy flow material circulation and information flow in the system and its steady state regulation mechanism ecological models highlight the impact of physical and biological interaction mechanisms on the dynamics of complex ecosystems liu et al 2003 based on a hydrodynamic the ecological model uses a material transfer equation to describe the biological and chemical state variables the source term is coupled to represent the biological process while physical factors such as hydrology and meteorology as the driving force of the whole system appear in the initial and boundary conditions there is a competitive relationship among plankton yang 2010 in the ecological model there are three phytoplankton functional groups diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria which differ in resource competition strategies nitrogen phosphorus light temperature and metabolic rates as well as in their morphological characteristics sedimentation rate shading effect arhonditsis and brett 2005a zhao et al 2008 simultaneously because complex models project species competition to more niche dimensions the model by arhonditsis et al simultaneously examines the effects of functional characteristics abiotic conditions and food web interactions on observed structural changes in phytoplankton communities arhonditsis and brett 2005b academic studies have shown that the close and positive relationship between diatoms fast growing species with excellent phosphorus dynamics and horned animals p rich animals reduces grazing pressure on other residents of phytoplankton communities zhao et al 2008 and large zooplankton herbivores can reduce the sensitivity of phytoplankton to external disturbances cottingham and schindler 2000 cottingham et al 2004 3 3 4 cluster id 6 biological factors biological factors are important constraints on ecological models wetland ecosystems and lake ecosystems can constrain water biomass from each other after harvesting a large number of aquatic plants in grassy lakes the biomass of algae produced at a given nutrient supply level can be strongly altered owing to the lack or absence of aquatic plants smith 2003 in typical nutrient lakes janse et al studied the physical lake water depth lake size sediment type etc chemical and biological factors life cycle growth and death parameters of the steady state transition between clear water clear water state dominated by aquatic plants and turbid state dominated by phytoplankton in a shallow lake ecosystem through the shallow lake model pclake janse et al 1998 janse 2005 therefore the control of algae growth and reproduction should not only control the condition of reducing nutrient load but also increase the amount of aquatic flora scholz starke et al simulated the dynamics of biotic green blue diatoms and abiotic components of the three gorges reservoir tgr ecosystem hydrodynamics nutrients scholz starke et al 2018 the results showed that blue green algae have a p half saturation rate of 0 03 mg l and n half saturation rate of 0 4 mg l whereas green algae have half saturation rates of 0 05 mg n l and 0 006 mg p l respectively wang et al 2013 accordingly blue green algae usually compete better than other algae in n limitation or o2 deﬁciency situations xin et al 2017 the co2 exchange volume of a wetland ecosystem is influenced by environmental factors such as temperature humidity radiation and rainfall biological factors biomass and leaf area index and hydrological processes which show obvious characteristics of daily dynamics as well as seasonal and interannual dynamic changes hao et al 2011 zhong et al 2016 of course a simplified vertical migration of plankton is added to the box model and the multi dimensional field model baird et al 2004 fujii et al 2002 the complex multidimensional model can qualitatively study the effects of thermocline density cline and the vertical movement of plankton on plankton biomass yang 2010 beckmann and hense simulated the mechanism of the vertical movement of phytoplankton considering both the external mechanism of various gradients in the water environment and the energy and nutrient storage of phytoplankton as the internal mechanism beckmann and hense 2004 however because the current active behavior and population changes of the organisms themselves and the ecosystem response has not been clearly understood there are limitations to an in depth understanding of the field of water eutrophication 3 3 5 cluster id 7 semi enclosed marine a semi enclosed marine is similar to other coastal waters at the junction of open seas and inland areas therefore in addition to the effects of human activity freshwater inputs from river runoff and water exchange with open seas affect the material composition and lead to the transmission of semi enclosed marine material and the immature development of the system barausse et al 2009 the coastline and shape of the bay the seabed topography the topography around the bay and the wind field on the water surface have a decisive influence on the simulation results for water levels especially in a semi enclosed bay area where the bay mouth is consistent with the wind direction the longer the wind blows the greater the uncertainty shi et al 2011 for the flow rate the surface velocity is most affected by the uncertainty followed by underlying parameters middle parameters are the least affected dhi 2011 in recent decades many scholars have proposed and adopted different transport time scales to study the convection diffusion transport process in anti enclosed waters these scholars have sought to clarify the material components that play a key role in water quality and the ecosystem and in the evolution process of semi enclosed bays based on the ecosystem level monsen et al 2002 yuan et al 2007 cucco et al 2009 ranjbar and zaker 2016 jokinen et al 2018 meng et al 2018 arhonditsis et al tried to quantify the effects of seasonal rainfall events on the dynamics of a semi enclosed marine environment using integrated simulation methods the response function was modified by estimating the nutrient flux from non point sources to study the effects of seasonal rainfall events on the dynamics of the semi enclosed marine environment in gera bay lesvos island greece yang jie studied the characteristics of water transport in semi enclosed bays and the characteristics of water exchange with foreign waters the movement of a water body and the material composition in semi enclosed bays can be revealed based on the temporal and spatial characteristics of water environmental parameters further on this basis the cycle modules of marine ecosystems can be established including plankton as the main body such as nitrogen and phosphorus yang 2010 defne et al used the coupled model of the regional ocean simulation system roms and water quality analysis simulation program wasp to simulate the effects of seasonal rainfall events on the environmental dynamics of the semi enclosed barnegat bay the results indicated that the spatial and temporal dispersion of nutrient distribution had significant differences defne et al 2017 3 3 6 cluster id 8 chlorophyll fluorescence parameters cyanobacteria have been the subject of eutrophication related model studies since the 1990s patterson et al 1994 cui et al 2016 rolighed et al 2016 algae reproduction in freshwater ecosystems is a serious concern for ecosystems and human health because it reduces the quality and quantity of plants and animal habitats disrupts food web dynamics and produces oxygen deprived areas and toxins paerl et al 2011 miller et al 2017 researchers have invested ample effort and resources in predicting algae reproduction the predictions involve the use of quantitative indicators environmental drivers and mathematical models one of the most widely used models for predicting cyanobacteria outbreaks is the parameter model wong et al 2007 gill et al 2017 chlorophyll fluorescence parameters cfpars are the main indicators for evaluating photosystem efficiency and photosynthetic capacity of algae misra et al 2012 they have been widely used to determine the photosynthetic efficiency of phytoplankton and assess the growth range wang et al 2018a b for example the baltic operational oceanographic system boos is a real time oceanic observation system combining environmental budget models for algal bloom in the baltic sea with seasonal water projections wang 2016 gorham et al 2017 mohrholz et al 2015 hernandez et al 2015 artificial neural networks anns provide a choice of parametric forecast models where some environmental factors act as input variables to determine the evolution of algal blooms and predict cell densities of freshwater phytoplankton varieties bosse et al 2019 urquhart et al 2017 easthope and howard 1999 analytical methods include cross correlation generalized additive models and satellite remote sensing forecasting techniques although some ecological models have good predictive accuracy all of these methods are time consuming laborious and computationally complex wong et al 2007 baig et al 2017 the accuracy of these methods also depends on the selection of a set of appropriate parameters and models according to different lake conditions nutritional status and local meteorological and hydrological conditions therefore previous studies have emphasized the need for simple fast and geographically unrestricted methods to predict algal reproduction at the same time fluorescence parameters can capture the physiological characteristics of algae the model created by fluorescence parameters has considerable ability to predict early blooming warnings baig et al 2017 wang et al 2018a b 3 3 7 cluster id 10 evolving conceptual model depending on how the ecosystem is represented mathematically we can distinguish several classes of models mooij et al 2010 scarnecchia and jorgensen 1995 models are generally ﬁrst separated into two classes static type models and dynamic models bryhn and håkanson 2007 bryhn 2009 fornarelli et al 2013 for example the vollenweider vol model is a simple static regression model for predicting tp concentration in water the model uses a steady state assumption assuming that the lake accepts stable nutrient input for a long time and calculates tp concentration from specific parameters set by a specific lake even though milstead uses the input output model and constructs the maximum depth and volume of lakes to improve the prediction accuracy hu et al 2016 the vollenweider vol model still has a large error compared with other complex dynamic models hu et al 2016 milstead et al 2013 examples of complex dynamic models include the efdc model ce qual 2w model dyresm caedym model aquatox model pclake model and wasp complex dynamic models can be used to trace paleoclimate to reproduce the exchange of ecosystem materials and to assess climate change in the future fig 6 with improvements in computing power multi model coupling has been applied to these ecological models kong et al 2015 for example the pclake model can be used in combination with a statistical correlation model according to actual needs to reduce the sources of uncertainty in the use of a single model kong et al 2015 ruihong et al 2017 bruggeman and bolding 2014 trolle et al combined the dyresm caedym protech and pclake models to reduce the uncertainties of a single model in the prediction process trolle et al 2014 2012 the results show that in the prediction of complex climate change the prediction value of the multi model combination is evidently better than that of the single model trolle et al 2014 2012 van gerven et al 2015 janssen et al coupled pclake with delft3d delwaq using a developed database approach to modeling datm and they used spatial ecosystem bifurcation analysis seba technology to predict large shallow lakes the results show that spatial pattern distribution has differences in determining the nutrient load and the chlorophyll a content of large shallow lakes janssen et al 2017 fig 6 3 3 8 cluster id 11 nutrient transfer as an ecological model can reproduce the observed trends of the variables considered we evaluate the characteristics of nutrient transfer and retention through the main dynamic processes involved in nutrient dynamics billen et al 2007 nutrient salts are mainly transferred from the basin to surface water along three different routes 1 superficial runoff is the major source of particulate material originating from soil erosion although the associated water fluxes are minor 2 sub surface runoff is characterized by water flows with low residence time in the watershed and a composition reflecting that of the sub root water within the different land use classes of the catchment 3 base flow corresponds to the discharge of the aquifers with long residence times and its composition in terms of the nutrients reflects the past 100 years of land use in the watershed billen et al 2007 vander et al 2010 woodward et al 2016 phosphorus is mainly transferred from catchment area to surface water by inorganic phosphorus through surface runoff nitrogen migrates mainly to surface water by solution thieu et al tried an approach linking global empirical modeling of nutrient transfer from the source to the river with a sub regional spatially distributed and process based approach of instream retention to assess the rationality of nutrient transfer in rivers thieu et al 2010 4 conclusions and prospects 4 1 conclusions 1 ecological models developed in the 1960s were static models of total phosphorus and salt basin nutrient load in the water body the most typical of which is the vollenweider vol model static models are simple easy to learn and can quickly calculate or control the nutrient concentration required for eutrophication of water bodies the biggest drawback of static models is that the calculation error is large 2 since the 1990s ecological modeling has seen the development of multi dimensional and time dependent models dynamic models can simulate water eutrophication more comprehensively and can represent different stages and degrees of water eutrophication compared with static models dynamic models are more systematic and reasonable and have strong comprehensive evaluation ability 3 from the perspective of knowledge structure and thematic evolution in trends in ecological modeling the frontier and hotspot areas of ecological model research and application in the 21 st century involve the impact of eutrophication on the ecosystem the impact of nutrient cycling on the ecological environment the impact of climate change and the management of eutrophic water bodies 4 2 prospects researchers from all over the world are working hard to improve the application of ecological models to maximize their function and better serve research in the field of water environment science at present ecological models are being developed based on the following aspects 1 multi model combination to reduce the sources of uncertainty in the use of single models ecological models can be used in conjunction with statistical models according to actual need 2 simplify calibration model parameters in the calibration process the input parameters are simplified and the model is calibrated by automatic calibration tools compared with the traditional manual calibration program the automatic calibration software has the advantages of speed high calibration efficiency and high number of parameter iterations it is suitable for complex dynamic models 3 increase early warning research for ecological models a long term automatic monitoring and data sharing mechanism is established to fit the simulation results well with the observation results during the monitoring and sampling process the sampling sites and times have artificial selectivity and the uncertainty of measurement results increases and owing to the lack of field data some processes of the model cannot be accurately simulated in actual operation 4 in recent years more and more ecological models have focused on modeling the functional characteristics of dominant species typically these model research objectives are related to the assessment of medium term projections and long term evolution of water eutrophication under the influence of global change urbanization greenhouse effect population growth etc to give ecological models more accurate prediction ability strong

24988,a consequence of genetic recombination can be the evolution of highly virulent pathogen strains virulence can manifest through various mechanisms of host pathogen interaction that facilitate transmission we discovered a highly virulent chimeric ranavirus in georgia usa estimated transmission parameters using controlled experiments and developed compartmental disease models to examine potential consequences on tadpoles of a susceptible host species lithobates sylvaticus our models included three transmission pathways direct transmission via host contact environmental transmission via shed virions in water and transmission via necrophagy of morbid individuals unlike previous models we categorized individuals into multiple stages of infection susceptible latency and infectious where the probability of disease induced mortality increased throughout the duration of infection following a gamma distribution with an integer shape parameter our simulations showed that accounting for pathogen incubation improved model predictions when compared to survival data from controlled experiments we found that transmission due to direct contact of tadpoles was the dominant transmission pathway however environmental transmission played a larger role as tadpole density increased and the epidemic progressed estimated r 0 basic reproduction number values 570 for all transmission pathways indicate that targeting only one transmission pathway is unlikely to thwart invasion additionally the high invasion potential and diseased induced mortality associated with this chimeric ranavirus indicate that this pathogen is a substantial threat to amphibian biodiversity in the united states keywords ranavirus transmission amphibians disease model amphibian declines emerging infectious disease pathogen model 1 introduction identifying the importance of transmission pathways under varying conditions is fundamental to characterizing the epidemiology of host pathogen systems tien and earn 2010 pathogens can infect hosts through various pathways environmental transmission can occur through air water or soil and depends on various factors such as host shedding rates of the pathogen and pathogen persistence outside the host nelson et al 2009 briggs et al 2010 transmission can also occur through direct contact between infected and uninfected individuals and that probability can change as disease progresses in the host mccallum et al 2001 if key transmission pathways can be identified disease management or intervention strategies can be conceived to thwart or prevent an outbreak langwig et al 2015 compartmental models such as susceptible infectious si and susceptible infectious recovered sir are commonly used to characterize the epidemiology of host pathogen systems estimate the invasion potential of a pathogen i e basic reproduction number r 0 and estimate outbreak size in hosts keeling and rohani 2011 these models commonly assume that the duration of host infectiousness follows an exponential distribution keeling and rohani 2011 which often is unrealistic because this assumes that the probability of remaining infectious over time drops dramatically more typically duration of host infectiousness is gamma distributed wearing et al 2005 lloyd 2001 and consequently individuals contribute to pathogen transmission over time frames that are closer to the mean duration of infectiousness moreover hosts that are more diseased can be more infectious previous investigations have expanded the infectious compartment into multiple stages each with exponentially distributed durations which sum together in order to approximate gamma distributed durations of infection lloyd 2001 krylova and earn 2013 wearing et al 2005 however few have used empirical data to estimate changes in host infectiousness through the course of disease progression finally few mathematical models have explicitly incorporated heterogeneities in host infectiousness with environmental transmission which could increase during an outbreak especially in aquatic ecosystems where pathogens might accumulate in water ranaviruses are globally emerging pathogens that affect amphibians reptiles and fish gray and chinchar 2015 this pathogen is a double stranded dna virus that can infect hosts through the water or by direct contact brunner et al 2007 only one study has previously developed a compartmental si model for ranaviruses and it did not consider changes in transmission with disease progression duffus 2012 that study predicted a stable equilibrium between common frog rana temporaria adults and ranavirus in the united kingdom duffus 2012 however the susceptibility of most adult amphibians to ranavirus is less than tadpoles because of a more robust and rapid immune response grayfer et al 2015 indeed catastrophic die offs of larval wood frogs lithobates sylvaticus involving thousands of individuals have been reported harp and petranka 2006 brunner et al 2011 wheelwright et al 2014 population projection models suggest that ranaviruses can cause amphibian population declines and extinction earl and gray 2014 earl et al 2016 but those models cannot determine influential pathways in this study we used a system of ordinary differential equations and empirical data to characterize the epidemiology of a recently discovered chimeric frog virus 3 fv3 like ranavirus claytor et al 2017 and its potential effects on a population of wood frog tadpoles using our experimental results for model parameterization we expanded previous modeling efforts duffus 2012 greer et al 2008 to include multiple transmission pathways i e direct contact necrophagy and environmental stage dependent transmission and r 0 estimates for each pathway we show that incorporating multiple host infection stages for direct transmission and pathogen shedding improves model fit and that all transmission pathways have high invasion potential illustrating the threat of this chimeric ranavirus to biodiversity in north america 2 methods 2 1 empirical methods we performed all experiments in a controlled laboratory environment at the johnson animal research and teaching unit of the university of tennessee institute of agriculture we collected egg masses from breeding wood frogs l sylvaticus in the wild and reared them outdoors in wading pools until the experiments began tennessee scientific collection permit 1990 all experiments were performed at room temperature 22 24 c and started when tadpoles were approximately gosner stage 30 which is the midpoint of pre metamorphic development for tadpoles wells 2007 water temperature and development stage are known to influence susceptibility results haislip et al 2011 brand et al 2016 hence they were held constant in our experiments we fed tadpoles commercial fish pellets ad libitum until the experiments began then switched to a diet of 12 of their body mass during the experiment hoverman et al 2011 all experiments followed approved university of tennessee iacuc protocol 2140 2 1 1 contact rate and probability of transmission given contact experiments we estimated contact rates for wood frog tadpoles in 12 l plastic tubs 724 cm2 that contained 5 5 l of water and 11 tadpoles which is approximately 153 tadpoles per m2 this is a moderate density of wood frog tadpoles based on estimates in vernal pools in north carolina usa petranka et al 2003 harp and petranka 2006 because infection by a pathogen can change activity parris et al 2005 we infected one tadpole and measured number of contacts with that tadpole during three 10 min intervals at 2 4 and 6 h following the start of co habitation the tadpole was infected via a 3 day exposure in a 1 l tub to 103 plaque forming units pfus per ml of a frog virus 3 fv3 like ranavirus miller et al 2007 which is sufficient to cause infection and disease in wood frog tadpoles hoverman et al 2011 warne et al 2011 we estimated contact rates by observing tadpoles from a distance of 1 m so not to influence activity and recorded number of contacts with the infected individual during the 10 min observation window there were 20 replicate tubs and each tub was observed three times data were summarized as number of contacts with an infected tadpole per minute then extrapolated to daily contact rates assuming 12 h of daily activity wells 2007 we performed a second experiment to estimate the probability of transmission given contact similar to the previous experiment we infected five wood frog tadpoles by exposing them to 103 pfu ml of the same fv3 like isolate given that the probability of transmission can change with post exposure pe duration to a pathogen lloyd 2001 we performed direct contact exposures at 24 48 72 and 96 h pe we emulated direct contact by touching each infected tadpole to five uninfected tadpoles for 1 s then placed the animals in individual 1 l tubs and followed their fate for 14 days brunner et al 2007 for consistency the original five infected tadpoles were used for each direct contact exposure with n 25 5 infected 5 uninfected tadpoles possible transmission events per 24 h time step we humanely euthanized surviving individuals using benzocaine hydrochloride collected a homogenate of liver and kidney tissue for virus testing discussed later and froze samples at 80 c until processing we summarized the transmission data as survival curves because all cases of infection as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr resulted in mortality 2 1 2 estimation of virus shedding rate experiment similar to the probability of transmission via direct contact it is likely that pathogen shedding increases as infection progresses and becomes systemic hence we estimated the daily shedding rate for wood frog tadpoles by measuring virions shed at 72 96 and 120 h pe as before tadpoles n 5 per pe duration were exposed individually to 103 pfu per ml of the same fv3 like isolate to initiate infection at 72 h all tadpoles were put into new containers with 1 l of fresh water at 24 48 and 72 h thereafter we collected 50 ml of water filtered it through a 0 2 μm filter thermofisher cat no 09 719c to collect virions and stored samples at 80 c until qpcr processing discussed below because water was not changed between collecting samples each time period except the first represented an accumulation of virions from the previous time periods plus the addition of newly shed virions the environmental persistence of ranavirus virions in aged dechlorinated municipal water exceeds 7 days johnson and brunner 2014 munro et al 2016 hence we adjusted mean daily shedding rate ω for each time step as ω t ω t 1 we divided qpcr estimates of viral load in the water by 50 ml i e volume of processed water sample and present ω as pfus produced per tadpole per ml per day 2 1 3 virus detection and quantification to quantify the amount of virus dna in tissue and water samples for the contact and shedding experiments respectively we used qpcr we extracted genomic dna gdna from samples using a dneasy blood and tissue kit qiagen inc valencia ca and quantified gdna using nanodrop technology we performed real time quantitative pcr qpcr targeting a highly conserved 70 bp region of the fv3 genome as described by hoverman et al 2010 each reaction included 7 5 μl of taqman universal pcr master mix 1 μl of both forward and reverse primers at 10 μm concentrations 1 μl of mcp probe and 25 μg of dna extracted from each sample we added rna nuclease free water to each reaction to bring the total volume to 15 μl we ran the samples at 50 c for 2 min 95 c for 10 min and 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 1 min for 40 cycles we used four controls for the qpcr two negative controls i e dna grade water and tissue from a known ranavirus negative tadpole and two positive controls i e virus and tissue from a known ranavirus positive tadpole we performed the qpcr for the shedding experiment using a life technologies abi 7900 fast real time pcr system and for the contact experiment using an applied biosystems quantstudio 6 flex real time pcr systems we fit standard curves with six serial dilutions 101 106 pfu ml of cultured virus for each qpcr run to determine virus presence and estimate viral load in each sample 2 2 modeling methods we used the laboratory experiments section 2 1 to parameterize two mathematical models of ranavirus transmission dynamics in a single population of wood frog tadpoles lithobathes sylvaticus which is a species that is highly susceptible to ranavirus hoverman et al 2011 we developed a base model section 2 2 1 with a single infection stage and constant direct transmission and viral shedding rates we subsequently expanded this model to include multiple stages of infection and stage specific transmission and viral shedding rates section 2 2 2 2 2 1 base model we divided individuals into three subpopulations densities susceptible s t infectious i t and dead d t individuals per liter l the base model is composed of ordinary differential equations for these three subpopulations and the amount of virions v t or virus particles in the water column the total population n t s t i t d t gives the total number of individuals per l in order to relate the model to empirical estimates we rescaled the population densities to be individuals per meter squared which is typically observed and documented empirically following the experimental set up described in section 2 1 1 we assumed that an average density of two individuals l corresponds to 153 individuals m2 the model structure is shown in fig 1 and the equations are given below 1a ds dt sg i direct transmission ρ sf v environmental transmission sh d necrophagy transmission 1b di dt sg i direct transmission ρ sf v environmental transmission sh d necrophagy transmission μ i viral induced death 1c dd dt μ i viral induced death ξ csd necrophagy δ d natural decay 1d dv dt ω i ω d d shed virions η v degradation the base model incorporates three pathways for pathogen transmission direct contact with infected individuals environmental and ingestions of dead individuals necrophagy direct and necrophagy transmission are assumed to be either frequency dependent or density dependent if the per individual contact rate is assumed to be independent of population density then transmission is frequency dependent with rates g i β i t n t and h d α d t n t on the other hand contact rates may scale linearly with population density density dependent transmission i e g i β ˆ i and h d α ˆ d t consequently transmission and necrophagy coefficients are defined as β ˆ β s 0 and α ˆ α s 0 we note that defining β ˆ and α ˆ as inversely proportional to the initial susceptible population size s 0 s 0 is an approximation for density dependent transmission dynamics under these approximations the basic reproduction number is equivalent for both types of transmission section 2 2 4 environmental transmission depends on the concentration of virus in the water as well as the successful contact rate with ranavirus virions in plaque forming units pfu per ml of water per day ρ the environmental transmission function takes the form of ρ f v where f v v v κ and κ is ranavirus id 50 the dose needed to infect 50 of a population once infected an individual has a disease induced mortality rate of μ dead individuals are assumed to persist in the environment and are depleted due to necrophagy from susceptible individuals ξ is the proportion consumed per individual and c is the contact rate in addition to other natural losses δ which incorporates natural decay and necrophagy from other species infected and dead individuals shed virions into the environment at rate ω and virions in the environment naturally degrade at rate η evidence suggests that it is extremely rare for wood frog tadpoles infected with ranavirus to recover hoverman et al 2011 warne et al 2011 therefore we did not include a recovered compartment in our models we developed the models on the time scale for a single outbreak scenario and therefore do not consider any birth or natural death processes 2 2 2 full model the base model 1 assumes the infectious period is exponentially distributed that is the diseased induced mortality rate μ is assumed constant and does not depend on the time spent in the compartment this assumption is epidemiologically unrealistic as infected individuals are more likely to die as they progress through the infection wearing et al 2005 here we update the base model so the probability of mortality increases the longer the individual resides in the infection class by using a gamma distribution with an integer shape parameter lloyd 2001 wearing et al 2005 krylova and earn 2013 following wearing et al 2005 we divide the infection compartment into n subcompartments each exponentially distributed with mean 1 n μ the modified model can still be represented by a system of ordinary differential equations where the infection compartment is divided into n subcompartments 2a di 0 dt s i 0 n g i i ρ sf v sh d n μ i 0 2b di 1 dt n μ i 0 n μ i 1 2c di n dt n μ i n 1 n μ i n the sum of a sequence of independent exponentially distributed random variables is gamma distributed here the probability density function p t for the full infection period is a gamma distribution with integer shape parameter n krylova and earn 2013 3 p t n μ n e n μ t t n 1 n 1 in this notation n 1 results in the exponentially distributed model 1 and n results in a fixed infectious period of 1 μ lloyd 2001 wearing et al 2005 krylova and earn 2013 we note that the probability density function p t has mean 1 μ and variance 1 nμ 2 therefore the full model is composed of ordinary differential equations for multiple subpopulations susceptible s t multiple infectious classes i i t i 0 1 n dead individuals d t and the amount of virions v t in the environment the total population is n t s t i 0 t i 1 t i n t d t the model structure is shown in fig 2 and the equations are given below 4a ds dt s i 0 n g i i direct transmission ρ sf v environmental transmission sh d necrophagy transmission 4b di 0 dt s i 0 n g i i direct transmission ρ sf v environmental transmission sh d necrophagy

i as well as varying viral shedding rates ω i here the subscript i refers to the ith stage of infection individuals in the initial infection stages are infected but may not yet be infectious this corresponds to a latent or incubation period i e β i 0 for i 0 2 furthermore not all stages necessarily shed virus into the environment it takes time for virions to sufficiently replicate within an infected individual robert et al 2011 therefore we assume early stages of host infection do not shed ranavirus i e ω i 0 for i 0 6 parameterization of these stages is discussed below we assumed direct transmission to be either frequency dependent or density dependent 2 2 3 model simulations to understand ranavirus dynamics in wood frogs we simulated the base model 1 and the full model 4 using the parameters in table 2 as baseline values the rate of contact with ranavirus in water ρ was the only parameter that we were unable to estimate and previously published estimates do not exist to investigate the effect of successful contact with ranavirus on disease outcomes we varied ρ over a range of 102 106 per day to investigate how population density influences model dynamics we varied the initial population size fig 11 in addition to various contact rates that represent different density scenarios fig 9 in order to investigate the influence of the model parameters obtained from the literature search on ranavirus dynamics we varied environmental contact rate virion persistence time and tadpole carcass persistence time 2 2 4 basic reproduction number to elucidate the influence of each transmission pathway on invasion potential of ranavirus we used the basic reproduction number the basic reproduction number r 0 is the expected number of secondary infections in a completely susceptible population produced by a single infectious individual during its infectious period dietz 1993 using model 4 we calculated the basic reproduction number of ranavirus in a population of wood frog tadpoles a 5 r 0 1 n μ i 0 n β i direct α δ ξ c necrophagy ρ s 0 n μ κ η δ ξ c δ ξ c i 0 n ω i n μ ω d environmental where s 0 is the initial number of susceptible individuals we independently examined the impact of the three transmission pathways direct contact environmental and necrophagy on ranavirus dynamics 3 results 3 1 empirical results here we present results of the empirical experiments and describe the parameterization of the models all model parameters are presented in table 2 3 1 1 stages of infection to estimate the probability of remaining infectious and alive up to a specific time i e the parameters in eq 3 we used the probability of transmission given contact data but restricted survival time observations to tadpoles that died and tested positive for ranavirus at the end of the 48 h 72 h and 96 h post exposure experiments 50 tadpoles the 24 h pe experiment was not used because only a single infected tadpole died we fitted the base and full models to the dead and positive data by minimizing the negative log likelihood of each model in r v 3 3 1 table 1 because the number of stages n must be an integer we re fit the full model to the data using the floor n 20 and ceiling n 21 values of n respectively fig 4 because the negative log likelihood of the models obtained from n 20 21 respectively are equivalent to two decimal places table 1 we selected the n 20 model rate nμ 3 927 since the exponential distribution is nested within the gamma distribution n 1 we used a likelihood ratio test to compare the fit of the full and base models the base model was a poor fit to the data χ 2 228 95 p 0 0001 3 1 2 direct transmission model 4 assumes direct transmission between an infected individual in the ith stage of infection i i and a susceptible individual s occurs at rate β i following keeling and rohani 2011 and anderson and may 1992 we define β i as a function of the successful contact rate c and the probability of transmission given contact ϕ i where β i c log 1 ϕ i we estimated the average number of contacts of uninfected wood frog tadpoles with an infected tadpole to be 1 2 contacts per min se 0 3 which is approximately 864 contacts per day assuming 12 h of activity the probability of ranavirus transmission given contact with an infected tadpole was dependent on the stage of infection fig 3 the risk of ranavirus induced mortality due to direct contact with an infected tadpole increased on average 2 7x every 24 h such that probability of transmission to an uninfected tadpole and subsequent mortality was 8 40 76 and 92 for 24 48 72 and 96 h pe to the virus respectively all tadpoles that died tested positive for ranavirus dna and those individuals that contacted infected tadpoles 72 and 96 h pe to the virus had more ranavirus in their kidney and liver tissue fig 5 the empirical estimates for the probability of transmission at these given times pe were used to estimate ϕ i for the 20 stages of infection i 0 19 the time spent in each infection stages comes from an exponential distribution with approximate mean of 6 h therefore we assumed that ϕ 0 ϕ 2 0 ϕ 3 ϕ 6 8 ϕ 7 ϕ 10 40 ϕ 11 ϕ 14 76 and ϕ 15 ϕ 19 92 here the first few stages i i for i 0 2 correspond to the latent period 3 1 3 shedding rates to parameterize stage specific shedding rate ω i for i 0 19 we used the results from the shedding rate experiment section 2 1 2 the ability of tadpoles to shed ranavirus increased substantially with pe duration viral load was below detection prior to 72 h pe of hosts to the pathogen however the concentration of ranavirus increased on average 5x per day over the next 48 h fig 6 for the first few stages of infection we assumed ω 0 ω 6 0 given the viral loads presented in fig 6 we assumed ω 7 ω 10 03 ω 11 ω 14 14 and ω 15 ω 19 86 pfu per tadpole per day we also assumed that infected carcasses shed virions at rates similar to the final infected stage ω d ω 19 given that dead tadpoles are known to shed virus harp and petranka 2006 3 1 4 other model parameters we obtained estimates for id 50 survival time of ranavirus in water and mortality rate of tadpoles from necrophagy from the literature environmental transmission depends on the id 50 κ of the host and the rate of successful host infection given contact with virions ρv κ v since κ for wood frog tadpoles has not been estimated we used an estimate of the dose required to kill 50 of a population of wood frog tadpoles ld 50 for our simulations warne et al 2011 hence our predictions likely are conservative we considered the range 0 106 day munro et al 2016 observed the length of time environmental virions persist in 30 c water to be about five days and johnson and brunner 2014 observed persistence to be 3 days in 23 c water therefore we assumed virions persist four days in the environment η 1 4 days finally we assumed that necrophagy transmission is similar to direct contact consequently we assumed α i cϕ d where ϕ d is the probability of transmission from consuming an infected carcass harp and petranka 2006 observed nearly all infected carcasses where depleted within 48 h δ 1 2 days and 95 of scavenging tadpoles died ϕ d 95 additionally we assumed it takes 1 δ days for scavenging tadpoles to consume a carcass at contact rate c and therefore we parameterize the proportion consumed per individual as ξ δ c 3 2 modeling results 3 2 1 survival simulations both the base model 1 and the full model 4 predicted a rapid decrease in the population with populations near extinction within two weeks but as expected from the results of the model fitting table 1 the full model 4 better captures the transmission dynamics fig 7 the remainder of this section presents numerical simulations of the full model 4 figs 8 14 in this system both types of transmission frequency and density dependent cause rapid declines in amphibian populations and the model yields similar predictions in population survival and environmental load for both scenarios all simulations shown use frequency dependent transmission but the results were similar under density dependent transmission not shown larger environmental contact rates ρ induce a more rapid epidemic fig 8 varying direct contact rates c shifted the temporal dynamics of the epidemic with higher contact rates inducing a more rapid die off of wood frogs fig 9 low contact rates slowed the population decline and delayed the timing of the peak in environmental viral load in water 3 2 2 environmental viral load simulations the duration of ranavirus accumulation in water was robust to changes in environmental contact rate ρ fig 10 peak environmental viral loads and ranavirus extinction time in water depended on the initial population size fig 11 peak environmental viral loads exceeded the ld 50 of 102 37 pfu ml warne et al 2011 even for relatively low population densities e g n 0 77 m2 fig 11 the dynamics of the environmental viral load depended on ranavirus persistence time fig 12a as well as the persistence of infected carcasses in the environment fig 12b increasing these persistence times yielded higher environmental viral loads and increased the duration of ranavirus accumulation in water fig 12 3 2 3 transmission pathway all three transmission modes predicted rapid declines in the population and high environmental viral loads in water fig 13 however transmission via direct contact yielded the fastest dynamics epidemic take off was delayed if either environmental or necrophagy is the single mode of transmission because it takes time for virus and infectious carcasses to accumulate in water all transmission pathways influenced the potential for ranavirus to invade a susceptible population of wood frog tadpoles but this depended on population density table 3 and fig 14 the dominant pathway depended on the magnitude of the successful environmental contact rate ρ direct transmission was dominant for small medium population densities i e n 0 150 m 2 for all values of ρ environmental transmission may become the dominant pathway for large population densities if environmental contact rate is sufficiently high fig 14c but environmental transmission pathway contributions to r 0 are not sensitive to changes in population density for moderately high environmental contact rates e g ρ 104 fig 14a direct contact transmission played a larger role than necrophagy transmission for all population densities 4 discussion while any one transmission pathway on its own is influential enough to cause rapid population declines fig 13 we demonstrated that transmission due to host contact is likely the most influential in low medium population densities fig 14 it is possible for environmental waterborne transmission to be the most influential pathway if population densities exceeds approximately 150 individuals per m 2 which is common for wood frog tadpoles fig 14c we detected virus shed by the host within 72 h pe and the rate increased nearly exponentially within 48 h fig 6 the high rate of virus shedding coupled with high tadpole densities results in virus loads accumulating rapidly in the water beyond the ranavirus ld 50 102 37 pfu ml for wood frog tadpoles warne et al 2011 in addition dead tadpoles continue to shed virus harp and petranka 2006 we assumed the environmental persistence of virions was four days which is reasonable in pond systems johnson and brunner 2014 munro et al 2016 given the duration of simulated die offs i e 2 weeks and the environmental persistence of ranavirus our results suggest that viral loads in the water could remain above the ld 50 for wood frog tadpoles for one month and viable virions could persist for two months figs 11 and 12 environmental transmission is also a key pathway for batrachochytrium dendrobatidis bd in mountain yellow legged frog rana mucosa populations wilber et al 2017 presumably at lower densities insufficient virus is shed by the population for environmental transmission to be most influential at low population abundance direct contact between tadpoles was most influential and it was more important than the necrophagy pathway even at higher densities it is likely that outbreaks are initiated through direct contact because tadpoles do not shed virus until several days after initial infection fig 6 for wood frog tadpoles contact rates are high ca one per min and likely saturate in the population even at lower densities brunner et al 2017 hence contacts may be important to initiate ranavirus transmission with environmental transmission becoming influential as the outbreak progresses when tadpole population densities exceeds 150 m2 the lower importance of necrophagy is likely due to short persistence of dead tadpoles in the environment based on mesocosm research in north carolina usa we assumed tadpoles were eaten or decomposed within 24 h i e hence available for transmission for one day harp and petranka 2006 in systems where tadpoles persist longer e g northern latitudes with colder temperatures the necrophagy pathway may play a more important role uninfected tadpoles that are allowed to scavenge morbid tadpoles become infected and die faster from ranaviral disease than tadpoles that are exposed to dead tadpoles but are prevented from scavenging them pearman et al 2004 harp and petranka 2006 while large variations in the successful environmental contact rate ρ did not significantly alter model predictions of wood frog survival and environmental viral loads figs 8 and 10 we found that it was an influential parameter for identifying the dominant transmission pathway fig 14 clearly as ranavirus infects a host more efficiently through water the environmental pathway will become more influential moreover as more individuals shed virus the environment becomes increasingly saturated with the pathogen leading to a near certain probability that the virus level accumulated in water results in infection of susceptible hosts hence ρ can be thought of as contributions from any factors that potentially increase the environmental transmission rate of a pathogen to a host e g factors that are commonly associated with stressors or novel pathogens in naïve populations anthropogenic stressors such as pesticides have been occasionally shown to increase susceptibility to ranaviruses kerby and storfer 2009 and recent introduction of ranavirus has been one explanation for ranavirus induced population declines in europe price et al 2014 more research is needed for robust estimates of ρ under different environmental conditions our simulations predicted 100 mortality of a wood frog tadpole population in two weeks which corresponds with the extent and rate of ranavirus outbreaks in several field reports when wood frogs are present greer et al 2005 harp and petranka 2006 todd thompson 2010 brunner et al 2011 wheelwright et al 2014 there are some cases however where ranavirus infections have been detected in wood frog populations but disease outbreaks do not occur occur at a slower rate or do not result in 100 mortality crespi et al 2015 hall et al 2016 suggesting that our models do not account for all factors influencing transmission one factor that might contribute to the simulated transmission and mortality outcomes is the fv3 like ranavirus that we used in our empirical experiments this strain of ranavirus rcv z2 was isolated from an american bullfrog l catesbeianus farm in southern georgia usa miller et al 2007 and it is chimeric claytor et al 2017 the genome of rcv z2 is mostly fv3 the type species for ranavirus however there have been at least seven recent recombination events with common midwife toad virus cmtv claytor et al 2017 which is a strain of ranavirus that likely originated from asia or europe mavian et al 2012 the cmtv like ranaviruses have caused population declines of several amphibian species in europe price et al 2014 and mass die offs of giant salamanders andrias davidianus in china geng et al 2011 cunningham et al 2016 the recombination events appear to be associated with immune evasion genes claytor et al 2017 and have resulted in a mutated virus that is more pathogenic than native fv3 like strains in north america hoverman et al 2011 and is capable of population declines earl and gray 2014 earl et al 2016 there are several conditions that could have influenced our simulations tadpole contact rates were estimated in the laboratory with no habitat structure plants detritus and other submersed structure might change contact rates for example ranavirus transmission was facilitated in wetlands where cattle grazed emergent vegetation which resulted in salamander larvae clustering and contacting each other more often greer et al 2008 that said our contact rates were similar to larger outdoor mesocosm experiments with wood frog tadpoles brunner et al 2017 we also assumed that all shed virions were viable and persistence was four days although the environmental persistence parameters we used were estimated using pond water with microbes present johnson and brunner 2014 munro et al 2016 there could be other environmental factors e g temperature ph inorganic and organic compounds in the wild that reduce persistence in addition our shedding rates were estimated using qpcr hence we do not know if all quantified virus was infectious although empirical experiments have demonstrated waterborne ranavirus transmission between infected and uninfected individuals without contact pearman et al 2004 brunner et al 2007 brenes et al 2014 it is possible that some shed virus was not viable or inactivated faster than four days even so simulated transmission dynamics indicated that ranavirus concentrations remained above the ld 50 for two weeks when virion degradation was reduced to one day fig 12a lastly other factors that could have influenced our simulations are life stage and temperature dependent transmission hall et al 2018 although our simulations did not consider post metamorphic stages they demonstrate the potential consequences on the tadpole population which is essential for recruitment and population persistence earl and gray 2014 our simulations are limited to the range of temperatures 22 24 c that we conducted our experiments despite this limitation this temperature range is experienced in many aquatic systems in north america during summer months which corresponds when many ranavirus outbreaks are observed in the wild amphibian populations brunner et al 2015 hall et al 2018 to our knowledge the r 0 estimates from our simulations are among the highest reported for an amphibian pathogen estimates of r 0 for bd invasion in declining populations of mountain yellow legged frog were 30 55 in worst case simulation scenarios wilber et al 2017 the estimates we report are similar to pathogens spread by mosquitoes at high host densities for example r 0 estimates for malaria outbreaks in africa can exceed 1000 davidson and draper 1953 davidson 1955 smith et al 2007 all simulations are estimated projections contingent upon model assumptions and the conditions for parameter estimation edelstein keshet 2005 allen 2010 however even if our estimates of r 0 are biased by several orders of magnitude rcv z2 still represents one of the most virulent pathogens reported in wildlife populations the site of the index case for rcv z2 is near alapaha georgia in the alapaha river watershed wastewater from the bullfrog farm is not decontaminated hence the likelihood of spillover to native ectothermic vertebrate populations is high we demonstrated that this pathogen can be transmitted to mosquitofish gambusia affinis brenes et al 2014 and it is very pathogenic to multiple amphibian species various anuran developmental stages and for wide range of water temperatures hoverman et al 2011 haislip et al 2011 sutton et al 2014 brand et al 2016 as such rcv z2 represents a significant conservation risk for biodiversity in north america given the threat of rcv z2 surveillance for this pathogen should occur at a minimum in the alapaha river watershed in addition it is worth considering possible disease intervention strategies given our simulations our results suggest that decisions should be based on population size for small tadpole populations efforts could be made to reduce direct contact rate such as removal of hosts or habitat manipulations that promote dispersion of individuals gray et al 2017 at high tadpole abundance techniques should be used to reduce environmental persistence of rcv z2 persistence of fv3 like ranaviruses tends to decrease as microbes in water increase johnson and brunner 2014 munro et al 2016 techniques that facilitate reduction in ranavirus concentration in water could also work such as flowing water through aquatic systems where management structures exist to manipulate hydrology gray et al 2017 mitigation strategies that target boosting host immune defenses also may be beneficial woodhams et al 2011 gray et al 2017 however considering that rcv z2 has high invasion potential for multiple transmission pathways disease management strategies that focus on spatial containment of the pathogen e g wastewater decontamination population isolation gray et al 2017 and heard et al 2017 might be most effective at thwarting regional spread acknowledgements this work was supported by the usda national institute of food and agriculture hatch project 1012932 part of this project was conducted

matrix with large domain diekmann et al 2010 the next generation matrix method decomposes the jacobian matrix into two matrices that describe production of new infected cases and transitions out of infectious states respectively the spectral radius dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix with large domain characterizes the potential for spread of ranavirus in a naive amphibian population and it is a critical threshold by theorem a 1 diekmann et al 2010 the disease free equilibrium is unstable if r 0 1 and is stable if r 0 1 to obtain the basic reproduction number we require the jacobian matrix of system 4 which is obtained from linearizing the system model 4 has a line of disease free equilibria s 0 0 0 0 where s 0 n 0 0 is the initial number of susceptibles in the population we note that g i i g i i i i β i n t 1 i n t if transmission is frequency dependent β ˆ i if transmission is density dependent at a disease free equilibrium s 0 0 0 0 the partial derivatives are g i i i i β i s 0 if transmission is frequency dependent β ˆ i if transmission is density dependent note that g 0 s 0 β i for either form of transmission unlike density dependent transmission frequency dependent transmission does not depend on population density however it is important to note that the basic reproduction number r 0 is defined at the beginning of an outbreak when the population density is s 0 here at the beginning of an outbreak frequency and density dependent transmissions are equivalent since the initial densities are equivalent additionally we defined β ˆ and α ˆ as inversely proportional to the initial susceptible population size s 0 s 0 as discussed in section 2 2 1 therefore the calculation of r 0 should be the same for both types of

24988,a consequence of genetic recombination can be the evolution of highly virulent pathogen strains virulence can manifest through various mechanisms of host pathogen interaction that facilitate transmission we discovered a highly virulent chimeric ranavirus in georgia usa estimated transmission parameters using controlled experiments and developed compartmental disease models to examine potential consequences on tadpoles of a susceptible host species lithobates sylvaticus our models included three transmission pathways direct transmission via host contact environmental transmission via shed virions in water and transmission via necrophagy of morbid individuals unlike previous models we categorized individuals into multiple stages of infection susceptible latency and infectious where the probability of disease induced mortality increased throughout the duration of infection following a gamma distribution with an integer shape parameter our simulations showed that accounting for pathogen incubation improved model predictions when compared to survival data from controlled experiments we found that transmission due to direct contact of tadpoles was the dominant transmission pathway however environmental transmission played a larger role as tadpole density increased and the epidemic progressed estimated r 0 basic reproduction number values 570 for all transmission pathways indicate that targeting only one transmission pathway is unlikely to thwart invasion additionally the high invasion potential and diseased induced mortality associated with this chimeric ranavirus indicate that this pathogen is a substantial threat to amphibian biodiversity in the united states keywords ranavirus transmission amphibians disease model amphibian declines emerging infectious disease pathogen model 1 introduction identifying the importance of transmission pathways under varying conditions is fundamental to characterizing the epidemiology of host pathogen systems tien and earn 2010 pathogens can infect hosts through various pathways environmental transmission can occur through air water or soil and depends on various factors such as host shedding rates of the pathogen and pathogen persistence outside the host nelson et al 2009 briggs et al 2010 transmission can also occur through direct contact between infected and uninfected individuals and that probability can change as disease progresses in the host mccallum et al 2001 if key transmission pathways can be identified disease management or intervention strategies can be conceived to thwart or prevent an outbreak langwig et al 2015 compartmental models such as susceptible infectious si and susceptible infectious recovered sir are commonly used to characterize the epidemiology of host pathogen systems estimate the invasion potential of a pathogen i e basic reproduction number r 0 and estimate outbreak size in hosts keeling and rohani 2011 these models commonly assume that the duration of host infectiousness follows an exponential distribution keeling and rohani 2011 which often is unrealistic because this assumes that the probability of remaining infectious over time drops dramatically more typically duration of host infectiousness is gamma distributed wearing et al 2005 lloyd 2001 and consequently individuals contribute to pathogen transmission over time frames that are closer to the mean duration of infectiousness moreover hosts that are more diseased can be more infectious previous investigations have expanded the infectious compartment into multiple stages each with exponentially distributed durations which sum together in order to approximate gamma distributed durations of infection lloyd 2001 krylova and earn 2013 wearing et al 2005 however few have used empirical data to estimate changes in host infectiousness through the course of disease progression finally few mathematical models have explicitly incorporated heterogeneities in host infectiousness with environmental transmission which could increase during an outbreak especially in aquatic ecosystems where pathogens might accumulate in water ranaviruses are globally emerging pathogens that affect amphibians reptiles and fish gray and chinchar 2015 this pathogen is a double stranded dna virus that can infect hosts through the water or by direct contact brunner et al 2007 only one study has previously developed a compartmental si model for ranaviruses and it did not consider changes in transmission with disease progression duffus 2012 that study predicted a stable equilibrium between common frog rana temporaria adults and ranavirus in the united kingdom duffus 2012 however the susceptibility of most adult amphibians to ranavirus is less than tadpoles because of a more robust and rapid immune response grayfer et al 2015 indeed catastrophic die offs of larval wood frogs lithobates sylvaticus involving thousands of individuals have been reported harp and petranka 2006 brunner et al 2011 wheelwright et al 2014 population projection models suggest that ranaviruses can cause amphibian population declines and extinction earl and gray 2014 earl et al 2016 but those models cannot determine influential pathways in this study we used a system of ordinary differential equations and empirical data to characterize the epidemiology of a recently discovered chimeric frog virus 3 fv3 like ranavirus claytor et al 2017 and its potential effects on a population of wood frog tadpoles using our experimental results for model parameterization we expanded previous modeling efforts duffus 2012 greer et al 2008 to include multiple transmission pathways i e direct contact necrophagy and environmental stage dependent transmission and r 0 estimates for each pathway we show that incorporating multiple host infection stages for direct transmission and pathogen shedding improves model fit and that all transmission pathways have high invasion potential illustrating the threat of this chimeric ranavirus to biodiversity in north america 2 methods 2 1 empirical methods we performed all experiments in a controlled laboratory environment at the johnson animal research and teaching unit of the university of tennessee institute of agriculture we collected egg masses from breeding wood frogs l sylvaticus in the wild and reared them outdoors in wading pools until the experiments began tennessee scientific collection permit 1990 all experiments were performed at room temperature 22 24 c and started when tadpoles were approximately gosner stage 30 which is the midpoint of pre metamorphic development for tadpoles wells 2007 water temperature and development stage are known to influence susceptibility results haislip et al 2011 brand et al 2016 hence they were held constant in our experiments we fed tadpoles commercial fish pellets ad libitum until the experiments began then switched to a diet of 12 of their body mass during the experiment hoverman et al 2011 all experiments followed approved university of tennessee iacuc protocol 2140 2 1 1 contact rate and probability of transmission given contact experiments we estimated contact rates for wood frog tadpoles in 12 l plastic tubs 724 cm2 that contained 5 5 l of water and 11 tadpoles which is approximately 153 tadpoles per m2 this is a moderate density of wood frog tadpoles based on estimates in vernal pools in north carolina usa petranka et al 2003 harp and petranka 2006 because infection by a pathogen can change activity parris et al 2005 we infected one tadpole and measured number of contacts with that tadpole during three 10 min intervals at 2 4 and 6 h following the start of co habitation the tadpole was infected via a 3 day exposure in a 1 l tub to 103 plaque forming units pfus per ml of a frog virus 3 fv3 like ranavirus miller et al 2007 which is sufficient to cause infection and disease in wood frog tadpoles hoverman et al 2011 warne et al 2011 we estimated contact rates by observing tadpoles from a distance of 1 m so not to influence activity and recorded number of contacts with the infected individual during the 10 min observation window there were 20 replicate tubs and each tub was observed three times data were summarized as number of contacts with an infected tadpole per minute then extrapolated to daily contact rates assuming 12 h of daily activity wells 2007 we performed a second experiment to estimate the probability of transmission given contact similar to the previous experiment we infected five wood frog tadpoles by exposing them to 103 pfu ml of the same fv3 like isolate given that the probability of transmission can change with post exposure pe duration to a pathogen lloyd 2001 we performed direct contact exposures at 24 48 72 and 96 h pe we emulated direct contact by touching each infected tadpole to five uninfected tadpoles for 1 s then placed the animals in individual 1 l tubs and followed their fate for 14 days brunner et al 2007 for consistency the original five infected tadpoles were used for each direct contact exposure with n 25 5 infected 5 uninfected tadpoles possible transmission events per 24 h time step we humanely euthanized surviving individuals using benzocaine hydrochloride collected a homogenate of liver and kidney tissue for virus testing discussed later and froze samples at 80 c until processing we summarized the transmission data as survival curves because all cases of infection as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr resulted in mortality 2 1 2 estimation of virus shedding rate experiment similar to the probability of transmission via direct contact it is likely that pathogen shedding increases as infection progresses and becomes systemic hence we estimated the daily shedding rate for wood frog tadpoles by measuring virions shed at 72 96 and 120 h pe as before tadpoles n 5 per pe duration were exposed individually to 103 pfu per ml of the same fv3 like isolate to initiate infection at 72 h all tadpoles were put into new containers with 1 l of fresh water at 24 48 and 72 h thereafter we collected 50 ml of water filtered it through a 0 2 μm filter thermofisher cat no 09 719c to collect virions and stored samples at 80 c until qpcr processing discussed below because water was not changed between collecting samples each time period except the first represented an accumulation of virions from the previous time periods plus the addition of newly shed virions the environmental persistence of ranavirus virions in aged dechlorinated municipal water exceeds 7 days johnson and brunner 2014 munro et al 2016 hence we adjusted mean daily shedding rate ω for each time step as ω t ω t 1 we divided qpcr estimates of viral load in the water by 50 ml i e volume of processed water sample and present ω as pfus produced per tadpole per ml per day 2 1 3 virus detection and quantification to quantify the amount of virus dna in tissue and water samples for the contact and shedding experiments respectively we used qpcr we extracted genomic dna gdna from samples using a dneasy blood and tissue kit qiagen inc valencia ca and quantified gdna using nanodrop technology we performed real time quantitative pcr qpcr targeting a highly conserved 70 bp region of the fv3 genome as described by hoverman et al 2010 each reaction included 7 5 μl of taqman universal pcr master mix 1 μl of both forward and reverse primers at 10 μm concentrations 1 μl of mcp probe and 25 μg of dna extracted from each sample we added rna nuclease free water to each reaction to bring the total volume to 15 μl we ran the samples at 50 c for 2 min 95 c for 10 min and 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 1 min for 40 cycles we used four controls for the qpcr two negative controls i e dna grade water and tissue from a known ranavirus negative tadpole and two positive controls i e virus and tissue from a known ranavirus positive tadpole we performed the qpcr for the shedding experiment using a life technologies abi 7900 fast real time pcr system and for the contact experiment using an applied biosystems quantstudio 6 flex real time pcr systems we fit standard curves with six serial dilutions 101 106 pfu ml of cultured virus for each qpcr run to determine virus presence and estimate viral load in each sample 2 2 modeling methods we used the laboratory experiments section 2 1 to parameterize two mathematical models of ranavirus transmission dynamics in a single population of wood frog tadpoles lithobathes sylvaticus which is a species that is highly susceptible to ranavirus hoverman et al 2011 we developed a base model section 2 2 1 with a single infection stage and constant direct transmission and viral shedding rates we subsequently expanded this model to include multiple stages of infection and stage specific transmission and viral shedding rates section 2 2 2 2 2 1 base model we divided individuals into three subpopulations densities susceptible s t infectious i t and dead d t individuals per liter l the base model is composed of ordinary differential equations for these three subpopulations and the amount of virions v t or virus particles in the water column the total population n t s t i t d t gives the total number of individuals per l in order to relate the model to empirical estimates we rescaled the population densities to be individuals per meter squared which is typically observed and documented empirically following the experimental set up described in section 2 1 1 we assumed that an average density of two individuals l corresponds to 153 individuals m2 the model structure is shown in fig 1 and the equations are given below 1a ds dt sg i direct

dd dt μ i viral induced death ξ csd necrophagy δ d natural decay 1d dv dt ω i ω d d shed virions η v degradation the base model incorporates three pathways for pathogen transmission direct contact with infected individuals environmental and ingestions of dead individuals necrophagy direct and necrophagy transmission are assumed to be either frequency dependent or density dependent if the per individual contact rate is assumed to be independent of population density then transmission is frequency dependent with rates g i β i t n t and h d α d t n t on the other hand contact rates may scale linearly with population density density dependent transmission i e g i β ˆ i and h d α ˆ d t consequently transmission and necrophagy coefficients are defined as β ˆ β s 0 and α ˆ α s 0 we note that defining β ˆ and α ˆ as inversely proportional to the initial susceptible population size s 0 s 0 is an approximation for density dependent transmission dynamics under these approximations the basic reproduction number is equivalent for both types of transmission section 2 2 4 environmental transmission depends on the concentration of virus in the water as well as the successful contact rate with ranavirus virions in plaque forming units pfu per ml of water per day ρ the environmental transmission function takes the form of ρ f v where f v v v κ and κ is ranavirus id 50 the dose needed to infect 50 of a population once infected an individual has a disease induced mortality rate of μ dead individuals are assumed to persist in the environment and are depleted due to necrophagy from susceptible individuals ξ is the proportion consumed per individual and c is the contact rate in addition to other natural losses δ which incorporates natural decay and necrophagy from other species infected and dead individuals shed virions into the environment at rate ω and virions in the environment naturally degrade at rate η evidence suggests that it is extremely rare for wood frog tadpoles infected with ranavirus to recover hoverman et al 2011 warne et al 2011 therefore we did not include a recovered compartment in our models we developed the models on the time scale for a single outbreak scenario and therefore do not consider any birth or natural death processes 2 2 2 full model the base model 1 assumes the infectious period is exponentially distributed that is the diseased induced mortality rate μ is assumed constant and does not depend on the time spent in the compartment this assumption is epidemiologically unrealistic as infected individuals are more likely to die as they progress through the infection wearing et al 2005 here we update the base model so the probability of mortality increases the longer the individual resides in the infection class by using a gamma distribution with an integer shape parameter lloyd 2001 wearing et al 2005 krylova and earn 2013 following wearing et al 2005 we divide the infection compartment into n subcompartments each exponentially distributed with mean 1 n μ the modified model can still be represented by a system of ordinary differential equations where the infection compartment is divided into n subcompartments 2a di 0 dt s i 0 n g i i ρ sf v sh d n μ i 0 2b di 1 dt n μ i 0 n μ i 1 2c di n dt n μ i n 1 n μ i n the sum of a sequence of independent exponentially distributed random variables is gamma

notation n 1 results in the exponentially distributed model 1 and n results in a fixed infectious period of 1 μ lloyd 2001 wearing et al 2005 krylova and earn 2013 we note that the probability density function p t has mean 1 μ and variance 1 nμ 2 therefore the full model is composed of ordinary differential equations for multiple subpopulations susceptible s t multiple infectious classes i i t i 0 1 n dead individuals d t and the amount of virions v t in the environment the total population is n t s t i 0 t i 1 t i n t d t the model structure is shown in fig 2 and the equations are given below

i as well as varying viral shedding rates ω i here the subscript i refers to the ith stage of infection individuals in the initial infection stages are infected but may not yet be infectious this corresponds to a latent or incubation period i e β i 0 for i 0 2 furthermore not all stages necessarily shed virus into the environment it takes time for virions to sufficiently replicate within an infected individual robert et al 2011 therefore we assume early stages of host infection do not shed ranavirus i e ω i 0 for i 0 6 parameterization of these stages is discussed below we assumed direct transmission to be either frequency dependent or density dependent 2 2 3 model simulations to understand ranavirus dynamics in wood frogs we simulated the base model 1 and the full model 4 using the parameters in table 2 as baseline values the rate of contact with ranavirus in water ρ was the only parameter that we were unable to estimate and previously published estimates do not exist to investigate the effect of successful contact with ranavirus on disease outcomes we varied ρ over a range of 102 106 per day to investigate how population density influences model dynamics we varied the initial population size fig 11 in addition to various contact rates that represent different density scenarios fig 9 in order to investigate the influence of the model parameters obtained from the literature search on ranavirus dynamics we varied environmental contact rate virion persistence time and tadpole carcass persistence time 2 2 4 basic reproduction number to elucidate the influence of each transmission pathway on invasion potential of ranavirus we used the basic reproduction number the basic reproduction number r 0 is the expected number of secondary infections in a completely susceptible population produced by a single infectious individual during its infectious period dietz 1993 using model 4 we calculated the basic reproduction number of ranavirus in a population of wood frog tadpoles a 5 r 0 1 n μ i 0 n β i direct α δ ξ c necrophagy ρ s 0 n μ κ η δ ξ c δ ξ c i 0 n ω i n μ ω d environmental where s 0 is the initial number of susceptible individuals we independently examined the impact of the three transmission pathways direct contact environmental and necrophagy on ranavirus dynamics 3 results 3 1 empirical results here we present results of the empirical experiments and describe the parameterization of the models all model parameters are presented in table 2 3 1 1 stages of infection to estimate the probability of remaining infectious and alive up to a specific time i e the parameters in eq 3 we used the probability of transmission given contact data but restricted survival time observations to tadpoles that died and tested positive for ranavirus at the end of the 48 h 72 h and 96 h post exposure experiments 50 tadpoles the 24 h pe experiment was not used because only a single infected tadpole died we fitted the base and full models to the dead and positive data by minimizing the negative log likelihood of each model in r v 3 3 1 table 1 because the number of stages n must be an integer we re fit the full model to the data using the floor n 20 and ceiling n 21 values of n respectively fig 4 because the negative log likelihood of the models obtained from n 20 21 respectively are equivalent to two decimal places table 1 we selected the n 20 model rate nμ 3 927 since the exponential distribution is nested within the gamma distribution n 1 we used a likelihood ratio test to compare the fit of the full and base models the base model was a poor fit to the data χ 2 228 95 p 0 0001 3 1 2 direct transmission model 4 assumes direct transmission between an infected individual in the ith stage of infection i i and a susceptible individual s occurs at rate β i following keeling and rohani 2011 and anderson and may 1992 we define β i as a function of the successful contact rate c and the probability of transmission given contact ϕ i where β i c log 1 ϕ i we estimated the average number of contacts of uninfected wood frog tadpoles with an infected tadpole to be 1 2 contacts per min se 0 3 which is approximately 864 contacts per day assuming 12 h of activity the probability of ranavirus transmission given contact with an infected tadpole was dependent on the stage of infection fig 3 the risk of ranavirus induced mortality due to direct contact with an infected tadpole increased on average 2 7x every 24 h such that probability of transmission to an uninfected tadpole and subsequent mortality was 8 40 76 and 92 for 24 48 72 and 96 h pe to the virus respectively all tadpoles that died tested positive for ranavirus dna and those individuals that contacted infected tadpoles 72 and 96 h pe to the virus had more ranavirus in their kidney and liver tissue fig 5 the empirical estimates for the probability of transmission at these given times pe were used to estimate ϕ i for the 20 stages of infection i 0 19 the time spent in each infection stages comes from an exponential distribution with approximate mean of 6 h therefore we assumed that ϕ 0 ϕ 2 0 ϕ 3 ϕ 6 8 ϕ 7 ϕ 10 40 ϕ 11 ϕ 14 76 and ϕ 15 ϕ 19 92 here the first few stages i i for i 0 2 correspond to the latent period 3 1 3 shedding rates to parameterize stage specific shedding rate ω i for i 0 19 we used the results from the shedding rate experiment section 2 1 2 the ability of tadpoles to shed ranavirus increased substantially with pe duration viral load was below detection prior to 72 h pe of hosts to the pathogen however the concentration of ranavirus increased on average 5x per day over the next 48 h fig 6 for the first few stages of infection we assumed ω 0 ω 6 0 given the viral loads presented in fig 6 we assumed ω 7 ω 10 03 ω 11 ω 14 14 and ω 15 ω 19 86 pfu per tadpole per day we also assumed that infected carcasses shed virions at rates similar to the final infected stage ω d ω 19 given that dead tadpoles are known to shed virus harp and petranka 2006 3 1 4 other model parameters we obtained estimates for id 50 survival time of ranavirus in water and mortality rate of tadpoles from necrophagy from the literature environmental transmission depends on the id 50 κ of the host and the rate of successful host infection given contact with virions ρv κ v since κ for wood frog tadpoles has not been estimated we used an estimate of the dose required to kill 50 of a population of wood frog tadpoles ld 50 for our simulations warne et al 2011 hence our predictions likely are conservative we considered the range 0 106 day munro et al 2016 observed the length of time environmental virions persist in 30 c water to be about five days and johnson and brunner 2014 observed persistence to be 3 days in 23 c water therefore we assumed virions persist four days in the environment η 1 4 days finally we assumed that necrophagy transmission is similar to direct contact consequently we assumed α i cϕ d where ϕ d is the probability of transmission from consuming an infected carcass harp and petranka 2006 observed nearly all infected carcasses where depleted within 48 h δ 1 2 days and 95 of scavenging tadpoles died ϕ d 95 additionally we assumed it takes 1 δ days for scavenging tadpoles to consume a carcass at contact rate c and therefore we parameterize the proportion consumed per individual as ξ δ c 3 2 modeling results 3 2 1 survival simulations both the base model 1 and the full model 4 predicted a rapid decrease in the population with populations near extinction within two weeks but as expected from the results of the model fitting table 1 the full model 4 better captures the transmission dynamics fig 7 the remainder of this section presents numerical simulations of the full model 4 figs 8 14 in this system both types of transmission frequency and density dependent cause rapid declines in amphibian populations and the model yields similar predictions in population survival and environmental load for both scenarios all simulations shown use frequency dependent transmission but the results were similar under density dependent transmission not shown larger environmental contact rates ρ induce a more rapid epidemic fig 8 varying direct contact rates c shifted the temporal dynamics of the epidemic with higher contact rates inducing a more rapid die off of wood frogs fig 9 low contact rates slowed the population decline and delayed the timing of the peak in environmental viral load in water 3 2 2 environmental viral load simulations the duration of ranavirus accumulation in water was robust to changes in environmental contact rate ρ fig 10 peak environmental viral loads and ranavirus extinction time in water depended on the initial population size fig 11 peak environmental viral loads exceeded the ld 50 of 102 37 pfu ml warne et al 2011 even for relatively low population densities e g n 0 77 m2 fig 11 the dynamics of the environmental viral load depended on ranavirus persistence time fig 12a as well as the persistence of infected carcasses in the environment fig 12b increasing these persistence times yielded higher environmental viral loads and increased the duration of ranavirus accumulation in water fig 12 3 2 3 transmission pathway all three transmission modes predicted rapid declines in the population and high environmental viral loads in water fig 13 however transmission via direct contact yielded the fastest dynamics epidemic take off was delayed if either environmental or necrophagy is the single mode of transmission because it takes time for virus and infectious carcasses to accumulate in water all transmission pathways influenced the potential for ranavirus to invade a susceptible population of wood frog tadpoles but this depended on population density table 3 and fig 14 the dominant pathway depended on the magnitude of the successful environmental contact rate ρ direct transmission was dominant for small medium population densities i e n 0 150 m 2 for all values of ρ environmental transmission may become the dominant pathway for large population densities if environmental contact rate is sufficiently high fig 14c but environmental transmission pathway contributions to r 0 are not sensitive to changes in population density for moderately high environmental contact rates e g ρ 104 fig 14a direct contact transmission played a larger role than necrophagy transmission for all population densities 4 discussion while any one transmission pathway on its own is influential enough to cause rapid population declines fig 13 we demonstrated that transmission due to host contact is likely the most influential in low medium population densities fig 14 it is possible for environmental waterborne transmission to be the most influential pathway if population densities exceeds approximately 150 individuals per m 2 which is common for wood frog tadpoles fig 14c we detected virus shed by the host within 72 h pe and the rate increased nearly exponentially within 48 h fig 6 the high rate of virus shedding coupled with high tadpole densities results in virus loads accumulating rapidly in the water beyond the ranavirus ld 50 102 37 pfu ml for wood frog tadpoles warne et al 2011 in addition dead tadpoles continue to shed virus harp and petranka 2006 we assumed the environmental persistence of virions was four days which is reasonable in pond systems johnson and brunner 2014 munro et al 2016 given the duration of simulated die offs i e 2 weeks and the environmental persistence of ranavirus our results suggest that viral loads in the water could remain above the ld 50 for wood frog tadpoles for one month and viable virions could persist for two months figs 11 and 12 environmental transmission is also a key pathway for batrachochytrium dendrobatidis bd in mountain yellow legged frog rana mucosa populations wilber et al 2017 presumably at lower densities insufficient virus is shed by the population for environmental transmission to be most influential at low population abundance direct contact between tadpoles was most influential and it was more important than the necrophagy pathway even at higher densities it is likely that outbreaks are initiated through direct contact because tadpoles do not shed virus until several days after initial infection fig 6 for wood frog tadpoles contact rates are high ca one per min and likely saturate in the population even at lower densities brunner et al 2017 hence contacts may be important to initiate ranavirus transmission with environmental transmission becoming influential as the outbreak progresses when tadpole population densities exceeds 150 m2 the lower importance of necrophagy is likely due to short persistence of dead tadpoles in the environment based on mesocosm research in north carolina usa we assumed tadpoles were eaten or decomposed within 24 h i e hence available for transmission for one day harp and petranka 2006 in systems where tadpoles persist longer e g northern latitudes with colder temperatures the necrophagy pathway may play a more important role uninfected tadpoles that are allowed to scavenge morbid tadpoles become infected and die faster from ranaviral disease than tadpoles that are exposed to dead tadpoles but are prevented from scavenging them pearman et al 2004 harp and petranka 2006 while large variations in the successful environmental contact rate ρ did not significantly alter model predictions of wood frog survival and environmental viral loads figs 8 and 10 we found that it was an influential parameter for identifying the dominant transmission pathway fig 14 clearly as ranavirus infects a host more efficiently through water the environmental pathway will become more influential moreover as more individuals shed virus the environment becomes increasingly saturated with the pathogen leading to a near certain probability that the virus level accumulated in water results in infection of susceptible hosts hence ρ can be thought of as contributions from any factors that potentially increase the environmental transmission rate of a pathogen to a host e g factors that are commonly associated with stressors or novel pathogens in naïve populations anthropogenic stressors such as pesticides have been occasionally shown to increase susceptibility to ranaviruses kerby and storfer 2009 and recent introduction of ranavirus has been one explanation for ranavirus induced population declines in europe price et al 2014 more research is needed for robust estimates of ρ under different environmental conditions our simulations predicted 100 mortality of a wood frog tadpole population in two weeks which corresponds with the extent and rate of ranavirus outbreaks in several field reports when wood frogs are present greer et al 2005 harp and petranka 2006 todd thompson 2010 brunner et al 2011 wheelwright et al 2014 there are some cases however where ranavirus infections have been detected in wood frog populations but disease outbreaks do not occur occur at a slower rate or do not result in 100 mortality crespi et al 2015 hall et al 2016 suggesting that our models do not account for all factors influencing transmission one factor that might contribute to the simulated transmission and mortality outcomes is the fv3 like ranavirus that we used in our empirical experiments this strain of ranavirus rcv z2 was isolated from an american bullfrog l catesbeianus farm in southern georgia usa miller et al 2007 and it is chimeric claytor et al 2017 the genome of rcv z2 is mostly fv3 the type species for ranavirus however there have been at least seven recent recombination events with common midwife toad virus cmtv claytor et al 2017 which is a strain of ranavirus that likely originated from asia or europe mavian et al 2012 the cmtv like ranaviruses have caused population declines of several amphibian species in europe price et al 2014 and mass die offs of giant salamanders andrias davidianus in china geng et al 2011 cunningham et al 2016 the recombination events appear to be associated with immune evasion genes claytor et al 2017 and have resulted in a mutated virus that is more pathogenic than native fv3 like strains in north america hoverman et al 2011 and is capable of population declines earl and gray 2014 earl et al 2016 there are several conditions that could have influenced our simulations tadpole contact rates were estimated in the laboratory with no habitat structure plants detritus and other submersed structure might change contact rates for example ranavirus transmission was facilitated in wetlands where cattle grazed emergent vegetation which resulted in salamander larvae clustering and contacting each other more often greer et al 2008 that said our contact rates were similar to larger outdoor mesocosm experiments with wood frog tadpoles brunner et al 2017 we also assumed that all shed virions were viable and persistence was four days although the environmental persistence parameters we used were estimated using pond water with microbes present johnson and brunner 2014 munro et al 2016 there could be other environmental factors e g temperature ph inorganic and organic compounds in the wild that reduce persistence in addition our shedding rates were estimated using qpcr hence we do not know if all quantified virus was infectious although empirical experiments have demonstrated waterborne ranavirus transmission between infected and uninfected individuals without contact pearman et al 2004 brunner et al 2007 brenes et al 2014 it is possible that some shed virus was not viable or inactivated faster than four days even so simulated transmission dynamics indicated that ranavirus concentrations remained above the ld 50 for two weeks when virion degradation was reduced to one day fig 12a lastly other factors that could have influenced our simulations are life stage and temperature dependent transmission hall et al 2018 although our simulations did not consider post metamorphic stages they demonstrate the potential consequences on the tadpole population which is essential for recruitment and population persistence earl and gray 2014 our simulations are limited to the range of temperatures 22 24 c that we conducted our experiments despite this limitation this temperature range is experienced in many aquatic systems in north america during summer months which corresponds when many ranavirus outbreaks are observed in the wild amphibian populations brunner et al 2015 hall et al 2018 to our knowledge the r 0 estimates from our simulations are among the highest reported for an amphibian pathogen estimates of r 0 for bd invasion in declining populations of mountain yellow legged frog were 30 55 in worst case simulation scenarios wilber et al 2017 the estimates we report are similar to pathogens spread by mosquitoes at high host densities for example r 0 estimates for malaria outbreaks in africa can exceed 1000 davidson and draper 1953 davidson 1955 smith et al 2007 all simulations are estimated projections contingent upon model assumptions and the conditions for parameter estimation edelstein keshet 2005 allen 2010 however even if our estimates of r 0 are biased by several orders of magnitude rcv z2 still represents one of the most virulent pathogens reported in wildlife populations the site of the index case for rcv z2 is near alapaha georgia in the alapaha river watershed wastewater from the bullfrog farm is not decontaminated hence the likelihood of spillover to native ectothermic vertebrate populations is high we demonstrated that this pathogen can be transmitted to mosquitofish gambusia affinis brenes et al 2014 and it is very pathogenic to multiple amphibian species various anuran developmental stages and for wide range of water temperatures hoverman et al 2011 haislip et al 2011 sutton et al 2014 brand et al 2016 as such rcv z2 represents a significant conservation risk for biodiversity in north america given the threat of rcv z2 surveillance for this pathogen should occur at a minimum in the alapaha river watershed in addition it is worth considering possible disease intervention strategies given our simulations our results suggest that decisions should be based on population size for small tadpole populations efforts could be made to reduce direct contact rate such as removal of hosts or habitat manipulations that promote dispersion of individuals gray et al 2017 at high tadpole abundance techniques should be used to reduce environmental persistence of rcv z2 persistence of fv3 like ranaviruses tends to decrease as microbes in water increase johnson and brunner 2014 munro et al 2016 techniques that facilitate reduction in ranavirus concentration in water could also work such as flowing water through aquatic systems where management structures exist to manipulate hydrology gray et al 2017 mitigation strategies that target boosting host immune defenses also may be beneficial woodhams et al 2011 gray et al 2017 however considering that rcv z2 has high invasion potential for multiple transmission pathways disease management strategies that focus on spatial containment of the pathogen e g wastewater decontamination population isolation gray et al 2017 and heard et al 2017 might be

matrix with large domain diekmann et al 2010 the next generation matrix method decomposes the jacobian matrix into two matrices that describe production of new infected cases and transitions out of infectious states respectively the spectral radius dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix with large domain characterizes the potential for spread of ranavirus in a naive amphibian population and it is a critical threshold by theorem a 1 diekmann et al 2010 the disease free equilibrium is unstable if r 0 1 and is stable if r 0 1 to obtain the basic reproduction number we require the jacobian matrix of system 4 which is obtained from linearizing the system model 4 has a line of disease free equilibria s 0 0 0 0 where s 0 n 0 0 is the initial number of susceptibles in the population we note that g i i g i i i i β i n t 1 i n t if transmission is frequency dependent β ˆ i if transmission is density dependent at a disease free equilibrium s 0 0 0 0 the partial derivatives are g i i i i β i s 0 if transmission is frequency dependent β ˆ i if transmission is density dependent note that g 0 s 0 β i for either form of transmission unlike density dependent transmission frequency dependent transmission does not depend on population density however it is important to note that the basic reproduction number r 0 is defined at the beginning of an outbreak when the population density is s 0 here at the beginning of an outbreak frequency and density dependent transmissions are equivalent since the initial densities are equivalent additionally we defined β ˆ and α ˆ as inversely proportional to the initial susceptible population size s 0 s 0 as discussed in section 2 2 1 therefore the calculation of r 0 should be the same for both types of

24989,background climate and socio economy signiﬁcantly affect the landscape dynamics of natural ecosystem and the simulated method to understand the landscape dynamics of natural ecosystems in responding to human and natural effects is increasingly important for ecosystem management in this study we integrated system dynamics maxent and cellular automata models called as sd maxent ca model to consider climatic effects and human activities during the simulation of natural ecosystems landscape dynamics in the integrated model the maxent process was used for the interactive coupling of the top down sd and bottom up ca which improve the model s ability to accurately acquire the weights of each layer and transition rules during the simulation with the effects of climate changes this proposed model was applied to simulate the landscape degradation of natural forest caused by the expanding of farmland tea gardens and rubber plantations in xishuangbanna from 2000 to 2010 one of the world s 34 biodiversity hotspots by the comparison with other algorithms the maxent achieve a good performance in acquiring the weights of each layer the spatial consistent between simulated map and actual result reached to 84 2 indicating the promising grid to grid agreement proposed model considered the driving of climate changes and socio economy which improved the accuracy of simulating the landscape dynamics of natural ecosystems the method was further used in simulating the landscape dynamics of natural forest in xishuangbanna from 2010 to 2030 under four different climate scenarios the variation of conversion area among different climate scenarios is consistent with their response to climate changes the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model is effective for the landscape simulation of natural ecosystems keywords landscape dynamics simulation natural ecosystems sd maxent ca model socio economy climate changes 1 introduction natural ecosystems are the planet s life support systems for human and other forms of life costanza et al 1998 ecosystems provide food water clean air and shelter for lives on the earth which play an important role in climate regulation regulation of infectious disease biological products and conservation ma 2005 however the extensive human activities and climate changes have resulted in fundamental changes in the structure and function of the global ecosystem pecl et al 2017 the intensified ecosystem degradation have led to food deficits infectious disease and natural disasters ma 2005 undoubtedly the knowledge of landscape

reproducible tools for identifying the process of landscape dynamics he et al 2008 and both the impacts of climate changes and socio economy have played important role in the landscape dynamics of ecosystems liu et al 2017 the interaction and complex linkages between socio economy and natural environmental driving forces is expected to be identified during the simulation to support ecosystems

reproducing feedback between socioeconomic and physical factors by demand supply method chang et al 2008 shen et al 2009 however sd models hardly indicate the changes of spatial patterns of land use and other spatial variables han et al 2009 the cellular automata ca down top model is useful for reflecting spatial patterns which have become more persuasive for the simulation of land dynamics li et al 2013b liao et al 2016 ca models are flexible extendable and have strong ability to model spatial processes which are increasingly popular in spatial simulation of landscape dynamics he et al 2006 li et al 2013b while it merely focus on the socio economy and climate changes han et al 2009 integration of the cellular automata ca and system dynamics sd models provide a scenario based solution for assessing the potential impact of various driving forces during the simulation of ecosystems landscape dynamics han et al 2009 lauf et al 2012 verburg and overmars 2009 nevertheless only integrating

promising performance during the spatial simulation of ecosystems phillips et al 2017a however the maxent rarely consider the influence of neighborhood effects and human disturbances and a couples among three methods may take full advantages of each method and lead to a more precise simulation of natural ecosystems thus integrated sd maxent ca model was proposed in this study to simulate the dynamics of natural forest considering the driving of climate changes and socio economy xishuangbanna is one of 34 biodiversity hotspots myers et al 2000 olson and dinerstein 1998 the natural forest in xishuangbanna provide suitable biozone for valuable and rare species however observations in xishuangbanna suggest that there are a great loss of natural forest caused by climate changes and the rapid growth of economy and population brandt et al 2015 simulating the landscape degradation of natural forest in xishuangbanna with the proposed method is important to arouse public s awareness of ecosystem management and aid governors in biodiversity conservation the objectives of this study were to 1 design a new simulation method sd maxent ca model that consider the driving of socio economy and climate changes 2 predict the spatial degradation of natural forest caused by the expanding of farmland tea gardens and rubber plantations in xishuangbanna in the future and provide management decisions for assessors 2 study area and data xishuangbanna 99 56 101 50 e 21 08 22 36 n located at yunnan province in southwestern china covering 19 150 km2 including jinghong menghai and mengla adjoining laos and burma fig 1 this region is featured with mountain valley topography and typical monsoon climate the combination of multiple climate and complex geography lead to the biodiversity hotpot in xishuangbanna zhang and cao 1995 it is one of the most diversified region around the world occupying only 0 2 of the area of china and containing almost 16 of the species of higher plants zhang and cao 1995 zhu et al 2006 many valuable and rare species are clustered in its natural vegetative habitats including nomascus leucogenys pavo muticus imperator and so on kong et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 however almost 0 75 million ha natural forest have lost from 1952 to 1994 because of climate changes and the development of socio economy tan et al 2017 and both climatic and socio economic data should be collected to simulate the dynamics of natural forest the socio economic data of xishuangbanna such as population gdp production of rubber and tea the price of rubber and tea the investment of agriculture and the plan of natural forest protection were collected from statistical yearbook editorial committee of xishuangbanna yearbook 2015 statistical bulletin statistical bureau of xishuangbanna 2015 local chronicles tang 1998 rubber economist quarterly report prachaya 2015 and prices of agricultural products national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2015 besides those socio economic variables the spatially environmental factors also play important roles in simulating the spatial distribution of the degradation of natural forest in this study the landcover data at 30 m resolution in 1990 2000 and 2010 was derived from the carbon special program based on landsat images lei et al 2016 data of soil types was obtained from food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao nachtergaele et al 2009 elevation was collected from the usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov and the data of aspect and slope were derived from the digital elevation model dem data the spatial meteorological data was produced by the interpolation of meteorological station with anusplin tan et al 2016 distance to each land cover type and the neighborhood effects of each land cover type focal functions in a 7 7 window based on the research of li et al li and yeh 2002 were acquired appendix s1 s2 future climate condition was acquired from the beijing climate center climate system model bcc csm1 1 m wu et al 2013 xiao ge et al 2013 four representative concentration pathways rcps low rcp2 6 medium rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 and high rcp8 5 were used in predicting future temperature and precipitation appendix s3 s4 ipcc 2014 to keep the consistent with the spatial resolution of land cover all datasets were resampled into 30 m based on the nearest method 3 methodology 3 1 model background and framework 3 1 1 model background the population in xishuangbanna here have doubled from 1973 to 2015 563 thousand in 1973 and 1164 thousand in 2015 wu 2008 the more population means the consumption of more grains and more potential alteration in nature natural forest in this region was mainly converted to rubber plantations tea gardens and farmland fig 2 jiang et al 2011 on the other hand some farmland have been returned to forest however considering that the functions and services of secondary forest is different to natural forest this study mainly focus on the degradation of natural forest from 1990 to 2010 the area of natural forest converting into rubber plantations tea gardens and farmland accounts for almost 99 of the roll out of natural forest on the other hand the expanding of these three types are mostly derived from natural forest in the realism the direct relationship between natural forest and economic factors is vague while the relationship between these three types rubber plantations tea gardens and farmland and economic factors is direct and apparent thus in the sd model the landscape degradation of natural forest can be indirectly acquired based on the simulation of the expanding of these three types on the other hand recently many natural reserves have been established in this region and the reduction of natural forest have significantly slowed down yi et al 2014 3 1 2 model framework the framework of sd maxent ca model is illustrated in fig 3 problems are mainly focused on how to predict the macro land use demand for natural forest driven by socio economy and how to determine the spatial pattern of natural forest degradation affected by environmental factors in sd maxent ca model a sd model is developed to predict the macro land use demand of natural forest caused by the expanding of rubber plantations tea gardens and farmland in xishuangbanna and a ca model is used to simulate the spatial dynamic of the degradation in natural forest with the control of the macro land use demand of sd the ca model is developed to process the complex interactions among land use types and environmental layers by maxent algorithm incorporating the local spatial factors environmental and socio economic data sd maxent ca model can assess the spatial transition probability of natural forest to these three types 3 2 macro model we developed the sd model of the degradation of natural forest in xishuangbanna due to the expanding of rubber plantation tea gardens and farmland land by considering both human activities and natural ecological effects in the model the area of degradation in natural forest is indirectly acquired by modeling the expanding of rubber plantation tea garden and farmland at the cost of natural forest fig 3 eq 1 with the demand of rubber and economic growth the rubber plantation have been expanded at the cost of tropical forest ahrends et al 2015 the area of rubber plantation have increased fiftyfold in the recent 50 years 33 km2 in 1959 and 3042 km2 in 2015 tang 1998 statistical bureau of xishuangbanna 2015 the growth of the area of rubber plantation is potential higher due to the border extent of rubber plantation at the same time the suitable environment of rubber plantation is heat and wet which maybe one of the limitation for its expanding with the global warming the rubber plantation may expand into the region of natural forest where the rubber plantation could not survive in the past or present tan et al 2019 zomer et al 2014 therefore the area of rubber plantation growth of population and 2nd gdp and the price of rubber have positive effects on the increment of rubber plantation appendix s5 while the expanding of rubber plantation is limited by the natural environment and natural forest protection fig 3 conversion to tea gardens is another main factor leading to the degradation of natural forest in xishuangbanna with the growth of population and the 1st gdp the tea gardens have been booming in this region appendix s6 the area of tea gardens was 98 7 km2 in 1978 and 670 km2 in 2015 tang 1998 statistical bureau of xishuangbanna 2015 the border extent of tea gardens potentially result into more area of tea gardens converting from natural forest the climate change may also have impacts on the growth of tea and higher temperature may lead to less fog which may cause drought for tea ji et al 2016 liu et al 2007 and the increment of tea garden is driven by the area of tea garden the growth of 1st gdp the growth of population and the price of tea and also limited by the natural forest protection and environment fig 3 the area of farmland have also expanded at the cost of natural forest though its area derived from natural forest is much less than that of rubber plantations and tea gardens it is obvious that the increasing of population means more consumption of grains and the growth of 1st gdp potentially lead to the increment in the area of farmland at the same time the prosperous tourism lead to great requirements of grains higher price of grain always lead to expanding of farmland while the population levels may decrease if grain prices rise the increment of farmland is at the driver of the area of farmland the growth of 1st gdp the demand of food and the price of grain and is limited by the natural forest protection fig 3 1 s n t 1 s n t s r t t 1 s t t t 1 s a t t 1 f d r t f d t t f d a t where sn t 1 and sn t is the area of natural forest at the time of t 1 and t sr t t 1 st t t 1 and sa t t 1 are the increase in area of rubber plantation tea garden and farmland which are derived from natural forest from time of t to t 1 fd is the value of feedbacks of rubber plantation tea garden and farmland derived from the bottom up ca model at the time of t through developing the macro model we acquired the area demand of natural forest for the expanding of rubber plantation tea garden and farmland which provide the area for the simulation in the micro level to reach 3 3 micro model the ca model is developed to allocate the spatial dynamic of the degradation of natural forest under the given area demands provided by the sd model three steps implemented during the ca simulation acquire the simulation model by training the data in the past with maxent algorithm estimate the conversion probability surface and the spatial allocation of land cover type integrating with sd model fig 3 in all the spatial degradation of natural forest was controlled by neighborhood effects and the result of sd models limited by the environment and the protection area which can be described in the eq 2 2 s t 1 f s t n t s d t 1 p t 1 e t 1 where st 1 and st are the area of natural forest at time t 1 and t n is the effect of neighborhood sdt 1 is the effect of sd model on the cell state at time t 1 pt 1 and et 1 are the limitation of protection and environment on the cell state at time t 1 3 3 1 training and probability of occurrence estimation using maxent algorithm how to define the transition rule and model structure is another problem of the simulation with ca model this paper exhibits the results of an experiment on simulating land use dynamics by using maxent algorithm to meet these demands maxent algorithm was used to establish the relationship between the occurrence probability of land use type and the given environmental factors during the modeling with maxent algorithm the simulation meets any constraints on the unknown distribution and the result of modeling should have maximum entropy to achieve the best approximation eq 3 phillips and dudík 2008 similar to previous large scale simulation models such as flus liu et al 2017 clumondo van asselen and verburg 2013 and clue s verburg et al 2006 the established relationship based on maxent algorithm is assumed to remain relatively unchanged over the study period due to the essential nature of the land use 3 p arg max i j c p f i j ln p f i j subject to i j c p f i j 1 where ln is the natural logarithm f is the feature vector for the occurrence points i is the number of occurrence sits j is the number of features p fi j is the probability distribution c is the constrain sets in general maxent with multiple input and output consists of three parts environmental layer samples and an output layer fig 3 the environmental layer is the input layers in the ca model samples are used for training which are the stochastically sampled pixels of the conversion of natural forest into three types rubber plantation tea gardens and farmland land by referring to former research li and yeh 2002 output layer is the prediction that represents the probability of occurrence for the natural forest conversing into three types at the grid cell a higher value indicates that the speciﬁc grid cell has a higher probability of occurrence for natural forest converting into target land type in the training procedure the maxent algorithm iteratively gain the entropy through the training datasets and the optimum model will be acquired with maximum entropy the pixels of land cover change from 1990 to 2000 were stochastically sampled to obtain the sites for training the environmental layer temperature precipitation soil type slope aspect and elevation in 2000 reserves layer the existing of each land cover type distance and neighborhood layer in 1990 were overlaid with the sampled site fig 3 this training datasets could reveal the relationship between land cover conversion probabilities and site attributes the training process was carried out by using a maxent package phillips et al 2017b three simulation models natural forest to rubber plantation tea garden and farmland were obtained by the maxent package combined with the probability of occurrence derived from maxent and the actually transformed sites from 1990 to 2000 the converting threshold of probability that determine the pixel whether natural forest converted into this type was acquired the environmental layer in 2010 existing of each land cover type distance and neighborhood layer in 2000 imported into the three established models the predicted probability distribution of natural forest converting into the three types from 2000 to 2010 were acquired fig 4 3 3 2 spatial allocation of land cover type integrating with sd model in the final which type and where the natural forest could convert were determined by the spatial conversion probability converting area in sd model and converting threshold of the three types pixel either retains natural forest or converts into the three types potential converting pixels depending on their converting threshold fig 3 however some potential converting pixels of different type may overlap and there will be controversy to determine which type these pixels convert into therefore the potential converting pixels of these three types will be iteratively sought out by its conversion probability from high to low and the type whose conversion probability is the maximum will be assigned when there is a controversy the type whose number of converted pixels reach its number in sd will be assigned with final stage fig 3 then these lefts will continue the process of iterative seek till all types reach its number in sd however for those potential converting pixels whose conversion probability is too low to transform less than the threshold obtained from the training part the number of converted pixels is beyond to reach its number in sd this may means that the physical factors may constrain the conversion and the modification of environment variables in sd model was made to meet this restriction through the feedbacks of conversion probability at micro level fig 3 eq 1 the value of fd in the eq 1 is the difference between the simulated area in sd model and the area of the converting pixels in ca at the time of t the sd model and the procedure of determination will be iterated until all the potential converting pixels reach to the final stage after acquiring the dynamic landscape of the expanding of the three types the deterioration area and the landscape degradation of natural forest at the cost of the expanding of farmland rubber plantations and tea gardens would be indirectly available 3 4 comparison with other algorithm to exploring the performance of maxent in acquiring the weights of each layer we compared the performance of the proposed method to that of general method without maxent the traditional ann and logistic algorithm generally used in acquiring the weights of layers in ca model li et al 2013a liu et al 2017 were used to compare with maxent same samples and input layers in the training part were used in maxent traditional ann and logistic algorithm to guarantee the consistency of input environment for each algorithm the receiver operating characteristic roc curve and the area under roc curve auc values widely applied for visualizing the performance of model in ﬁtting the probability of occurrence liu et al 2017 were used for performance comparison an roc graph depicts relative tradeoﬀ s between beneﬁts and costs in which true positives rate tpr known as the sensitivity in machine learning is plotted on the y axis and false positive rate fpr estimated with speciﬁcity is plotted on the x axis fawcett 2006 auc is a portion of the area of the unit square in roc curve its value will always be between 0 and 1 0 generally a larger area under the roc curve auc value corresponds to a better performance of model therefore the roc curve and auc value of maxent traditional ann and logistic algorithm were compared to validate the performance of maxent combining model over sd ca models in order to further test whether maxent is better than the other two methods a nonparametric approach was applied to compare the areas under roc curves by using the theory on generalized u statistics delong et al 1988 4 results and analysis 4 1 validation of maxent performance through the comparison of roc of maxent traditional ann and logistic algorithm fig 5 we validated the performance of maxent for the conversion from natural forest to farmland the ann and maxent perform better than that of logistic algorithm fig 5a for the conversion from natural forest to rubber plantations and tea gardens maxent perform better than that of logistic and ann algorithm fig 5 b c considering the conversion from natural forest to rubber plantations and tea gardens potentially controlled by climate zomer et al 2014 the slightly better performance of maxent indicates that maxent may have good ability to consider the effects of climate during landscape simulation in all the auc value of maxent algorithm were more than 0 8 fig 5 which means these models perform well in simulating the conversion from natural forest into the three types from fig 5 it appears that ann performs little improvement over maxent to further analyze and compare these areas the covariance matrix correlation coefficients and significance test proposed by delong et al were applied delong et al 1988 covariance matrix was displayed in table 1 in table 2 the correlation coefficients were presented indicating a high correlation between maxent and ann based on the covariance matrix we used the contrast l 0 5 1 0 5 to compare maxent to the average of ann and glm delong et al 1988 the standard deviation of this estimate lslt 1 2 were 0 0186 0 0148 and 0 0146 for the conversion from natural forest to farmland rubber plantations and tea gardens respectively accordingly the two sided 95 confidence interval for this contrast were 0 047 0 120 0 026 0 084 and 0 042 0 099 respectively indicating an improvement by maxent over ann and glm on the other hand to determine whether the maxent is better than at least one of method glm or ann we used the contrast l 1 1 0 0 1 1 based on a modest generalization of significance test the χ2 statistic with 2 degrees of freedom can be computed as 15 88 with a p value 0 01 6 93 with a p value 0 01 and 14 82 with a p value 0 01 for the conversion from natural forest to farmland rubber plantations and tea gardens respectively based on these significance tests there appears to be an advantage in using the maxent over the other two methods 4 2 analysis of variable contributions and correlations of maxent the following table shows the percent contribution of each input variable to the conversion probability of natural forest into farmland rubber plantations tea gardens table 3 for all types the variable distance to its own occurrences was signiﬁcant in determining the conversion probability existing of land cover also had high a percent contribution across all types beyond that dem accounted for a signiﬁcant percentage for the conversion of natural forest into farmland and annual mean temperature had a significant percentage for the conversion of natural forest into rubber plantations and neighborhood of tea gardens the percent contribution of settlements of farmland is more significant than that both of rubber plantations and tea gardens which indicates that settlements play a more important role in the simulation of farmland than that of rubber plantations and tea gardens the percent contribution of climate variables of rubber plantations and tea gardens are more significant than that of farmland and climate variables counts more during the simulation of rubber plantations and tea gardens than that of farmland maxent produced response curves that showed how the predicted conversion probability changes across each variable the curves indicate the correlation between variables and conversion probability and only the variables that have significant percent contribution were listed fig 6 maxent predicted a signiﬁcantly negative correlation between the distance to its own occurrences and conversion probability for the natural forest converting into farmland the variables of slope and annual total precipitation showed a negative correlation while that of altitude is positive which means the probability of expanding of farmland is higher in high altitude for the natural forest converting into rubber plantations the annual mean temperature showed a strong positive correlation and the altitude showed a strong negative correlation which means higher temperature may lead to higher conversion probability of natural forest converting into rubber plantations tan et al 2019 the slop showed no correlation in the natural forest converting into rubber plantations resulting into low value of its percent contribution for the natural forest converting into tea gardens altitude temperature precipitation and slope showed a negative correlation 4 3 comparison between actual and simulated degradation of natural forest in xishuangbanna during 2000 2010 the comparison between actual and simulated area of natural forest degradation caused by the expanding of farmland rubber plantations and tea gardens during 2000 2010 were presented in the table 4 the accuracy of the model output was veriﬁed using relative error re between the simulation results and actual conversion he et al 2015 among the three types the accuracy of natural forest converting into rubber plantations is featured with the highest re is 0 9 while that of farmland is the lowest re is 8 4 the predicted area of the degradation of natural forest caused by the expanding of these three types is close to the actual area re is 0 3 table 4 the area of the spatial consistency between the simulated result and the actual conversion were listed in table 5 the precision of the simulated transform of natural forest to farmland is the lowest re is 32 0 and the simulated transform of natural forest to rubber plantations is featured with high spatial consistency with the actual result re is 12 4 in all the re of spatial consistency between the simulated result and the actual conversion of natural forest due to the expanding of the three types is 15 8 which is very high in the simulation of natural ecosystems liu et al 2017 the map comparison between the simulated and the actual landscape dynamic of the expanding of rubber plantations tea gardens and farmland derived from natural forest during 2000 to 2010 were presented in the fig 7 the conversion area of natural forest to farmland is the fewest table 4 and its patches is desultorily distributed fig 7a the conversion area of natural forest to rubber plantations is the largest table 4 and there are large area of spatial consistency between the simulated result and the actual conversion fig 7b for the conversion of natural forest to rubber plantations the only in actual map pixels are mainly located in the reserve regions and the west of xishuangbanna fig 7 b1 b3 and the only in simulated map pixels occur around the consistent occurrences fig 7 b2 for the conversion of natural forest to tea gardens the only in actual map pixels are mainly distributed in the reserve regions fig 7 c2 and the only in simulated map pixels located in the west of xishuangbanna fig 7 c1 4 4 projection the degradation of natural forest in xishuangbanna for 2010 2030 based on the proposed model and the environment variables in the future we simulated the degradation of natural forest from 2010 to 2030 due to the expanding of tea gardens rubber plantations and farmland table 6 fig 8 from the conversion area from 2010 to 2030 tab 6 the conversion area of tea gardens derived from natural forest would be more than that of rubber plantations in the future the conversion area of tea gardens from natural forest decreases with higher rcps the conversion area of rubber plantations from natural forest increases with higher rcps and reach the highest at the rcp 8 5 in all the degraded area of natural forest from 2010 to 2030 decreases with higher rcps which is similar to the tea gardens the corresponding simulated map of the expanding of tea gardens rubber plantations and farmland derived from natural forest among different scenarios were presented in the fig 8 in all the spatial consistent among different scenarios is very high the inconsistency of spatial dynamic among different scenarios occurs around the converted regions fig 8 small window 1 2 5 discussion the sd model is adept in the simulation with the effects of socio economy the ca model is good at the spatial modeling considering neighborhood effects and the maxent model achieve promising performance in modeling potential distribution with the impacts of natural climates through the integrated way the sd maxent ca model was proposed in this paper to take advantages of the sd ca and maxent model which provide a feasible way to consider the effects of natural human and neighborhood effects during landscape simulation 5 1 the communication among sd ca and maxent the communication among sd ca and maxent was implemented in sd maxent ca model by the interactive integration among the conversion area in sd the feedbacks in ca and the parameters of each layer derived from maxent through the statistical data the area of natural forest demanded for the expanding of each type was acquired based on the top down sd model which was applied to determine the conversion area in ca model the ca model was acquired through the training part based on the maxent algorithm environment and neighborhood effects in the past the feedbacks was used to response the constraint of environment and protection in the bottom up ca model based on the threshold of conversion probability derived from the training part and the modifications of the dynamic equation in sd were made to response to these feedbacks this cycle is repeated to achieve a bidirectional communication among sd ca and maxent and a more reasonable result will be realized compared with the method only relies on sd or ca through the maxent algorithm we can feasibly acquire the weight of each layer and consider the natural effects during simulation compared with other methods the maxent algorithm is excellent in the distribution modeling under climate changes phillips and dudík 2008 and provide a useful method for determining the parameters in ca during the simulation of natural ecosystems the sd maxent ca model is not only applicable for simulating the landscape degradation of natural forest but also for landscape prediction of other natural ecosystems however as some economic decisions may directly influence the position of expanding a more closely integrated and tightly coupled method between ca and sd should be explored the feedbacks were simply assigned in the dynamic equation of sd model a more reasonable way should be designed to clarify the response of sd model to these feedbacks on the other hand with the development of new type of rubber plantation that can tolerant chilling condition the actual conversion area of rubber plantation derived from natural forest may be more than that in the simulation 5 2 evaluation to the results by the comparison between the simulated map and actual map of transform from 2000 in 2010 the precision of farmland is the lowest it may be the result that the transform of natural forest into farmland is more random and beyond the control of climate to the contrary the rubber plantations owns the highest precision which may result from its heavy reliability on the environment the analysis of variable contributions and correlations of maxent supports this points the only in actual map pixels of rubber plantations located in the reserve regions indicates that some rubber plantations actually expanded in the reserves so is the expanding of tea gardens on the other hand only in actual map pixels of rubber plantations also distributed in the west of xishuangbanna where temperature is low which may be the reason that new types of cold resistant rubber tree have been cultivated in the recent years chen and wu 2009 the only in simulated map pixels of tea gardens located in the west of xishuangbanna may due the facts that the original teas gardens occurs in this region fig 7 the proposed method was further applied in the simulation of landscape dynamics of natural forest from 2010 to 2030 presenting its potentiality in the future land use simulation the predicted results indicate that the tea gardens substitute for the rubber plantations become the type that natural forest mainly converted into the increment of rubber plantation from 2010 to 2015 have significantly decreased in sd model based the statistical data editorial committee of xishuangbanna yearbook 2015 this maybe the result from the efforts of biodiversity conservation and the promotion of the public s awareness of ecosystem conservation in this region yi et al 2014 meanwhile the remaining area suitable for rubbers was rare which may also constrain the expanding of rubber plantation liu et al 2015 with higher rcps the conversion area of rubber plantations has increased for rubber plantations inhabiting in the condition of heat fig 8 small window 2 liu et al 2015 oppositely the conversion area of tea gardens has decreased with higher rcps as tea always inhabit in the condition of humidity and higher rcps lead to dry environment fig 8 small window 1 ji et al 2016 the variation of conversion area of each type among different climate scenarios is consistent with their response to climate changes 5 3 implications for management with this method we may simulated the natural ecosystem in the future which provide a potential way for acquiring the degradation of area over the next 50 years in iucn red lists of ecosystems what s more managers may pay more attentions to the regions where natural forest have the most potential to be degraded providing advices for decision makers and forest management the predicted result indicates that tea gardens may be the largest area the natural forest converted into as the medicinal value of tea have been widely realized weng et al 2017 the consumption of tea is great and the tea garden presents an increasing trend from 2000 to 2015 editorial committee of xishuangbanna yearbook 2015 furthermore the survival condition of tea garden is less limited than that of rubber plantation and the expanding of tea gardens may be significant in the future great attention should be laid on the expanding of tea gardens at the cost of natural forest in the west and north of xishuangbanna in the future rubber plantations may have the trend to expand at the cost of natural forest in the middle and south of xishuangbanna where elevation is high conservationists need to strengthen the inspection of natural forests in high elevation to protect the natural forest from the expanding of rubber plantations 6 summary in this study we proposed a new method for the simulation of natural forest degradation due to the expanding of tea gardens rubber plantations and farmland by considering the impacts of the socio economy and environments the maxent algorithm sd and ca model were integrated to achieve this aims the iterative feedback part provide integrated coupling of sdca and eliciting the maxent algorithm greatly extend the ability of this method in the simulation of natural ecosystems and provide a new algorithm for calculating the parameters of each layer in ca model through the bidirectional communication among sd ca and maxent the proposed method represented a promising way in simulating the landscape degradation of natural ecosystems by considering the human and natural effects based on the validation of the conversion of natural forest from 2000 to 2010 the spatial precision of this method reached to 84 2 which indicates the feasibility of the proposed method even though there are some trade off between the simulation and reality the proposed method provide a potential way in modeling the landscape dynamics of natural ecosystems that are both controlled by socio economy and climate changes acknowledgements the

24989,background climate and socio economy signiﬁcantly affect the landscape dynamics of natural ecosystem and the simulated method to understand the landscape dynamics of natural ecosystems in responding to human and natural effects is increasingly important for ecosystem management in this study we integrated system dynamics maxent and cellular automata models called as sd maxent ca model to consider climatic effects and human activities during the simulation of natural ecosystems landscape dynamics in the integrated model the maxent process was used for the interactive coupling of the top down sd and bottom up ca which improve the model s ability to accurately acquire the weights of each layer and transition rules during the simulation with the effects of climate changes this proposed model was applied to simulate the landscape degradation of natural forest caused by the expanding of farmland tea gardens and rubber plantations in xishuangbanna from 2000 to 2010 one of the world s 34 biodiversity hotspots by the comparison with other algorithms the maxent achieve a good performance in acquiring the weights of each layer the spatial consistent between simulated map and actual result reached to 84 2 indicating the promising grid to grid agreement proposed model considered the driving of climate changes and socio economy which improved the accuracy of simulating the landscape dynamics of natural ecosystems the method was further used in simulating the landscape dynamics of natural forest in xishuangbanna from 2010 to 2030 under four different climate scenarios the variation of conversion area among different climate scenarios is consistent with their response to climate changes the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model is effective for the landscape simulation of natural ecosystems keywords landscape dynamics simulation natural ecosystems sd maxent ca model socio economy climate changes 1 introduction natural ecosystems are the planet s life support systems for human and other forms of life costanza et al 1998 ecosystems provide food water clean air and shelter for lives on the earth which play an important role in climate regulation regulation of infectious disease biological products and conservation ma 2005 however the extensive human activities and climate changes have resulted in fundamental changes in the structure and function of the global ecosystem pecl et al 2017 the intensified ecosystem degradation have led to food deficits infectious disease and natural disasters ma 2005 undoubtedly the knowledge of landscape dynamics of natural ecosystems in the future is urgently required to provide decisions for policy maker and biodiversity conservation spatiotemporal ecosystems simulations are effective and reproducible tools for identifying the process of landscape dynamics he et al 2008 and both the impacts of climate changes and socio economy have played important role in the landscape dynamics of ecosystems liu et al 2017 the interaction and complex linkages between socio economy and natural environmental driving forces is expected to be identified during the simulation to support ecosystems management decisions the system dynamics sd model a favored top down model is widely used to represent the socio economic driving forces and complex systems lauf et al 2012 they are capable of reproducing feedback between socioeconomic and physical factors by demand supply method chang et al 2008 shen et al 2009 however sd models hardly indicate the changes of spatial patterns of land use and other spatial variables han et al 2009 the cellular automata ca down top model is useful for reflecting spatial patterns which have become more persuasive for the simulation of land dynamics li et al 2013b liao et al 2016 ca models are flexible extendable and have strong ability to model spatial processes which are increasingly popular in spatial simulation of landscape dynamics he et al 2006 li et al 2013b while it merely focus on the socio economy and climate changes han et al 2009 integration of the cellular automata ca and system dynamics sd models provide a scenario based solution for assessing the potential impact of various driving forces during the simulation of ecosystems landscape dynamics han et al 2009 lauf et al 2012 verburg and overmars 2009 nevertheless only integrating sd and ca models it is very hard for assessors to acquire the weight of each layer and the transition rules li and yeh 2002 and the impacts of climate changes on the simulation of landscape dynamics are beyond consideration liu et al 2017 maximum entropy maxent is one of the widely used algorithm in simulating the potential distribution of ecosystems and species under the consideration of climate changes phillips and dudík 2008 soberon and nakamura 2009 maxent acquires the maximum entropy of target probability distribution based on the sample sites and environmental variables and achieves promising performance during the spatial simulation of ecosystems phillips et al 2017a however the maxent rarely consider the influence of neighborhood effects and human disturbances and a couples among three methods may take full advantages of each method and lead to a more precise simulation of natural ecosystems thus integrated sd maxent ca model was proposed in this study to simulate the dynamics of natural forest considering the driving of climate changes and socio economy xishuangbanna is one of 34 biodiversity hotspots myers et al 2000 olson and dinerstein 1998 the natural forest in xishuangbanna provide suitable biozone for valuable and rare species however observations in xishuangbanna suggest that there are a great loss of natural forest caused by climate changes and the rapid growth of economy and population brandt et al 2015 simulating the landscape degradation of natural forest in xishuangbanna with the proposed method is important to arouse public s awareness of ecosystem management and aid governors in biodiversity conservation the objectives of this study were to 1 design a new simulation method sd maxent ca model that consider the driving of socio economy and climate changes 2 predict the spatial degradation of natural forest caused by the expanding of farmland tea gardens and rubber plantations in xishuangbanna in the future and provide management decisions for assessors 2 study area and data xishuangbanna 99 56 101 50 e 21 08 22 36 n located at yunnan province in southwestern china covering 19 150 km2 including jinghong menghai and mengla adjoining laos and burma fig 1 this region is featured with mountain valley topography and typical monsoon climate the combination of multiple climate and complex geography lead to the biodiversity hotpot in xishuangbanna zhang and cao 1995 it is one of the most diversified region around the world occupying only 0 2 of the area of china and containing almost 16 of the species of higher plants zhang and cao 1995 zhu et al 2006 many valuable and rare species are clustered in its natural vegetative habitats including nomascus leucogenys pavo muticus imperator and so on kong et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 however almost 0 75 million ha natural forest have lost from 1952 to 1994 because of climate changes and the development of socio economy tan et al 2017 and both climatic and socio economic data should be collected to simulate the dynamics of natural forest the socio economic data of xishuangbanna such as population gdp production of rubber and tea the price of rubber and tea the investment of agriculture and the plan of natural forest protection were collected from statistical yearbook editorial committee of xishuangbanna yearbook 2015 statistical bulletin statistical bureau of xishuangbanna 2015 local chronicles tang 1998 rubber economist quarterly report prachaya 2015 and prices of agricultural products national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2015 besides those socio economic variables the spatially environmental factors also play important roles in simulating the spatial distribution of the degradation of natural forest in this study the landcover data at 30 m resolution in 1990 2000 and 2010 was derived from the carbon special program based on landsat images lei et al 2016 data of soil types was obtained from food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao nachtergaele et al 2009 elevation was collected from the usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov and the data of aspect and slope were derived from the digital elevation model dem data the spatial meteorological data was produced by the interpolation of meteorological station with anusplin tan et al 2016 distance to each land cover type and the neighborhood effects of each land cover type focal functions in a 7 7 window based on the research of li et al li and yeh 2002 were acquired appendix s1 s2 future climate condition was acquired from the beijing climate center climate system model bcc csm1 1 m wu et al 2013 xiao ge et al 2013 four representative concentration pathways rcps low rcp2 6 medium rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 and high rcp8 5 were used in predicting future temperature and precipitation appendix s3 s4 ipcc 2014 to keep the consistent with the spatial resolution of land cover all datasets were resampled into 30 m based on the nearest method 3 methodology 3 1 model background and framework 3 1 1 model background the population in xishuangbanna here have doubled from 1973 to 2015 563 thousand in 1973 and 1164 thousand in 2015 wu 2008 the more population means the consumption of more grains and more potential alteration in nature natural forest in this region was mainly converted to rubber plantations tea gardens and farmland fig 2 jiang et al 2011 on the other hand some farmland have been returned to forest however considering that the functions and services of secondary forest is different to natural forest this study mainly focus on the degradation of natural forest from 1990 to 2010 the area of natural forest converting into rubber plantations tea gardens and farmland accounts for almost 99 of the roll out of natural forest on the other hand the expanding of these three types are mostly derived from natural forest in the realism the direct relationship between natural forest and economic factors is vague while the relationship between these three types rubber plantations tea gardens and farmland and economic factors is direct and apparent thus in the sd model the landscape degradation of natural forest can be indirectly acquired based on the simulation of the expanding of these three types on the other hand recently many natural reserves have been established in this region and the reduction of natural forest have significantly slowed down yi et al 2014 3 1 2 model framework the framework of sd maxent ca model is illustrated in fig 3 problems are mainly focused on how to predict the macro land use demand for natural forest driven by socio economy and how to determine the spatial pattern of natural forest degradation affected by environmental factors in sd maxent ca model a sd model is developed to predict the macro land use demand of natural forest caused by the expanding of rubber plantations tea gardens and farmland in xishuangbanna and a ca model is used to simulate the spatial dynamic of the degradation in natural forest with the control of the macro land use demand of sd the ca model is developed to process the complex interactions among land use types and environmental layers by maxent algorithm incorporating the local spatial factors environmental and socio economic data sd maxent ca model can assess the spatial transition probability of natural forest to these three types 3 2 macro model we developed the sd model of the degradation of natural forest in xishuangbanna due to the expanding of rubber plantation tea gardens and farmland land by considering both human activities and natural ecological effects in the model the area of degradation in natural forest is indirectly acquired by modeling the expanding of rubber plantation tea garden and farmland at the cost of natural forest fig 3 eq 1 with the demand of rubber and economic growth the rubber plantation have been expanded at the cost of tropical forest ahrends et al 2015 the area of rubber plantation have increased fiftyfold in the recent 50 years 33 km2 in 1959 and 3042 km2 in 2015 tang 1998 statistical bureau of xishuangbanna 2015 the growth of the area of rubber plantation is potential higher due to the border extent of rubber plantation at the same time the suitable environment of rubber plantation is heat and wet which maybe one of the limitation for its expanding with the global warming the rubber plantation may expand into the region of natural forest where the rubber plantation could not survive in the past or present tan et al 2019 zomer et al 2014 therefore the area of rubber plantation growth of population and 2nd gdp and the price of rubber have positive effects on the increment of rubber plantation appendix s5 while the expanding of rubber plantation is limited by the natural environment and natural forest protection fig 3 conversion to tea gardens is another main factor leading to the degradation of natural forest in xishuangbanna with the growth of population and the 1st gdp the tea gardens have been booming in this region appendix s6 the area of tea gardens was 98 7 km2 in 1978 and 670 km2 in 2015 tang 1998 statistical bureau of xishuangbanna 2015 the border extent of tea gardens potentially result into more area of tea gardens converting from natural forest the climate change may also have impacts on the growth of tea and higher temperature may lead to less fog which may cause drought for tea ji et al 2016 liu et al 2007 and the increment of tea garden is driven by the area of tea garden the growth of 1st gdp the growth of population and the price of tea and also limited by the natural forest protection and environment fig 3 the area of farmland have also expanded at the cost of natural forest though its area derived from natural forest is much less than that of rubber plantations and tea gardens it is obvious that the increasing of population means more consumption of grains and the growth of 1st gdp potentially lead to the increment in the area of farmland at the same time the prosperous tourism lead to great requirements of grains higher price of grain always lead to expanding of farmland while the population levels may decrease if grain prices rise the increment of farmland is at the driver of the area of farmland the growth of 1st gdp the demand of food and the price of grain and is limited by the natural forest protection fig 3 1 s n t 1 s n t s r t t 1 s t t t 1 s a t t 1 f d r t f d t t f d a t where sn t 1 and sn t is the area of natural forest at the time of t 1 and t sr t t 1 st t t 1 and sa t t 1 are the increase in area of rubber plantation tea garden and farmland which are derived from natural forest from time of t to t 1 fd is the value of feedbacks of rubber plantation tea garden and farmland derived from the bottom up ca model at the time of t through developing the macro model we acquired the area demand of natural forest for the expanding of rubber plantation tea garden and farmland which provide the area for the simulation in the micro level to reach 3 3 micro model the ca model is developed to allocate the spatial dynamic of the degradation of natural forest under the given area demands provided by the sd model three steps implemented during the ca simulation acquire the simulation model by training the data in the past with maxent algorithm estimate the conversion probability surface and the spatial allocation of land cover type integrating with sd model fig 3 in all the spatial degradation of natural forest was controlled by neighborhood effects and the result of sd models limited by the environment and the protection area which can be described in the eq 2 2 s t 1 f s t n t s d t 1 p t 1 e t 1 where st 1 and st are the area of natural forest at time t 1 and t n is the effect of neighborhood sdt 1 is the effect of sd model on the cell state at time t 1 pt 1 and et 1 are the limitation of protection and environment on the cell state at time t 1 3 3 1 training and probability of occurrence estimation using maxent algorithm how to define the transition rule and model structure is another problem of the simulation with ca model this paper exhibits the results of an experiment on simulating land use dynamics by using maxent algorithm to meet these demands maxent algorithm was used to establish the relationship between the occurrence probability of land use type and the given environmental factors during the modeling with maxent algorithm the simulation meets any constraints on the unknown distribution and the result of modeling should have maximum entropy to achieve the best approximation eq 3 phillips and dudík 2008 similar to previous large scale simulation models such as flus liu et al 2017 clumondo van asselen and verburg 2013 and clue s verburg et al 2006 the established relationship based on maxent algorithm is assumed to remain relatively unchanged over the study period due to the essential nature of the land use 3 p arg max i j c p f i j ln p f i j subject to i j c p f i j 1 where ln is the natural logarithm f is the feature vector for the occurrence points i is the number of occurrence sits j is the number of features p fi j is the probability distribution c is the constrain sets in general maxent with multiple input and output consists of three parts environmental layer samples and an output layer fig 3 the environmental layer is the input layers in the ca model samples are used for training which are the stochastically sampled pixels of the conversion of natural forest into three types rubber plantation tea gardens and farmland land by referring to former research li and yeh 2002 output layer is the prediction that represents the probability of occurrence for the natural forest conversing into three types at the grid cell a higher value indicates that the speciﬁc grid cell has a higher probability of occurrence for natural forest converting into target land type in the training procedure the maxent algorithm iteratively gain the entropy through the training datasets and the optimum model will be acquired with maximum entropy the pixels of land cover change from 1990 to 2000 were stochastically sampled to obtain the sites for training the environmental layer temperature precipitation soil type slope aspect and elevation in 2000 reserves layer the existing of each land cover type distance and neighborhood layer in 1990 were overlaid with the sampled site fig 3 this training datasets could reveal the relationship between land cover conversion probabilities and site attributes the training process was carried out by using a maxent package phillips et al 2017b three simulation models natural forest to rubber plantation tea garden and farmland were obtained by the maxent package combined with the probability of occurrence derived from maxent and the actually transformed sites from 1990 to 2000 the converting threshold of probability that determine the pixel whether natural forest converted into this type was acquired the environmental layer in 2010 existing of each land cover type distance and neighborhood layer in 2000 imported into the three established models the predicted probability distribution of natural forest converting into the three types from 2000 to 2010 were acquired fig 4 3 3 2 spatial allocation of land cover type integrating with sd model in the final which type and where the natural forest could convert were determined by the spatial conversion probability converting area in sd model and converting threshold of the three types pixel either retains natural forest or converts into the three types potential converting pixels depending on their converting threshold fig 3 however some potential converting pixels of different type may overlap and there will be controversy to determine which type these pixels convert into therefore the potential converting pixels of these three types will be iteratively sought out by its conversion probability from high to low and the type whose conversion probability is the maximum will be assigned when there is a controversy the type whose number of converted pixels reach its number in sd will be assigned with final stage fig 3 then these lefts will continue the process of iterative seek till all types reach its number in sd however for those potential converting pixels whose conversion probability is too low to transform less than the threshold obtained from the training part the number of converted pixels is beyond to reach its number in sd this may means that the physical factors may constrain the conversion and the modification of environment variables in sd model was made to meet this restriction through the feedbacks of conversion probability at micro level fig 3 eq 1 the value of fd in the eq 1 is the difference between the simulated area in sd model and the area of the converting pixels in ca at the time of t the sd model and the procedure of determination will be iterated until all the potential converting pixels reach to the final stage after acquiring the dynamic landscape of the expanding of the three types the deterioration area and the landscape degradation of natural forest at the cost of the expanding of farmland rubber plantations and tea gardens would be indirectly available 3 4 comparison with other algorithm to exploring the performance of maxent in acquiring the weights of each layer we compared the performance of the proposed method to that of general method without maxent the traditional ann and logistic algorithm generally used in acquiring the weights of layers in ca model li et al 2013a liu et al 2017 were used to compare with maxent same samples and input layers in the training part were used in maxent traditional ann and logistic algorithm to guarantee the consistency of input environment for each algorithm the receiver operating characteristic roc curve and the area under roc curve auc values widely applied for visualizing the performance of model in ﬁtting the probability of occurrence liu et al 2017 were used for performance comparison an roc graph depicts relative tradeoﬀ s between beneﬁts and costs in which true positives rate tpr known as the sensitivity in machine learning is plotted on the y axis and false positive rate fpr estimated with speciﬁcity is plotted on the x axis fawcett 2006 auc is a portion of the area of the unit square in roc curve its value will always be between 0 and 1 0 generally a larger area under the roc curve auc value corresponds to a better performance of model therefore the roc curve and auc value of maxent traditional ann and logistic algorithm were compared to validate the performance of maxent combining model over sd ca models in order to further test whether maxent is better than the other two methods a nonparametric approach was applied to compare the areas under roc curves by using the theory on generalized u statistics delong et al 1988 4 results and analysis 4 1 validation of maxent performance through the comparison of roc of maxent traditional ann and logistic algorithm fig 5 we validated the performance of maxent for the conversion from natural forest to farmland the ann and maxent perform better than that of logistic algorithm fig 5a for the conversion from natural forest to rubber plantations and tea gardens maxent perform better than that of logistic and ann algorithm fig 5 b c considering the conversion from natural forest to rubber plantations and tea gardens potentially controlled by climate zomer et al 2014 the slightly better performance of maxent indicates that maxent may have good ability to consider the effects of climate during landscape simulation in all the auc value of maxent algorithm were more than 0 8 fig 5 which means these models perform well in simulating the conversion from natural forest into the three types from fig 5 it appears that ann performs little improvement over maxent to further analyze and compare these areas the covariance matrix correlation coefficients and significance test proposed by delong et al were applied delong et al 1988 covariance matrix was displayed in table 1 in table 2 the correlation coefficients were presented indicating a high correlation between maxent and ann based on the covariance matrix we used the contrast l 0 5 1 0 5 to compare maxent to the average of ann and glm delong et al 1988 the standard deviation of this estimate lslt 1 2 were 0 0186 0 0148 and 0 0146 for the conversion from natural forest to farmland rubber plantations and tea gardens respectively accordingly the two sided 95 confidence interval for this contrast were 0 047 0 120 0 026 0 084 and 0 042 0 099 respectively indicating an improvement by maxent over ann and glm on the other hand to determine whether the maxent is better than at least one of method glm or ann we used the contrast l 1 1 0 0 1 1 based on a modest generalization of significance test the χ2 statistic with 2 degrees of freedom can be computed as 15 88 with a p value 0 01 6 93 with a p value 0 01 and 14 82 with a p value 0 01 for the conversion from natural forest to farmland rubber plantations and tea gardens respectively based on these significance tests there appears to be an advantage in using the maxent over the other two methods 4 2 analysis of variable contributions and correlations of maxent the following table shows the percent contribution of each input variable to the conversion probability of natural forest into farmland rubber plantations tea gardens table 3 for all types the variable distance to its own occurrences was signiﬁcant in determining the conversion probability existing of land cover also had high a percent contribution across all types beyond that dem accounted for a signiﬁcant percentage for the conversion of natural forest into farmland and annual mean temperature had a significant percentage for the conversion of natural forest into rubber plantations and neighborhood of tea gardens the percent contribution of settlements of farmland is more significant than that both of rubber plantations and tea gardens which indicates that settlements play a more important role in the simulation of farmland than that of rubber plantations and tea gardens the percent contribution of climate variables of rubber plantations and tea gardens are more significant than that of farmland and climate variables counts more during the simulation of rubber plantations and tea gardens than that of farmland maxent produced response curves that showed how the predicted conversion probability changes across each variable the curves indicate the correlation between variables and conversion probability and only the variables that have significant percent contribution were listed fig 6 maxent predicted a signiﬁcantly negative correlation between the distance to its own occurrences and conversion probability for the natural forest converting into farmland the variables of slope and annual total precipitation showed a negative correlation while that of altitude is positive which means the probability of expanding of farmland is higher in high altitude for the natural forest converting into rubber plantations the annual mean temperature showed a strong positive correlation and the altitude showed a strong negative correlation which means higher temperature may lead to higher conversion probability of natural forest converting into rubber plantations tan et al 2019 the slop showed no correlation in the natural forest converting into rubber plantations resulting into low value of its percent contribution for the natural forest converting into tea gardens altitude temperature precipitation and slope showed a negative correlation 4 3 comparison between actual and simulated degradation of natural forest in xishuangbanna during 2000 2010 the comparison between actual and simulated area of natural forest degradation caused by the expanding of farmland rubber plantations and tea gardens during 2000 2010 were presented in the table 4 the accuracy of the model output was veriﬁed using relative error re between the simulation results and actual conversion he et al 2015 among the three types the accuracy of natural forest converting into rubber plantations is featured with the highest re is 0 9 while that of farmland is the lowest re is 8 4 the predicted area of the degradation of natural forest caused by the expanding of these three types is close to the actual area re is 0 3 table 4 the area of the spatial consistency between the simulated result and the actual conversion were listed in table 5 the precision of the simulated transform of natural forest to farmland is the lowest re is 32 0 and the simulated transform of natural forest to rubber plantations is featured with high spatial consistency with the actual result re is 12 4 in all the re of spatial consistency between the simulated result and the actual conversion of natural forest due to the expanding of the three types is 15 8 which is very high in the simulation of natural ecosystems liu et al 2017 the map comparison between the simulated and the actual landscape dynamic of the expanding of rubber plantations tea gardens and farmland derived from natural forest during 2000 to 2010 were presented in the fig 7 the conversion area of natural forest to farmland is the fewest table 4 and its patches is desultorily distributed fig 7a the conversion area of natural forest to rubber plantations is the largest table 4 and there are large area of spatial consistency between the simulated result and the actual conversion fig 7b for the conversion of natural forest to rubber plantations the only in actual map pixels are mainly located in the reserve regions and the west of xishuangbanna fig 7 b1 b3 and the only in simulated map pixels occur around the consistent occurrences fig 7 b2 for the conversion of natural forest to tea gardens the only in actual map pixels are mainly distributed in the reserve regions fig 7 c2 and the only in simulated map pixels located in the west of xishuangbanna fig 7 c1 4 4 projection the degradation of natural forest in xishuangbanna for 2010 2030 based on the proposed model and the environment variables in the future we simulated the degradation of natural forest from 2010 to 2030 due to the expanding of tea gardens rubber plantations and farmland table 6 fig 8 from the conversion area from 2010 to 2030 tab 6 the conversion area of tea gardens derived from natural forest would be more than that of rubber plantations in the future the conversion area of tea gardens from natural forest decreases with higher rcps the conversion area of rubber plantations from natural forest increases with higher rcps and reach the highest at the rcp 8 5 in all the degraded area of natural forest from 2010 to 2030 decreases with higher rcps which is similar to the tea gardens the corresponding simulated map of the expanding of tea gardens rubber plantations and farmland derived from natural forest among different scenarios were presented in the fig 8 in all the spatial consistent among different scenarios is very high the inconsistency of spatial dynamic among different scenarios occurs around the converted regions fig 8 small window 1 2 5 discussion the sd model is adept in the simulation with the effects of socio economy the ca model is good at the spatial modeling considering neighborhood effects and the maxent model achieve promising performance in modeling potential distribution with the impacts of natural climates through the integrated way the sd maxent ca model was proposed in this paper to take advantages of the sd ca and maxent model which provide a feasible way to consider the effects of natural human and neighborhood effects during landscape simulation 5 1 the communication among sd ca and maxent the communication among sd ca and maxent was implemented in sd maxent ca model by the interactive integration among the conversion area in sd the feedbacks in ca and the parameters of each layer derived from maxent through the statistical data the area of natural forest demanded for the expanding of each type was acquired based on the top down sd model which was applied to determine the conversion area in ca model the ca model was acquired through the training part based on the maxent algorithm environment and neighborhood effects in the past the feedbacks was used to response the constraint of environment and protection in the bottom up ca model based on the threshold of conversion probability derived from the training part and the modifications of the dynamic equation in sd were made to response to these feedbacks this cycle is repeated to achieve a bidirectional communication among sd ca and maxent and a more reasonable result will be realized compared with the method only relies on sd or ca through the maxent algorithm we can feasibly acquire the weight of each layer and consider the natural effects during simulation compared with other methods the maxent algorithm is excellent in the distribution modeling under climate changes phillips and dudík 2008 and provide a useful method for determining the parameters in ca during the simulation of natural ecosystems the sd maxent ca model is not only applicable for simulating the landscape degradation of natural forest but also for landscape prediction of other natural ecosystems however as some economic decisions may directly influence the position of expanding a more closely integrated and tightly coupled method between ca and sd should be explored the feedbacks were simply assigned in the dynamic equation of sd model a more reasonable way should be designed to clarify the response of sd model to these feedbacks on the other hand with the development of new type of rubber plantation that can tolerant chilling condition the actual conversion area of rubber plantation derived from natural forest may be more than that in the simulation 5 2 evaluation to the results by the comparison between the simulated map and actual map of transform from 2000 in 2010 the precision of farmland is the lowest it may be the result that the transform of natural forest into farmland is more random and beyond the control of climate to the contrary the rubber plantations owns the highest precision which may result from its heavy reliability on the environment the analysis of variable contributions and correlations of maxent supports this points the only in actual map pixels of rubber plantations located in the reserve regions indicates that some rubber plantations actually expanded in the reserves so is the expanding of tea gardens on the other hand only in actual map pixels of rubber plantations also distributed in the west of xishuangbanna where temperature is low which may be the reason that new types of cold resistant rubber tree have been cultivated in the recent years chen and wu 2009 the only in simulated map pixels of tea gardens located in the west of xishuangbanna may due the facts that the original teas gardens occurs in this region fig 7 the proposed method was further applied in the simulation of landscape dynamics of natural forest from 2010 to 2030 presenting its potentiality in the future land use simulation the predicted results indicate that the tea gardens substitute for the rubber plantations become the type that natural forest mainly converted into the increment of rubber plantation from 2010 to 2015 have significantly decreased in sd model based the statistical data editorial committee of xishuangbanna yearbook 2015 this maybe the result from the efforts of biodiversity conservation and the promotion of the public s awareness of ecosystem conservation in this region yi et al 2014 meanwhile the remaining area suitable for rubbers was rare which may also constrain the expanding of rubber plantation liu et al 2015 with higher rcps the conversion area of rubber plantations has increased for rubber plantations inhabiting in the condition of heat fig 8 small window 2 liu et al 2015 oppositely the conversion area of tea gardens has decreased with higher rcps as tea always inhabit in the condition of humidity and higher rcps lead to dry environment fig 8 small window 1 ji et al 2016 the variation of conversion area of each type among different climate scenarios is consistent with their response to climate changes 5 3 implications for management with this method we may simulated the natural ecosystem in the future which provide a potential way for acquiring the degradation of area over the next 50 years in iucn red lists of ecosystems what s more managers may pay more attentions to the regions where natural forest have the most potential to be degraded providing advices for decision makers and forest management the predicted result indicates that tea gardens may be the largest area the natural forest converted into as the medicinal value of tea have been widely realized weng et al 2017 the consumption of tea is great and the tea garden presents an increasing trend from 2000 to 2015 editorial committee of xishuangbanna yearbook 2015 furthermore the survival condition of tea garden is less limited than that of rubber plantation and the expanding of tea gardens may be significant in the future great attention should be laid on the expanding of tea gardens at the cost of natural forest in the west and north of xishuangbanna in the future rubber plantations may have the trend to expand at the cost of natural forest in the middle and south of xishuangbanna where elevation is high conservationists need to strengthen the inspection of natural forests in high elevation to protect the natural forest from the expanding of rubber plantations 6 summary in this study we proposed a new method for the simulation of natural forest degradation due to the expanding of tea gardens rubber plantations and farmland by considering the impacts of the socio economy and environments the maxent algorithm sd and ca model were integrated to achieve this aims the iterative feedback part provide integrated coupling of sdca and eliciting the maxent algorithm greatly extend the ability of this method in the simulation of natural ecosystems and provide a new algorithm for calculating the parameters of each layer in ca model through the bidirectional communication among sd ca and maxent the proposed method represented a promising way in simulating the landscape degradation of natural ecosystems by considering the human and natural effects based on the validation of the conversion of natural forest from 2000 to 2010 the spatial precision of this method reached to 84 2 which indicates the feasibility of the proposed method even though there are some trade off between the simulation and reality the proposed method provide a potential way in modeling the landscape dynamics of natural ecosystems that are both controlled by socio economy and climate changes acknowledgements the
