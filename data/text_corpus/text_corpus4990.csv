24950,the everglades located in south florida usa have been accumulating organic soils peats for 5000 years the northern portion of the natural everglades called the everglades agricultural area eaa has been drained for more than 100 years and has experienced soil subsidence since then rates of soil subsidence in the eaa have changed over time due mostly to changes in land use and water management the purpose of this study was to adapt a model of peat dynamics to the eaa based on historic and current data to explore parameter estimation and to identify information parameters that might be useful to model and predict soil subsidence in organic soils model optimization predicted a predrainage peat thickness of 2 57 m and a current subsidence rate of 0 65 cm yr 1 model evaluation indicated that increasing biomass input to the soils from the current dominant crop sugarcane had the greatest potential to reduce future subsidence while increasing water table depth or reducing the aerobic decomposition rate could also help reduce subsidence to decrease subsidence in the eaa and improve soil conservation farm practices that increase biomass input and water table depth would need to be implemented adding a seasonal water table component to this model and improve estimates of biomass input to the soil are the next steps to improve predictions of soil subsidence in the eaa under

stone 1994 before human intervention peat accumulated in the everglades at a rate of 0 08 cm yr 1 mcdowell et al 1969 the everglades agricultural area eaa comprises one fourth of the original everglades snyder et al 1978 and is located south of lake okeechobee these peat deposits are thickest north of the eaa and thinnest at its southern edge snyder et al 1978 aich et al 2013 all eaa peat soils are underlain by limestone rock and have mineral content of less than 35 rice et al 2005 the eaa was established for farmers to cultivate the land under water controlled conditions draining the soils with a system of canals and dikes that channels drained water primarily into the water conservation areas and secondarily into the atlantic ocean and lake okeechobee abtew and khanal 1994 most irrigation in the eaa occurs by seepage maintaining the water table at a level that provides the moisture necessary for the root zone of each crop snyder et al 1978 soil subsidence which is the loss of soil thickness in organic soils after drainage is a widespread phenomenon occurring in places such as southeast asia wösten et al 1997 hooijer et al 2012 and new zealand pronger et al 2014 in the united states the best known cases of subsidence are the sacramento san joaquin delta in california and the florida everglades galloway et al 1999 several environmental factors such as type of peat decomposition rate density and thickness of peat climate water table depth temperature and land use history affect subsidence armentano 1980 wösten et al 1997 water table depth is considered the dominant factor controlling soil subsidence because it regulates peat growth and formation clymo 1984 in the eaa studies with subsidence lines established in 1913 indicate that rapid subsidence rates ca 9 cm yr 1 followed the initial drainage of the everglades stephens 1956 after this rapid rate subsidence remained constant at 3 cm yr 1 dominated by the oxidation process stephens 1956 stephens and speir 1970 during the past few decades subsidence rates have decreased to 1 45 cm yr 1 shih et al 1998 possible causes for this decrease in subsidence rates include increases in the water table possibly due to best management practices in the mineral content of the soils and in recalcitrant forms of organic carbon c shih et al 1998 galloway et al 1999 the processes that contribute to soil subsidence include oxidation due to organic matter decomposition under aerobic conditions shrinkage which occurs to peats above the water table consolidation below the water table due to the loss of buoyancy compaction due to use of machinery and tillage wind and water erosion and burning stephens et al 1984 pronger et al 2014 shrinkage consolidation and oxidation have been the dominant processes controlling subsidence in the eaa stephens 1956 and stephens et al 1984 showed that subsidence accelerated after installation of water pumps that quickly lowered the water table in the eaa soil subsidence in the eaa is currently dominated by oxidation tate 1980 before drainage eaa soils had limited oxygen availability due to their saturated condition and the resulting low rates of oxygen diffusion in water reddy and delaune 2008 following drainage oxygen became available to aerobic bacteria that decomposes organic matter more rapidly resulting in subsidence due to oxidation stephens and johnson 1951 volk 1973 found that carbon dioxide co2 efflux from eaa soils accounted for 58 73 of the average soil subsidence estimated by field studies with subsidence lines while stephens and speir 1970 found that oxidation losses accounted for 75 of field subsidence estimates higher water tables result in lower subsidence rates stephens and speir 1970 shih et al 1998 furthermore lowering the water table depth by a factor of two in the eaa doubles the subsidence rate snyder et al 1978 increases in bulk density due to compaction and shrinkage increased subsidence rates particularly during the initial years after drainage the estimated bulk density of eaa peats before drainage 0 1 g cm 3 aich et al 2013 doubled 10 years after drainage stephens and johnson 1951 studies in the eaa show that oxidation of these soils is affected by soil temperature with a q10 of 2 knipling et al 1970 volk 1973 where q10 is the factorial increase in decomposition for every 10 c increase in temperature after initial drainage of the eaa the most active type of agricultural production in this area was vegetables which had the largest acreage planted by the 1930s and 1940s snyder and davidson 1994 although vegetables represent a variety of crops a water table of 60 cm below the soil surface was considered the optimum for most vegetables in the eaa snyder et al 1978 sugarcane production in the eaa was initially limited by federal acts that established quotas on sugarcane production for the state in 1942 quotas were suspended due to the second world war and in 1963 soon after the u s suspended sugar imports from cuba sugarcane became the dominant crop in the eaa snyder and davidson 1994 by the 1970s water tables were generally maintained deeper than 60 cm below the surface for sugarcane in the eaa snyder et al 1978 in recent decades the difficulty in maintaining deep drainage due to soil subsidence and the increasing proximity of bedrock has prompted development of sugarcane varieties that can withstand shallower water tables glaz et al 2002 best management practices implemented since 1995 to reduce phosphorus p exports from the eaa include retaining water in the fields daroub et al 2011 which also has produced higher water tables in some fields biomass input may help replenish lost soil organic c however green sugarcane leaves are burned in the field before harvest hence little aboveground harvest residue is incorporated into the soil from 2008 2015 the area under rice cultivation in the eaa increased by 92 bhadha et al 2016 indicating that the area kept flooded during summer when rice is cultivated there is increasing the resulting anaerobic soil conditions slow oxidation soil temperatures in the eaa are affected by the type of crop cultivated with vegetables having higher soil temperatures than sugarcane shih et al 1982 1 2 peatland models browder and volk 1978 developed a mass balance model to study soil subsidence in the eaa they predicted that seasonally varying temperature influenced subsidence the most and suggested that changes in the c composition of peat might not affect its subsidence rates significantly most peatland modeling is based on the study of clymo 1984 whose conceptual model distinguished two components of accumulated peat acrotelm composed of fresh plant biomass that has low bulk density high hydraulic conductivity and lies above the water table most of the year and catotelm which has higher bulk density lower hydraulic conductivity and lies under the water table in clymo s model peat accumulates over the long term as mass moves from the acrotelm to the catotelm and as the catotelm constantly loses material due to decomposition mostly in the form of methane most ca 70 of the mass entering the acrotelm is lost due to decomposition under aerobic conditions clymo suggests that as plant biomass is added to the topsoil mass accumulates until the material loses its integrity and collapses which increases the bulk density and raises the water table if the catotelm is thin the addition of new mass exceeds the losses due to decomposition which causes peat to accumulate however as the peat layer thickens so do total peat losses because decomposition losses are proportional to peat mass ultimately the system reaches a steady state when inputs and outputs are balanced most data on peat accumulation overtime are consistent with a concave profile i e peat accumulates until it reaches a steady state clymo 1984 clymo et al 1998 more recent studies on peatland modeling incorporated new elements for instance frolking et al 2001 developed a model in which decomposition rates decrease with depth and are affected by temperature hilbert et al 2000 developed a model of peatland dynamics that consists of two coupled differential equations that describe the change in peat thickness and the change in water table thus emphasizing interactions between peat and water dynamics more recently frolking et al 2010 merged elements from hilbert et al 2000 and frolking et al 2001 their peat model uses plant functional types to simulate net peat accumulation and peat properties dynamic peat accumulation models have been combined with estimates of wetland extent to predict c accumulation in peat over the holocene kleinen et al 2012 variations in these peat accumulation models show how dynamic they can be and that it is possible to calibrate them for environmental conditions in different places essential components of these peat accumulation models are the existence of two peat layers acrotelm and catotelm and that decomposition losses from peat are proportional to peat mass may be influenced by temperature and proceed at slower rates in the catotelm modifications of these basic model components include the addition of variable water tables hilbert et al 2000 plant functional types frolking et al 2010 and belowground productivity frolking et al 2001 the eaa stores a large amount of c in its peat soils that is currently being released to the atmosphere as co2 greenhouse gas because of subsidence the crops cultivated in the eaa are economically important for the population of southern florida a model of soil subsidence that includes the historic changes in water management and crops as well as soil compaction has not yet been developed for the eaa doing so can highlight key factors that influence subsidence rates and help evaluate management scenarios understanding soil subsidence in the eaa is fundamental to develop soil conservation strategies which is a common goal for all stakeholders the objectives of this study were to 1 apply a model of peat dynamics that can represent accumulation and subsequent subsidence of eaa peats using equations from previous models 2 explore parameter estimation based on data on peat thickness over time 3 identify factors that influenced past and current peat dynamics and assess their relative influence on the subsidence of eaa peats and 4 predict soil subsidence rates under future management scenarios 2 methods we based our model on that of hilbert et al 2000 we selected this model because it allows to relate changes in water tables the main driver of soil subsidence to peat dynamics like clymo 1984 we distinguished the acrotelm and catotelm layers of peat whose decomposition rates were controlled by aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively symbols and parameters used in the model are described in table 1 we aimed to represent and simulate peat accumulation of the entire soil column and subsequent subsidence due to lowering of the water table we expanded the hilbert et al 2000 model by considering compaction of the acrotelm layer and adding an intermediate layer between the acrotelm and catotelm layers that experienced drainage and compaction under lower water tables and was subsequently flooded when water tables were raised the model therefore has three peat layers surface intermediate and deep this expansion may be critical for the eaa since water tables were significantly lowered initially and then raised again in recent decades this modification expanded the hilbert et al 2000 model to five state variables the thickness of the three layers and bulk densities of the surface and intermediate layers the change in thickness of each layer is determined by input of fresh biomass decomposition compaction and by moving the boundaries of the layers 1 d h i d t g i ρ p r i h i c i w i j where the subscript i is the layer surface intermediate or deep h is the thickness of the layer g is input of biomass from plant production with density ρp r is a first order decomposition rate c is compaction and wi j is the depth change as the boundaries move up or down transferring depth i e mass from layer j to layer i plant biomass input enters the topmost layer that has h 0 for example during peat accumulation plant biomass enters the deep peat layer directly because the water table lies at the surface to relate bulk density to the thickness of layers the model calculates the mass balance in each layer 2 d m i d t d ρ i h i d t ρ i d h i d t h i d ρ i d t g i r i ρ i h i w i j ρ i j where m is peat mass in the respective layer with its density ρ ρi j is the bulk density of the material that moves from layer i to j here the bulk density of the originating layer since the surface layer is defined as the depth from the surface to the water table the change in h of that layer equals the water table height change g the reference level of the water table is the soil surface 3 d h s d t g the model calculates compaction of the surface layer as a linear process 4 c k h s ρ s ρ f ρ s where k is the compaction rate ρs the current bulk density and ρf is the final bulk density beyond which no further compaction occurs the aerobic decomposition rate depends on surface temperature which is influenced by vegetation cover using a q10 approach 5 r 1 r 1 0 q ₁ ₀ t s 25 10 where r1 is the acrotelm decomposition rate and r1 0 is the aerobic decomposition rate at the reference temperature 25 c and ts the surface temperature eq 1 4 were then integrated using the following algorithm mass gains losses a determine the layer that receives plant input topmost layer with h 0 b determine loss from respiration in each layer calculate gain loss of thickness in each layer due to moving boundaries wi j a determine prescribed water table changes b determine compaction of the surface layer c determine gain loss in the surface layer by solving eq 1 and 2 for wi j d transfer gains in the surface layer from the intermediate layer and if the intermediate layer is too thin from the deep layer calculate changes in bulk density in the surface and intermediate layers by solving eq 2 for dρ dt the framework was coded using the statistical software r r core team 2017 a conceptual diagram of the model can be seen in fig 1 2 1 parameterization for peat accumulation in the model the water table z0 is considered to be at the surface from the beginning of the simulation 3504 ybp until the initial drainage of the eaa 104 ybp allowing for 3400 years of undisturbed peat accumulation the temperature of the entire column is kept constant at the reference temperature biomass input g is assumed to be dominated by sawgrass from the beginning of peat accumulation until initial drainage to determine the catotelm decomposition rate r2 and the predrainage biomass input g0 we used data from 3420 1210 ybp corrected for recent compaction from mcdowell et al 1969 who carbon dated eaa peats data from 4350 3420 ybp were excluded because it corresponds to an early stage of slow peat accumulation mcdowell et al 1969 there was no peat data from 1210 ybp to the present in mcdowell s study because by the time of their analysis peat accumulated from 1210 ybp to the present had already been lost due to oxidation and subsidence we first attempted to optimize g0 and r2 simultaneously for the peat accumulation phase using r s optim function minimizing the least square difference between model predictions and empirical data the parameters could not be optimized simultaneously however because optimization of one parameter had antagonistic effects on the other based on the nearly linear accumulation of peat in the holocene we suspected that r2 was lower than that in the literature since a higher rate would lead to a plateau thus we arbitrarily set r2 to equal one tenth 1 8 10 5 the rate observed by hu et al 2017 which yielded predictions of linear peat accumulation we then estimated g0 through optimization 2 2 parameterization of subsidence dynamics after the initial drainage in 1914 we assumed that the water table decreased linearly until 1940 as progressive improvements and installation of water pumps lowered water tables stephens and speir 1970 reaching a level 60 cm below the surface which was used mostly by vegetable crops in the eaa izuno 1994 in the model z 0 is kept at 60 cm until 1975 when water table rises to 30 cm representing the predominance of sugarcane in the area izuno 1994 development of sugarcane varieties more tolerant to higher water tables glaz et al 2002 and progressive implementation of best management practices to reduce p export fig 2 we modified soil temperature based on the plant cover that dominated the eaa we assumed that soil temperature was determined by sawgrass reference temperature 25 c from 3504 ybp to 1914 and increased linearly from 1914 to 1940 to a temperature determined by vegetables 28 3 c which provided less shade soil temperature was assumed to remain constant from 1940 to 1975 after which it decreased 26 2 c since it was determined by sugarcane fig 2 differences in soil temperature based on crop cover were based on observations of shih et al 1982 from 1914 1975 biomass input is dominated by input from vegetables which we assumed was 90 lower than that of sugarcane we chose lettuce as the representative vegetable based on a yield of 14 309 kg fresh weight ha 1 for 2010 in the eaa lu and sui 2012 allocation of 30 of biomass to roots jackson and stivers 1993 and a root dry matter proportion of 0 2 murakami et al 2002 we estimated that lettuce added 1 35 t dry weight ha 1yr 1of belowground biomass to the soil which is considerably less compared to our estimated sugarcane inputs from 1975 to the present input was assumed to be dominated by sugarcane particularly belowground sugarcane input was estimated as follows 6 s b i y i e l d y d w s a b s r where sbi is sugarcane biomass input from belowground biomass t dry weight ha 1 yr 1 yield is estimated sugarcane yield for the eaa obtained from united states department of agriculture statistics usda 2017 99 3 t fresh weight ha 1 yr 1 ydw is the dry matter proportion of sugarcane yield 0 3 thompson 1978 sab is a factor converting sugarcane stalk into aboveground biomass 1 3 silva olaya et al 2017 and sr is the shoot to root ratio 5 3 silva olaya et al 2017 the result of this calculation 7 29 t dry weight ha 1 yr 1 was converted to g dry weight cm 2 yr 1 and divided by the peat bulk density to obtain sugarcane biomass input table 1 to obtain values for the compaction rate k and aerobic decomposition rate at the reference temperature r1 0 we used least square optimization during the soil subsidence phase the past 100 years the data used for optimization were subsidence rates from previous soil subsidence studies performed in the eaa table 2 the two parameters were optimized simultaneously 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate how changes in model parameters changed predicted rates of soil subsidence we evaluated the following rates to represent different stages of soil subsidence early subsidence 1914 1924 vegetables dominance 1934 1944 sugarcane dominance 1979 1989 current subsidence 2004 2014 and overall subsidence 1914 2014 we doubled or halved the value of each parameter individually and compared the new subsidence rate to that predicted by the original model to test effects of compaction during subsidence we also assessed how inclusion or exclusion of compaction influenced optimized values of the aerobic decomposition rate at base temperature using the akaike information criterion aic 2 4 model use we used the model to predict predrainage peat accumulation peat thickness cm and soil subsidence caused by draining the eaa to predict the impact that changes in z0sug g sug and r 1 0 could produce in soil subsidence in the eaa over the next 50 years based on results from the sensitivity analysis we developed eight scenarios of potential future management practices with associated modification of parameters fig 5 h business as usual sc1 higher 15 cm average annual water table increase z0sug sc2 increased biomass input by adding aboveground sugarcane residue g sug 1 62 cm yr 1

combination of increased biomass and improved cover sc7 combination of higher water table increased biomass and improved cover 3 results 3 1 model optimization optimization of the predrainage biomass input g0 yielded a value of 0 078 cm yr 1 optimization of the aerobic decomposition rate at base temperature r 1 0 yielded a value of 0 028 yr 1 while optimization of the compaction rate k yielded a value of 0 016 yr 1 using the optimized model peat thickness increased with a slightly concave shape reaching a maximum of 257 cm by 1914 104 ybp fig 3 after drainage in 1914 peat thickness decreased to 60 cm by 2018 fig 4 soil subsidence was predicted to be slow for the first five years after drainage followed by a second steeper linear phase of subsidence until 1975 when the water table was raised and sugarcane became dominant from1975 2018 soil subsidence was slower and linear the model predicted subsidence rates of 0 66 and 0 65 cm yr 1for the past 20 years 1998 2018 and 10 years 2008 2018 respectively 3 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis showed that parameters associated with peat accumulation such as the anaerobic decomposition rate r 2 and the predrainage biomass input g0 had little influence on subsidence rates fig 5 when g0 was halved however the resulting lower peat thickness at initial drainage influenced later soil subsidence stages from 1979 to 2014 reducing subsidence rates fig 4 biomass input from vegetable farming g veg which influenced early subsidence rates 1914 1924 and 1934 1944 had little influence due to its relatively small value thus doubling or halving of its value remained small in absolute terms for early subsidence rates 1914 1979 the most influential parameters were water table depth under vegetables z0veg the compaction parameters k ρp and ρf and the aerobic respiration rate at base temperature r 1 0 for later subsidence rates 1979 1989 the most influential parameters were water table depth under sugarcane z0sug biomass input from sugarcane g sug and the aerobic decomposition rate at base temperature r 1 0 the current rate of soil subsidence 2004 2014 was not influenced by changes in the base respiration rate of the deep layer r 2 and was influenced little by changes in vegetable inputs to the soil g veg fig 5 all other parameters influenced this subsidence rate some by influencing predrainage peat accumulation for instance lower g0 resulted in lower peat thickness at initial drainage which after 100 years would produce a lower subsidence rate some of the influential parameters such as the compaction parameters k ρ p and ρ f cannot be controlled by managers under current conditions however managers could modify three influential parameters g sug r 1 0 and z0sug to improve soil conservation in the eaa when comparing models with and without compaction the model without compaction fit the data similarly to the model with compaction in fact the aic indicated that the model without compaction had slightly better results because of the penalty of two additional parameters table 3 3 3 model use under the business as usual scenario h in which current management did not change peat thickness was predicted to decrease from 61 cm in 2018 to 25 cm in 2068 fig 6 under the scenario in which improved management raised the average annual water table from 30 cm to 15 cm sc1 peat thickness was predicted to increase to 62 cm by 2068 under the scenario with higher biomass input achieved by incorporating aboveground sugarcane residue into the soil sc2 peat thickness was predicted to increase to 72 cm by 2068 under the scenario with lower soil temperatures due to improved cover sc3 peat thickness was predicted to decrease to 28 cm by 2068 thus only slightly higher than that in the business as usual scenario the scenarios that combined the three management strategies had additive effects by combining improved cover with either a higher water table sc5 or higher biomass input sc6 peat thickness was predicted to increase slightly 64 and 74 cm respectively compared to the scenarios of higher water table or higher biomass fig 6 combination of a higher water table and biomass input sc4 increased peat thickness considerably 105 cm by 2068 logically combination of all three management strategies was predicted to increase peat thickness the most 107 cm by 2068 albeit not much higher than that under scenario sc4 4 discussion predrainage peat thickness in the eaa varies with higher peats in the north and lower peats in the south snyder 1994 hohner and dreschel 2015 hohner and dreschel 2015 estimated that eaa peat thickness were generally 3 m and increased up to 4 6 m near lake okeechobee while aich et al 2013 estimated an average peat thickness of 2 63 m for the eaa these differences in peat thickness can be explained in part by differences in bedrock height in the eaa shih et al 1979 hohner and dreschel 2015 the predrainage peat thickness predicted by the optimized model 2 57 m lies within the range of those estimated for the eaa since we optimized parameters to fit estimates of historic peat thickness the optimized anaerobic decomposition rate was too low to yield the concave peat accumulation profile described by clymo et al 1998 the data from mcdowell et al 1969 used to optimize prediction of the peat accumulation phase showed linear accumulation until drainage and thus did not have a concave profile model optimization with these data suggested low decomposition rates of saturated organic matter the mcdowell et al 1969 data however do not have data on the peat that formed after 1200 ybp because peat had already been lost due to subsidence by the time of their study this highlights a limitation of soil subsidence models of drained peatlands the rapid loss of organic soils due to oxidation and the loss of useful information such as their age along with the soils also model optimization yielded a rate of predrainage biomass input g0 0 078 cm yr 1 that was lower than a calculated value of 2 7 cm yr 1 for aboveground and belowground biomass added from sawgrass for the everglades based on measurements of childers et al 2006 and noe and childers 2007 suggesting that only a small fraction of sawgrass biomass was incorporated which may indicate cycles of lower productivity due to climate fluctuations that influenced the everglades region during the peat accumulation phase and or aerobic decomposition of sawgrass residue before the material was incorporated soon after initial drainage of the eaa which was performed first by gravity and then by pumps model predictions indicated lower subsidence rates compared to observations of stephens 1956 who reported accelerated subsidence after pumps were installed in the eaa this difference was due to optimizing the model using field estimates of both the initial rapid subsidence and subsequent slower oxidation subsidence and could potentially be reduced by a more dramatic lowering of the water table initially in the model in fact the optimized model predicted an e folding time of ca 20 years i e peat thickness decreased by a factor of e in 20 years due to accelerated decomposition and compaction the model predicted lower subsidence rates by 1975 due to higher water tables and dominance of sugarcane in the eaa which resulted in higher input from belowground sugarcane biomass however the current 2018 subsidence rate predicted by the model was approximately half that reported by shih et al 1998 and snyder 2005 despite our effort to fit the data this difference may have arisen from assuming a constant 30 cm water table in the model which does not represent the common crop rotations in the eaa that require different water tables such as vegetables rice and sod some assumptions made during model development influenced model predictions the model did not consider topographic variability within the eaa which has been found to be important for predicting peat accumulation at high latitudes kleinen et al 2012 topographic variations in the eaa may produce changes in subsidence patterns as indicated by differences in the influence of parameters as peat depth decreased however the sensitivity analysis suggested that predicted subsidence was relatively insensitive to g0 and r 2 which influence peat thickness during the peat accumulation phase we assumed no climate variability or secular climate drifts short term weather fluctuations do not influence peat accumulation but long term weather fluctuations can do so clymo 1984 frolking et al 2010 although we did not consider climate variability because we assumed constant flooded conditions during peat accumulation use of peat accumulation data during optimization implicitly reflected the net influence of these weather fluctuations on peat accumulation during the soil subsidence phase we assumed a linear lowering of the water table due to continuously increasing drainage from initial drainage 1914 to 1940 and then a constant water depth of 60 cm until 1975 followed by a depth of 30 cm from 1975 2018 although water management in the eaa is efficient the constant water table depths that we assumed did not consider the influence of seasonality or storm events that can generate flooding cycles which can increase oxidation morris et al 2004 miller et al 2012 and consequently change subsidence rates we also assumed a biomass input in the model that may not reflect the diversity of crops cultivated in the eaa crop rotations which have become more common in the eaa in recent decades imply differential water management and input of different types of root biomass to the soil the aerobic decomposition rate at base temperature r 1 0 in the model was a product of optimization while the anaerobic decomposition rate r 2 was a product of optimization for g0 and the use of literature values the ratio of anaerobic to aerobic decomposition rates used in our model was 0 00064 while the model of hilbert et al 2000 used a ratio of 0 1 with an r 1 0 of 0 0025 yr 1 and that of frolking et al 2001 used ratios of 0 1 for fens and 0 025 for bogs higher temperatures at lower latitudes increase peat decomposition rates clymo et al 1998 which could explain why our r 1 0 is higher and our anaerobic to aerobic decomposition rate ratio much smaller than those used in peatland models developed for higher latitudes such as hilbert s and frolking s models since our optimization for r 1 0 used subsidence rates that reflected losses of dissolved c which can be large in the eaa stephens and stewart 1976 the model s aerobic decomposition rate may have been overestimated some models such as that of frolking 2001 differentiate between labile and recalcitrant c most c is currently in the recalcitrant form in the eaa thus higher r 1 0 during initial subsidence stages than during later stages could represent the initial loss of labile c and would generate a higher r 1 0 after optimization excluding compaction from the model yielded an aerobic respiration rate at base temperature r 1 0 that was twice that estimated by the model with compaction and 20 times as high as that for other peatlands from the literature therefore the model with compaction determined more realistic parameters and provided a more complete representation of subsidence as expected the parameters included in the sensitivity analysis influenced the predicted subsidence rate in different ways the parameters that influenced the peat accumulation stage determined peat thickness and thus how much material was vulnerable to subsidence peat thickness does not limit soil losses during initial subsidence stages but can do so in later subsidence stages as seen in the reduction in subsidence rates from 1979 to 2014 when g0 was halved early subsidence is influenced greatly by the conditions experienced after initial drainage as indicated by the influence of parameters such as the water table depth under vegetables z0veg and compaction subsidence rates accelerated and subsequently peaked partly due to further lowering of the water table while the relative influence of oxidation also increased this indicates that early stages of soil subsidence were particularly important to predicted peat thickness because peat was more sensitive to management changes then the results emphasize the importance of rapid mitigation strategies when subsidence begins in order to minimize its long term effects the changes observed in current subsidence rates due to changes in parameters that managers can control such as maintaining shallow water tables and leaving harvest residues in the field show that according to this model current soil subsidence in the eaa can be controlled by management strategies the model predicted that peat thickness would decrease from 60 cm in 2018 to 25 cm in 2068 under a business as usual scenario in such shallow soils farming would face challenges due to higher ph lower nutrient availability and a shallower rooting zone in addition soil c losses would add to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations adding aboveground residue of sugarcane to the soil is the practice that individually could have the most positive effect on soil conservation in this scenario we assumed that all aboveground residue was incorporated into the soil which may not be possible due to the loss of some residue during harvest it also implies harvesting sugarcane without burning off its leaves this scenario may also be optimistic since peat accumulated at a much slower rate historically incorporating sugarcane residue into the soil faces a bigger challenge because it implies harvesting sugarcane without burning it first i e green harvest in the eaa green harvest has been observed to decrease air temperatures 10 cm aboveground when residue is left on the soil however this decrease in temperatures makes subsequent sugarcane crops more vulnerable to freezing events gilbert et al 2010 in the eaa gilbert et al 2010 found that burned harvests produced higher yields than green harvests if harvest occurred early nov jan however green and burned harvests had no significant difference in yield if harvest occurred late in the season feb mar sandhu et al 2017 observed that even though green harvest delayed sugarcane growth compared to burned harvest this delay did not produce differences in yields or sugar content green harvest is considered more sustainable than burned harvest because it reduces soil erosion improves nutrient cycling and increases soil c and nitrogen n ma et al 2014 different strategies can be adopted for the residue left after green harvest viator et al 2009 tested four strategies in louisiana u s shredding application of n stabilizing compounds full incorporation into the soil and burning on the ground a similar approach testing different ways to incorporate green harvest residue into the soil could be beneficial for the eaa the scenario of a higher average annual water table was created to represent either a raising of water tables in association with more flood resistant sugarcane varieties which has been studied in the eaa for water tables 15 cm glaz et al 2002 23 cm glaz and gilbert 2006 and 20 cm deep glaz and morris 2010 or a crop rotation in which soils are flooded for part of the year e g rice cultivation during summer model predictions suggested that this higher water table level stopped subsidence but this represents an ideal situation because a crop rotation may also add less biomass to the soil the increased cover scenario influenced the subsidence rate the least it assumed that soil temperatures could decrease to those of the predrainage period when the eaa was dominated by sawgrass this decrease may be difficult to achieve particularly because harvesting crops removes shade and because of higher mean temperatures due to climate change the combination of these management practices rendered the best results for soil conservation the additive effect of these practices indicates that they can be combined in different ways and to different extents producing an overall net decrease or even partial reversal of subsidence rates higher water tables and increasing biomass input produced the largest decrease in subsidence rates suggesting that any step towards them would reduce subsidence incorporating rice with three months of flooded soils into rotations has already begun in the eaa with rice production increasing in the past decade bhadha et al 2016 tootoonchi et al 2018 in contrast improved cover had little influence in decreasing subsidence the model could be adapted to specific areas within the eaa such as shallow soils by using historic data on peat thickness for these locations during optimization to determine oxidation and compaction parameters also regarding model parameterization since sugarcane root development is influenced by the soil type plant variety and management specific research needs to be performed for the sugarcane varieties in the eaa to determine accurately how much of their root biomass is incorporated into the soil estimation of oxidation rates may be improved further by using a multi pool model that considers different substrate qualities and determining values of r 1 that would vary depending on substrate quality higher for labile c and lower for recalcitrant c however they would be difficult to determine for the eaa due to the loss of most labile c during initial subsidence stages to simulate current subsidence in the eaa it would be useful to add a more dynamic hydrology component that considers the influence of cycles of flooding and draining particularly during the rainy season on oxidation rates rodriguez 2018 doing so would imply representing seasonal and inter annual cycles of water table depth the effects of the fires in the eaa before sugarcane harvest could also be included due to their impacts on the biomass that could be added to the soil and the labile c pool representing fires could also help to understand how alternative management without fire could influence subsidence rates 5 conclusions we used a simple mechanistic model to study peat accumulation and loss in the eaa our modeling and data analysis suggest nearly linear accumulation before drainage and soil subsidence suggesting low anaerobic decomposition rates the analysis further indicates that soil subsidence was initially strongly influenced by compaction with resulting changes in bulk density under the current conditions the main factors influencing soil subsidence in the eaa are the water table level and fresh biomass input which replenishes c in the soil raising water tables and increasing biomass input were predicted to decrease subsidence rates over the next few decades and the substantial effects of these practices should motivate further field based studies biomass input can for instance come from aboveground sugarcane residue while water tables could be raised by more flood tolerant sugarcane varieties or greater cultivation of crops that need flooded conditions such as rice to achieve these changes management practices would need to be adjusted such as transitioning to green sugarcane harvest the soil subsidence model for the eaa can be improved by estimating the biomass input of crops particularly sugarcane to soils more accurately and the potential amount of biomass from residue that can be incorporated adding water table fluctuations at seasonal to inter annual scales could help determine its influence on soil subsidence in the eaa future modeling of drained peatlands should focus on the influence of different c pools at different stages of soil subsidence subsidence caused by loss of dissolved c in drainage and how subsidence is influenced by changes in soil moisture content

24950,the everglades located in south florida usa have been accumulating organic soils peats for 5000 years the northern portion of the natural everglades called the everglades agricultural area eaa has been drained for more than 100 years and has experienced soil subsidence since then rates of soil subsidence in the eaa have changed over time due mostly to changes in land use and water management the purpose of this study was to adapt a model of peat dynamics to the eaa based on historic and current data to explore parameter estimation and to identify information parameters that might be useful to model and predict soil subsidence in organic soils model optimization predicted a predrainage peat thickness of 2 57 m and a current subsidence rate of 0 65 cm yr 1 model evaluation indicated that increasing biomass input to the soils from the current dominant crop sugarcane had the greatest potential to reduce future subsidence while increasing water table depth or reducing the aerobic decomposition rate could also help reduce subsidence to decrease subsidence in the eaa and improve soil conservation farm practices that increase biomass input and water table depth would need to be implemented adding a seasonal water table component to this model and improve estimates of biomass input to the soil are the next steps to improve predictions of soil subsidence in the eaa under

everglades snyder et al 1978 and is located south of lake okeechobee these peat deposits are thickest north of the eaa and thinnest at its southern edge snyder et al 1978 aich et al 2013 all eaa peat soils are underlain by limestone rock and have mineral content of less than 35 rice et al 2005 the eaa was established for farmers to cultivate the land under water controlled conditions draining the soils with a system of canals and dikes that channels drained water primarily into the water conservation areas and secondarily into the atlantic ocean and lake okeechobee abtew and khanal 1994 most irrigation in the eaa occurs by seepage maintaining the water table at a level that provides the moisture necessary for the root zone of each crop snyder et al 1978 soil subsidence which is the loss of soil thickness in organic soils after drainage is a widespread phenomenon occurring in places such as southeast asia wösten et al 1997 hooijer et al 2012 and new zealand pronger et al 2014 in the united states the best known cases of subsidence are the sacramento san joaquin delta in california and the florida everglades galloway et al 1999 several environmental factors such as type of peat decomposition rate density and thickness of peat climate water table depth temperature and land use history affect subsidence armentano 1980 wösten et al 1997 water table depth is considered the dominant factor controlling soil subsidence because it regulates peat growth and formation clymo 1984 in the eaa studies with subsidence lines established in 1913 indicate that rapid subsidence rates ca 9 cm yr 1 followed the initial drainage of the everglades stephens 1956 after this rapid rate subsidence remained constant at 3 cm yr 1 dominated by the oxidation process stephens 1956 stephens and speir 1970 during the past few decades subsidence rates have decreased to 1 45 cm yr 1 shih et al 1998 possible causes for this decrease in subsidence rates include increases in the water table possibly due to best management practices in the mineral content of the soils and in recalcitrant forms of organic carbon c shih et al 1998 galloway et al 1999 the processes that contribute to soil subsidence include oxidation due to organic matter decomposition under aerobic conditions shrinkage which occurs to peats above the water table consolidation below the water table due to the loss of buoyancy compaction due to use of machinery and tillage wind and water erosion and burning stephens et al 1984 pronger et al 2014 shrinkage consolidation and oxidation have been the dominant processes controlling subsidence in the eaa stephens 1956 and stephens et al 1984 showed that subsidence accelerated after installation of water pumps that quickly lowered the water table in the eaa soil subsidence in the eaa is currently dominated by oxidation tate 1980 before drainage eaa soils had limited oxygen availability due to their saturated condition and the resulting low rates of oxygen diffusion in water reddy and delaune 2008 following drainage oxygen became available to aerobic bacteria that decomposes organic matter more rapidly resulting in subsidence due to oxidation stephens and johnson 1951 volk 1973 found that carbon dioxide co2 efflux from eaa soils accounted for 58 73 of the average soil subsidence estimated by field studies with subsidence lines while stephens and speir 1970 found that oxidation losses accounted for 75 of field subsidence estimates higher water tables result in lower subsidence rates stephens and speir 1970 shih et al 1998 furthermore lowering the water table depth by a factor of two in the eaa doubles the subsidence rate snyder et al 1978 increases in bulk density due to compaction and shrinkage increased subsidence rates particularly during the initial years after drainage the estimated bulk density of eaa peats before drainage 0 1 g cm 3 aich et al 2013 doubled 10 years after drainage stephens and johnson 1951 studies in the eaa show that oxidation of these soils is affected by soil temperature with a q10 of 2 knipling et al 1970 volk 1973 where q10 is the factorial increase in decomposition for every 10 c increase in temperature after initial drainage of the eaa the most active type of agricultural production in this area was vegetables which had the largest acreage planted by the 1930s and 1940s snyder and davidson 1994 although vegetables represent a variety of crops a water table of 60 cm below the soil surface was considered the optimum for most vegetables in the eaa snyder et al 1978 sugarcane production in the eaa was initially limited by federal acts that established quotas on sugarcane production for the state in 1942 quotas were suspended due to the second world war and in 1963 soon after the u s suspended sugar imports from cuba sugarcane became the dominant crop in the eaa snyder and davidson 1994 by the 1970s water tables were generally maintained deeper than 60 cm below the surface for sugarcane in the eaa snyder et al 1978 in recent decades the difficulty in maintaining deep drainage due to soil subsidence and the increasing proximity of bedrock has prompted development of sugarcane varieties that can withstand shallower water tables glaz et al 2002 best management practices implemented since 1995 to reduce phosphorus p exports from the eaa include retaining water in the fields daroub et al 2011 which also has produced higher water tables in some fields biomass input may help replenish lost soil organic c however green sugarcane leaves are burned in the field before harvest hence little aboveground harvest residue is incorporated into the soil from 2008 2015 the area under rice cultivation in the eaa increased by 92 bhadha et al 2016 indicating that the area kept flooded during summer when rice is cultivated there is increasing the resulting anaerobic soil conditions slow oxidation soil temperatures in the eaa are affected by the type of crop cultivated with vegetables having higher soil temperatures than sugarcane shih et al 1982 1 2 peatland models browder and volk 1978 developed a mass balance model to study soil subsidence in the eaa they predicted that seasonally varying temperature influenced subsidence the most and suggested that changes in the c composition of peat might not affect its subsidence rates significantly most peatland modeling is based on the study of clymo 1984 whose conceptual model distinguished two components of accumulated peat acrotelm composed of fresh plant biomass that has low bulk density high hydraulic conductivity and lies above the water table most of the year and catotelm which has higher bulk density lower hydraulic conductivity and lies under the water table in clymo s model peat accumulates over the long term as mass moves from the acrotelm to the catotelm and as the catotelm constantly loses material due to decomposition mostly in the form of methane most ca 70 of the mass entering the acrotelm is lost due to decomposition under aerobic conditions clymo suggests that as plant biomass is added to the topsoil mass accumulates until the material loses its integrity and collapses which increases the bulk density and raises the water table if the catotelm is thin the addition of new mass exceeds the losses due to decomposition which causes peat to accumulate however as the peat layer thickens so do total peat losses because decomposition losses are proportional to peat mass ultimately the system reaches a steady state when inputs and outputs are balanced most data on peat accumulation overtime are consistent with a concave profile i e peat accumulates until it reaches a steady state clymo 1984 clymo et al 1998 more recent studies on peatland modeling incorporated new elements for instance frolking et al 2001 developed a model in which decomposition rates decrease with depth and are affected by temperature hilbert et al 2000 developed a model of peatland dynamics that consists of two coupled differential equations that describe the change in peat thickness and the change in water table thus emphasizing interactions between peat and water dynamics more recently frolking et al 2010 merged elements from hilbert et al 2000 and frolking et al 2001 their peat model uses plant functional types to simulate net peat accumulation and peat properties dynamic peat accumulation models have been combined with estimates of wetland extent to predict c accumulation in peat over the holocene kleinen et al 2012 variations in these peat accumulation models show how dynamic they can be and that it is possible to calibrate them for environmental conditions in different places essential components of these peat accumulation models are the existence of two peat layers acrotelm and catotelm and that decomposition losses from peat are proportional to peat mass may be influenced by temperature and proceed at slower rates in the catotelm modifications of these basic model components include the addition of variable water tables hilbert et al 2000 plant functional types frolking et al 2010 and belowground productivity frolking et al 2001 the eaa stores a large amount of c in its peat soils that is currently being released to the atmosphere as co2 greenhouse gas because of subsidence the crops cultivated in the eaa are economically important for the population of southern florida a model of soil subsidence that includes the historic changes in water management and crops as well as soil compaction has not yet been developed for the eaa doing so can highlight key factors that influence subsidence rates and help evaluate management scenarios understanding soil subsidence in the eaa is fundamental to develop soil conservation strategies which is a common goal for all stakeholders the objectives of this study were to 1 apply a model of peat dynamics that can represent accumulation and subsequent subsidence of eaa peats using equations from previous models 2 explore parameter estimation based on data on peat thickness over time 3 identify factors that influenced past and current peat dynamics and assess their relative influence on the subsidence of eaa peats and 4 predict soil subsidence rates under future management scenarios 2 methods we based our model on that of hilbert et al 2000 we selected this model because it allows to relate changes in water tables the main driver of soil subsidence to peat dynamics like clymo 1984 we distinguished the acrotelm and catotelm layers of peat whose decomposition rates were controlled by aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively symbols and parameters used in the model are described in table 1 we aimed to represent and simulate peat accumulation of the entire soil column and subsequent subsidence due to lowering of the water table we expanded the hilbert et al 2000 model by considering compaction of the acrotelm layer and adding an intermediate layer between the acrotelm and catotelm layers that experienced drainage and compaction under lower water tables and was subsequently flooded when water tables were raised the model therefore has three peat layers surface intermediate and deep this expansion may be critical for the eaa since water tables were significantly lowered initially and then raised again in recent decades this modification expanded the hilbert et al 2000 model to five state variables the thickness of the three layers and bulk densities of the surface and intermediate layers the change in thickness of each layer is determined by input of fresh biomass decomposition compaction and by moving the boundaries of the layers 1 d h i d t g i ρ p r i h i c i w i j where the subscript i is the layer surface intermediate or deep h is the thickness of the layer g is input of biomass from plant production with density ρp r is a first order decomposition rate c is compaction and wi j is the depth change as the boundaries move up or down transferring depth i e mass from layer j to layer i plant biomass input enters the topmost layer that has h 0 for example during peat accumulation plant biomass enters the deep peat layer directly because the water table lies at the surface to relate bulk density to the thickness of layers the model calculates the mass balance in each layer 2 d m i d t d ρ i h i d t ρ i d h i d t h i d ρ i d t g i r i ρ i h i w i j ρ i j where m is peat mass in the respective layer with its density ρ ρi j is the bulk density of the material that moves from layer i to j here the bulk density of the originating layer since the surface layer is defined as the depth from the surface to the water table the change in h of that layer equals the water table height change g the reference level of the water table is the soil surface 3 d h s d t g the model calculates compaction of the surface layer as a linear process 4 c k h s ρ s ρ f ρ s where k is the compaction rate ρs the current bulk density and ρf is the final bulk density beyond which no further compaction occurs the aerobic decomposition rate depends on surface temperature which is influenced by vegetation cover using a q10 approach 5 r 1 r 1 0 q ₁ ₀ t s 25 10 where r1 is the acrotelm decomposition rate and r1 0 is the aerobic decomposition rate at the reference temperature 25 c and ts the surface temperature eq 1 4 were then integrated using the following algorithm mass gains losses a determine the layer that receives plant input topmost layer with h 0 b determine loss from respiration in each layer calculate gain loss of thickness in each layer due to moving boundaries wi j a determine prescribed water table changes b determine compaction of the surface layer c determine gain loss in the surface layer by solving eq 1 and 2 for wi j d transfer gains in the surface layer from the intermediate layer and if the intermediate layer is too thin from the deep layer calculate changes in bulk density in the surface and intermediate layers by solving eq 2 for dρ dt the framework was coded using the statistical software r r core team 2017 a conceptual diagram of the model can be seen in fig 1 2 1 parameterization for peat accumulation in the model the water table z0 is considered to be at the surface from the beginning of the simulation 3504 ybp until the initial drainage of the eaa 104 ybp allowing for 3400 years of undisturbed peat accumulation the temperature of the entire column is kept constant at the reference temperature biomass input g is assumed to be dominated by sawgrass from the beginning of peat accumulation until initial drainage to determine the catotelm decomposition rate r2 and the predrainage biomass input g0 we used data from 3420 1210 ybp corrected for recent compaction from mcdowell et al 1969 who carbon dated eaa peats data from 4350 3420 ybp were excluded because it corresponds to an early stage of slow peat accumulation mcdowell et al 1969 there was no peat data from 1210 ybp to the present in mcdowell s study because by the time of their analysis peat accumulated from 1210 ybp to the present had already been lost due to oxidation and subsidence we first attempted to optimize g0 and r2 simultaneously for the peat accumulation phase using r s optim function minimizing the least square difference between model predictions and empirical data the parameters could not be optimized simultaneously however because optimization of one parameter had antagonistic effects on the other based on the nearly linear accumulation of peat in the holocene we suspected that r2 was lower than that in the literature since a higher rate would lead to a plateau thus we arbitrarily set r2 to equal one tenth 1 8 10 5 the rate observed by hu et al 2017 which yielded predictions of linear peat accumulation we then estimated g0 through optimization 2 2 parameterization of subsidence dynamics after the initial drainage in 1914 we assumed that the water table decreased linearly until 1940 as progressive improvements and installation of water pumps lowered water tables stephens and speir 1970 reaching a level 60 cm below the surface which was used mostly by vegetable crops in the eaa izuno 1994 in the model z 0 is kept at 60 cm until 1975 when water table rises to 30 cm representing the predominance of sugarcane in the area izuno 1994 development of sugarcane varieties more tolerant to higher water tables glaz et al 2002 and progressive implementation of best management practices to reduce p export fig 2 we modified soil temperature based on the plant cover that dominated the eaa we assumed that soil temperature was determined by sawgrass reference temperature 25 c from 3504 ybp to 1914 and increased linearly from 1914 to 1940 to a temperature determined by vegetables 28 3 c which provided less shade soil temperature was assumed to remain constant from 1940 to 1975 after which it decreased 26 2 c since it was determined by sugarcane fig 2 differences in soil temperature based on crop cover were based on observations of shih et al 1982 from 1914 1975 biomass input is dominated by input from vegetables which we assumed was 90 lower than that of sugarcane we chose lettuce as the representative vegetable based on a yield of 14 309 kg fresh weight ha 1 for 2010 in the eaa lu and sui 2012 allocation of 30 of biomass to roots jackson and stivers 1993 and a root dry matter proportion of 0 2 murakami et al 2002 we estimated that lettuce added 1 35 t dry weight ha 1yr 1of belowground biomass to the soil which is considerably less compared to our estimated sugarcane inputs from 1975 to the present input was assumed to be dominated by sugarcane particularly belowground sugarcane input was estimated as follows 6

aboveground biomass 1 3 silva olaya et al 2017 and sr is the shoot to root ratio 5 3 silva olaya et al 2017 the result of this calculation 7 29 t dry weight ha 1 yr 1 was converted to g dry weight cm 2 yr 1 and divided by the peat bulk density to obtain sugarcane biomass input table 1 to obtain values for the compaction rate k and aerobic decomposition rate at the reference temperature r1 0 we used least square optimization during the soil subsidence phase the past 100 years the data used for optimization were subsidence rates from previous soil subsidence studies performed in the eaa table 2 the two parameters were optimized simultaneously 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate how changes in model parameters changed predicted rates of soil subsidence we evaluated the following rates to represent different stages of soil subsidence early subsidence 1914 1924 vegetables dominance 1934 1944 sugarcane dominance 1979 1989 current subsidence 2004 2014 and overall subsidence 1914 2014 we doubled or halved the value of each parameter individually and compared the new subsidence rate to that predicted by the original model to test effects of compaction during subsidence we also assessed how inclusion or exclusion of compaction influenced optimized values of the aerobic decomposition rate at base temperature using the akaike information criterion aic 2 4 model use we used the model to predict predrainage peat accumulation peat thickness cm and soil subsidence caused by draining the eaa to predict the impact that changes in z0sug g sug and r 1 0 could produce in soil subsidence in the eaa over the next 50 years based on results from the sensitivity analysis we developed eight scenarios of potential future management practices with associated modification of parameters fig 5 h business as usual sc1 higher 15 cm average annual water table increase z0sug sc2 increased biomass input by adding aboveground sugarcane residue g sug 1 62 cm yr 1

input g0 yielded a value of 0 078 cm yr 1 optimization of the aerobic decomposition rate at base temperature r 1 0 yielded a value of 0 028 yr 1 while optimization of the compaction rate k yielded a value of 0 016 yr 1 using the optimized model peat thickness increased with a slightly concave shape reaching a maximum of 257 cm by 1914 104 ybp fig 3 after drainage in 1914 peat thickness decreased to 60 cm by 2018 fig 4 soil subsidence was predicted to be slow for the first five years after drainage followed by a second steeper linear phase of subsidence until 1975 when the water table was raised and sugarcane became dominant from1975 2018 soil subsidence was slower and linear the model predicted subsidence rates of 0 66 and 0 65 cm yr 1for the past 20 years 1998 2018 and 10 years 2008 2018 respectively 3 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis showed that parameters associated with peat accumulation such as the anaerobic decomposition rate r 2 and the predrainage biomass input g0 had little influence on subsidence rates fig 5 when g0 was halved however the resulting lower peat thickness at initial drainage influenced later soil subsidence stages from 1979 to 2014 reducing subsidence rates fig 4 biomass input from vegetable farming g veg which influenced early subsidence rates 1914 1924 and 1934 1944 had little influence due to its relatively small value thus doubling or halving of its value remained small in absolute terms for early subsidence rates 1914 1979 the most influential parameters were water table depth under vegetables z0veg the compaction parameters k ρp and ρf and the aerobic respiration rate at base temperature r 1 0 for later subsidence rates 1979 1989 the most influential parameters were water table depth under sugarcane z0sug biomass input from sugarcane g sug and the aerobic decomposition rate at base temperature r 1 0 the current rate of soil subsidence 2004 2014 was not influenced by changes in the base respiration rate of the deep layer r 2 and was influenced little by changes in vegetable inputs to the soil g veg fig 5 all other parameters influenced this subsidence rate some by influencing predrainage peat accumulation for instance lower g0 resulted in lower peat thickness at initial drainage which after 100 years would produce a lower subsidence rate some of the influential parameters such as the compaction parameters k ρ p and ρ f cannot be controlled by managers under current conditions however managers could modify three influential parameters g sug r 1 0 and z0sug to improve soil conservation in the eaa when comparing models with and without compaction the model without compaction fit the data similarly to the model with compaction in fact the aic indicated that the model without compaction had slightly better results because of the penalty of two additional parameters table 3 3 3 model use under the business as usual scenario h in which current management did not change peat thickness was predicted to decrease from 61 cm in 2018 to 25 cm in 2068 fig 6 under the scenario in which improved management raised the average annual water table from 30 cm to 15 cm sc1 peat thickness was predicted to increase to 62 cm by 2068 under the scenario with higher biomass input achieved by incorporating aboveground sugarcane residue into the soil sc2 peat thickness was predicted to increase to 72 cm by 2068 under the scenario with lower soil temperatures due to improved cover sc3 peat thickness was predicted to decrease to 28 cm by 2068 thus only slightly higher than that in the business as usual scenario the scenarios that combined the three management strategies had additive effects by combining improved cover with either a higher water table sc5 or higher biomass input sc6 peat thickness was predicted to increase slightly 64 and 74 cm respectively compared to the scenarios of higher water table or higher biomass fig 6 combination of a higher water table and biomass input sc4 increased peat thickness considerably 105 cm by 2068 logically combination of all three management strategies was predicted to increase peat thickness the most 107 cm by 2068 albeit not much higher than that under scenario sc4 4 discussion predrainage peat thickness in the eaa varies with higher peats in the north and lower peats in the south snyder 1994 hohner and dreschel 2015 hohner and dreschel 2015 estimated that eaa peat thickness were generally 3 m and increased up to 4 6 m near lake okeechobee while aich et al 2013 estimated an average peat thickness of 2 63 m for the eaa these differences in peat thickness can be explained in part by differences in bedrock height in the eaa shih et al 1979 hohner and dreschel 2015 the predrainage peat thickness predicted by the optimized model 2 57 m lies within the range of those estimated for the eaa since we optimized parameters to fit estimates of historic peat thickness the optimized anaerobic decomposition rate was too low to yield the concave peat accumulation profile described by clymo et al 1998 the data from mcdowell et al 1969 used to optimize prediction of the peat accumulation phase showed linear accumulation until drainage and thus did not have a concave profile model optimization with these data suggested low decomposition rates of saturated organic matter the mcdowell et al 1969 data however do not have data on the peat that formed after 1200 ybp because peat had already been lost due to subsidence by the time of their study this highlights a limitation of soil subsidence models of drained peatlands the rapid loss of organic soils due to oxidation and the loss of useful information such as their age along with the soils also model optimization yielded a rate of predrainage biomass input g0 0 078 cm yr 1 that was lower than a calculated value of 2 7 cm yr 1 for aboveground and belowground biomass added from sawgrass for the everglades based on measurements of childers et al 2006 and noe and childers 2007 suggesting that only a small fraction of sawgrass biomass was incorporated which may indicate cycles of lower productivity due to climate fluctuations that influenced the everglades region during the peat accumulation phase and or aerobic decomposition of sawgrass residue before the material was incorporated soon after initial drainage of the eaa which was performed first by gravity and then by pumps model predictions indicated lower subsidence rates compared to observations of stephens 1956 who reported accelerated subsidence after pumps were installed in the eaa this difference was due to optimizing the model using field estimates of both the initial rapid subsidence and subsequent slower oxidation subsidence and could potentially be reduced by a more dramatic lowering of the water table initially in the model in fact the optimized model predicted an e folding time of ca 20 years i e peat thickness decreased by a factor of e in 20 years due to accelerated decomposition and compaction the model predicted lower subsidence rates by 1975 due to higher water tables and dominance of sugarcane in the eaa which resulted in higher input from belowground sugarcane biomass however the current 2018 subsidence rate predicted by the model was approximately half that reported by shih et al 1998 and snyder 2005 despite our effort to fit the data this difference may have arisen from assuming a constant 30 cm water table in the model which does not represent the common crop rotations in the eaa that require different water tables such as vegetables rice and sod some assumptions made during model development influenced model predictions the model did not consider topographic variability within the eaa which has been found to be important for predicting peat accumulation at high latitudes kleinen et al 2012 topographic variations in the eaa may produce changes in subsidence patterns as indicated by differences in the influence of parameters as peat depth decreased however the sensitivity analysis suggested that predicted subsidence was relatively insensitive to g0 and r 2 which influence peat thickness during the peat accumulation phase we assumed no climate variability or secular climate drifts short term weather fluctuations do not influence peat accumulation but long term weather fluctuations can do so clymo 1984 frolking et al 2010 although we did not consider climate variability because we assumed constant flooded conditions during peat accumulation use of peat accumulation data during optimization implicitly reflected the net influence of these weather fluctuations on peat accumulation during the soil subsidence phase we assumed a linear lowering of the water table due to continuously increasing drainage from initial drainage 1914 to 1940 and then a constant water depth of 60 cm until 1975 followed by a depth of 30 cm from 1975 2018 although water management in the eaa is efficient the constant water table depths that we assumed did not consider the influence of seasonality or storm events that can generate flooding cycles which can increase oxidation morris et al 2004 miller et al 2012 and consequently change subsidence rates we also assumed a biomass input in the model that may not reflect the diversity of crops cultivated in the eaa crop rotations which have become more common in the eaa in recent decades imply differential water management and input of different types of root biomass to the soil the aerobic decomposition rate at base temperature r 1 0 in the model was a product of optimization while the anaerobic decomposition rate r 2 was a product of optimization for g0 and the use of literature values the ratio of anaerobic to aerobic decomposition rates used in our model was 0 00064 while the model of hilbert et al 2000 used a ratio of 0 1 with an r 1 0 of 0 0025 yr 1 and that of frolking et al 2001 used ratios of 0 1 for fens and 0 025 for bogs higher temperatures at lower latitudes increase peat decomposition rates clymo et al 1998 which could explain why our r 1 0 is higher and our anaerobic to aerobic decomposition rate ratio much smaller than those used in peatland models developed for higher latitudes such as hilbert s and frolking s models since our optimization for r 1 0 used subsidence rates that reflected losses of dissolved c which can be large in the eaa stephens and stewart 1976 the model s aerobic decomposition rate may have been overestimated some models such as that of frolking 2001 differentiate between labile and recalcitrant c most c is currently in the recalcitrant form in the eaa thus higher r 1 0 during initial subsidence stages than during later stages could represent the initial loss of labile c and would generate a higher r 1 0 after optimization excluding compaction from the model yielded an aerobic respiration rate at base temperature r 1 0 that was twice that estimated by the model with compaction and 20 times as high as that for other peatlands from the literature therefore the model with compaction determined more realistic parameters and provided a more complete representation of subsidence as expected the parameters included in the sensitivity analysis influenced the predicted subsidence rate in different ways the parameters that influenced the peat accumulation stage determined peat thickness and thus how much material was vulnerable to subsidence peat thickness does not limit soil losses during initial subsidence stages but can do so in later subsidence stages as seen in the reduction in subsidence rates from 1979 to 2014 when g0 was halved early subsidence is influenced greatly by the conditions experienced after initial drainage as indicated by the influence of parameters such as the water table depth under vegetables z0veg and compaction subsidence rates accelerated and subsequently peaked partly due to further lowering of the water table while the relative influence of oxidation also increased this indicates that early stages of soil subsidence were particularly important to predicted peat thickness because peat was more sensitive to management changes then the results emphasize the importance of rapid mitigation strategies when subsidence begins in order to minimize its long term effects the changes observed in current subsidence rates due to changes in parameters that managers can control such as maintaining shallow water tables and leaving harvest residues in the field show that according to this model current soil subsidence in the eaa can be controlled by management strategies the model predicted that peat thickness would decrease from 60 cm in 2018 to 25 cm in 2068 under a business as usual scenario in such shallow soils farming would face challenges due to higher ph lower nutrient availability and a shallower rooting zone in addition soil c losses would add to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations adding aboveground residue of sugarcane to the soil is the practice that individually could have the most positive effect on soil conservation in this scenario we assumed that all aboveground residue was incorporated into the soil which may not be possible due to the loss of some residue during harvest it also implies harvesting sugarcane without burning off its leaves this scenario may also be optimistic since peat accumulated at a much slower rate historically incorporating sugarcane residue into the soil faces a bigger challenge because it implies harvesting sugarcane without burning it first i e green harvest in the eaa green harvest has been observed to decrease air temperatures 10 cm aboveground when residue is left on the soil however this decrease in temperatures makes subsequent sugarcane crops more vulnerable to freezing events gilbert et al 2010 in the eaa gilbert et al 2010 found that burned harvests produced higher yields than green harvests if harvest occurred early nov jan however green and burned harvests had no significant difference in yield if harvest occurred late in the season feb mar sandhu et al 2017 observed that even though green harvest delayed sugarcane growth compared to burned harvest this delay did not produce differences in yields or sugar content green harvest is considered more sustainable than burned harvest because it reduces soil erosion improves nutrient cycling and increases soil c and nitrogen n ma et al 2014 different strategies can be adopted for the residue left after green harvest viator et al 2009 tested four strategies in louisiana u s shredding application of n stabilizing compounds full incorporation into the soil and burning on the ground a similar approach testing different ways to incorporate green harvest residue into the soil could be beneficial for the eaa the scenario of a higher average annual water table was created to represent either a raising of water tables in association with more flood resistant sugarcane varieties which has been studied in the eaa for water tables 15 cm glaz et al 2002 23 cm glaz and gilbert 2006 and 20 cm deep glaz and morris 2010 or a crop rotation in which soils are flooded for part of the year e g rice cultivation during summer model predictions suggested that this higher water table level stopped subsidence but this represents an ideal situation because a crop rotation may also add less biomass to the soil the increased cover scenario influenced the subsidence rate the least it assumed that soil temperatures could decrease to those of the predrainage period when the eaa was dominated by sawgrass this decrease may be difficult to achieve particularly because harvesting crops removes shade and because of higher mean temperatures due to climate change the combination of these management practices rendered the best results for soil conservation the additive effect of these practices indicates that they can be combined in different ways and to different extents producing an overall net decrease or even partial reversal of subsidence rates higher water tables and increasing biomass input produced the largest decrease in subsidence rates suggesting that any step towards them would reduce subsidence incorporating rice with three months of flooded soils into rotations has already begun in the eaa with rice production increasing in the past decade bhadha et al 2016 tootoonchi et al 2018 in contrast improved cover had little influence in decreasing subsidence the model could be adapted to specific areas within the eaa such as shallow soils by using historic data on peat thickness for these locations during optimization to determine oxidation and compaction parameters also regarding model parameterization since sugarcane root development is influenced by the soil type plant variety and management specific research needs to be performed for the sugarcane varieties in the eaa to determine accurately how much of their root biomass is incorporated into the soil estimation of oxidation rates may be improved further by using a multi pool model that considers different substrate qualities and determining values of r 1 that would vary depending on substrate quality higher for labile c and lower for recalcitrant c however they would be difficult to determine for the eaa due to the loss of most labile c during initial subsidence stages to simulate current subsidence in the eaa it would be useful to add a more dynamic hydrology component that considers the influence of cycles of flooding and draining particularly during the rainy season on oxidation rates rodriguez 2018 doing so would imply representing seasonal and inter annual cycles of water table depth the effects of the fires in the eaa before sugarcane harvest could also be included due to their impacts on the biomass that could be added to the soil and the labile c pool representing fires could also help to understand how alternative management without fire could influence subsidence rates 5 conclusions we used a simple mechanistic model to study peat accumulation and loss in the eaa our modeling and data analysis suggest nearly linear accumulation before drainage and soil subsidence suggesting low anaerobic decomposition rates the analysis further indicates that soil subsidence was initially strongly influenced by compaction with resulting changes in bulk density under the current conditions the main factors influencing soil subsidence in the eaa are the water table level and fresh biomass input which replenishes c in the soil raising water tables and increasing biomass input were predicted to decrease subsidence rates over the next few decades and the substantial effects of these practices should motivate further field based studies biomass input can for instance come from aboveground sugarcane residue while water tables could be raised by more flood tolerant sugarcane varieties or greater cultivation of crops that need flooded conditions such as rice to achieve these changes management practices would need to be adjusted such as transitioning to green sugarcane harvest the soil subsidence model for the eaa can be improved by estimating the biomass input of crops particularly sugarcane to soils more accurately and the potential amount of biomass from residue that can be incorporated adding water table fluctuations at seasonal to inter annual scales could help determine its influence on soil subsidence in the eaa future modeling of drained peatlands should focus on the influence of different c pools at different stages of soil subsidence subsidence caused by loss of dissolved c in drainage and how subsidence is influenced by changes in soil moisture content

24951,development of integrated population models ipms assume the absence of systematic bias in monitoring programs yet many potential sources of systematic bias in monitoring data exist e g under counts of abundance by integrating multiple sources of data we can assess whether various sources of monitoring data provide consistent inferences about changes in population size and thus whether monitoring programs appear unbiased for the purposes of understanding how ipms could provide insights for monitoring programs we used the svalbard breeding population of pink footed goose anser brachyrhynchus as a case study the svalbard pink footed goose is a well studied species the focus of the first adaptive harvest management program in europe and the subject of a variety of long term monitoring programs we examined two formulations of an ipm but ultimately relied on the one that provided a satisfactory fit to all the available data as based on chi squared goodness of fit tests our analyses suggest a negative bias in november counts 20 a negative bias in capture mark recapture estimates of survival 3 and a negative bias in indices of productivity 23 we offer possible explanations for these biases whether the degree of bias seems reasonable considering those explanations and how bias might be investigated directly and ultimately avoided or corrected finally we discuss implications of our work for developing ipms and associated monitoring programs for managing pink footed geese and other waterbird species keywords bias capture mark resight demography integrated population model monitoring pink footed goose 1 introduction integrated population models are increasingly being used to better understand the size and demography of wildlife populations freeman and crick 2003 kéry and schaub 2012 mosnier et al 2015 schaub et al 2007 schaub and abadi 2011 tempel et al 2014 ipms represent an advanced approach to modeling in which all available demographic data are incorporated into a single analysis ipms have many advantages over traditional approaches to modeling including the proper propagation of uncertainty better precision of demographic rates and population size and the ability to handle missing data and estimate latent i e unobserved variables kéry and schaub 2012 schaub and abadi 2011 moreover use of a bayesian estimation framework for ipms provides a natural framework for adaptation in which model parameters can be updated over time based on observations from operational monitoring programs it has also been suggested the ipms could help inform development of monitoring programs because of their ability to integrate multiple sources of data and to estimate parameters that may be occasionally missing from the monitoring streams or else never observed schaub and abadi 2011 importantly however ipms assume the absence of systematic biases in monitoring although random error with zero mean is admissible kéry and schaub 2012 by integrating multiple sources of data we might be able to assess whether various sources of monitoring data provide consistent inferences about changes in population abundance and thus whether monitoring programs appear unbiased many potential sources of systematic bias in monitoring data exist e g under counts of abundance neck band loss leading to an underestimation of survival rates and it seems unrealistic that all monitoring data will deliver bias free estimates thus we wanted to understand if an ipm might suggest whether some monitoring data are inconsistent with other monitoring data implying bias in one or both sources the utility of monitoring data to understand demographic processes is important because the design or redesign of monitoring programs for waterbirds in europe is a high priority reflecting the desire of countries to assure long term conservation and sustainable use of these populations e g https www unep aewa org en document strengthening monitoring migratory waterbirds 2 thus in addition to providing a better understanding of demography to improve conservation efforts we wanted to understand how ipms might help with evaluation of monitoring programs for european waterbirds to that end we used the svalbard breeding population of pink footed goose as a case study madsen et al 1999 this population of pink footed goose migrates through mainland norway and winters in denmark the netherlands and belgium clausen et al 2018 madsen et al 2015 the svalbard pink footed goose is a well studied species the focus of the first adaptive harvest management program in europe and the subject of a variety of long term monitoring programs madsen et al 2017 population models currently in use for managing pink footed geese are based on more traditional approaches to modeling i e whereby demographic processes like mortality and production are modeled independently and then combined and rely on raw uncorrected counts of population size johnson et al 2014 madsen et al 2017 managers believed that development of an ipm for pink footed geese could provide more reliable estimates of population size help identify any limitations in current monitoring protocols and ultimately improve management decisions in particular we were interested in whether estimates of pink footed goose survival and productivity suggested a population trajectory consistent with population counts over the period of record an index to productivity has been relatively constant estimated annual survival has been declining and yet population counts have continued to increase the svalbard population of pink footed geese is relatively small with well defined breeding and wintering ranges so undetected immigration and emigration are unlikely explanations for the apparent discrepancy in population trajectories madsen et al 2014 in what follows we describe the various sources of monitoring data for pink footed geese the development and fitting of ipms and our conclusions concerning possible bias in some monitoring programs we emphasize that our use of the term bias is informal bias is defined as the difference between an estimate and truth but here truth is unknown rather our reference to bias involves the comparison of estimates derived from component data sets and those derived from the ipm using all data in a single analysis our interest was in identifying individual monitoring programs that might deliver biased estimates of demographic parameters we go on to offer possible explanations for these potential sources of monitoring bias whether the degree of bias seems reasonable considering those explanations and how bias might be investigated directly and corrected or avoided based on our results we offer several ideas about using ipms to improve management and to design or redesign monitoring programs for other waterbird species 2 methods 2 1 monitoring data all monitoring data described below and used in this study are publicly available johnson et al 2019 2 1 1 population counts conducted in spring and autumn internationally coordinated population counts of pink footed geese have been performed annually since 1990 in denmark belgium and the netherlands in late october or early november hereafter referred to as the november count madsen et al 1999 over time the population has expanded its distribution and the coverage of the monitoring program has repeatedly been extended to capture new sites occupied by geese madsen et al 2015 since 2005 the population has also been counted in norway and since 2016 in sweden because of increasing challenges in monitoring the population an additional count was introduced in early may in 2010 which has included norway denmark sweden and since 2016 finland madsen et al 2016b the known sites are covered by a network of trained observers who coordinate the coverage counts are conducted in a single day when possible to avoid double counting flocks are either counted when they are leaving roost sites in the morning arriving at roost sites in the evening or in norway when the roost is in the middle of the day or during daytime when geese are in fields to forage additional but sporadic information is available from internet reporting portals where birdwatchers report flocks in areas outside the main areas madsen et al 2016a we assumed that the november and may counts pertain to the same population of birds 2 1 2 harvest estimates pink footed geese are subject to an open hunting season in norway 10 august to 23 december including svalbard 20 august to 31 october http www miljodirektoratet no no tjenester og verktoy nettsted jakttider they are also subject to hunting in denmark 1 september to 31 december on land for marine environments outside the high water line until 15 january since 2011 the hunting season has been open in both environments until 31 january with the exception of 2015 http fauna au dk jagt og vildtforvaltning jagttidsrevision fugle kortnaebbet gaas the species is protected in the netherlands belgium sweden and finland in both norway and denmark reporting the harvest is mandatory and hunters report their harvests online in norway the mandatory species specific harvest is compiled by statistics norway www ssb no where data are available from 1992 onward in denmark harvest has been compiled in the national hunting bag statistics since 1941 http fauna au dk en hunting and game management bag statistics statistics online since 1941 however prior to 2006 hunters only reported number of individuals shot by groups e g geese and estimates of species specific harvests were obtained using the relative species distribution in a national wing survey which has been operating since 1982 http fauna au dk en hunting and game management wing survey 2 1 3 temporal distribution of harvest in denmark the november count occurs after the start of hunting seasons in norway and denmark and so it was important to be able to partition harvest into that occurring before and after the count we assume all of the harvest in norway occurs prior to the november count most pink footed geese have left mainland norway by mid november either due to excessive disturbance or cold conditions and the majority are shot from late september to late october gundersen et al 2017 jensen et al 2016 the temporal distribution of the pink footed goose harvest in denmark was derived from wings submitted to the danish wing survey http fauna au dk en hunting and game management wing survey danish hunters voluntarily submit wings from harvested individuals providing information on date location and age of harvested geese annual sample sizes in the 1991 2018 period varied between 8 and 433 with an average of 114 wings 2 1 4 proportion of young in the autumn based on age specific plumage characteristics random counts of the number of young of the year and of older geese in flocks have been conducted by trained observers every autumn in the netherlands and denmark since 1980 madsen 1982 madsen et al 1999 we used only counts occurring between october 12 and november 4 inclusive to minimize the effect of seasonal changes in age ratios for each year we aggregated counts of both young and adults by the day of observation and then treated the proportions of young as replicate samples this allowed us to account for variation in the observed proportion of young within a year due to variation in day and locale of the counts 2 1 5 annual survival rates estimates of annual survival rate were available from an update of work by madsen et al 2002 conducted by two of us mf kc we chose not to embed what is a complicated survival rate analysis in an already complex ipm but rather used the estimates and sample variances to generate prior distributions for annual survival during the period 1990 2018 4938 pink footed geese were captured and fitted with neck bands and tarsus metal rings during spring staging in denmark and norway and in four years on the svalbard breeding grounds resightings were made by a network of professional and volunteer observers outside the breeding grounds september may all marking and resighting data were stored in the online database maintained by www geese org annual survival was estimated with program mark white and burnham 1999 using a burnham model for combined dead recoveries and live encounter histories burnham 1993 encounter histories were based on an observation window from march 23 may 22 and because neck collared individuals were generally seen several times during this period only birds with at least two sightings within the observation window were included as positive observations this ensured that the influence of resighting errors was kept to a minimum eliminating some recaptures lowers the recapture probability of course but it does not affect the accuracy of the estimates and in our case the recapture probabilities were so high that the effect on precision was marginal observations of pink footed geese n 395 543 were extracted from www geese org information on dead recoveries n 440 was provided by the ringing centers in denmark natural history museum of denmark and norway stavanger museum dead recoveries are reported by members of the public to the ringing centers involved in denmark and norway they are unsolicited and can occur throughout the annual range of the population although in practice some spatial variation in recovery and reporting probabilities can be expected due to e g variation in human population density they include both geese reported shot by hunters and those found dead by other members of the public the recovery process thus corresponds well with the assumptions of the burnham 1993 model using program mark we fit a variety of models with various constraints on survival resighting probability and recovery probability these models were evaluated using aicc burnham and anderson 2003 and estimates of annual survival from the best performing model were used survival estimates were generally consistent across the different models but the best performing model included annual variation in survival and resighting probability and a constant recovery probability and fidelity parameter δaicc to nearest model 3 0 we omitted the last survival estimate in the time series due to identifiability issues 2 1 6 capture mark resight estimates of population size the neck collar data used to estimate survival can also be used to derive a capture mark resight estimate of pink footed goose population size n by dividing the number of marked geese in the population m by the ratio of the number of marked geese to the number of geese screened r sheaffer and jarvis 1995 n m r this approach was used by clausen et al 2019 to derive estimates of pink footed goose population size in spring m was estimated from the number of marked birds seen alive in any given year corrected for annual variation in detection probability and r was estimated as the average of the ratios from observations of marked individuals in screened flocks the variance of n was approximated using the delta method rice 1988 assuming no covariance between r and m a detailed description of the approach is given by clausen et al 2019 2 2 population dynamics annual

is the harvest rate of adults in denmark prior to november the set of difference equations for may and november population size are based on the following assumptions a natural mortality and reproduction are time dependent b natural mortality is evenly distributed throughout the year in spite of evidence that there may be some minor seasonal differences madsen et al 2002 and natural mortality is the same for all birds that have survived at least one hunting season francis et al 1992 c hunting seasons in september and october in norway and denmark expose a common group of birds to harvest i e harvest does not occur sequentially but simultaneously d young are more vulnerable to harvest than older birds and this rate of differential vulnerability is constant e the rate of crippling loss has changed over time as reflected in the number of young carrying embedded shot clausen et al 2017b f hunters report only retrieved harvest and g harvest mortality is additive to natural mortality 2 3 integrated population model here we describe the likelihood of the various data sets given the model of population dynamics and the prior distributions of parameters to be estimated assuming independence of the individual data sets the joint likelihood of all the data is simply the product of the individual data likelihoods kéry and schaub 2012 we also describe different formulations of the ipm used to investigate potential biases in monitoring data 2 3 1 data likelihoods and prior distributions the likelihood of may counts assumes that counts are distributed log normal with mean log n t m and a proportionally constant variance σ m 2 c t m log normal log n t m σ m 2 where c t m is the log count of pink footed geese in may we assumed an uninformative prior for precision τ m 1 σ m 2 gamma 0 001 0 001 we expressed counts in thousands of birds rounded to the nearest thousand for estimates of may population size based on capture mark resight cmr data we assumed the cmr estimates were distributed log normal with mean log n t m and constant proportional variance σ c m r 2 c t c m r log normal log n t m σ c m r 2 the variance σ c m r 2 is a residual variance incorporating both the sampling error of the estimates as well as lack of fit of the state equations kéry and schaub 2012 117 we expressed the cmr estimates in thousands of birds rounded to the nearest thousand we omitted the may 1999 estimate because it was based on a single observation of a marked bird similar to the may counts the likelihood of november counts assumes that counts are distributed log normal but with mean log n t n β and constant proportional variance σ n 2 c t n log normal log n t n β σ n 2 where c t n is the log count of pink footed geese in november and β is a parameter expressing potential negative bias in the november counts we assumed an uninformative prior for precision τ m 1 σ n 2 gamma 0 001 0 001 we included a bias parameter because november counts were generally similar or less than counts in the subsequent may fig 1 this is not biologically feasible because only mortality and no reproduction occurs between november and may we decided to assume bias in the november counts rather than the may counts because the may counts and may cmr estimates are quite similar clausen et al 2019 we assumed a vague prior for the bias parameter β uniform 0 5 1 0 again we expressed counts in thousands of birds rounded to the nearest thousand the likelihood of the harvest in denmark prior to november i e the number of danish wings received with a pre november harvest date w t was described as the outcome of a binomial variable w t binomial α t w t where w t was the total number of wings received during the danish hunting season and α t h t d h t d where α t is the proportion of the total denmark harvest occurring prior to the november count we described the likelihood of the number of young observed in autumn p t as a beta binomial distribution bolker 2008 to account for over dispersion in the counts i e counts of young within a year varied by date and locale p t beta binomial ω ψ t ω 1 ψ t p t where ω is a constant over dispersion parameter ψ is the proportion of young p t is the total number of individuals tallied young older birds and ψ t r t 1 v h t n h t d 1 h t n h t d r t 1 v h t n h t d we specified a prior distribution ω gamma μ 2 σ μ σ where u 185 and σ 148 the prior distribution for ω was derived by first taking the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of young within each year the year specific means and standard deviations were then used to fit year specific beta distributions beta a b for the proportion of young using the method of moments the year specific estimates of over dispersion were the sum of the parameters of the beta distribution bolker 2008 we then used these year specific estimates of over dispersion to calculate u 185 and σ 148 we thus assumed temporally constant over dispersion with an informative prior finally we specified the likelihoods of observed harvest in norway and denmark as h t n poisson λ t n h t d poisson λ t d respectively where λ t n h t n n t m θ 4 12 1 v r t λ t d h t d n t m θ 4 12 1 v r t we expressed harvests in hundreds of birds rounded to the nearest hundred this effectively allowed for greater sampling variability which was unmeasured in reported harvests not in terms of the variance but in terms of the coefficient of variation for other parameters to be estimated we specified the following prior distributions θ t beta 49 7 r t uniform 0 1 h t n uniform 0 0 3 h t d uniform 0 0 3 h t d uniform 0 0 3 v gamma μ 2 σ μ σ with μ 2 2 σ 0 3 n 1 m log normal 3 23 0 64 the prior distributions for natural survival were derived based on the allometric relationships described by johnson et al 2012 and a female mass of 2520 g sd 270 g dunning 2008 and age at first breeding of three years we used vague prior distributions for r t h t n h t d and h t d but constrained their values to biologically realistic bounds the informative prior distribution for the differential vulnerability of young to harvest was based on the work of clausen et al 2017a supplemented by two additional years of data the prior distribution for the first population size in may 1992 was specified using the corresponding cmr estimate based on the findings of clausen et al 2017b we modeled the rate of crippling loss c t as an exponentially declining trend over time c t c δ t 1 where c was the crippling rate prior to campaigns to reduce crippling loss and δ is the exponential rate of decay based on clausen et al 2017b and with additional years of data we defined an informative prior as δ beta 387 32 using the method of moments for the crippling rate at the beginning of the timeframe we used a prior based on field observations by one of us jm of retrieved and un retrieved harvests of pink footed geese by hunters in 1996 and 1997 prior to the campaigns to reduce crippling loss c beta 8 31 in one model we used the cmr estimates of annual survival as prior distributions although not in the model including the cmr estimates of may population size as this would seriously violate the assumption of independent data sets abadi et al 2010 to specify prior distributions for annual survival we used the cmr estimates and their sample variances inflated by the most conservative estimate of c hat from program mark http www phidot org software mark docs book page 5 26 and then estimated the parameters of associated beta distributions using the method of moments 2 3 2 model formulations and fitting we relied on two basic formulations of the ipm one in which we used the cmr estimates of annual survival as priors but not the cmr estimates of may population size referred to as model s and one in which we used the cmr estimates of population size but not the cmr estimates of annual survival referred to as model p in which annual survival was a derived parameter s t θ t 1 k t again this was to avoid the potential for parameter bias resulting from non independence of the two cmr based data sets although ipms are typically constructed from raw data the use of estimates from previous analyses of component data is acceptable arnold et al 2018 indeed a strength of a bayesian estimation framework for ipms is the ability to use results from prior studies which is sometimes necessary due to problems of parameter identifiability kéry and schaub 2012 to fit the ipms we used jags 4 3 0 plummer 2003 run in the r computing environment r core team 2018 using runjags denwood 2016 r code for the two models is provided as supplementary material for each model we used three chains of 120 000 iterations each and retained the last 20 000 samples from each chain for analysis we assessed parameter convergence using the potential scale reduction factor psrf gelman and rubin 1992 and assumed values of psrf 1 1 indicated parameter convergence gelman and hill 2006 we note that the fitted ipms include 350 estimated parameters which is greater than the number of data points however it is often sensible to fit hierarchical models with more parameters than there are data points and overfitting is much less concern with reasonable prior distributions such as those in hierarchical models gelman et al 2004 unless otherwise noted we report the medians and 95 credible intervals of posterior estimates no widely accepted goodness of fit tests or model selection tests exist for ipms schaub and abadi 2011 although this is an active area of research hooten and hobbs 2015 we followed the recommendation of kéry and schaub 2012 and used chi squared goodness of fit tests for the individual data sets assuming that adequate fit of all the data sets implied a good fit of the ipm chi squared statistics were calculated by first generating mcmc samples of expectations for the data then a distribution of chi squared statistics and p values were calculated by comparing expectations with the actual data we report the medians of those distributions to evaluate apparent bias in survival and productivity estimates we regressed the data based estimates cmr estimates for survival observed proportion of young in autumn for productivity against their corresponding posterior estimates assuming an intercept of zero using this formulation the average bias is equal to 1 regression coefficient we also checked for a temporal trend in the bias of november counts by fitting an exponential model to the bias within the ipm y a e b t where bias 1 y and t year 3 results convergence of all parameter estimates was achieved for both models model s psrf 1 007 model p psrf 1 005 model s did a reasonable job of fitting the data p 0 27 except for the counts of young birds in autumn p 0 01 table 1 not surprisingly model s fit the estimates of annual survival well because they were used as informative priors p 0 99 however posterior estimates of may population size did not correspond well with the cmr estimates p 0 01 recognizing of course that they were not used in model s in contrast model p fit all the data sets well even the estimates of annual survival which were not used in the model p 0 59 model p also provided much smaller credible intervals for population size than did model s figs 2 and 3 also in model s the credible intervals for population size increase dramatically over the time frame recall that in model s there are no cmr estimates of population size thus the model is attempting to reconcile the demographic information with only the november counts which seem to be a biased estimate of population size and only nine may counts in this case the demographic information tends to dominate the joint likelihood as compared to model p in which the may cmr estimates have a strong influence on the joint likelihood the discordance between counts and demographic information in model s produces increasing credible intervals for population size due to the serial correlation in the state equations we also found differences between models s and p in posterior estimates of the fixed parameters of interest for example the parameter for bias in the november count had a posterior median of 0 93 0 86 1 00 indicative of a 7 bias in model s but a posterior median of 0 80 0 75 0 84 indicative of a 20 bias in model p fig 4 the apparent truncation of the distribution to 1 in fig 4 results from the strong influence of the demographic information on the joint likelihood which suggests that the population size particularly in later years is lower than that indicated by the november counts differential vulnerability of young had a relatively low posterior median of 1 75 1 47 2 04 in model s and a posterior median of 2 08 1 76 2 42 in model p fig 5 finally in model s the base crippling rate had a relatively high posterior median of 0 47 0 27 0 66 suggesting in the initial years of the timeframe that crippling loss was nearly as high as the retrieved harvest fig 6 in contrast model p produced a more realistic median crippling rate of 0 24 0 12 0 38 both models produced similar estimates of the exponential rate of decline in crippling rate over time model s median 0 94 0 92 0 96 model p median 0 92 0 90 0 95 both model s and model p suggested bias in the cmr estimates of survival rate and the observed proportion of young in autumn for survival estimates the bias was relatively small at about 3 model s median 0 97 se 0 005 model p median 0 97 se 0 013 fig 7 for the observed proportion of young the apparent bias was relatively large suggesting that over 20 of young in autumn are misidentified as adults model s median 0 74 se 0 024 model p median 0 77 se 0 018 fig 8 we examined the question of whether the apparent bias in survival and productivity may have changed over time in both cases the ratios of posterior to either the priors for survival or the data proportion of young increased over time this was true of both model s and model p although only the results from model p are depicted in fig 9 it should be noted that the increasing trend in apparent bias of productivity was heavily influenced by the first five years of the timeframe finally we note that model p provided only weak evidence of a temporal trend in bias in the november count for an exponential trend the posterior slope coefficient was 0 001 0 000 0 003 4 discussion svalbard pink footed geese are well monitored and studied and development of an ipm has contributed insights into the veracity of estimates of demographic parameters and their impact on population development we believe model p likely provides the best representation of the pink footed goose population as it provides posterior estimates similar to those derived from the individual data sets as well as estimates that agree well with the published literature that relies on more traditional modeling approaches using model p posterior medians of survival from natural causes were relatively constant with mean 0 92 sd 0 01 which is similar to the findings of johnson et al 2014 fig 10 posterior estimates of adult kill rate ranged from 0 04 0 03 0 06 to 0 13 0 11 0 16 and are similar in both magnitude and temporal trend to those reported by clausen et al 2017a posterior estimates of country specific kill rates suggest that most of the overall increase in kill rate in recent years is attributed to increasing harvest pressure in denmark a finding also consistent with clausen et al 2017a fig 11 with respect to productivity model p produced posterior estimates of preseason age ratio that were variable over time mean 0 22 sd 0 10 but suggested that on average young constitute about 18 of the population just prior to the hunting season fig 12 posterior estimates of the preseason age ratio also appeared to correlate well with the number of days above freezing in may on the breeding grounds in svalbard especially after 2005 a finding in accord with jensen et al 2014 and johnson et al 2014 our results suggest that population size of svalbard pink footed geese may have stabilized recently or at least is not increasing as rapidly as in the past this apparent stabilization is in keeping with declining survival rates that have accompanied an increase in kill rate most of the recent increase in kill rate is attributable to an increase of hunting pressure in denmark where the birds are staying longer in winter and where efforts have been made to increase the harvest to slow population growth clausen et al 2018 madsen et al 2016a in contrast productivity as estimated by the preseason age ratio has been increasing for much of the last 15 years apparently in response to the warming climate in svalbard piskozub 2017 may of 2018 was the warmest may in at least the last 50 years 27 days with mean temperature above freezing whether continued warming will further enhance productivity of pink footed geese is unknown as continued warming is likely to have ecological impacts far beyond decreasing snow cover which is the principal benefit now because it provides an abundance of snow free nesting sites jensen et al 2014 we also note that the ipm uses all available demographic data to provide estimates of population size with accompanying measures of precision at two times during the annual cycle the current adaptive harvest management framework relies on a single count to set harvest quotas and in may 2015 the count suggested that harvest restrictions were warranted madsen et al 2017 denmark restricted its hunting season despite the suspicion that the count was biased low a suspicion confirmed by the following count and by our analyses here an ipm estimates population size based on all available abundance and demographic data with the added benefit that managers can account for the sampling and process error of abundance in the optimization of harvest quotas sethi et al 2005 we suggest that model p perhaps with further development might be an acceptable substitute for the current population models which have been poor predictors of population abundance in recent years for managing the harvest of pink footed geese https egmp aewa info sites default files meeting files documents aewa egm iwg 3 9 pfg 20ahm 20report 202018 formatted final 0 pdf an important consideration in doing so would be the potential addition of covariates to explain annual variation in reproduction and or natural mortality with the covariates themselves described by dynamic models thus future population sizes and their attendant uncertainty could be predicted both as a function of these environmental covariates and harvest levels important findings of this study relate to potential biases in monitoring instruments ipms cannot correct for bias without ancillary data which if present can lead to spurious conclusions regarding demography and abundance kéry and schaub 2012 with pink footed geese we had the advantage of having a diversity of long term monitoring data that could be used to ascertain whether different data sets were telling a consistent story if a suggestion of bias exists there are two possibilities 1 the ipm is mis specified as it does not include all relevant processes e g there is immigration but this is not included in the model riecke et al 2019 2 the data sets are from a biased monitoring program or the models to analyze them do not account for bias e g neck band loss that is not modeled we thus strongly emphasize that our inferences are dependent on the structure of the state model we specified for pink footed geese there could be invalid assumptions e g the rate of natural mortality is constant throughout the year or key structural components of demography missing perhaps a good candidate for missing demographic structure is additional age specificity in mortality or reproductive rates we noted earlier that this is unlikely to be a strong concern because we observe the proportion of young in the autumn and include significant age specificity in harvest mortality significant permanent or temporary immigration or emigration would be cause for concern but large undetected movements seem unlikely given the restricted range of this population and monitoring that occurs throughout the annual cycle plus omnibus goose monitoring that occurs outside the known range of pink footed geese madsen et al 2016a 1999 assuming model structure is approximately correct both models suggested about the same magnitude of bias in cmr estimates of survival 3 and in the observed proportion of young in autumn 23 to 26 cmr estimates of survival are often biased low for several reasons permanent emigration from a limited study area is the most common source of bias but given that neck banded pink footed geese are observed throughout their known wintering range this issue is probably of minor importance neckband loss and resighting heterogeneity are other common causes of negative bias but the inclusion of dead recoveries in our survival analysis should to some extent compensate for these effects frederiksen 2014 frederiksen and bregnballe 2000 one remaining potential source of bias is a direct effect of neckbands on survival such effects have been found to be important in several experimental studies in north america alisauskas et al 2006 alisauskas and lindberg 2002 caswell et al 2012 but no similar studies have been carried out in europe to date analyses of non experimental data on neck banded and leg banded pink footed geese respectively in the uk iceland flyway indicate a substantial negative effect of neckbands on survival on the order of 3 5 m frederiksen unpubl data a negative bias in the estimates for the svalbard flyway population which are based largely on neck banded individuals is therefore not unexpected in future marking operations it would be useful to randomly assign neckbands or leg bands to captured geese to directly assess impacts on survival we cannot now explain the suggestion of a serious negative bias in the proportion of young the age counts are carried out by experienced observers along the flyway in autumn during a fixed interval of time at least two sources of bias could be addressed in future studies first discriminating juveniles from older geese becomes increasingly difficult during autumn because juveniles gradually molt covert feathers second families often segregate from large goose flocks madsen 2010 thus there is a risk of an underrepresentation of juveniles if observers focus their sampling on larger flocks model p also suggests that the apparent bias in data based estimates of annual survival and productivity may have increased over time the mean bias in cmr estimates of survival about 3 might be explained by neck band loss clausen et al 2015 the apparent trend in survival bias over time is more difficult to explain but could in part be due to heterogeneity in resighting rates which can produce more severe bias in cmr estimates toward the end of the study period kéry et al 2006 the increasing trend in apparent productivity bias seems to be driven largely by the first few years in the time frame however a possible explanation for a temporal trend in bias involves the recognition that successful breeders with young migrate later than non breeders and families have been observed leaving svalbard later with increasing summer temperatures gundersen et al 2017 j madsen personal observation it s at least possible that adults with young are increasingly absent from the autumn counts of young our results also suggest a negative bias of 20 in november counts although ipms can account for random error in counts they cannot account for systematic bias e g imperfect detection without additional information kéry and schaub 2012 had we only used november counts we would not have been able to estimate the bias in this estimate of november population size although this would not have affected the estimates of demographic parameters nor population trajectory if the bias was relatively constant only the inclusion of may counts and cmr population estimates along with the temporal partitioning of the harvest allowed us to estimate the negative bias in november counts a negative bias was anticipated because increasing numbers of pink footed geese have been using areas not covered in the traditional november count madsen et al 2015 this was the principal reason that counts in may were initiated in 2010 during may pink footed geese are more confined to well defined staging areas in scandinavia and therefore under counts are probably less likely although there is good correspondence between may counts and cmr estimates of population size counts in may might also be negatively biased if resighting heterogeneity is producing a negative bias in the cmr estimates we emphasize that much more needs to be done to understand how ipms can help inform the development and implementation of monitoring protocols schaub and abadi 2011 but see lahoz monfort et al 2014 considering the calls for harvesting practices that are demonstrably sustainable for european waterbirds at least a rudimentary level of monitoring is necessary population size and harvest at a minimum often other monitoring protocols are available or contemplated but additional monitoring comes at a cost harvest management thus involves a tradeoff between meeting the objectives of harvest management e g sustainability population control and the cost of maintaining various monitoring activities these tradeoffs can be investigated using an ipm a markov decision process marescot et al 2013 and the concept of pareto efficiency kennedy et al 2007 the idea would be to construct an ipm with all available data and then either omit some of the available data or simulate new data and re fit the ipm then the expected management performance could be compared between those cases with more data and those with less data such an approach would help managers decide whether the benefits of improved management are worth the costs of more monitoring for european waterbirds monitoring data are often limited to counts possibly at multiple times of the year with little or no information on annual harvests survival or productivity we emphasize however that in these cases it may still be possible to construct a prototype ipm using demographic information from similar species or by relying on allometric relationships and studies of captive reared birds johnson et al 2018 these models can be updated and latent parameters estimated as additional monitoring or research information becomes available in addition to gaining a better understanding of population demography ipms offer exciting opportunities for guiding conservation efforts especially harvest management for example adaptive harvest management can be an effective tool for dealing with demographic and other sources of uncertainty but traditionally has involved a small set of discrete models representing various hypotheses about how the population will respond to conservation actions johnson 2011 johnson et al 2014 belief weights representing the relative confidence in the discrete models are updated each year using a comparison of observed and predicted population sizes parameter values of the individual models are fixed however in contrast a single ipm can represent a generalized model of population dynamics i e one that admits various hypotheses as special cases e g conroy et al 2002 the joint distribution of all model parameters can then be updated each year using all available monitoring data the posterior distribution of model parameters can be used to derive an optimal harvest strategy using stochastic dynamic programming marescot et al 2013 the optimal harvest strategy can also account for other sources of uncertainty including environmental variation imprecise control over harvest levels partial controllability and imprecise population estimates partial observability by updating the ipm periodically the associated harvest strategy can evolve over time in the spirit of adaptive management credit authorship contribution statement fred a johnson

24951,development of integrated population models ipms assume the absence of systematic bias in monitoring programs yet many potential sources of systematic bias in monitoring data exist e g under counts of abundance by integrating multiple sources of data we can assess whether various sources of monitoring data provide consistent inferences about changes in population size and thus whether monitoring programs appear unbiased for the purposes of understanding how ipms could provide insights for monitoring programs we used the svalbard breeding population of pink footed goose anser brachyrhynchus as a case study the svalbard pink footed goose is a well studied species the focus of the first adaptive harvest management program in europe and the subject of a variety of long term monitoring programs we examined two formulations of an ipm but ultimately relied on the one that provided a satisfactory fit to all the available data as based on chi squared goodness of fit tests our analyses suggest a negative bias in november counts 20 a negative bias in capture mark recapture estimates of survival 3 and a negative bias in indices of productivity 23 we offer possible explanations for these biases whether the degree of bias seems reasonable considering those explanations and how bias might be investigated directly and ultimately avoided or corrected finally we discuss implications of our work for developing ipms and associated monitoring programs for managing pink footed geese and other waterbird species keywords bias capture mark resight demography integrated population model monitoring pink footed goose 1 introduction integrated population models are increasingly being used to better understand the size and demography of wildlife populations freeman and crick 2003 kéry and schaub 2012 mosnier et al 2015 schaub et al 2007 schaub and abadi 2011 tempel et al 2014 ipms represent an advanced approach to modeling in which all available demographic data are incorporated into a single analysis ipms have many advantages over traditional approaches to modeling including the proper propagation of uncertainty better precision of demographic rates and population size and the ability to handle missing data and estimate latent i e unobserved variables kéry and schaub 2012 schaub and abadi 2011 moreover use of a bayesian estimation framework for ipms provides a natural framework for adaptation in which model parameters can be updated over time based on observations from operational monitoring programs it has also been suggested the ipms could help inform development of monitoring programs because of their ability to integrate multiple sources of data and to estimate parameters that may be occasionally missing from the monitoring streams or else never observed schaub and abadi 2011 importantly however ipms assume the absence of systematic biases in monitoring although random error with zero mean is admissible kéry and schaub 2012 by integrating multiple sources of data we might be able to assess whether various sources of monitoring data provide consistent inferences about changes in population abundance and thus whether monitoring programs appear unbiased many potential sources of systematic bias in monitoring data exist e g under counts of abundance neck band loss leading to an underestimation of survival rates and it seems unrealistic that all monitoring data will deliver bias free estimates thus we wanted to understand if an ipm might suggest whether some monitoring data are inconsistent with other monitoring data implying bias in one or both sources the utility of monitoring data to understand demographic processes is important because the design or redesign of monitoring programs for waterbirds in europe is a high priority reflecting the desire of countries to assure long term conservation and sustainable use of these populations e g https www unep aewa org en document strengthening monitoring migratory waterbirds 2 thus in addition to providing a better understanding of demography to improve conservation efforts we wanted to understand how ipms might help with evaluation of monitoring programs for european waterbirds to that end we used the svalbard breeding population of pink footed goose as a case study madsen et al 1999 this population of pink footed goose migrates through mainland norway and winters in denmark the netherlands and belgium clausen et al 2018 madsen et al 2015 the svalbard pink footed goose is a well studied species the focus of the first adaptive harvest management program in europe and the subject of a variety of long term monitoring programs madsen et al 2017 population models currently in use for managing pink footed geese are based on more traditional approaches to modeling i e whereby demographic processes like mortality and production are modeled independently and then combined and rely on raw uncorrected counts of population size johnson et al 2014 madsen et al 2017 managers believed that development of an ipm for pink footed geese could provide more reliable estimates of population size help identify any limitations in current monitoring protocols and ultimately improve management decisions in particular we were interested in whether estimates of pink footed goose survival and productivity suggested a population trajectory consistent with population counts over the period of record an index to productivity has been relatively constant estimated annual survival has been declining and yet population counts have continued to increase the svalbard population of pink footed geese is relatively small with well defined breeding and wintering ranges so undetected immigration and emigration are unlikely explanations for the apparent discrepancy in population trajectories madsen et al 2014 in what follows we describe the various sources of monitoring data for pink footed geese the development and fitting of ipms and our conclusions concerning possible bias in some monitoring programs we emphasize that our use of the term bias is informal bias is defined as the difference between an estimate and truth but here truth is unknown rather our reference to bias involves the comparison of estimates derived from component data sets and those derived from the ipm using all data in a single analysis our interest was in identifying individual monitoring programs that might deliver biased estimates of demographic parameters we go on to offer possible explanations for these potential sources of monitoring bias whether the degree of bias seems reasonable considering those explanations and how bias might be investigated directly and corrected or avoided based on our results we offer several ideas about using ipms to improve management and to design or redesign monitoring programs for other waterbird species 2 methods 2 1 monitoring data all monitoring data described below and used in this study are publicly available johnson et al 2019 2 1 1 population counts conducted in spring and autumn internationally coordinated population counts of pink footed geese have been performed annually since 1990 in denmark belgium and the netherlands in late october or early november hereafter referred to as the november count madsen et al 1999 over time the population has expanded its distribution and the coverage of the monitoring program has repeatedly been extended to capture new sites occupied by geese madsen et al 2015 since 2005 the population has also been counted in norway and since 2016 in sweden because of increasing challenges in monitoring the population an additional count was introduced in early may in 2010 which has included norway denmark sweden and since 2016 finland madsen et al 2016b the known sites are covered by a network of trained observers who coordinate the coverage counts are conducted in a single day when possible to avoid double counting flocks are either counted when they are leaving roost sites in the morning arriving at roost sites in the evening or in norway when the roost is in the middle of the day or during daytime when geese are in fields to forage additional but sporadic information is available from internet reporting portals where birdwatchers report flocks in areas outside the main areas madsen et al 2016a we assumed that the november and may counts pertain to the same population of birds 2 1 2 harvest estimates pink footed geese are subject to an open hunting season in norway 10 august to 23 december including svalbard 20 august to 31 october http www miljodirektoratet no no tjenester og verktoy nettsted jakttider they are also subject to hunting in denmark 1 september to 31 december on land for marine environments outside the high water line until 15 january since 2011 the hunting season has been open in both environments until 31 january with the exception of 2015 http fauna au dk jagt og vildtforvaltning jagttidsrevision fugle kortnaebbet gaas the species is protected in the netherlands belgium sweden and finland in both norway and denmark reporting the harvest is mandatory and hunters report their harvests online in norway the mandatory species specific harvest is compiled by statistics norway www ssb no where data are available from 1992 onward in denmark harvest has been compiled in the national hunting bag statistics since 1941 http fauna au dk en hunting and game management bag statistics statistics online since 1941 however prior to 2006 hunters only reported number of individuals shot by groups e g geese and estimates of species specific harvests were obtained using the relative species distribution in a national wing survey which has been operating since 1982 http fauna au dk en hunting and game management wing survey 2 1 3 temporal distribution of harvest in denmark the november count occurs after the start of hunting seasons in norway and denmark and so it was important to be able to partition harvest into that occurring before and after the count we assume all of the harvest in norway occurs prior to the november count most pink footed geese have left mainland norway by mid november either due to excessive disturbance or cold conditions and the majority are shot from late september to late october gundersen et al 2017 jensen et al 2016 the temporal distribution of the pink footed goose harvest in denmark was derived from wings submitted to the danish wing survey http fauna au dk en hunting and game management wing survey danish hunters voluntarily submit wings from harvested individuals providing information on date location and age of harvested geese annual sample sizes in the 1991 2018 period varied between 8 and 433 with an average of 114 wings 2 1 4 proportion of young in the autumn based on age specific plumage characteristics random counts of the number of young of the year and of older geese in flocks have been conducted by trained observers every autumn in the netherlands and denmark since 1980 madsen 1982 madsen et al 1999 we used only counts occurring between october 12 and november 4 inclusive to minimize the effect of seasonal changes in age ratios for each year we aggregated counts of both young and adults by the day of observation and then treated the proportions of young as replicate samples this allowed us to account for variation in the observed proportion of young within a year due to variation in day and locale of the counts 2 1 5 annual survival rates estimates of annual survival rate were available from an update of work by madsen et al 2002 conducted by two of us mf kc we chose not to embed what is a complicated survival rate analysis in an already complex ipm but rather used the estimates and sample variances to generate prior distributions for annual survival during the period 1990 2018 4938 pink footed geese were captured and fitted with neck bands and tarsus metal rings during spring staging in denmark and norway and in four years on the svalbard breeding grounds resightings were made by a network of professional and volunteer observers outside the breeding grounds september may all marking and resighting data were stored in the online database maintained by www geese org annual survival was estimated with program mark white and burnham 1999 using a burnham model for combined dead recoveries and live encounter histories burnham 1993 encounter histories were based on an observation window from march 23 may 22 and because neck collared individuals were generally seen several times during this period only birds with at least two sightings within the observation window were included as positive observations this ensured that the influence of resighting errors was kept to a minimum eliminating some recaptures lowers the recapture probability of course but it does not affect the accuracy of the estimates and in our case the recapture probabilities were so high that the effect on precision was marginal observations of pink footed geese n 395 543 were extracted from www geese org information on dead recoveries n 440 was provided by the ringing centers in denmark natural history museum of denmark and norway stavanger museum dead recoveries are reported by members of the public to the ringing centers involved in denmark and norway they are unsolicited and can occur throughout the annual range of the population although in practice some spatial variation in recovery and reporting probabilities can be expected due to e g variation in human population density they include both geese reported shot by hunters and those found dead by other members of the public the recovery process thus corresponds well with the assumptions of the burnham 1993 model using program mark we fit a variety of models with various constraints on survival resighting probability and recovery probability these models were evaluated using aicc burnham and anderson 2003 and estimates of annual survival from the best performing model were used survival estimates were generally consistent across the different models but the best performing model included annual variation in survival and resighting probability and a constant recovery probability and fidelity parameter δaicc to nearest model 3 0 we omitted the last survival estimate in the time series due to identifiability issues 2 1 6 capture mark resight estimates of population size the neck collar data used to estimate survival can also be used to derive a capture mark resight estimate of pink footed goose population size n by dividing the number of marked geese in the population m by the ratio of the number of marked geese to the number of geese screened r sheaffer and jarvis 1995 n m r this approach was used by clausen et al 2019 to derive estimates of pink footed goose population size in spring m was estimated from the number of marked birds seen alive in any given year corrected for annual variation in detection probability and r was estimated as the average of the ratios from observations of marked individuals in screened flocks the variance of n was approximated using the delta method rice 1988 assuming no covariance between r and m a detailed description of the approach is given by clausen et al 2019 2 2 population dynamics annual

is the harvest rate of adults in denmark prior to november the set of difference equations for may and november population size are based on the following assumptions a natural mortality and reproduction are time dependent b natural mortality is evenly distributed throughout the year in spite of evidence that there may be some minor seasonal differences madsen et al 2002 and natural mortality is the same for all birds that have survived at least one hunting season francis et al 1992 c hunting seasons in september and october in norway and denmark expose a common group of birds to

crippling loss has changed over time as reflected in the number of young carrying embedded shot clausen et al 2017b f hunters report only retrieved harvest and g harvest mortality is additive to natural mortality 2 3 integrated population model here we describe the likelihood of the various data sets given the model of population dynamics and the prior distributions of parameters to be estimated assuming independence of the individual data sets the joint likelihood of all the data is simply the product of the individual data likelihoods kéry and schaub 2012 we also describe different formulations of the ipm used to investigate potential biases in monitoring data 2 3 1 data likelihoods and prior distributions the likelihood of may counts assumes that counts are distributed log normal with mean log n t m and a proportionally constant variance σ m 2 c t m log normal log n t m σ m 2 where c t m is the log count of pink footed geese in may we assumed an uninformative prior for precision τ m 1 σ m 2 gamma 0 001 0 001 we expressed counts in thousands of birds rounded to the nearest thousand for estimates of may population size based on capture mark resight cmr data we assumed the cmr estimates were distributed log normal with mean log n t m and constant proportional variance σ c m r 2 c t c m r log normal log n t m σ c m r 2 the variance σ c m r 2 is a residual variance incorporating both the sampling error of the estimates as well as lack of fit of the state equations kéry and schaub 2012 117 we expressed the cmr estimates in thousands of birds rounded to the nearest thousand we omitted the may 1999 estimate because it was based on a single observation of a marked bird similar to the may counts the likelihood of november counts assumes that counts are distributed log normal but with mean log n t n β and constant proportional variance σ n 2 c t n log normal log n t n β σ n 2 where c t n is the log count of pink footed geese in november and β is a parameter expressing potential negative bias in the november counts we assumed an uninformative prior for precision τ m 1 σ n 2 gamma 0 001 0 001 we included a bias parameter because november counts were generally similar or less than counts in the subsequent may fig 1 this is not biologically feasible because only mortality and no reproduction occurs between november and may we decided to assume bias in the november counts rather than the may counts because the may counts and may cmr estimates are quite similar clausen et al 2019 we assumed a vague prior for the bias parameter β uniform 0 5 1 0 again we expressed counts in thousands of birds rounded to the nearest thousand the likelihood of the harvest in denmark prior to november i e the number of danish wings received with a pre november harvest date w t was described as the outcome of a binomial variable w t binomial α t w t where w t was the total number of wings received during the danish hunting season and α t h t d h t d where α t is the proportion of the total denmark harvest occurring prior to the november count we described the likelihood of the number of young observed in autumn p t as a beta binomial distribution bolker 2008 to account for over dispersion in the counts i e counts of young within a year varied by date and locale p t beta binomial ω ψ t ω 1 ψ t p t where ω is a constant over dispersion parameter ψ is the proportion of young p t is the total number of individuals tallied young older birds and ψ t r t 1 v h t n h t d 1 h t n h t d r t 1 v h t n h t d we specified a prior distribution ω gamma μ 2 σ μ σ where u 185 and σ 148 the prior distribution for ω was derived by first taking the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of young within each year the year specific means and standard deviations were then used to fit year specific beta distributions beta a b for the proportion of young using the method of moments the year specific estimates of over dispersion were the sum of the parameters of the beta distribution bolker 2008 we then used these year specific estimates of over dispersion to calculate u 185 and σ 148 we thus assumed temporally constant over dispersion with an informative prior finally we specified the likelihoods of observed harvest in norway and denmark as h t n poisson λ t n h t d poisson λ t d respectively where λ t n h t n n t m θ 4 12 1 v r t λ t d h t d n t m θ 4 12 1 v r t we expressed harvests in hundreds of birds rounded to the nearest hundred this effectively allowed for greater sampling variability which was unmeasured in reported harvests not in terms of the variance but in terms of the coefficient of variation for other parameters to be estimated we specified the following prior distributions θ t beta

based on the allometric relationships described by johnson et al 2012 and a female mass of 2520 g sd 270 g dunning 2008 and age at first breeding of three years we used vague prior distributions for r t h t n h t d and h t d but constrained their values to biologically realistic bounds the informative prior distribution for the differential vulnerability of young to harvest was based on the work of clausen et al 2017a supplemented by two additional years of data the prior distribution for the first population size in may 1992 was specified using the corresponding cmr estimate based on the findings of clausen et al 2017b we modeled the rate of crippling loss c t as an exponentially declining trend over time c t c δ t 1 where c was the crippling rate prior to campaigns to reduce crippling loss and δ is the exponential rate of decay based on clausen et al 2017b and with additional years of data we defined an informative prior as δ beta 387 32 using the method of moments for the crippling rate at the beginning of the timeframe we used a prior based on field observations by one of us jm of retrieved and un retrieved harvests of pink footed geese by hunters in 1996 and 1997 prior to the campaigns to reduce crippling loss c beta 8 31 in one model we used the cmr estimates of annual survival as prior distributions although not in the model including the cmr estimates of may population size as this would seriously violate the assumption of independent data sets abadi et al 2010 to specify prior distributions for annual survival we used the cmr estimates and their sample variances inflated by the most conservative estimate of c hat from program mark http www phidot org software mark docs book page 5 26 and then estimated the parameters of associated beta distributions using the method of moments 2 3 2 model formulations and fitting we relied on two basic formulations of the ipm one in which we used the cmr estimates of annual survival as priors but not the cmr estimates of may population size referred to as model s and one in which we used the cmr estimates of population size but not the cmr estimates of annual survival referred to as model p in which annual survival was a derived parameter s t θ t 1 k t again this was to avoid the potential for parameter bias resulting from non independence of the two cmr based data sets although ipms are typically constructed from raw data the use of estimates from previous analyses of component data is acceptable arnold et al 2018 indeed a strength of a bayesian estimation framework for ipms is the ability to use results from prior studies which is sometimes necessary due to problems of parameter identifiability kéry and schaub 2012 to fit the ipms we used jags 4 3 0 plummer 2003 run in the r computing environment r core team 2018 using runjags denwood 2016 r code for the two models is provided as supplementary material for each model we used three chains of 120 000 iterations each and retained the last 20 000 samples from each chain for analysis we assessed parameter convergence using the potential scale reduction factor psrf gelman and rubin 1992 and assumed values of psrf 1 1 indicated parameter convergence gelman and hill 2006 we note that the fitted ipms include 350 estimated parameters which is greater than the number of data points however it is often sensible to fit hierarchical models with more parameters than there are data points and overfitting is much less concern with reasonable prior distributions such as those in hierarchical models gelman et al 2004 unless otherwise noted we report the medians and 95 credible intervals of posterior estimates no widely accepted goodness of fit tests or model selection tests exist for ipms schaub and abadi 2011 although this is an active area of research hooten and hobbs 2015 we followed the recommendation of kéry and schaub 2012 and used chi squared goodness of fit tests for the individual data sets assuming that adequate fit of all the data sets implied a good fit of the ipm chi squared statistics were calculated by first generating mcmc samples of expectations for the data then a distribution of chi squared statistics and p values were calculated by comparing expectations with the actual data we report the medians of those distributions to evaluate apparent bias in survival and productivity estimates we regressed the data based estimates cmr estimates for survival observed proportion of young in autumn for productivity against their corresponding posterior estimates assuming an intercept of zero using this formulation the average bias is equal to 1 regression coefficient we also checked for a temporal trend in the bias of november counts by fitting an exponential model to the bias within the ipm y a e b t where bias 1 y and t year 3 results convergence of all parameter estimates was achieved for both models model s psrf 1 007 model p psrf 1 005 model s did a reasonable job of fitting the data p 0 27 except for the counts of young birds in autumn p 0 01 table 1 not surprisingly model s fit the estimates of annual survival well because they were used as informative priors p 0 99 however posterior estimates of may population size did not correspond well with the cmr estimates p 0 01 recognizing of course that they were not used in model s in contrast model p fit all the data sets well even the estimates of annual survival which were not used in the model p 0 59 model p also provided much smaller credible intervals for population size than did model s figs 2 and 3 also in model s the credible intervals for population size increase dramatically over the time frame recall that in model s there are no cmr estimates of population size thus the model is attempting to reconcile the demographic information with only the november counts which seem to be a biased estimate of population size and only nine may counts in this case the demographic information tends to dominate the joint likelihood as compared to model p in which the may cmr estimates have a strong influence on the joint likelihood the discordance between counts and demographic information in model s produces increasing credible intervals for population size due to the serial correlation in the state equations we also found differences between models s and p in posterior estimates of the fixed parameters of interest for example the parameter for bias in the november count had a posterior median of 0 93 0 86 1 00 indicative of a 7 bias in model s but a posterior median of 0 80 0 75 0 84 indicative of a 20 bias in model p fig 4 the apparent truncation of the distribution to 1 in fig 4 results from the strong influence of the demographic information on the joint likelihood which suggests that the population size particularly in later years is lower than that indicated by the november counts differential vulnerability of young had a relatively low posterior median of 1 75 1 47 2 04 in model s and a posterior median of 2 08 1 76 2 42 in model p fig 5 finally in model s the base crippling rate had a relatively high posterior median of 0 47 0 27 0 66 suggesting in the initial years of the timeframe that crippling loss was nearly as high as the retrieved harvest fig 6 in contrast model p produced a more realistic median crippling rate of 0 24 0 12 0 38 both models produced similar estimates of the exponential rate of decline in crippling rate over time model s median 0 94 0 92 0 96 model p median 0 92 0 90 0 95 both model s and model p suggested bias in the cmr estimates of survival rate and the observed proportion of young in autumn for survival estimates the bias was relatively small at about 3 model s median 0 97 se 0 005 model p median 0 97 se 0 013 fig 7 for the observed proportion of young the apparent bias was relatively large suggesting that over 20 of young in autumn are misidentified as adults model s median 0 74 se 0 024 model p median 0 77 se 0 018 fig 8 we examined the question of whether the apparent bias in survival and productivity may have changed over time in both cases the ratios of posterior to either the priors for survival or the data proportion of young increased over time this was true of both model s and model p although only the results from model p are depicted in fig 9 it should be noted that the increasing trend in apparent bias of productivity was heavily influenced by the first five years of the timeframe finally we note that model p provided only weak evidence of a temporal trend in bias in the november count for an exponential trend the posterior slope coefficient was 0 001 0 000 0 003 4 discussion svalbard pink footed geese are well monitored and studied and development of an ipm has contributed insights into the veracity of estimates of demographic parameters and their impact on population development we believe model p likely provides the best representation of the pink footed goose population as it provides posterior estimates similar to those derived from the individual data sets as well as estimates that agree well with the published literature that relies on more traditional modeling approaches using model p posterior medians of survival from natural causes were relatively constant with mean 0 92 sd 0 01 which is similar to the findings of johnson et al 2014 fig 10 posterior estimates of adult kill rate ranged from 0 04 0 03 0 06 to 0 13 0 11 0 16 and are similar in both magnitude and temporal trend to those reported by clausen et al 2017a posterior estimates of country specific kill rates suggest that most of the overall increase in kill rate in recent years is attributed to increasing harvest pressure in denmark a finding also consistent with clausen et al 2017a fig 11 with respect to productivity model p produced posterior estimates of preseason age ratio that were variable over time mean 0 22 sd 0 10 but suggested that on average young constitute about 18 of the population just prior to the hunting season fig 12 posterior estimates of the preseason age ratio also appeared to correlate well with the number of days above freezing in may on the breeding grounds in svalbard especially after 2005 a finding in accord with jensen et al 2014 and johnson et al 2014 our results suggest that population size of svalbard pink footed geese may have stabilized recently or at least is not increasing as rapidly as in the past this apparent stabilization is in keeping with declining survival rates that have accompanied an increase in kill rate most of the recent increase in kill rate is attributable to an increase of hunting pressure in denmark where the birds are staying longer in winter and where efforts have been made to increase the harvest to slow population growth clausen et al 2018 madsen et al 2016a in contrast productivity as estimated by the preseason age ratio has been increasing for much of the last 15 years apparently in response to the warming climate in svalbard piskozub 2017 may of 2018 was the warmest may in at least the last 50 years 27 days with mean temperature above freezing whether continued warming will further enhance productivity of pink footed geese is unknown as continued warming is likely to have ecological impacts far beyond decreasing snow cover which is the principal benefit now because it provides an abundance of snow free nesting sites jensen et al 2014 we also note that the ipm uses all available demographic data to provide estimates of population size with accompanying measures of precision at two times during the annual cycle the current adaptive harvest management framework relies on a single count to set harvest quotas and in may 2015 the count suggested that harvest restrictions were warranted madsen et al 2017 denmark restricted its hunting season despite the suspicion that the count was biased low a suspicion confirmed by the following count and by our analyses here an ipm estimates population size based on all available abundance and demographic data with the added benefit that managers can account for the sampling and process error of abundance in the optimization of harvest quotas sethi et al 2005 we suggest that model p perhaps with further development might be an acceptable substitute for the current population models which have been poor predictors of population abundance in recent years for managing the harvest of pink footed geese https egmp aewa info sites default files meeting files documents aewa egm iwg 3 9 pfg 20ahm 20report 202018 formatted final 0 pdf an important consideration in doing so would be the potential addition of covariates to explain annual variation in reproduction and or natural mortality with the covariates themselves described by dynamic models thus future population sizes and their attendant uncertainty could be predicted both as a function of these environmental covariates and harvest levels important findings of this study relate to potential biases in monitoring instruments ipms cannot correct for bias without ancillary data which if present can lead to spurious conclusions regarding demography and abundance kéry and schaub 2012 with pink footed geese we had the advantage of having a diversity of long term monitoring data that could be used to ascertain whether different data sets were telling a consistent story if a suggestion of bias exists there are two possibilities 1 the ipm is mis specified as it does not include all relevant processes e g there is immigration but this is not included in the model riecke et al 2019 2 the data sets are from a biased monitoring program or the models to analyze them do not account for bias e g neck band loss that is not modeled we thus strongly emphasize that our inferences are dependent on the structure of the state model we specified for pink footed geese there could be invalid assumptions e g the rate of natural mortality is constant throughout the year or key structural components of demography missing perhaps a good candidate for missing demographic structure is additional age specificity in mortality or reproductive rates we noted earlier that this is unlikely to be a strong concern because we observe the proportion of young in the autumn and include significant age specificity in harvest mortality significant permanent or temporary immigration or emigration would be cause for concern but large undetected movements seem unlikely given the restricted range of this population and monitoring that occurs throughout the annual cycle plus omnibus goose monitoring that occurs outside the known range of pink footed geese madsen et al 2016a 1999 assuming model structure is approximately correct both models suggested about the same magnitude of bias in cmr estimates of survival 3 and in the observed proportion of young in autumn 23 to 26 cmr estimates of survival are often biased low for several reasons permanent emigration from a limited study area is the most common source of bias but given that neck banded pink footed geese are observed throughout their known wintering range this issue is probably of minor importance neckband loss and resighting heterogeneity are other common causes of negative bias but the inclusion of dead recoveries in our survival analysis should to some extent compensate for these effects frederiksen 2014 frederiksen and bregnballe 2000 one remaining potential source of bias is a direct effect of neckbands on survival such effects have been found to be important in several experimental studies in north america alisauskas et al 2006 alisauskas and lindberg 2002 caswell et al 2012 but no similar studies have been carried out in europe to date analyses of non experimental data on neck banded and leg banded pink footed geese respectively in the uk iceland flyway indicate a substantial negative effect of neckbands on survival on the order of 3 5 m frederiksen unpubl data a negative bias in the estimates for the svalbard flyway population which are based largely on neck banded individuals is therefore not unexpected in future marking operations it would be useful to randomly assign neckbands or leg bands to captured geese to directly assess impacts on survival we cannot now explain the suggestion of a serious negative bias in the proportion of young the age counts are carried out by experienced observers along the flyway in autumn during a fixed interval of time at least two sources of bias could be addressed in future studies first discriminating juveniles from older geese becomes increasingly difficult during autumn because juveniles gradually molt covert feathers second families often segregate from large goose flocks madsen 2010 thus there is a risk of an underrepresentation of juveniles if observers focus their sampling on larger flocks model p also suggests that the apparent bias in data based estimates of annual survival and productivity may have increased over time the mean bias in cmr estimates of survival about 3 might be explained by neck band loss clausen et al 2015 the apparent trend in survival bias over time is more difficult to explain but could in part be due to heterogeneity in resighting rates which can produce more severe bias in cmr estimates toward the end of the study period kéry et al 2006 the increasing trend in apparent productivity bias seems to be driven largely by the first few years in the time frame however a possible explanation for a temporal trend in bias involves the recognition that successful breeders with young migrate later than non breeders and families have been observed leaving svalbard later with increasing summer temperatures gundersen et al 2017 j madsen personal observation it s at least possible that adults with young are increasingly absent from the autumn counts of young our results also suggest a negative bias of 20 in november counts although ipms can account for random error in counts they cannot account for systematic bias e g imperfect detection without additional information kéry and schaub 2012 had we only used november counts we would not have been able to estimate the bias in this estimate of november population size although this would not have affected the estimates of demographic parameters nor population trajectory if the bias was relatively constant only the inclusion of may counts and cmr population estimates along with the temporal partitioning of the harvest allowed us to estimate the negative bias in november counts a negative bias was anticipated because increasing numbers of pink footed geese have been using areas not covered in the traditional november count madsen et al 2015 this was the principal reason that counts in may were initiated in 2010 during may pink footed geese are more confined to well defined staging areas in scandinavia and therefore under counts are probably less likely although there is good correspondence between may counts and cmr estimates of population size counts in may might also be negatively biased if resighting heterogeneity is producing a negative bias in the cmr estimates we emphasize that much more needs to be done to understand how ipms can help inform the development and implementation of monitoring protocols schaub and abadi 2011 but see lahoz monfort et al 2014 considering the calls for harvesting practices that are demonstrably sustainable for european waterbirds at least a rudimentary level of monitoring is necessary population size and harvest at a minimum often other monitoring protocols are available or contemplated but additional monitoring comes at a cost harvest management thus involves a tradeoff between meeting the objectives of harvest management e g sustainability population control and the cost of maintaining various monitoring activities these tradeoffs can be investigated using an ipm a markov decision process marescot et al 2013 and the concept of pareto efficiency kennedy et al 2007 the idea would be to construct an ipm with all available data and then either omit some of the available data or simulate new data and re fit the ipm then the expected management performance could be compared between those cases with more data and those with less data such an approach would help managers decide whether the benefits of improved management are worth the costs of more monitoring for european waterbirds monitoring data are often limited to counts possibly at multiple times of the year with little or no information on annual harvests survival or productivity we emphasize however that in these cases it may still be possible to construct a prototype ipm using demographic information from similar species or by relying on allometric relationships and studies of captive reared birds johnson et al 2018 these models can be updated and latent parameters estimated as additional monitoring or research information becomes available in addition to gaining a better understanding of population demography ipms offer exciting opportunities for guiding conservation efforts especially harvest management for example adaptive harvest management can be an effective tool for dealing with demographic and other sources of uncertainty but traditionally has involved a small set of discrete models representing various hypotheses about how the population will respond to conservation actions johnson 2011 johnson et al 2014 belief weights representing the relative confidence in the discrete models are updated each year using a comparison of observed and predicted population sizes parameter values of the individual models are fixed however in contrast a single ipm can represent a generalized model of population dynamics i e one that admits various hypotheses as special cases e g conroy et al 2002 the joint distribution of all model parameters can then be updated each year using all available monitoring data the posterior distribution of model parameters can be used to derive an optimal harvest strategy using stochastic dynamic programming marescot et al 2013 the optimal harvest strategy can also account for other sources of uncertainty including environmental variation imprecise control over harvest levels partial controllability and imprecise population estimates partial observability by updating the ipm periodically the associated harvest strategy can evolve over time in the spirit of adaptive management credit authorship contribution statement fred a johnson

24952,with increasing concern over the environment in mariculture the integrated culture has received extensive attention in recent years for management of aquaculture farms a biophysical model was developed to quantify the potential influence of bivalves seaweed integrated culture on pelagic ecosystem we developed nemuro culture model by coupling the cultivated species kelp laminaria japonica oyster crassostrea gigas scallop chlamys farreri and phosphorus related variables with nemuro north pacific ecosystem model for understanding regional oceanography the entire culture area of sungo bay was divided into five boxes according to the culture layout kelp monoculture areas k area co culture areas k o area scallop monoculture areas s area oyster monoculture areas o area fish culture areas f area and no culture areas boundary the application of the model to the integrated culture system in sungo bay has shown promising results as the simulations reasonably agreed with the observations the model was then used for scenario simulations to analyse the impact of mariculture the simulation results showed that 1 the concentration of phytoplankton and nutrients was largely constrained by cultivated kelps during the late stage of kelp culture period while the influence of cultivated bivalves was relatively small 2 the influence of cultivated kelps and bivalves could be transported to neighbor areas and weakened in the k area while the influence of cultivated fishes was confined near f area 3 the integrated culture of shellfish and seaweed in sungo bay would reduce the risk of eutrophication in spring 4 the addition of phosphorus related variables enabled the model to depict more details and phosphorus could be the limiting factor for phytoplankton growth at some time in sungo bay this modelling work provides a quantitative tool for helping planning and management of coastal aquaculture keywords physical biological model multi species mariculture environmental impacts nemuro sungo bay 1 introduction the stagnation of the yield from global marine fisheries cannot meet the increasing demand for fish protein and the growth of aquaculture has been considered as the production sector that could compensate for the declining wild fish stocks fao 2018 however the intensive mariculture activity would cause environmental impact which hinder the sustainable development of this industry price et al 2015 li et al 2017 park et al 2018 the integrated multi trophic aquaculture imta can be one of the means for the development of sustainable culture neori et al 2007 troell et al 2009 chopin et al 2012 as it can help facilitate nutrient recycling and optimize productivity traditional field based methods are impossible to disentangle the interactions among the components in complex integrated culture systems ren et al 2012 zhang and kitazawa 2016 particularly for coastal ecosystem where the water exchange plays an important role alternatively numerical models are appropriate tools which could facilitate the assessment of interactions and provide guidance for management of integrated culture systems fang et al 2016 integrated mariculture models have been developed for various purposes including environmental impact prediction and carrying capacity estimation duarte et al 2003 ferreira et al 2012 ren et al 2012 lamprianidou et al 2015 cubillo et al 2016 zhang and kitazawa 2016 hadley et al 2018 most of these models however focus on the systems around fish cages whereas study on the large scale suspended longline culture of shellfish and seaweed has received less attention china is the biggest marine shellfish and seaweed producer in the world and its annual production of shellfish and seaweed were 14 371 300 tons and 2 227 800 tons in 2017 moa 2018 the suspended longline culture of bivalves with seaweed is one of the most important aquacultural means in coasts of northern china fang et al 1996 as a typical bivalves seaweed integrated culture system sungo bay has attracted much attention in modelling studies duarte et al 2003 shi et al 2011 wang et al 2018 however much attention has been paid on the carrying capacity of cultivated species or hydrodynamics and less on pelagic ecosystem the cultivated species are seeded in separate areas fig 1 previous studies tend to analyze the dynamics in each area separately while the interactions among areas are ignored in addition nitrogen is considered as the only nutrient currency in previous models duarte et al 2003 shi et al 2011 wang et al 2018 since phosphorus p has been proved to be a potential limiting nutrient in sungo bay li et al 2017 xu et al 2017 the addition of p related variables is necessary in modeling of sungo bay as a lower trophic ecosystem model nemuro north pacific ecosystem model for understanding regional oceanography has proven to be a solid foundation for the development of versions applicable to other locations new species and community type kishi et al 2011 the purposes of this paper are to 1 extend nemuro by adding p related variables and coupling aquacultural species sub models to represent the integrated culture systems 2 quantify the influence of current bivalves seaweed culture on pelagic ecosystem the interactions among different areas were also studied 3 simulate the influence of adjust culture layout on pelagic ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data sungo bay is a semi enclosed bay located at the eastern end of the shandong peninsula of china with depth increasing gradually to 21 m at the mouth fig 1 the total area of the bay is about 144 km2 and nearly 2 3 of the area is used for aquaculture the kelp culture areas are located at the mouth while the bivalve culture areas are located at the head of the bay the middle part is characterized by kelp bivalve co culture relatively small fish cage areas are located at the southwest of the bay four cruises were conducted in sungo bay during 2014 2015 november 2014 march 2015 may 2015 and august 2015 the sampling stations were located within the kelp monoculture areas k area co culture areas k o area scallop monoculture areas s area oyster monoculture areas o area fish culture areas f area and no culture areas boundary respectively fig 1 in situ sea surface temperature sst were measured using a multi parameter water quality meter surface seawater samples at each station were collected and filtered onto gf f glass fiber filters whatman for analysis of chlorophyll a chl a and the dissolved inorganic nutrients nitrates ammonium phosphate and silicate according to methods described by strickland and parsons 1972 2 2 nemuro culture nemuro consists of eleven state variables as shown in fig 2 kishi et al 2007 in this study nemuro was extended by coupling aquacultural species sub models bivalves and kelps in fig 2 to represent the integrated culture systems the coupled biological model fig 2 is called nemuro culture nemuro for including cultivated species the kelp sub model was based on wu et al 2009 and zhang et al 2016 with some necessary modifications the model equations were listed in appendix a kelp growth rate was assumed to be limited by temperature light and nutrients the function used for temperature limitation was from wu et al 2009 the light limitation was described as zhang et al 2016 except that the depth of kelp culture was assumed to be relative to kelp length the function used for nutrient limitation was the same as described by zhang et al 2016 but with modified parameter values kelp was allowed to grow until a threshold biomass that corresponds to a value of 110 g dry weight ind 1 wu et al 2009 the sub models for scallop and oyster were based on hawkins et al 2002 2013 both models included selective feeding processes of bivalves considering the differences between phytoplankton organics and non phytoplankton organics in this study the energy content of phytoplankton organics was assumed to be 23 5 j mg while the energy content of non phytoplankton organics was 6 1 j mg hawkins et al 2002 temperature limitations on both feeding and respiration were considered the organic matter in faeces and pseudofaeces were included in this study after independently calibrated using growth and environmental data these sub models were integrated into nemuro kishi et al 2007 the currencies in nemuro are nitrogen and silicon kishi et al 2007 since phosphorus is a limiting variable in sungo bay li et al 2017 xu et al 2017 phosphorus related variables were added according to previous studies zuenko 2007 wang 2007 2011 yang 2011 the differential equations of state variable in nemuro were modified to include loss or gain terms due to aquaculture and the equations corresponding to those processes are introduced in appendix b 2 3 hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model was based on the regional ocean modeling system roms a free surface hydrostatic and primitive equation model shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 haidvogel et al 2008 the model region 36 97 n 37 3 n 122 3 e 122 7e covered the entire culture area in sungo bay fig 1 with 200 m horizontal resolution and 11 s coordinate levels in the vertical the products of hydrodynamic model were hour averaged simulation of temperature and current velocity although the aquaculture structures could slow down the surface flow shi et al 2011 those did not lead to a prominent reduction in total water exchange zeng et al 2015 in addition the pelagic variables in each box were assumed to be homogeneous within each box so the effects of aquaculture structures on water exchange were not considered 2 4 model implementation the biophysical model was spatially resolved to accommodate variation of farm layout in the bay the entire culture area of sungo bay was divided into five boxes fig 1 according to the latest reported culture maps fang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 pelagic variables were assumed homogeneous within each box the initial biomass of kelp was assumed to be 1 g dry weight ind 1 and the initial shell length of scallops and oysters were assumed to be 2 5 cm and 0 5 cm respectively duarte et al 2003 kelps and scallops were seeded and harvested at regular time intervals according to the schedule table 1 while the seeding densities table 2 referred to duarte et al 2003 the fish component in this model was simplified as a constant input 1 7 g d m2 of particulate organic matter pom during the fish cultivate season fang et al 2017 table 1 there are two harvesting periods for oysters and only the second one was considered during the model implementation in addition the second harvesting period was compressed to 1 month from 1 st to 31st in march since this harvesting period of oysters overlaps with the seeding period of the following year the numbers of seeding and harvesting were assumed evenly distributed during the seeding and harvesting season harvesting did not depend on available biomass or size the average values of in situ observations in each box during november 2014 were used for calculating the initial fields of plankton and nutrients the boundary conditions were defined based on the average value of the outermost stations fig 1 and interpolated from four cruises in lack of pom and zooplankton data the initial values and boundary conditions were derived from duarte et al 2003 and marine atlas editorial board for marine atlas 1992 respectively based on field investigation there was no clear signal in nutrients near the river outlets in sungo bay li et al 2016 previous modelling results also showed that nutrients load from river has little interaction with the aquaculture in sungo bay wang et al 2018 therefore the inputs from land were not considered in the model at each time step the nemuro culture model in each box was calculated first then the volume exchanges among boxes which were derived from the results of hydrodynamic model see 2 2 were used to calculate the transport for all pelagic variables including nutrients plankton and pom the model was implemented using the matlab software model equations were solved using fourth order runge kutta numerical integration scheme with a timestep of one hour after running the model for one year model outputs were used as new initial conditions for subsequent runs the model was run for 3 years to cover the whole culture cycle and the results of last 2 years were used for analysis we conducted seven simulation scenarios as described in table 2 for model validation the first scenario was run based on current culture practices in which all cultivated species were considered in the second scenario the effects of all cultivated species were eliminated to evaluate the effects of different species the next four scenarios were built upon the second scenario by adding one species at a time the culture areas and seeding densities were also based on current culture practices in the last scenario the effects of fish culture were eliminated comparisons between scenarios permits evaluation of influences mariculture have on ecosystem the influences were quantified as i n f l u e n c e v i v n o n c u l t u r e v n o n c u l t u r e 100 where vi and vnon culture are the values of variable in scenarios with and without mariculture respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance the model successfully simulated the variations in observed temperature over the year with minimum values around 2 during winter and maximum values around 25 during august fig 3 a there was a dominant gyre circulation with high current speeds near the mouth of the bay fig 3b c the flooding tide current entered along the northern side and flowed anticlockwise while the ebbing tide was in the opposite direction there was a close agreement between observations and simulations for circulation the influence of mariculture on pelagic variables in all areas except f area was similar fig 5 we only present the description of the results for k o area fig 4 two chl a concentration peaks were observed in spring march and summer august while the second lowest and lowest values appeared in late spring may and fall november it was also consistent with the observations of li et al 2017 all nutrients except si oh 4 concentrations peaked in march with a steep decline after that while the concentration of si oh 4 peaked in may in this study n p ratio is calculated as no3 nh4 po4 the observed n p ratio peaked in august and did not show significant differences during may august and october it was also consistent with the observations of li et al 2017 the lowest value of n p ratio appeared in march overall when all cultivated species were considered culture in fig 4 the model could generally reproduce the timing and magnitude of most variables observed in the field 3 2 influence of present mariculture in one simulated culture period the seeding biomass of kelp oyster and scallop were respectively about 15 ton dry weight 1 ton wet weight and 100 ton wet weight while their harvests were 9 104 ton dry weight 7 8 104 ton wet weight and 5000 ton wet weight respectively compared to non culture scenario non culture in fig 4 the mariculture culture in fig 4 introduced fluctuations consistent with the timing of culture activities the concentrations of phytoplankton were consistently low over the simulation period in culture scenario which was resulted from prey by bivalves and competition for nutrients with kelps the nutrient absorption by kelps was most obvious at the late stage of kelp culture period 15th march to 30th april during which kelps grew exponentially as a result a sharply decline appeared in all nutrients except silicate and the n p ratio increased correspondingly since kelps could not use silicon and the concentrations of phytoplankton decreased the concentration of silicate in culture scenario went beyond that in non culture scenario during this period from 1st may to 30th june kelps were harvested gradually which weakened the influences of kelps during this period phytoplankton in culture scenario was still lower than that in non culture scenario due to the prey of bivalves as a result all nutrients in culture scenario went beyond until the following kelp culture period 3 3 species dependent influence based on simulation scenarios we quantified the influence of cultivated species on pelagic ecosystem separately fig 5 in this study 30 was chosen arbitrarily as the criteria to determine the significance all of the time averaged values were less than 20 solid bars in fig 5 except a significant increase of the non phytoplankton pom in f area it seems that the mariculture in sungo bay did not affect its surrounding environment significantly which could be explained by the periodical culture activities and the ecological resilience however the cultivated species could cause significant influences within two months as shown in fig 4 so the influences in a short time hollow bars in fig 5 should be emphasized the monoculture of bivalves fig 5b c could lead to the increase of all nutrients whereas the monoculture of kelps fig 5a could cause significant decline of nutrients with maximum reduction of 39 95 and 75 for ammonium nitrate and phosphate respectively in addition the monoculture of kelps or bivalves could lead to the decline of phytoplankton non phytoplankton pom and zp among which the influences of kelps on phytoplankton were significant for n p ratio the monoculture of bivalves could lead to the reduction of n p ratio which was consistent with previous investigation lu et al 2015 li et al 2017 when kelps were cultured only the n p ratio fluctuated with significant rise appeared in k o area only 53 3 4 area dependent influence the influences of cultivated kelps and bivalves could be extended to adjacent areas because model boxes were inter connected with each other fig 1 these influences were weakened in k area which could be attributed to the very short distance between the defined k area and boundary fig 1 it could also be partially explained by the high current speeds in this area fig 3 by contrast the influences of fish culture fig 5d were confined near f area due to its small area and weak water exchange fig 3 these influences included the significant increase of non phytoplankton pom 480 phytoplankton 185 n p ratio 120 which could not be mitigated by adding kelps or bivalves in neighbor areas fig 5e besides the impacts on pelagic ecosystem the sedimentation of uneaten feed and fish feces around fish cages could settle to the seafloor potentially causing organic pollution fang et al 2017 to solve these problems fish cages in this area are removed gradually by local government overall the influences of mariculture on surrounding environment varied with cultivated species areas and culture schedule which provided fundamental information to guide the planning of integrated culture in a more sustainable way 3 5 potential influence of mariculture on ecosystem if the effect of fish culture was negligible we could deduce that the integrated culture system in sungo bay fig 5f could cause significant decline of phytoplankton and nutrients especially in spring which could reduce the risk of eutrophication however the reduction of phytoplankton and nutrients would in turn affect the growth of cultivated kelps and bivalves in addition the decreased biomass of low trophic levels such as phytoplankton and zooplankton would reduce the mass and energy input to the natural ecosystem which would ultimately influence higher trophic levels such as fish for the ecological carrying capacity these effects should be investigated in the future we note that the n p ratio increased significantly in k o area in spring which would increase the ratio of dinoflagellate versus diatom abundance li et al 2017 it could consequently increase the risk of harmful algal blooms caused by dinoflagellate in spring zhou et al 2008 li et al 2014 2017 a harmful algal bloom was recorded with considerable high n p ratio in sungo bay during april 2011 zhang et al 2012 3 6 model advantages and improvement the ecological model nemuro culture is established based on nemuro kishi et al 2007 which is one option in the publicly available version of roms aita et al 2007 hashioka and yamanaka 2007 megrey et al 2007 zuenko 2007 kishi et al 2011 wang 2011 nemuro culture is an extension of nemuro to include aquaculture species and could generally reproduce the detailed dynamics of integrated culture system in the bay when phosphorus related variables were considered the peak of chl a in spring was closer to observations than that in scenario without phosphorus fig 6 this suggests that phosphorus could be the limiting factor for phytoplankton growth at some time in sungo bay which is consistent with previous studies fang et al 2011 mahmood et al 2015 wu et al 2015 xu et al 2017 integrated culture systems are highly complex and depend on the balance of a wide range of interactions whether among cultivated species or between the organisms and their physical and chemical environment granada et al 2018 development of models to understand these interactions and analyze the components involved is increasingly necessary granada et al 2018 since nemuro culture was coupled with hydrodynamic model in this study it can be used to evaluate the effects of physical forcing on primary production and mariculture we note that the biggest measuring errors of chl a no3 nh4 and po4 appeared in march since the observations in each box were merged bigger errors implied that more heterogeneity might exist in the box in the future the number of boxes should be increased appropriately and more interactions among culture areas could be analyzed 4 conclusions a biophysical model was developed to evaluate the influence of bivalves seaweed integrated culture on pelagic ecosystem the main innovative aspect of the ecological model nemuro culture was the coupling between nemuro and cultivated species application of the model showed that the model could successfully reproduce the main features of the integrated culture system in sungo bay scenario simulations indicated that the influence of mariculture varied with cultivated species areas and culture schedule overall the current integrated culture system in sungo bay could reduce the risk of eutrophication in spring the model provides a framework for investigating the impact of aquaculture activities on the functioning of ecosystems acknowledgements we would like to thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for

the nemuro and species specific models involved uniform of units nemuro represented time in units of day while the species specific models operated on hourly or daily rates in this model the units were converted to hour kelp grew by assimilating nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 and phosphate po4 scallop and oyster grew by assimilating pom including phytoplankton and non phytoplankton in addition to the particulate organic nitrogen pon in nemuro major contributions to non phytoplankton pom were faeces and pseudofaeces produced by bivalves added to this source were faeces and waste feed by finfish culture since the large and predatory zooplankton zl and zp in nemuro are assumed greater than 200 μm rose et al 2007a only the live small zooplankton zs in nemuro contributed to non phytoplankton pom the excretions of culture bivalves were added to the sources of nh4 and po4 nemuro and these species specific models could be solved simultaneously coupled which allowed these biological objects to interact with each other in addition they could also be solved separately uncoupled allowing for investigation of the interactions between culture species and ecosystem nemuro represent phytoplankton biomass in nitrogen μmol l while both bivalve models represent phytoplankton biomass in chlorophyll a μg l refer to wang et al 2011 the conversions between chlorophyll a and nitrogen in phytoplankton were expressed as p s c h l 10 0 623 log p s n 14 0 671 0 71 1 5 p l c h l 10 0 816 log p l n 14 2 538 1 208 2 581 where psn and pln are the nitrogen of small phytoplankton ps and large phytoplankton

24952,with increasing concern over the environment in mariculture the integrated culture has received extensive attention in recent years for management of aquaculture farms a biophysical model was developed to quantify the potential influence of bivalves seaweed integrated culture on pelagic ecosystem we developed nemuro culture model by coupling the cultivated species kelp laminaria japonica oyster crassostrea gigas scallop chlamys farreri and phosphorus related variables with nemuro north pacific ecosystem model for understanding regional oceanography the entire culture area of sungo bay was divided into five boxes according to the culture layout kelp monoculture areas k area co culture areas k o area scallop monoculture areas s area oyster monoculture areas o area fish culture areas f area and no culture areas boundary the application of the model to the integrated culture system in sungo bay has shown promising results as the simulations reasonably agreed with the observations the model was then used for scenario simulations to analyse the impact of mariculture the simulation results showed that 1 the concentration of phytoplankton and nutrients was largely constrained by cultivated kelps during the late stage of kelp culture period while the influence of cultivated bivalves was relatively small 2 the influence of cultivated kelps and bivalves could be transported to neighbor areas and weakened in the k area while the influence of cultivated fishes was confined near f area 3 the integrated culture of shellfish and seaweed in sungo bay would reduce the risk of eutrophication in spring 4 the addition of phosphorus related variables enabled the model to depict more details and phosphorus could be the limiting factor for phytoplankton growth at some time in sungo bay this modelling work provides a quantitative tool for helping planning and management of coastal aquaculture keywords physical biological model multi species mariculture environmental impacts nemuro sungo bay 1 introduction the stagnation of the yield from global marine fisheries cannot meet the increasing demand for fish protein and the growth of aquaculture has been considered as the production sector that could compensate for the declining wild fish stocks fao 2018 however the intensive mariculture activity would cause environmental impact which hinder the sustainable development of this industry price et al 2015 li et al 2017 park et al 2018 the integrated multi trophic aquaculture imta can be one of the means for the development of sustainable culture neori et al 2007 troell et al 2009 chopin et al 2012 as it can help facilitate nutrient recycling and optimize productivity traditional field based methods are impossible to disentangle the interactions among the components in complex integrated culture systems ren et al 2012 zhang and kitazawa 2016 particularly for coastal ecosystem where the water exchange plays an important role alternatively numerical models are appropriate tools which could facilitate the assessment of interactions and provide guidance for management of integrated culture systems fang et al 2016 integrated mariculture models have been developed for various purposes including environmental impact prediction and carrying capacity estimation duarte et al 2003 ferreira et al 2012 ren et al 2012 lamprianidou et al 2015 cubillo et al 2016 zhang and kitazawa 2016 hadley et al 2018 most of these models however focus on the systems around fish cages whereas study on the large scale suspended longline culture of shellfish and seaweed has received less attention china is the biggest marine shellfish and seaweed producer in the world and its annual production of shellfish and seaweed were 14 371 300 tons and 2 227 800 tons in 2017 moa 2018 the suspended longline culture of bivalves with seaweed is one of the most important aquacultural means in coasts of northern china fang et al 1996 as a typical bivalves seaweed integrated culture system sungo bay has attracted much attention in modelling studies duarte et al 2003 shi et al 2011 wang et al 2018 however much attention has been paid on the carrying capacity of cultivated species or hydrodynamics and less on pelagic ecosystem the cultivated species are seeded in separate areas fig 1 previous studies tend to analyze the dynamics in each area separately while the interactions among areas are ignored in addition nitrogen is considered as the only nutrient currency in previous models duarte et al 2003 shi et al 2011 wang et al 2018 since phosphorus p has been proved to be a potential limiting nutrient in sungo bay li et al 2017 xu et al 2017 the addition of p related variables is necessary in modeling of sungo bay as a lower trophic ecosystem model nemuro north pacific ecosystem model for understanding regional oceanography has proven to be a solid foundation for the development of versions applicable to other locations new species and community type kishi et al 2011 the purposes of this paper are to 1 extend nemuro by adding p related variables and coupling aquacultural species sub models to represent the integrated culture systems 2 quantify the influence of current bivalves seaweed culture on pelagic ecosystem the interactions among different areas were also studied 3 simulate the influence of adjust culture layout on pelagic ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data sungo bay is a semi enclosed bay located at the eastern end of the shandong peninsula of china with depth increasing gradually to 21 m at the mouth fig 1 the total area of the bay is about 144 km2 and nearly 2 3 of the area is used for aquaculture the kelp culture areas are located at the mouth while the bivalve culture areas are located at the head of the bay the middle part is characterized by kelp bivalve co culture relatively small fish cage areas are located at the southwest of the bay four cruises were conducted in sungo bay during 2014 2015 november 2014 march 2015 may 2015 and august 2015 the sampling stations were located within the kelp monoculture areas k area co culture areas k o area scallop monoculture areas s area oyster monoculture areas o area fish culture areas f area and no culture areas boundary respectively fig 1 in situ sea surface temperature sst were measured using a multi parameter water quality meter surface seawater samples at each station were collected and filtered onto gf f glass fiber filters whatman for analysis of chlorophyll a chl a and the dissolved inorganic nutrients nitrates ammonium phosphate and silicate according to methods described by strickland and parsons 1972 2 2 nemuro culture nemuro consists of eleven state variables as shown in fig 2 kishi et al 2007 in this study nemuro was extended by coupling aquacultural species sub models bivalves and kelps in fig 2 to represent the integrated culture systems the coupled biological model fig 2 is called nemuro culture nemuro for including cultivated species the kelp sub model was based on wu et al 2009 and zhang et al 2016 with some necessary modifications the model equations were listed in appendix a kelp growth rate was assumed to be limited by temperature light and nutrients the function used for temperature limitation was from wu et al 2009 the light limitation was described as zhang et al 2016 except that the depth of kelp culture was assumed to be relative to kelp length the function used for nutrient limitation was the same as described by zhang et al 2016 but with modified parameter values kelp was allowed to grow until a threshold biomass that corresponds to a value of 110 g dry weight ind 1 wu et al 2009 the sub models for scallop and oyster were based on hawkins et al 2002 2013 both models included selective feeding processes of bivalves considering the differences between phytoplankton organics and non phytoplankton organics in this study the energy content of phytoplankton organics was assumed to be 23 5 j mg while the energy content of non phytoplankton organics was 6 1 j mg hawkins et al 2002 temperature limitations on both feeding and respiration were considered the organic matter in faeces and pseudofaeces were included in this study after independently calibrated using growth and environmental data these sub models were integrated into nemuro kishi et al 2007 the currencies in nemuro are nitrogen and silicon kishi et al 2007 since phosphorus is a limiting variable in sungo bay li et al 2017 xu et al 2017 phosphorus related variables were added according to previous studies zuenko 2007 wang 2007 2011 yang 2011 the differential equations of state variable in nemuro were modified to include loss or gain terms due to aquaculture and the equations corresponding to those processes are introduced in appendix b 2 3 hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model was based on the regional ocean modeling system roms a free surface hydrostatic and primitive equation model shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 haidvogel et al 2008 the model region 36 97 n 37 3 n 122 3 e 122 7e covered the entire culture area in sungo bay fig 1 with 200 m horizontal resolution and 11 s coordinate levels in the vertical the products of hydrodynamic model were hour averaged simulation of temperature and current velocity although the aquaculture structures could slow down the surface flow shi et al 2011 those did not lead to a prominent reduction in total water exchange zeng et al 2015 in addition the pelagic variables in each box were assumed to be homogeneous within each box so the effects of aquaculture structures on water exchange were not considered 2 4 model implementation the biophysical model was spatially resolved to accommodate variation of farm layout in the bay the entire culture area of sungo bay was divided into five boxes fig 1 according to the latest reported culture maps fang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 pelagic variables were assumed homogeneous within each box the initial biomass of kelp was assumed to be 1 g dry weight ind 1 and the initial shell length of scallops and oysters were assumed to be 2 5 cm and 0 5 cm respectively duarte et al 2003 kelps and scallops were seeded and harvested at regular time intervals according to the schedule table 1 while the seeding densities table 2 referred to duarte et al 2003 the fish component in this model was simplified as a constant input 1 7 g d m2 of particulate organic matter pom during the fish cultivate season fang et al 2017 table 1 there are two harvesting periods for oysters and only the second one was considered during the model implementation in addition the second harvesting period was compressed to 1 month from 1 st to 31st in march since this harvesting period of oysters overlaps with the seeding period of the following year the numbers of seeding and harvesting were assumed evenly distributed during the seeding and harvesting season harvesting did not depend on available biomass or size the average values of in situ observations in each box during november 2014 were used for calculating the initial fields of plankton and nutrients the boundary conditions were defined based on the average value of the outermost stations fig 1 and interpolated from four cruises in lack of pom and zooplankton data the initial values and boundary conditions were derived from duarte et al 2003 and marine atlas editorial board for marine atlas 1992 respectively based on field investigation there was no clear signal in nutrients near the river outlets in sungo bay li et al 2016 previous modelling results also showed that nutrients load from river has little interaction with the aquaculture in sungo bay wang et al 2018 therefore the inputs from land were not considered in the model at each time step the nemuro culture model in each box was calculated first then the volume exchanges among boxes which were derived from the results of hydrodynamic model see 2 2 were used to calculate the transport for all pelagic variables including nutrients plankton and pom the model was implemented using the matlab software model equations were solved using fourth order runge kutta numerical integration scheme with a timestep of one hour after running the model for one year model outputs were used as new initial conditions for subsequent runs the model was run for 3 years to cover the whole culture cycle and the results of last 2 years were used for analysis we conducted seven simulation scenarios as described in table 2 for model validation the first scenario was run based on current culture practices in which all cultivated species were considered in the second scenario the effects of all cultivated species were

based on current culture practices in the last scenario the effects of fish culture were eliminated comparisons between scenarios permits evaluation of influences mariculture have on ecosystem the influences were quantified as i n f l u e n c e v i v n o n c u l t u r e v n o n c u l t u r e 100 where vi and vnon culture are the values of variable in scenarios with and without mariculture respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance the model successfully simulated the variations in observed temperature over the year with minimum values around 2 during winter and maximum

primary production and mariculture we note that the biggest measuring errors of chl a no3 nh4 and po4 appeared in march since the observations in each box were merged bigger errors implied that more heterogeneity might exist in the box in the future the number of boxes should be increased appropriately and more interactions among culture areas could be analyzed 4 conclusions a biophysical model was developed to evaluate the influence of bivalves seaweed integrated culture on pelagic ecosystem the main innovative aspect of the ecological model nemuro culture was the coupling between nemuro and cultivated species application of the model showed that the model could successfully reproduce the main features of the integrated culture system in sungo bay scenario simulations indicated that the influence of mariculture varied with cultivated species areas and culture schedule overall the current integrated culture system in sungo bay could reduce the risk of eutrophication in spring the model provides a framework for investigating the impact of aquaculture activities on the functioning of ecosystems acknowledgements we would like to thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for

were converted to hour kelp grew by assimilating nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 and phosphate po4 scallop and oyster grew by assimilating pom including phytoplankton and non phytoplankton in addition to the particulate organic nitrogen pon in nemuro major contributions to non phytoplankton pom were faeces and pseudofaeces produced by bivalves added to this source were faeces and waste feed by finfish culture since the large and predatory zooplankton zl and zp in nemuro are assumed greater than 200 μm rose et al 2007a only the live small zooplankton zs in nemuro contributed to non phytoplankton pom the excretions of culture bivalves were added to the sources of nh4 and po4 nemuro and these species specific models could be solved simultaneously coupled which allowed these biological objects to

24953,the spatial and temporal patterns of broad front bird migration are governed by the geospatial distributions of landmasses mountain ranges and weather conditions these distributions interact with the birds innate program during migration and are critical to successful migration hence favourable environmental conditions for migration consequently lead to spatio temporal concentrations and the evolution of specific migratory flyways based on the aerodynamic properties of the ten most abundant nocturnal long distance migrants we developed a computational framework to simulate millions of individual trajectories across europe using an agent based simulation approach we simulated a three week period of autumn migration with a temporal resolution of 30 s departure conditions were derived from bird densities observed within the first two hours after sunset which were extracted from the weather radar network individual itineraries were strongly influenced by the behavioural reactions to the environment such as the wind flow coastlines and mountain ranges wind speed and direction are among the key factors that shape migration patterns such as reverse movements observed within some nights accumulation of migration was triggered by the combined effect of geographic barriers coastlines mountain ranges and wind the overall result of the simulation corresponds well with the large scale pattern of bird migration intensities measured across the study area for instance the high migration intensity observed between the atlantic coast and the pyrenees our model framework conjoins all important domains such as the birds preconditions and behavioural scope as well as the spatio temporal dynamics of the environment however for the time being we cannot decide whether local discrepancies between model and data are due to environmental effects that are not yet captured by our simulation i e effect of rain on migration intensity or caused by differences in the sensitivity of the local weather radar systems due to the limited time period and lack of more accurate data for validation our findings are preliminary further progress in data quality and hopefully better access of bird profiles from the continent wide weather radar network will allow to improve model performance and implement a bird migration forecasting similar to weather forecasts apart from assessing conflicts between human activities and bird movements this would greatly enhance our understanding of biomass flow on a large scale keywords bird migration flight behaviour ecological

specific route are determined by intrinsic and extrinsic factors it is assumed that the energy balance the time required for migration and the risk of predation are the main factors contributing to this adaptive behaviour alerstam and lindström 1990 thus the rapid course of changing environmental conditions during migration requires an almost continuous process of decision making as birds decision making is diverse timing as well as migration routes can vary considerably between years aside from intrinsic aspects such as internal clocks gwinner 1977 and body conditions alerstam and lindström 1990 sjöberg et al 2015 highly dynamic environmental factors such as wind flow bruderer et al 1995 mclaren et al 2012 and food availability marra et al 2005 tøttrup et al 2012 modulate the birds decision for departure landing and route choice jenni and schaub 2003 shamoun baranes et al 2017 selecting supporting wind conditions can save energy but also time weber et al 1998 liechti and bruderer 1998 and has been confirmed by several studies bruderer et al 1995 kemp et al 2013 dokter et al 2010 further studies demonstrated that departure decisions of songbirds are strongly correlated to large fat reserves and profitable winds deppe et al 2015 schmaljohann and eikenaar 2017 from a geographic point of view bird migration is known to concentrate within valleys bruderer and liechti 1990 liechti et al 1996 and along shorelines lensink et al 2002 fortin et al 1999 heist et al 2018 peterson et al 2015 often in combination with specific weather conditions erni et al 2002 show that wind and rain are key factors for temporal concentration of bird migration generally migration intensity has a positive correlation with wind profit a measure for tailwind support and a negative correlation with rain duration as unfavourable weather can delay departure and lead to instantaneous high migration peaks zugstau bruderer 1980 in order to achieve realistic predictions of temporal and spatial concentrations all these effects should be considered in a model approach many researchers have attempted to describe animal migration behaviour chapman et al 2011 hedenström and alerstam 1995 liechti et al 2000 pennycuick 2008 and to model their migration patterns and hotspots aurbach et al 2018 bauer and klaassen 2013 erni et al 2003 fern and morrison 2017 kölzsch et al 2018 liechti et al 2013 mclaren et al 2014 stoddard et al 1983 van belle et al 2007 however to our knowledge no attempt has been made to build an agent based model that combines all relevant factors such as internal condition external factors motion capacities and navigation capacities tang and bennett 2010 we model at the scale of individual bird migration behaviour that follows an optimal flight strategy approach minimizing flight duration and energy costs alerstam 2011 alerstam and lindström 1990 in previous work we modelled flight behaviour over complex terrain within a realistic wind field aurbach et al 2018 now we extend this simulation approach to a much larger geographic scope covering a major part of western europe in addition we incorporate birds decision making processes in proximity to shorelines and open waters hence our model covers most of the fundamental influencing factors that birds have to cope with during migration namely wind and geographic barriers supplementary material table a 1 we investigate how the dynamic environment modulates the birds movement patterns and where and how areas of high concentrations evolve we simulate the migration of nocturnal migrants which account for about two thirds of palaearctic migratory species contrary to diurnal migration where most migrants fly in flocks the vast majority of nocturnal migrants fly singly bruderer 1997 casement 1966 thus we model the individual flight behaviour of the ten most abundant nocturnal long distance passerine migrants hahn et al 2009 supplementary material table b 1 for the start conditions of the simulation we used observed take off bird densities from weather radars across the study area due to the limited data available we focused on a relatively short period of three weeks during peak autumn migration we elucidate the role of the internal state of an individual migrant for decision making processes in combination with potential barriers ahead and atmospheric conditions and we validate temporal and spatial patterns retrieved from the simulations with measurements from weather radars this study shall be a step towards a spatial explicit forecasting of bird movements across large spatial scale within the context of increasing developments of high human made structures e g wind turbines and aviation our simulation approach aims at identifying areas and time periods with increased risk of bird fatalities due to collision desholm et al 2014 liechti et al 2013 2 materials and methods for this study we used the simulation framework following aurbach et al 2018 we used an agent based approach implemented in python python software foundation 2010 to model the individual movement behaviour within a high spatial and temporal resolution wind field and over a highly resolved orography radar data provides the initial information on the spatial and temporal distribution of migration intensity 2 1 behaviour models for i wind compensation ii flight height adaptation and iii obstacle avoidance presented in the work of aurbach et al 2018 as well as a iv coastline behaviour model see 2 3 describe the bird s decision making 2 1 study area and definition of simulated birds using radar locations to simulate europe wide bird migration patterns the initial bird migration intensity and departure time are retrieved from 52 radars including weather radars from france belgium netherlands germany czech republic denmark poland and sweden fig 1 a b as available on the enram data repository http enram github io data repository across the extent of europe nilsson 2018 the information about bird migration patterns is retrieved from reflectivity and radial velocity polar volumes registered between radii of 5 25 km occasionally from 5 40 km from the radar dokter et al 2010 the vertical resolution of the radar data is 200 m height bins up to 2 km above ground level and a temporal resolution of 10 sometimes 15 min we linearly interpolated in time the migration intensity at a 5 minute resolution we then spatially interpolated the migration intensity between the radar locations using a cubic interpolation scheme fig 1a as a proxy for the departure intensity of migratory birds we considered the migration intensity within the first two hours after sunset biebach et al 2000 previous studies report that most of the migrant birds depart during the first few hours after sunset åkesson et al 1996 moore 1987 sjöberg et al 2017 and typically land before sunrise liechti et al 2018 moore 1986 bruderer and liechti 1999 showed that main take off starts 30 min to 1 h after sunset while under favourable weather conditions peak densities are observed 1 2 hours after dusk furthermore we defined departure time at each location according to the peak of migration intensity within the two hour period at 30 minute resolution according to the migration intensity departure times were spatially interpolated using a cubic interpolation scheme fig 1b 2 2 environmental data environmental factors that influence the bird s migration behaviour are mainly related to wind speed and direction orography coastlines and water bodies as well as the patterns of daylight detailed information of coastlines and orography are retrieved from the high resolution 0 1 0 1 km aster global digital elevation model global digital elevation model and high spatial and temporal resolution wind field generated from a mesoscale numerical weather simulation model weather research and forecasting model spatial resolution 10 km x 10 km with information at twenty vertical height bins of 100 m up to 2000 m above ground temporal resolution is 5 min skamarock et al 2008 throughout this paper the convention used is that the wind direction corresponds to the direction from which the wind is coming the simulated wind field is validated while the method for the validation of the wind field is shown in aurbach et al 2018 the mean wind field occurring over the three week period is shown in fig 2 a in autumn birds mainly face unfavourable wind conditions due to the dominant westerly winds towards northern latitudes wind conditions are more unfavourable along the coastlines of northern europe mainly headwinds occur furthermore mainly negative wind profits are observed across the alps with increased height wind conditions are more unfavourable for migration towards the southwest fig 2b lastly the simulation framework accounts for sunset and sunrise as these are crucial parameters that determine the departure and landing of nocturnal migrants the times of sunset and sunrise are calculated at each geographic location within the simulation domain using the julian date and coordinates 2 3 modelling birds in addition to modelling the bird s physiological condition energy model and its decision making such as i wind compensation ii flight height adaptation and iii obstacle avoidance as detailed in aurbach et al 2018 we extend the modelling to include the bird s behaviour in proximity to large water bodies coastline behaviour model migrant landbirds are known to concentrate at coastlines bruderer and liechti 1999 fortin et al 1999 williams and williams 1977 yong and moore 1997 this behaviour is mainly driven by the avoidance behaviour of crossing large water bodies bruderer and liechti 1998 heist et al 2018 different studies indicate that sea crossing only occurs with sufficient fuel load rubolini et al 2002 smolinsky et al 2013 and that crossing behaviour is also related to the orientation of the coastline in relation to the preferred flight direction for instance a weather radar study across the bay of biscay suggests that nocturnal passerines avoid crossing large water bodies and prefer to follow the coastline weisshaupt et al 2018 and that birds encountering coasts perpendicular to their flight direction may be more prone to cross the sea alerstam and pettersson 1977 these observations regarding the decision making on crossing or coasting are also supported by other studies bruderer and liechti 1998 1999 gagnon et al 2011 heist et al 2018 peterson et al 2015 with diehl et al 2003 who observed continuous reorientation behaviour close to coastlines the coastline behaviour model defines i the birds visualisation of the coastal area in the birds field of view and ii the birds decision making in response to the characteristics of the observed area distance to sea sea crossing distance angle between flight direction and coastline this allows the bird to select an optimal migration route according to the bird s energy condition as well as environmental condition such as sunlight wind assistance and expected detour 2 3 1 coastal areas in the bird s field of view coastline behaviour takes place within a distance of 100 km from the coast which is a proxy for coastline sensing and in line with the modelling study from mccabe et al 2018 every half an hour t0 5h the simulated bird observes the orographic features in its flight direction in the case of a large water body coastline behaviour takes place the simulated bird scans the surrounding coastline for i the distance to the coast dsea and ii the distance of sea crossing dcrossing at 5 degree resolution up to 90 from its flight direction fig 3 2 3 2 coastline behaviour and decision making to select a strategy the bird s flight orientation from the coastline is evaluated as well as its energy condition the bird s energy height as defined by pennycuick 2008 determines the possible distance that the simulated bird can still fly as a simple rule sea crossing is only initiated when the orientation of the coastline is more than 45 off the preferred flight direction in the case where a bird is energetically capable of crossing eheight dcrossing and the bird also experiences supportive wind conditions wind support estimated using the bird s ground speed vxy that enable the bird to complete the crossing before sunrise tsunrise tsunrise vxy dcrossing the bird maintains its flight direction across the open water in the case where a bird can follow the coastline for at least half an hour t0 5h vxy dsea within the 45 from its flight direction the bird initializes coasting in all other cases a bird stops over to rest and refuel 2 4 model initiation each simulated night we model the migratory flight of 1 million simulated birds these birds are from a distribution of the ten most common palaearctic long distance migratory birds hahn et al 2009 following the study of hahn et al 2009 the species relative abundance is used to attribute species characteristics to the simulated birds accordingly supplementary material table b 1 body mass and wing length data are retrieved from the swiss ornithological institute soi https www vogelwarte ch en birds birds of switzerland in addition a preferred direction randomly generated from a circular normal distribution mean 230 sigma 15 based on the seasonal flight directions retrieved from the radar data was attributed to each individual bird in order to increase the stochasticity of the birds behaviour every 5 min the bird s preferred direction deviates up to 5 randomly chosen from a normal distribution with a mean of the original preferred direction preferred direction at release the simulated birds departing from the departure area at departure time see 2 1 are released 100 m above ground and initialize migration additionally at the limits of the departure area simulated birds are released into the domain along a broad front supplementary material fig c 1 continuously throughout the night at the flight altitude and time as observed in the radar 2 5 model assessment and validation for validating the simulation results we excluded radars close to the atlantic coast as incoming birds from england or norway might bias the data here further we excluded the first two hours after sunset that were used to define the take off intensity and we excluded the hour before sunrise to avoid interference with diurnal migration additionally the validation excludes radars directly influenced by the continuous broad front migration that originates from the northeast edge of the simulation domain 2 5 1 spatial validation of migration intensity the spatial distribution of bird migration intensity is evaluated over the first 2000 m a g l we considered 17 weather radars for the validation 3 1 1 fig 5 we compared the measured and the predicted relative mean bird migration intensity per night relative to sum of bird intensity measured by radar using pearson correlation additionally we show the influence of the different radar locations on the validation results using the ratio between relative simulated and measured intensity to normalize the ratio to zero the following equation was applied eqs 1 2 eq 1 if ratio 1 rati o norm 1 ratio 1 eq 2 if ratio 1 rati o norm ratio 1 2 5 2 temporal validation of migration intensity following the same approach as aurbach et al 2018 we compared the temporal profiles of measured and simulated migration intensity at the 17 radars integrated over heights the error calculation is derived from an hourly comparison between measurement and simulation then we summed the hourly relative errors to come up with the normalized temporal summed error we finally show the normalized temporal summed error over the different radar locations according to their latitude 2 5 3 vertical validation of migration intensity following the same approach as aurbach et al 2018 we compared the vertical profiles of measured and simulated migration intensity for comparison we use data of the ornithological bird radar located at the swiss ornithological institute in sempach switzerland for the same three week long period the first 50 m above ground level were excluded from the comparison as this low level measurement volume of the radar is biased for the comparison we use the simulated bird migration intensity of a circle of 50 km distance around the radar location 2 6 model analysis 2 6 1 spatial pattern of migration intensity the spatial pattern of bird migration intensity is evaluated at spatial resolution of 10 by 10 km across europe we calculated the mean relative migration intensity across the simulated nights to map areas of concentration of migratory birds to further quantify the spatial consistency in relative bird migration intensity patterns across europe we show the normalized standard deviation mean divided by standard deviation 3 results 3 1 model assessment and validation 3 1 1 spatial validation of migration intensity with a mean correlation coefficient of 0 69 across the 19 simulated nights the spatial migration intensity patterns are well explained by the simulations the daily mean correlation coefficients are presented in fig 4 during nearly all nights except september 25 migration intensity is over predicted at the southern radar north of the pyrenees at bordeaux frbor fig 5 overall in 63 of the simulated nights migration intensity is over predicted at the two southernmost radars momuy frmom and bordeaux frbor the location of each radar has an influence on migration intensity predictions fig 6 while simulations at southerly radars mainly over predict migration intensity simulations at northerly radars mainly under predict migration intensity 3 1 2 temporal validation of migration intensity the predicted temporal migration intensity patterns are in good agreement with observations fig 7 the mean temporal error is 0 29 no effect of latitude on the mean temporal error can be observed but there tends to be higher variability at northern latitudes 3 1 3 validation of vertical migration intensity the simulation predicts well the vertical distribution of bird migration intensity at the bird radar located in sempach fig 8 b the mean difference between simulation and data is 137 m with a mean summed vertical error of 0 26 fig 8a 3 2 model analysis 3 2 1 spatial pattern of migration intensity over the three week migration period the observations suggest low migration intensities at the coastlines with an exception at the french west coast fig 9 a b north of the pyrenees at the bay of biscay a hotspot area of bird migration established another hotspot was apparent in central france as well as northern germany the simulation further implies higher migration intensities in central france compared to the rest of europe while the increased measured intensities in northern germany are not confirmed by the simulations instead the simulations suggest high migration intensities in southern germany and north of the alps the consistency in migration intensities across the simulated nights is shown by the normalized standard deviation fig 9c d both measurement and simulation imply high consistency across france mainly close to the pyrenees low consistency in migration intensities is indicated at northern latitudes towards the edges of the domain there is higher variability indicating that the higher inaccuracy has to be interpreted carefully 3 2 2 environmental influence on migration patterns 3 2 2 1 drift and ground speeds simulated birds mainly drift along coastlines fig 10 a additionally an increased drift from the preferred direction is observed over complex terrain such as over the alps and jura mountains the pyrenees as well as in proximity of the carpathians for instance the observed hot spot area north of the pyrenees is influenced by the effect of the coastline of the bay of biscay and by the pyrenees both landscape elements lead to avoidance behaviour which leads to the observed increase in bird intensity during the three week period there is a general increase in ground speeds from northern europe to southern europe fig 10b simulated ground speeds are lower over complex terrain i e pyrenees massif central jura mountains alps compared to flat terrain while a reduced ground speed is also observed along coastlines during the three week period there is a general decrease in energy costs from north to south fig 10c the highest energy costs occurred over southeast of france an area shaped by the massif central also along other complex terrain specific energy is increased such as along the pyrenees ridge the jura mountains and north of the alps this increase represents about twice the energy costs compared to the energy costs in favourable areas such as in western france ca 150 jkm 1 compared to 70 jkm 1 for passerine birds moreover there is an increased specific energy cost along the northern coastlines of europe france belgium netherlands denmark and sweden which again require about twice the energy costs compared to favourable areas the lowest specific energy costs occur mainly over france north of the pyrenees the mean energy costs observed over europe are about 100 jkm 1 in the case of a movement of about 300 km migration distance that well represents the distance a bird covers in one night the energy costs under unfavourable conditions ca 150 j km are about 19 of the initial energy supply with 237 kj being the initial energy supply 150 j km 300 km 45 kj d 1 45 kj d 1 237 kj 0 189 d 1 in comparison about 13 of the initial energy costs are needed during mean favourable conditions ca 100 j km and 9 are needed during favourable conditions ca 70 j km this means that under unfavourable conditions a bird can only cover about 5 days in comparison to 11 days during favourable conditions 237 kj 45 kj d 1 5 27 d 70 jkm 1 300 km 21 kj d 1 237 kj 21 kj d 1 11 29 d it should be noted that a bird would probably not continue migrating until it has no more energy left and without refueling at a stop over site the calculation here still provides an estimate on the potential duration of migration 3 2 2 2 untypical bird movement behaviors mainly explained by wind conditions in line with radar measurements the simulation shows unexpected bird movements during some nights of the three week period e g september 23 fig 11 the northwards movements are likely related to the local wind conditions during the night of the 24 september birds drift to the atlantic sea between england and scandinavia further during the 25 september there is a northerly movement across southern sweden 4 discussion we developed an agent based model to simulate and forecast the spatio temporal dynamics of bird migration at a continental scale we used up to date knowledge on migration behavior to formulate the bird s response to its environment such as to the interlinked environmental information of the orography e g presence of mountain or water body weather conditions specifically wind speed and wind direction and sun information time of sunset and sunrise we used high resolution environmental data to update the bird s behavior every five minutes running the simulations on a cluster computer we were able to simulate one million birds in four hours 10 000 per cluster this high performance computing enables forecasting the migration intensity at a fine spatio temporal resolution fine scale mapping of migration intensity is essential for informing stakeholders to reduce collision risks of birds with airplanes metz et al 2017 or renewable energies such as wind turbines liechti et al 2013 masden and cook 2016 in the near future this model aims to map migration intensity during both the spring and the autumn migration season furthermore the simulation framework shall be applied to novel environments such as for instance northern america such a transfer is possible due to the generalized behavioural rules the model is based on in this study we used measured migration intensity retrieved from the eumet opera european network of weather radar huuskonen et al 2014 shamoun baranes et al 2014 i to define the nightly take off intensity ii and to validate our model we distributed one million birds in the simulation domain according to the migration intensity measured within two hours after sunset by radar it allows us to create a realistic setup for each simulated night however our linear interpolation between radar sites neglects the influence of topography or patchy distribution of suitable stopover sites hansson et al 2002 martin and karr 1986 furthermore besides being limited by data availability we only considered birds observed during the first 2 hs after sunset as departing nonetheless although in lower numbers birds are also observed to depart during night åkesson et al 1996 bolshakov et al 2007 moore and aborn 1996 müller et al 2016 further development of the model should include refuelling and departure decision making based on fuel reserves eikenaar and bairlein 2014 schaub and jenni 2000 jenni and schaub 2003 habitat quality at the stopover site ktitorov et al 2008 and weather conditions schaub et al 2004 for instance our simulations predict a daily energy consumption of the initial fuel load of about 9 in favourable and of about 19 in unfavourable conditions modelling the same birds during their entire migratory journey may enable to gain insights into geographical variation in stopover duration with a better understanding on the birds energy constraints along their route drever and hrachowitz 2017 further it allows to better understand the temporal dynamics of broad front migration nilsson et al 2018 overall the simulated migration intensity showed high spatial and temporal correlation with the migration intensity measured by weather radars in particular our model captured the reverse migration movements measured by the radar on a few nights with strong headwind indeed unfavourable wind conditions negatively impact the birds capabilities to compensate for wind drift leading to reverse movements bruderer and liechti 1998 in addition the model accurately simulates the vertical distribution of the birds flight altitudes as shown in a validation using a dedicated bird radar the ability to model the birds flight altitude at fine scale is particularly important for estimating the collision risks with human made structures aschwanden et al 2018 a feature missing in most existing migration models nevertheless our simulation tended to underestimate the migration intensity at northern latitudes and to overestimate the migration intensity in southern europe the observed underprediction of migration intensity in northern europe is likely caused by the lack of information on migration fluxes at the domain s edge between norway and the british islands further migrants in northern europe experienced stronger headwinds than further south lower migration intensity predicted by our model compared to radar measurements may be explained by a better efficiency of birds to fly in headwind condition than we have modelled our model may not cover particular flight strategies that allow birds to effectively fly in headwind conditions the ability to fly in headwind conditions can be particularly important when the environmental conditions force migrants to leave increasingly inhospitable habitat during autumn migration bolus et al 2017 in southern europe the simulation overpredicts the high migration intensity measured by radar north of the pyrenees a renowned hotspot in bird migration arizaga et al 2011 galarza and tellería 2003 on one hand the reason for this accumulation of birds is a result of the higher wind profits in central france compared to the region closer to the pyrenees suggesting a fast influx of birds towards north of the pyrenees on the other hand the hot spot area is fed with birds that circumvent the geographic barriers namely alps jura massif central as well as the pyrenees along their northern ridge these mountain ranges build up a large geographic barrier that influences the wind patterns and shapes the migration patterns aurbach et al 2018 in addition sea avoidance behaviour modelled herein at the bay of biscay further increases the number of simulated birds accumulating north of the pyrenees we note that the weather radar data used for the simulation and validation also include measurement biases as for instance radars located at high altitudes a s l may overlook bird migration passing at lower altitudes liechti et al 2019 due to the limited amount of radar data data only covers a three week period and missing data at significant arrival departure areas after before sea crossing such as at the northern border of spain and south england we abstained to do a more detailed validation of the different behaviour models to investigate the sensitivity of model parameters large datasets are needed as well as spatial and temporal shortcomings in radar measurements have to be taken into account 5 conclusion to summarize we show that large scale simulations of bird migration intensity well comply with the measurements of bird migration by weather radars our agent based model is therefore a seminal tool for studying and investigating the behaviour of migratory birds on the local regional and continental scale further simulations offer the possibility to better understand the connectivity of migration movements and environmental conditions we show that geographical barriers such as coastlines and complex terrain have a profound effect on bird intensity as well as on the bird s performance however the cumulative effect of additional influencing factors such as rain cloud cover and visibility or pressure and temperature but also food availability at stop over sites might still be significant for the results therefore we suggest aiming for including these influencing factors in future work in view of the increasing anthropogenic influence on the environment and therefore also on bird populations knowledge on spatial and temporal concentrations of bird migration is crucial to reduce the negative impact on bird migration future simulation studies shall not only predict spatial and temporal concentrations smith and deppe 2007 but analyse the anthropogenic influence and associated risk

24953,the spatial and temporal patterns of broad front bird migration are governed by the geospatial distributions of landmasses mountain ranges and weather conditions these distributions interact with the birds innate program during migration and are critical to successful migration hence favourable environmental conditions for migration consequently lead to spatio temporal concentrations and the evolution of specific migratory flyways based on the aerodynamic properties of the ten most abundant nocturnal long distance migrants we developed a computational framework to simulate millions of individual trajectories across europe using an agent based simulation approach we simulated a three week period of autumn migration with a temporal resolution of 30 s departure conditions were derived from bird densities observed within the first two hours after sunset which were extracted from the weather radar network individual itineraries were strongly influenced by the behavioural reactions to the environment such as the wind flow coastlines and mountain ranges wind speed and direction are among the key factors that shape migration patterns such as reverse movements observed within some nights accumulation of migration was triggered by the combined effect of geographic barriers coastlines mountain ranges and wind the overall result of the simulation corresponds well with the large scale pattern of bird migration intensities measured across the study area for instance the high migration intensity observed between the atlantic coast and the pyrenees our model framework conjoins all important domains such as the birds preconditions and behavioural scope as well as the spatio temporal dynamics of the environment however for the time being we cannot decide whether local discrepancies between model and data are due to environmental effects that are not yet captured by our simulation i e effect of rain on migration intensity or caused by differences in the sensitivity of the local weather radar systems due to the limited time period and lack of more accurate data for validation our findings are preliminary further progress in data quality and hopefully better access of bird profiles from the continent wide weather radar network will allow to improve model performance and implement a bird migration forecasting similar to weather forecasts apart from assessing conflicts between human activities and bird movements this would greatly enhance our understanding of biomass flow on a large scale keywords bird migration flight behaviour ecological

specific route are determined by intrinsic and extrinsic factors it is assumed that the energy balance the time required for migration and the risk of predation are the main factors contributing to this adaptive behaviour alerstam and lindström 1990 thus the rapid course of changing environmental conditions during migration requires an almost continuous process of decision making as birds decision making is diverse timing as well as migration routes can vary considerably between years aside from intrinsic aspects such as internal clocks gwinner 1977 and body conditions alerstam and lindström 1990 sjöberg et al 2015 highly dynamic environmental factors such as wind flow bruderer et al 1995 mclaren et al 2012 and food availability marra et al 2005 tøttrup et al 2012 modulate the birds decision for departure landing and route choice jenni and schaub 2003 shamoun baranes et al 2017 selecting supporting wind conditions can save energy but also time weber et al 1998 liechti and bruderer 1998 and has been confirmed by several studies bruderer et al 1995 kemp et al 2013 dokter et al 2010 further studies demonstrated that departure decisions of songbirds are strongly correlated to large fat reserves and profitable winds deppe et al 2015 schmaljohann and eikenaar 2017 from a geographic point of view bird migration is known to concentrate within valleys bruderer and liechti 1990 liechti et al 1996 and along shorelines lensink et al 2002 fortin et al 1999 heist et al 2018 peterson et al 2015 often in combination with specific weather conditions erni et al 2002 show that wind and rain are key factors for temporal concentration of bird migration generally migration intensity has a positive correlation with wind profit a measure for tailwind support and a negative correlation with rain duration as unfavourable weather can delay departure and lead to instantaneous high migration peaks zugstau bruderer 1980 in order to achieve realistic predictions of temporal and spatial concentrations all these effects should be considered in a model approach many researchers have attempted to describe animal migration behaviour chapman et al 2011 hedenström and alerstam 1995 liechti et al 2000 pennycuick 2008 and to model their migration patterns and hotspots aurbach et al 2018 bauer and klaassen 2013 erni et al 2003 fern and morrison 2017 kölzsch et al 2018 liechti et al 2013 mclaren et al 2014 stoddard et al 1983 van belle et al 2007 however to our knowledge no attempt has been made to build an agent based model that combines all relevant factors such as internal condition external factors motion capacities and navigation capacities tang and bennett 2010 we model at the scale of individual bird migration behaviour that follows an optimal flight strategy approach minimizing flight duration and energy costs alerstam 2011 alerstam and lindström 1990 in previous work we modelled flight behaviour over complex terrain within a realistic wind field aurbach et al 2018 now we extend this simulation approach to a much larger geographic scope covering a major part of western europe in addition we incorporate birds decision making processes in proximity to shorelines and open waters hence our model covers most of the fundamental influencing factors that birds have to cope with during migration namely wind and geographic barriers supplementary material table a 1 we investigate how the dynamic environment modulates the birds movement patterns and where and how areas of high concentrations evolve we simulate the migration of nocturnal migrants which account for about two thirds of palaearctic migratory species contrary to diurnal migration where most migrants fly in flocks the vast majority of nocturnal migrants fly singly bruderer 1997 casement 1966 thus we model the individual flight behaviour of the ten most abundant nocturnal long distance passerine migrants hahn et al 2009 supplementary material table b 1 for the start conditions of the simulation we used observed take off bird densities from weather radars across the study area due to the limited data available we focused on a relatively short period of three weeks during peak autumn migration we elucidate the role of the internal state of an individual migrant for decision making processes in combination with potential barriers ahead and atmospheric conditions and we validate temporal and spatial patterns retrieved from the simulations with measurements from weather radars this study shall be a step towards a spatial explicit forecasting of bird movements across large spatial scale within the context of increasing developments of high human made structures e g wind turbines and aviation our simulation approach aims at identifying areas and time periods with increased risk of bird fatalities due to collision desholm et al 2014 liechti et al 2013 2 materials and methods for this study we used the simulation framework following aurbach et al 2018 we used an agent based approach implemented in python python software foundation 2010 to model the individual movement behaviour within a high spatial and temporal resolution wind field and over a highly resolved orography radar data provides the initial information on the spatial and temporal distribution of migration intensity 2 1 behaviour models for i wind compensation ii flight height adaptation and iii obstacle avoidance presented in the work of aurbach et al 2018 as well as a iv coastline behaviour model see 2 3 describe the bird s decision making 2 1 study area and definition of simulated birds using radar locations to simulate europe wide bird migration patterns the initial bird migration intensity and departure time are retrieved from 52 radars including weather radars from france belgium netherlands germany czech republic denmark poland and sweden fig 1 a b as available on the enram data repository http enram github io data repository across the extent of europe nilsson 2018 the information about bird migration patterns is retrieved from reflectivity and radial velocity polar volumes registered between radii of 5 25 km occasionally from 5 40 km from the radar dokter et al 2010 the vertical resolution of the radar data is 200 m height bins up to 2 km above ground level and a temporal resolution of 10 sometimes 15 min we linearly interpolated in time the migration intensity at a 5 minute resolution we then spatially interpolated the migration intensity between the radar locations using a cubic interpolation scheme fig 1a as a proxy for the departure intensity of migratory birds we considered the migration intensity within the first two hours after sunset biebach et al 2000 previous studies report that most of the migrant birds depart during the first few hours after sunset åkesson et al 1996 moore 1987 sjöberg et al 2017 and typically land before sunrise liechti et al 2018 moore 1986 bruderer and liechti 1999 showed that main take off starts 30 min to 1 h after sunset while under favourable weather conditions peak densities are observed 1 2 hours after dusk furthermore we defined departure time at each location according to the peak of migration intensity within the two hour period at 30 minute resolution according to the migration intensity departure times were spatially interpolated using a cubic interpolation scheme fig 1b 2 2 environmental data environmental factors that influence the bird s migration behaviour are mainly related to wind speed and direction orography coastlines and water bodies as well as the patterns of daylight detailed information of coastlines and orography are retrieved from the high resolution 0 1 0 1 km aster global digital elevation model global digital elevation model and high spatial and temporal resolution wind field generated from a mesoscale numerical weather simulation model weather research and forecasting model spatial resolution 10 km x 10 km with information at twenty vertical height bins of 100 m up to 2000 m above ground temporal resolution is 5 min skamarock et al 2008 throughout this paper the convention used is that the wind direction corresponds to the direction from which the wind is coming the simulated wind field is validated while the method for the validation of the wind field is shown in aurbach et al 2018 the mean wind field occurring over the three week period is shown in fig 2 a in autumn birds mainly face unfavourable wind conditions due to the dominant westerly winds towards northern latitudes wind conditions are more unfavourable along the coastlines of northern europe mainly headwinds occur furthermore mainly negative wind profits are observed across the alps with increased height wind conditions are more unfavourable for migration towards the southwest fig 2b lastly the simulation framework accounts for sunset and sunrise as these are crucial parameters that determine the departure and landing of nocturnal migrants the times of sunset and sunrise are calculated at each geographic location within the simulation domain using the julian date and coordinates 2 3 modelling birds in addition to modelling the bird s physiological condition energy model and its decision making such as i wind compensation ii flight height adaptation and iii obstacle avoidance as detailed in aurbach et al 2018 we extend the modelling to include the bird s behaviour in proximity to large water bodies coastline behaviour model migrant landbirds are known to concentrate at coastlines bruderer and liechti 1999 fortin et al 1999 williams and williams 1977 yong and moore 1997 this behaviour is mainly driven by the avoidance behaviour of crossing large water bodies bruderer and liechti 1998 heist et al 2018 different studies indicate that sea crossing only occurs with sufficient fuel load rubolini et al 2002 smolinsky et al 2013 and that crossing behaviour is also related to the orientation of the coastline in relation to the preferred flight direction for instance a weather radar study across the bay of biscay suggests that nocturnal passerines avoid crossing large water bodies and prefer to follow the coastline weisshaupt et al 2018 and that birds encountering coasts perpendicular to their flight direction may be more prone to cross the sea alerstam and pettersson 1977 these observations regarding the decision making on crossing or coasting are also supported by other studies bruderer and liechti 1998 1999 gagnon et al 2011 heist et al 2018 peterson et al 2015 with diehl et al 2003 who observed continuous reorientation behaviour close to coastlines the coastline behaviour model defines i the birds visualisation of the coastal area in the birds field of view and ii the birds decision making in response to the characteristics of the observed area distance to sea sea crossing distance angle between flight direction and coastline this allows the bird to select an optimal migration route according to the bird s energy condition as well as environmental condition such as sunlight wind assistance and expected detour 2 3 1 coastal areas in the bird s field of view coastline behaviour takes place within a distance of 100 km from the coast which is a proxy for coastline sensing and in line with the modelling study from mccabe et al 2018 every half an hour t0 5h the simulated bird observes the orographic features in its flight direction in the case of a large water body coastline behaviour takes place the simulated bird scans the surrounding coastline for i the distance to the coast dsea and ii the distance of sea crossing dcrossing at 5 degree resolution up to 90 from its flight direction fig 3 2 3 2 coastline behaviour and decision making to select a strategy the bird s flight orientation from the coastline is evaluated as well as its energy condition the bird s energy height as defined by pennycuick 2008 determines the possible distance that the simulated bird can still fly as a simple rule sea crossing is only initiated when the orientation of the coastline is more than 45 off the preferred flight direction in the case where a bird is energetically capable of crossing eheight dcrossing and the bird also experiences supportive wind conditions wind support estimated using the bird s ground speed vxy that enable the bird to complete the crossing before sunrise tsunrise tsunrise vxy dcrossing the bird maintains its flight direction across the open water in the case where a bird can follow the coastline for at least half an hour t0 5h vxy dsea within the 45 from its flight direction the bird initializes coasting in all other cases a bird stops over to rest and refuel 2 4 model initiation each simulated night we model the migratory flight of 1 million simulated birds these birds are from a distribution of the ten most common palaearctic long distance migratory birds hahn et al 2009 following the study of hahn et al 2009 the species relative abundance is used to attribute species characteristics to the simulated birds accordingly supplementary material table b 1 body mass and wing length data are retrieved from the swiss ornithological institute soi https www vogelwarte ch en birds birds of switzerland in addition a preferred direction randomly generated from a circular normal distribution mean 230 sigma 15 based on the seasonal flight directions retrieved from the radar data was attributed to each individual bird in order to increase the stochasticity of the birds behaviour every 5 min the bird s preferred direction deviates up to 5 randomly chosen from a normal distribution with a mean of the original preferred direction preferred direction at release the simulated birds departing from the departure area at departure time see 2 1 are released 100 m above ground and initialize migration additionally at the limits of the departure area simulated birds are released into the domain along a broad front supplementary material fig c 1 continuously throughout the night at the flight altitude and time as observed in the radar 2 5 model assessment and validation for validating the simulation results we excluded radars close to the atlantic coast as incoming birds from england or norway might bias the data here further we excluded the first two hours after sunset that were used to define the take off intensity and we excluded the hour before sunrise to avoid interference with diurnal migration additionally the validation excludes radars directly influenced by the continuous broad front migration that originates from the northeast edge of the simulation domain 2 5 1 spatial validation of migration intensity the spatial distribution of bird migration intensity is evaluated over the first 2000 m a g l we considered 17 weather radars for the validation 3 1 1 fig 5 we compared the measured and the predicted relative mean bird migration intensity per night relative to sum of bird intensity measured by radar using pearson correlation additionally we show the influence of the different radar locations on the validation results using the ratio between relative simulated and measured intensity to normalize the ratio to zero the following equation was applied eqs 1 2 eq 1 if ratio 1 rati o norm 1 ratio 1 eq 2 if ratio 1 rati o norm ratio 1 2 5 2 temporal validation of migration intensity following the same approach as aurbach et al 2018 we compared the temporal profiles of measured and simulated migration intensity at the 17 radars integrated over heights the error calculation is derived from an hourly comparison between measurement and simulation then we summed the hourly relative errors to come up with the normalized temporal summed error we finally show the normalized temporal summed error over the different radar locations according to their latitude 2 5 3 vertical validation of migration intensity following the same approach as aurbach et al 2018 we compared the vertical profiles of measured and simulated migration intensity for comparison we use data of the ornithological bird radar located at the swiss ornithological institute in sempach switzerland for the same three week long period the first 50 m above ground level were excluded from the comparison as this low level measurement volume of the radar is biased for the comparison we use the simulated bird migration intensity of a circle of 50 km distance around the radar location 2 6 model analysis 2 6 1 spatial pattern of migration intensity the spatial pattern of bird migration intensity is evaluated at spatial resolution of 10 by 10 km across europe we calculated the mean relative migration intensity across the simulated nights to map areas of concentration of migratory birds to further quantify the spatial consistency in relative bird migration intensity patterns across europe we show the normalized standard deviation mean divided by standard deviation 3 results 3 1 model assessment and validation 3 1 1 spatial validation of migration intensity with a mean correlation coefficient of 0 69 across the 19 simulated nights the spatial migration intensity patterns are well explained by the simulations the daily mean correlation coefficients are presented in fig 4 during nearly all nights except september 25 migration intensity is over predicted at the southern radar north of the pyrenees at bordeaux frbor fig 5 overall in 63 of the simulated nights migration intensity is over predicted at the two southernmost radars momuy frmom and bordeaux frbor the location of each radar has an influence on migration intensity predictions fig 6 while simulations at southerly radars mainly over predict migration intensity simulations at northerly radars mainly under predict migration intensity 3 1 2 temporal validation of migration intensity the predicted temporal migration intensity patterns are in good agreement with observations fig 7 the mean temporal error is 0 29 no effect of latitude on the mean temporal error can be observed but there tends to be higher variability at northern latitudes 3 1 3 validation of vertical migration intensity the simulation predicts well the vertical distribution of bird migration intensity at the bird radar located in sempach fig 8 b the mean difference between simulation and data is 137 m with a mean summed vertical error of 0 26 fig 8a 3 2 model analysis 3 2 1 spatial pattern of migration intensity over the three week migration period the observations suggest low migration intensities at the coastlines with an exception at the french west coast fig 9 a b north of the pyrenees at the bay of biscay a hotspot area of bird migration established another hotspot was apparent in central france as well as northern germany the simulation further implies higher migration intensities in central france compared to the rest of europe while the increased measured intensities in northern germany are not confirmed by the simulations instead the simulations suggest high migration intensities in southern germany and north of the alps the consistency in migration intensities across the simulated nights is shown by the normalized standard deviation fig 9c d both measurement and simulation imply high consistency across france mainly close to the pyrenees low consistency in migration intensities is indicated at northern latitudes towards the edges of the domain there is higher variability indicating that the higher inaccuracy has to be interpreted carefully 3 2 2 environmental influence on migration patterns 3 2 2 1 drift and ground speeds simulated birds mainly drift along coastlines fig 10 a additionally an increased drift from the preferred direction is observed over complex terrain such as over the alps and jura mountains the pyrenees as well as in proximity of the carpathians for instance the observed hot spot area north of the pyrenees is influenced by the effect of the coastline of the bay of biscay and by the pyrenees both landscape elements lead to avoidance behaviour which leads to the observed increase in bird intensity during the three week period there is a general increase in ground speeds from northern europe to southern europe fig 10b simulated ground speeds are lower over complex terrain i e pyrenees massif central jura mountains alps compared to flat terrain while a reduced ground speed is also observed along coastlines during the three week period there is a general decrease in energy costs from north to south fig 10c the highest energy costs occurred over southeast of france an area shaped by the massif central also along other complex terrain specific energy is increased such as along the pyrenees ridge the jura mountains and north of the alps this increase represents about twice the energy costs compared to the energy costs in favourable areas such as in western france ca 150 jkm 1 compared to 70 jkm 1 for passerine birds moreover there is an increased specific energy cost along the northern coastlines of europe france belgium netherlands denmark and sweden which again require about twice the energy costs compared to favourable areas the lowest specific energy costs occur mainly over france north of the pyrenees the mean energy costs observed over europe are about 100 jkm 1 in the case of a movement of about 300 km migration distance that well represents the distance a bird covers in one night the energy costs under unfavourable conditions ca 150 j km are about 19 of the initial energy supply with 237 kj being the initial energy supply 150 j km 300 km 45 kj d 1 45 kj d 1 237 kj 0 189 d 1 in comparison about 13 of the initial energy costs are needed during mean favourable conditions ca 100 j km and 9 are needed during favourable conditions ca 70 j km this means that under unfavourable conditions a bird can only cover about 5 days in comparison to 11 days during favourable conditions 237 kj 45 kj d 1 5 27 d 70 jkm 1 300 km 21 kj d 1 237 kj 21 kj d 1 11 29 d it should be noted that a bird would probably not continue migrating until it has no more energy left and without refueling at a stop over site the calculation here still provides an estimate on the potential duration of migration 3 2 2 2 untypical bird movement behaviors mainly explained by wind conditions in line with radar measurements the simulation shows unexpected bird movements during some nights of the three week period e g september 23 fig 11 the northwards movements are likely related to the local wind conditions during the night of the 24 september birds drift to the atlantic sea between england and scandinavia further during the 25 september there is a northerly movement across southern sweden 4 discussion we developed an agent based model to simulate and forecast the spatio temporal dynamics of bird migration at a continental scale we used up to date knowledge on migration behavior to formulate the bird s response to its environment such as to the interlinked environmental information of the orography e g presence of mountain or water body weather conditions specifically wind speed and wind direction and sun information time of sunset and sunrise we used high resolution environmental data to update the bird s behavior every five minutes running the simulations on a cluster computer we were able to simulate one million birds in four hours 10 000 per cluster this high performance computing enables forecasting the migration intensity at a fine spatio temporal resolution fine scale mapping of migration intensity is essential for informing stakeholders to reduce collision risks of birds with airplanes metz et al 2017 or renewable energies such as wind turbines liechti et al 2013 masden and cook 2016 in the near future this model aims to map migration intensity during both the spring and the autumn migration season furthermore the simulation framework shall be applied to novel environments such as for instance northern america such a transfer is possible due to the generalized behavioural rules the model is based on in this study we used measured migration intensity retrieved from the eumet opera european network of weather radar huuskonen et al 2014 shamoun baranes et al 2014 i to define the nightly take off intensity ii and to validate our model we distributed one million birds in the simulation domain according to the migration intensity measured within two hours after sunset by radar it allows us to create a realistic setup for each simulated night however our linear interpolation between radar sites neglects the influence of topography or patchy distribution of suitable stopover sites hansson et al 2002 martin and karr 1986 furthermore besides being limited by data availability we only considered birds observed during the first 2 hs after sunset as departing nonetheless although in lower numbers birds are also observed to depart during night åkesson et al 1996 bolshakov et al 2007 moore and aborn 1996 müller et al 2016 further development of the model should include refuelling and departure decision making based on fuel reserves eikenaar and bairlein 2014 schaub and jenni 2000 jenni and schaub 2003 habitat quality at the stopover site ktitorov et al 2008 and weather conditions schaub et al 2004 for instance our simulations predict a daily energy consumption of the initial fuel load of about 9 in favourable and of about 19 in unfavourable conditions modelling the same birds during their entire migratory journey may enable to gain insights into geographical variation in stopover duration with a better understanding on the birds energy constraints along their route drever and hrachowitz 2017 further it allows to better understand the temporal dynamics of broad front migration nilsson et al 2018 overall the simulated migration intensity showed high spatial and temporal correlation with the migration intensity measured by weather radars in particular our model captured the reverse migration movements measured by the radar on a few nights with strong headwind indeed unfavourable wind conditions negatively impact the birds capabilities to compensate for wind drift leading to reverse movements bruderer and liechti 1998 in addition the model accurately simulates the vertical distribution of the birds flight altitudes as shown in a validation using a dedicated bird radar the ability to model the birds flight altitude at fine scale is particularly important for estimating the collision risks with human made structures aschwanden et al 2018 a feature missing in most existing migration models nevertheless our simulation tended to underestimate the migration intensity at northern latitudes and to overestimate the migration intensity in southern europe the observed underprediction of migration intensity in northern europe is likely caused by the lack of information on migration fluxes at the domain s edge between norway and the british islands further migrants in northern europe experienced stronger headwinds than further south lower migration intensity predicted by our model compared to radar measurements may be explained by a better efficiency of birds to fly in headwind condition than we have modelled our model may not cover particular flight strategies that allow birds to effectively fly in headwind conditions the ability to fly in headwind conditions can be particularly important when the environmental conditions force migrants to leave increasingly inhospitable habitat during autumn migration bolus et al 2017 in southern europe the simulation overpredicts the high migration intensity measured by radar north of the pyrenees a renowned hotspot in bird migration arizaga et al 2011 galarza and tellería 2003 on one hand the reason for this accumulation of birds is a result of the higher wind profits in central france compared to the region closer to the pyrenees suggesting a fast influx of birds towards north of the pyrenees on the other hand the hot spot area is fed with birds that circumvent the geographic barriers namely alps jura massif central as well as the pyrenees along their northern ridge these mountain ranges build up a large geographic barrier that influences the wind patterns and shapes the migration patterns aurbach et al 2018 in addition sea avoidance behaviour modelled herein at the bay of biscay further increases the number of simulated birds accumulating north of the pyrenees we note that the weather radar data used for the simulation and validation also include measurement biases as for instance radars located at high altitudes a s l may overlook bird migration passing at lower altitudes liechti et al 2019 due to the limited amount of radar data data only covers a three week period and missing data at significant arrival departure areas after before sea crossing such as at the northern border of spain and south england we abstained to do a more detailed validation of the different behaviour models to investigate the sensitivity of model parameters large datasets are needed as well as spatial and temporal shortcomings in radar measurements have to be taken into account 5 conclusion to summarize we show that large scale simulations of bird migration intensity well comply with the measurements of bird migration by weather radars our agent based model is therefore a seminal tool for studying and investigating the behaviour of migratory birds on the local regional and continental scale further simulations offer the possibility to better understand the connectivity of migration movements and environmental conditions we show that geographical barriers such as coastlines and complex terrain have a profound effect on bird intensity as well as on the bird s performance however the cumulative effect of additional influencing factors such as rain cloud cover and visibility or pressure and temperature but also food availability at stop over sites might still be significant for the results therefore we suggest aiming for including these influencing factors in future work in view of the increasing anthropogenic influence on the environment and therefore also on bird populations knowledge on spatial and temporal concentrations of bird migration is crucial to reduce the negative impact on bird migration future simulation studies shall not only predict spatial and temporal concentrations smith and deppe 2007 but analyse the anthropogenic influence and associated risk on bird mortality such as collisions with airplanes metz et al 2017 or renewable energies liechti et al 2013 masden and cook 2016 credit authorship contribution statement annika aurbach

24954,many ecological processes that play important roles in ecosystems occur over long time periods and can therefore not always be properly studied with short term studies however researchers have to face many challenges while setting up long term ecological studies including the choice of relevant data analysis methods and the design of the study i e sampling frequency number of sites etc this literature review based on 99 original studies provides an overview of methodological choices used to analyse the effects of abiotic parameters on biological communities on a long term scale to this end the main characteristics of study design were recorded e g sampling frequency duration taxa variables and the different data analysis tools summarised and analysed we found that long term ecological studies focusing on the effects of environmental factors on biotic parameters mostly concerned aquatic habitats studies substantially varied in their design although many of them had similar aims univariate methods almost entirely performed by means of linear modelling and correlation tests were used more often than multivariate methods finally constrained and unconstrained ordination methods were used equally and other data analysis tools were rare finally we created a decision key to help researchers choose the appropriate analysis tools for their specific long term study keywords lter data analysis sampling multivariate data modelling statistics 1 introduction the effects of environmental parameters on biological communities can occur at different time scales from less than a day e g effect of tides to several millennia e g effect of continental glaciation and at different spatial scales from less than a plot e g effect of microtopography to the entire earth e g effect of climate change franklin et al 1990 magnuson 1990 although various phenomena qualified as long term play a key role in ecosystems franklin et al 1990 there is often a difference between the funding duration of ecological studies and the relevant time scale to study these phenomena callahan 1984 this discrepancy combined with the increasing number of potential drivers of ecosystem change that occur simultaneously e g rising temperature pollution habitat destruction has led to an increasing demand for data from long term ecological studies and to the development of long term ecological programs such as the long term ecological research lter network callahan 1984 there is no consensus about the definition of long term in ecological studies it can be based either on ecological criteria e g generation time of the studied organism time scale of ecological processes or on operational constraints e g funding cycles human life span knapp et al 2012 strayer et al 1986 because both strategies have advantages and drawbacks lindenmayer et al 2012 strayer et al 1986 a minimum duration threshold 10 years for example can be chosen to compromise between the two approaches lindenmayer et al 2012 wolfe et al 1987 several types of short term study e g retrospective studies modelling substitution of space for time and use of systems of fast dynamics offer distinct advantages over long term studies and allow the analysis of long term ecological phenomena for that reason researchers should also consider these less funding dependent options strayer et al 1986 although these alternatives are not always achievable knowledge of ecosystem behaviour over long time scales is indispensable to gain a deeper understanding of the processes that drive ecosystems and to disentangle anthropogenic and natural changes as well as short term fluctuations and long term trends haase et al 2016 long term studies are appropriate to investigate processes that can be classified in four categories slow processes e g forest succession vertebrate population cycles rare events e g fire flood disease subtle processes i e when the magnitude of the long term trend is small compared to the year to year variance and complex phenomena involving a combination of multiple abiotic parameters that cannot be studied statistically with few observations strayer et al 1986 long term ecological studies have thus contributed and continue to contribute to many findings in ecological sciences franklin et al 1990 magurran et al 2010 this approach makes it possible to quantify ecological responses to environmental change and to understand complex ecosystem phenomena occurring over a prolonged period in addition to providing ecological data for model development parameterization and validation lindenmayer et al 2012 wolfe et al 1987 it also promotes multidisciplinary research supports environmental policies and ecosystem management and plays an important role in societal issues e g efficacy of fertilisers soil acidification impact of sewage pollution on lakes education e g students involved in these projects and communication to the general public lindenmayer et al 2012 strayer et al 1986 however long term ecological studies have serious disadvantages the main one being the need of long term funding staff and facilities thus these studies are limited to time scales ranging from a few decades to one or two centuries strayer et al 1986 researchers conducting this type of study also have to face other essential challenges such as dealing with changing objectives and schemes that can lead to modifications in methodology magurran et al 2010 implementing long term studies on ecosystems and ecological processes requires a series of methodological choices covering roughly the following steps 1 selection of study sites 2 choice of taxa and abiotic variables to monitor 3 selection of the appropriate spatial and temporal scales for the monitoring and 4 selection of data analysis methods while steps 2 and 3 refer to study design step 4 can include or be followed by modelling of the monitored system the methodological choices are largely dependent on the type and extent of the investigated ecosystem the life cycle duration of the investigated taxa and the dimension of the area where the life cycle takes place fig 1 the main focus of a long term study that surveys biodiversity is often to identify the main drivers of community and ecosystem dynamics datasets resulting from those studies thus typically comprise different kinds of biota and different series of environmental parameters although these parameters are also referred to as abiotic parameters they are actually not independent of life but have coevolved with it so the term conbiotic parameters would be more appropriate fath and müller 2019 data analysis that aims to explain biota i e response variables by environmental parameters explanatory variables can be performed with a potentially wide variety of techniques that should be chosen according to the type number and frequency distribution of data many authors have discussed the applications of data analysis methods in ecology most of them focusing on specific methods or approaches e g bayesian methods linear and additive modelling in an ecological framework e g beninger et al 2012 boldina and beninger 2016 dale and fortin 2002 dorazio 2016 guisan et al 2002 hobbs and hilborn 2006 mukhopadhyay and banerjee 2015 by contrast only a few articles introduce a wide set of analytical tools often with respect to a particular research area e g buttigieg and ramette 2014 garamszegi et al 2009 paliy and shankar 2016 parker and arnold 1999 ramos et al 2015 literature reviews on data analysis techniques applied to ecology e g crowley 1992 james and mcculloch 1990 jennions 2003 ramette 2007 are even less common similarly many articles and books on ecology focus on study design e g hurlbert 1984 morrison 2010 strayer et al 1986 yoccoz et al 2001 however information about what is actually applied in the field by researchers i e sampling design field methods measured variables etc is not easily available although this could be valuable for researchers designing long term studies examples are jaeschke et al 2014 who reviewed aspects including the areas taxa and parameters of studies analysing the impact of climate change on ecosystems and jackson and fureder 2006 who summarised the duration and number of sites and sample years of 46 long term studies of freshwater macroinvertebrates literature reviews covering both data analysis and study design in a long term framework are even rarer although it is critical 1 to consider the selection of data analysis methods and study design simultaneously as the former is conditioned by the latter and 2 to choose the methods carefully considering the resources necessary to conduct long term ecological studies and the particularities of their methodology in this paper we aim to give an overview of the main characteristics of study design in existing long term studies and the methods used to analyse the resulting data the first part of this article summarises study features with regard to the following questions 1 what are the main characteristics of these studies i e aims location and sampling strategy 2 which taxa and habitats are investigated 3 which and how many environmental parameters and biological metrics are used 4 how are data analysed the second part of this article provides details on the data analysis techniques that were performed in the reviewed articles 2 materials and methods 2 1 search strategy we examined the web of science all databases between may and june 2018 covering all publications available up to that point and exclusively belonging to the web of science biodiversity and conservation and environmental sciences and ecology categories to obtain the most relevant papers we used various search keywords and operators table 1 only original studies were considered because a very extensive number of articles matched these requirements about 2500 we restricted the number of potential articles by rejecting studies related to extraneous research areas e g medicine microbiology chemistry or molecular biology or exclusively analysing one very specific effect e g impact of fire and thus not investigating several environmental parameters simultaneously the search was further focused by excluding a list of topics table a1 this produced a total of 511 articles for which abstracts and when necessary the methods section were read among the 511 articles we selected those that explicitly analysed i e using data analysis methods the effects of two or more abiotic factors excluding the drivers shown in table a1 on two or more biotic variables or one explained variable based on several taxa in a long term framework this choice was motivated by the specificity and infrequency of the other topics i e biotic interactions and impacts of the biological compartment on environmental characteristics however the presence of biotic variables among abiotic predictors was not a reason for rejecting articles given the various definitions of long term and because it was not our purpose to discuss them in this review we considered as long term the studies qualified as such by their authors and characterised by a long term sampling design we thus excluded in line with lindenmayer et al 2012 retrospective investigations sensu likens 1989 e g studies based on tree rings studies using simulated data and studies with extended gaps between sampling in total the relevant sections i e the ones dealing with effects of abiotic parameters on biocoenosis of 99 articles were analysed in depth for this study 2 2 study characterisation the following characteristics were recorded 1 investigated ecosystem i e taxa and habitat 2 geographical location 3 lter involvement 4 aim of the study 5 explained variables i e total number and type 6 explanatory variables i e total number and type 7 sampling strategy i e study duration sampling frequency number of sites and type of study observational or experimental and 8 data analysis methods only the features associated with the section focusing on the effects of abiotic parameters on biocoenosis were analysed when recording the investigated ecosystems only the biological communities used as explained variables were retained we followed the taxonomic indications of the authors whether the authors defined the organisms they studied with monophyletic group names or not e g aquatic invertebrates benthic communities plankton in the first case we used taxonomic classification table 3 lower part whereas in the second case we based our analyses on the terms given by the authors table 3 upper part to compute the number of explained variables we considered the measurement of one taxon e g abundance as one explained variable even if the community composition was analysed as a whole e g with ordination methods and not every taxon separately the computation of the number of explanatory variables takes into account every single relevant explanatory variable including variables belonging to the direct anthropogenic impact category that were considered as abiotic factors the calculation of study duration was based on the temporal interval of the dependent variables dataset minus the number of years without sampling in the few cases in which quantitative data were missing e g concerning time lag number of studied species sampling frequency semi quantitative classes e g from one to five variables more than five variables were used to characterise the studies data analysis methods used to select variables before analysis e g correlation tests among explanatory variables to avoid multicollinearity issues were not mentioned unless the method led to the creation of new variables used in the analysis process itself e g ordination axes summarising an extensive set of variables secondary analysis tools i e resampling techniques and post hoc tests associated with the main methods were recorded but were not developed in this review spearman s rank order correlation spearman 1907 was performed to test the correlation between the number of articles published per year and the year more details on study characterisation methodology are available as supplementary materials table a2 3 results publication dates of the 99 reviewed articles range from 1997 to 2018 the number of reviewed publications increased progressively from 1995 to 2017 spearman s rank order correlation ρ 0 769 s 306 49 p value 0 001 this is shown graphically for data grouped into five year intervals with the exception of the most recent data spanning 2 5 years fig 2 3 1 ecosystems most of the articles concentrated on aquatic habitats with almost half focusing on marine habitats and about a quarter on terrestrial habitats table 2 most terrestrial studies were conducted in grasslands or woodlands but five articles involved different kinds of terrestrial habitats at the same time wide and non monophyletic group names were used in almost half of the articles n 47 to describe their biological material table 3 upper part several groups and taxa were highly represented plankton was studied in almost a quarter of the articles fish crustaceans and benthic communities were all examined in more than 10 of the studies several phyla exclusively or mostly associated with aquatic habitats e g cnidaria mollusca and echinodermata were rarely investigated but may have been included in articles studying zooplankton aquatic invertebrates or benthic communities similarly hexapods were mainly studied in terrestrial habitats n 6 85 7 of hexapod studies but we assume that insects were often studied as part of aquatic invertebrates and benthic communities green plants mammals and birds were mostly studied in terrestrial habitats viridiplantae n 9 100 mammalia n 6 85 7 aves n 5 83 3 several articles investigated many taxa or species groups for instance tian et al 2006 used fisheries catch results and included 58 species of fish molluscs crustaceans echinoderms marine mammals and algae on the other hand clotfelter et al 2007 focused on only 13 species but at four trophic levels two oak species three rodents one songbird and 7 raptors that were only used as dependent variables analysing interactions between biotic and abiotic factors at different trophic levels 3 2 localities more than half of the reviewed studies concerned europe n 54 and more than a quarter were conducted in north america n 28 fig 3 a the remaining quarter concerned asia n 7 oceania n 6 africa n 2 south america n 2 and antarctica n 1 ershova et al 2015 counted for both north america and asia because the study location was the chukchi sea the most commonly featured country was the united states of america with 23 articles lter and similar networks e g elter ilter were involved i e funding of the research project or sampling on a study site of this network in 8 articles three in the usa three in europe one in brazil and one in the arctic 3 3 aims for more than half of the studies n 57 the analysis of environmental effects on biological communities was a secondary goal used to understand the temporal i e intra or inter annual or spatial variability of biotic variables by comparing it to spatio temporal variability of abiotic parameters e g climatic variables or sampling site features for instance kimmel and roman 2004 assessed monthly abundance variability of two copepod species in relation to water quality metrics consequently the analysis of abiotic effects on biotic parameters often followed a trend analysis or a comparison of biological measurements between locations in the article structure e g möllmann et al 2000 a second category comprising 36 articles involved studies whose primary goal was to relate structure and community composition to abiotic characteristics these articles aimed 1 to detect differences of ecological preferences between taxa e g comparison of the habitat of native and invasive fish species in haupt and phelps 2016 2 to understand differences in community assemblages and structures e g brooker et al 2012 highlighted the effects of temperature and precipitation on spatial patterns of plant communities or 3 to compare different effects of environmental parameters on biological communities e g short term versus long term climatic effects on bird distribution in bateman et al 2016 climatic parameters versus logging effect on zooplankton communities in lévesque et al 2017 lastly a few articles n 6 aim to evaluate one very specific effect but include several confounding variables in the analyses to control for other effects and isolate the studied one for instance to study the long term effect of an oil spill on a benthic population poggiale and dauvin 2001 created a population dynamics model taking into account not only environmental pollution i e the factor to be studied but also sea water temperature and competition i e confounding factors 3 4 explained variables a third of the articles n 32 concerned a small number of explained variables from one to five fig 3b twenty one studies used between six and 20 response variables and 37 articles used more than 20 predictands from 21 to 50 n 16 more than 50 n 20 we were not able to determine the number of dependent variables for 10 articles response variables used in the articles concern either a single species or a group of species making up a considerable proportion of the studied community e g guild functional group trait category size class or taxonomic ranks above species such as genus family and order most metrics hereafter called species specific metrics table 4 upper part can be applied to both categories most of them are abundance based but alternative species specific metrics were also used in the reviewed literature e g biomass biovolume covered surface on the other hand several variables hereafter called community metrics table 4 lower part require more than one species to be calculated and meaningful consequently they are only used on groups of species and mostly on all the organisms studied these indices summarise community characteristics and usually outline the taxonomic structure and composition of the community mostly by means of diversity indices e g species richness shannon index simpson index pielou s evenness however community metrics can also focus on alternative community characteristics such as the mean trophic level or biological traits e g life history morphology physiology behaviour using fuzzy coding see chevenet et al 1994 for further details on the methodology species specific metrics were employed in 90 articles either in combination with community metrics n 19 21 1 of articles using species specific metrics or not n 71 78 9 community metrics were only analysed alone in a few studies n 9 3 5 explanatory variables all quantitative predictors can be based on one or multiple measures e g average sum variability minimum maximum they can also illustrate previous abiotic conditions e g weather variables one two and three years before measurement in clotfelter et al 2007 half of the reviewed articles n 52 used from six to 20 independent variables but a large number used fewer from 2 to 5 n 35 fig 3d only 9 articles used more than 20 predictors from 21 to 50 n 7 more than 50 n 2 we were not able to determine the number of explanatory variables for three articles it is worth noting that the two studies with more than 50 predictors kwok et al 2016 ladwig et al 2016 obtained a large number of explanatory variables because of the extensive use of different time lags on a modest number of measures they did not include more than 50 unrelated parameters meteorological e g temperature cloudiness radiation humidity precipitation wind speed atmospheric pressure and climatic measures north atlantic oscillation north pacific gyre oscillation pacific decadal oscillation el niño southern oscillation southern oscillation index north pacific index artic oscillation index etc were used as predictors in almost all the reviewed studies n 89 fig 3c followed by physical and chemical characteristics e g salinity ph dissolved oxygen nutrients and pollutant concentration and hydrological and hydraulic metrics e g depth velocity discharge turbidity wave height sinuosity in 49 and 39 articles respectively the effects of sampling site features e g topography elevation land cover habitat type sedimentary characteristics distance to the coast were analysed in 17 studies while direct anthropogenic impact e g hunting logging engineering oil spill was studied in only five articles sixty eight articles used two or more categories of abiotic variables 3 6 sampling strategy the average study duration of the 99 papers was 23 46 years min 3 max 114 sd 15 92 median 20 fig 4 the sampling frequency occurred monthly or at least several times a year in 32 articles but a significant number of the studies n 22 involved yearly sampling or less fig 3e fieldwork performed more than once a month was less frequent weekly or fortnightly n 15 daily or several times a week n 5 sampling frequency was not indicated in a large number of studies n 25 only three studies can be considered as experimental i e at least one environmental condition was controlled daghighi et al 2017 gutiérrez fonseca et al 2018 and waterkeyn et al 2011 who studied the effects of salinity and hydrological disturbance in mesocosms the remaining 96 articles were observational studies the articles studying only one site were similar in number to those studying more than 20 one site n 12 more than 20 sites n 13 fig 3f most papers involved an intermediate number of sampling stations 2 5 n 29 6 20 n 26 the number of sampling sites in 19 articles could not be determined 3 7 data analysis techniques in all 40 data analysis methods were recorded univariate methods were performed in 73 articles and multivariate techniques were used in 54 articles both methods were used in 28 articles statistical modelling is the most frequent type of analysis used in almost half of the reviewed articles n 46 in particular linear models were used in 34 studies table 5 ordination methods are also common used in 45 articles constrained ordination n 26 unconstrained ordination n 25 statistical tests mostly correlation tests n 27 73 0 of all studies with statistical tests were used in 37 studies the remaining analysis categories were performed in fewer than four articles there is a large gap in the use of univariate methods between the two main techniques i e linear modelling and correlation tests and the others e g additive modelling maxent there is no such gap in multivariate methods at least two distinct data analysis methods were combined in 43 articles to assess the effects of abiotic factors on biological communities with up to five methods involved in the reviewed section of one article ordination methods were often performed in combination with other analysis methods fig 5 for instance unconstrained ordination was associated with statistical tests in 13 studies and constrained ordination was combined with statistical modelling in 8 articles statistical modelling is the most common type of analysis used singly n 27 58 7 of all studies performing statistical modelling 3 7 1 statistical modelling for univariate analyses researchers can choose between three main types of model identified by levins 1966 in population biology analytical or mathematical models empirical or statistical or phenomenological models and mechanistic models also called causal models or process based models guisan and zimmermann 2000 most modelling techniques used in the studies belong to the empirical family i e models that aim to combine precision accuracy of predicted response and realism unrealistic assumptions are limited levins 1966 but do not describe realistic cause effect links between predictors and the response variables or inform about underlying ecological functions and mechanisms guisan and zimmermann 2000 in the reviewed literature statistical modelling was mainly performed by means of linear models table 5 mostly with ordinary and simple linear models n 23 50 0 of articles including modelling approaches table 6 e g linear regressions anova ancova they were used with other methods half of the time the purpose of linear modelling is to describe the relationship between a single response variable and a set of explanatory variables in order to test hypotheses about the model parameters or to forecast or predict values of the response variable legendre and legendre 2012 the response variable and the predictors cannot be interchanged the term linear is misleading it is possible to model non linear relationships e g polynomial trigonometric functions with linear models those models are linear in the parameters zuur et al 2009 i e each term of the explanatory part of the model is either a constant or the product of a parameter i e coefficient and a predictor the random part of an ordinary linear model is only composed of the real random term i e the residuals however the random part can be extended see table 6 with components that allow the model to take into account heterogeneity i e generalized least squares model nested data i e mixed effect model and temporal or spatial correlations e g auto regressive model auto regressive moving average model zuur et al 2009 these extensions were used in many of the studies performing linear modelling n 13 37 1 linear models can also be combined in a hierarchical model hm mackenzie and kendall 2002 royle 2004 which is a sequence of models ordered by their conditional probability structure santoro et al 2016 and which involves at least one model i e level of the hm model referring to an unobserved variable e g population abundance santoro et al 2016 used a two level hierarchical model in order to account for temporal variation in the probability of capture to evaluate changes in abundance when the dependent variable is not gaussian a generalized linear model glm with a non normal distribution e g poisson binomial gamma can be used to relate the explanatory variables to the response variable through a link function e g logarithm logit guisan et al 2002 however relatively few articles n 6 performed glm compared to linear models even though the distribution of the dependent variable is often not gaussian in ecology e g count data proportional data presence absence data the same extensions of the random part for linear models are also available in their generalized form in additive modelling in contrast to linear regressions a smoothing function is used to link an explanatory quantitative variable to the response variable instead of a coefficient zuur et al 2009 this non parametric method was used in only five articles it is an appropriate way of evaluating an empirical relationship instead of estimating the parameters of a model legendre and legendre 2012 it is also possible to generalise this method to non gaussian distributions and to extend the random part while frequentist methods are efficient for model comparison and evaluation bayesian frameworks i e approaches that consider that the parameters to be estimated are not fixed and where prior knowledge can be used zuur et al 2009 have many advantages in linear and additive modelling dorazio 2016 garamszegi et al 2009 hobbs and hilborn 2006 however only gutierrez et al 2016 took a bayesian approach by using markov chain monte carlo mcmc other statistical modelling methods were rarely performed n 8 hierarchical partitioning hp chevan and sutherland 1991 can be used in combination with other modelling techniques e g linear regression in order to assess the independent contribution of each predictor to the variation of the dependent variable it also enables the authors to avoid both multi collinearity issues and overfitting chevan and sutherland 1991 this method was used in marchant and dean 2014 and in latli et al 2017 with linear models and gam respectively maximum entropy modelling maxent jaynes 1957 is a type of species distribution model sdm very similar to glm gam which does not require absence data and has many advantages over other modelling of species distribution using presence only data phillips et al 2006 it was used by bateman et al 2016 and casey et al 2015 path analysis wright 1960 1921 is a special case of structural equations modelling grace et al 2012 legendre and legendre 2012 used to test causal hypothesis between multiple variables shipley 2013 unlike multiple linear regression from which it derives legendre and legendre 2012 it allows for more than a simple correlative relationship between two variables by including mediator moderator and covariate variables in the causal model irvine et al 2015 used this technique to assess the impact of anthropogenic drivers on biological conditions with bayesian estimation of the parameters it was also used by hallett et al 2014 who called it structural equation modelling to relate precipitation to community stability via species richness compensatory dynamics and dominant species stability quantile regression koenker and bassett 1978 is a method that estimates multiple slopes to describe the relationship between a response variable and predictors it is useful in cases of linear regression with heterogeneous variances cade and noon 2003 it was performed by menge et al 2011 to evaluate barnacle and mussel recruitment in response to climatic factors a multivariate analysis of variance manova the equivalent of a univariate analysis of variance anova applied to several continuous and independent response variables buttigieg and ramette 2014 james and mcculloch 1990 was performed in penczak 2011 3 7 2 ordination methods several problems occur when authors have to investigate the link between many explained variables and many drivers drawing all possible scatterplots is not only laborious but also uninformative and it is not possible to draw a plot with more than two or three axes each one representing a descriptor legendre and legendre 2012 however ordination methods widely used in multivariate frameworks make it possible to project such a multidimensional scatter plot onto bivariate graphs with axes representing a substantial portion of the data matrix variability in a reduced space a wide variety of methods were used in the reviewed literature belonging either to the unconstrained family table 7 upper part or to the constrained family table 7 lower part unconstrained ordination techniques aim to display a maximum amount of a dataset s variability on a few axes without presuming causal relationships ramette 2007 these methods are considered as exploratory and are used for indirect gradient analysis gradients are unknown a priori and are inferred from the response data buttigieg and ramette 2014 by contrast in direct gradient analysis gradients are known measured and directly related to the response dataset i e the biological variables in our case buttigieg and ramette 2014 direct gradient analysis can be performed with constrained ordination methods also called canonical analysis by comparing two or more matrices indeed these techniques aim to display only the dataset variation that can be modelled with constraining variables we identified two types of constrained ordination in the reviewed articles asymmetric methods and symmetric methods the asymmetric forms of constrained ordination involve a response matrix i e biotic variables in our case and an explanatory matrix i e environmental parameters in our case that cannot be interchanged without consequences on the analysis these methods combine ordination and regression the ordination of the response matrix is constrained to be linearly related to the explanatory matrix legendre and legendre 2012 however asymmetric constrained ordination methods like all traditional ordination techniques used in the articles are considered as algorithmic because the statistical properties of the data are not taken into account in contrast to model based methods which involve the specification of a statistical model hui et al 2015 warton et al 2015 in symmetric constrained ordination techniques the two data sets play the same role legendre and legendre 2012 most of these methods are considered as interpretive e g cca rda ccora paliy and shankar 2016 indirect gradient analysis was performed with unconstrained ordination as exploratory method mostly by means of ordinary principal components analysis pca which was also the most widely used ordination technique in the reviewed articles n 17 37 8 this method summarises a large number of quantitative variables in a few dimensions principal components that are orthogonal to each other and consist of linear combinations of input variables legendre and legendre 2012 pca was thus almost always used to limit the number of variables and avoid multicollinearity issues only jahan and choi 2014 used a single pca to visualise correlations between abiotic and biotic variables before testing them with a correlation test therefore pca in its ordinary form or in a derived form was not used for analysis strictly speaking and was always performed in combination with other methods e g correlation tests linear models canonical correlation analysis it was applied half the time n 9 47 4 on both biotic and abiotic variables with two separate pcas only on predictors in 7 studies and only on predictands in three articles different kinds of pca were not often used beaugrand et al 2000 performed a 3 mode principal components analysis 3 mode pca based on three classical pcas in order to assess variation of species abundance in time and space a between date pca bpca was used in latli et al 2017 to maximise the distance between the sampling years along the successive bpca axes and licandro et al 2012 used eigenvector filtering adapted to time series with missing values which corresponds to a pca calculated on an autocovariance matrix based on the original time series lagged with itself correspondence analysis ca also called reciprocal averaging was performed in five articles but in three different forms ordinary n 2 fuzzy n 2 and detrended n 1 ordinary correspondence analysis was first proposed for the analysis of two way contingency tables but in ecology it is mostly applied on sites x species presence absence or abundance matrices legendre and legendre 2012 although this method is analogous to pca it aims at maximising the correspondence between rows and columns unlike pca the same result is thus produced when transposing the data matrix moreover it preserves χ2 distance instead of euclidian distance i e ordinary straight line distance vaughan and ormerod 2012 achieved a ca on biological communities and then used the main axis of variation as a dependent variable fuzzy coded correspondence analysis fca chevenet et al 1994 can be applied on fuzzy coded data categories and subcategories e g biological traits and was used to relate community traits to temperature and precipitation in feio et al 2015 or to relate fca axes to environmental parameters in bêche and resh 2007 detrended correspondence analysis dca hill and gauch 1980 is used to remove the arch effect due to unimodal responses of communities to environmental gradients legendre and legendre 2012 it was performed by bortolini et al 2014 on biotic variables to produce axes subsequently used as response variables two other unconstrained ordination techniques were performed non metric multidimensional scaling nmds and min max autocorrelation factor analysis mafa nmds is not an eigenvector based technique so unlike pca and ca the input data is a distance matrix its aim is to represent the objects in a restricted number of dimensions i e two or three with all data variance utilised and it does not preserve the exact distance between objects the interpretations are thus qualitative and subjective james and mcculloch 1990 legendre and legendre 2012 paliy and shankar 2016 ramette 2007 jucevica and melecis 2006 performed an nmds on collembola communities and then used the two axes in correlation tests gutiérrez fonseca et al 2018 used nmds to define groups between macroinvertebrates assemblages and horn et al 2011 applied this method on diatom communities with vector fitting of explanatory variables prior to constrained ordination mafa is similar to pca but the axes represent a measure of autocorrelation van walraven et al 2017 used this technique on biological data prior to correlation test with mafa axes redundancy analysis rda is the most frequently used constrained ordination technique n 9 34 6 and was mainly performed in its ordinary form n 6 66 7 but distance based redundancy analysis db rda n 3 33 3 and partial redundancy p rda n 1 11 1 were also used ordinary redundancy analysis an asymmetric constrained ordination that allows for different types of explanatory variables i e quantitative and qualitative is the extension of multiple regression to the modelling of multivariate response data legendre and legendre 2012 however as mentioned above it is not considered to be model based warton et al 2015 this method is also the canonical version of pca where the components are constrained to be linear combinations of the environmental variables paliy and shankar 2016 ramette 2007 this technique is applied on sites x species matrices response data set and on sites x abiotic factors matrices explanatory data set for example li et al 2015 conducted ordinary rda to analyse the effect of climate factors on vegetation assemblage distance based redundancy analysis also called distance based linear model distlm is a particular form of rda carried out on a distance matrix and thus allows an analysis based on various distance functions it was performed in three studies abonyi et al 2018 pitacco et al 2018 zettler et al 2017 for example to quantify the variation in benthic community explained by climatic parameters in pitacco et al 2018 partial redundancy analysis is used to analyse the effect of an explanatory matrix x on the matrix y adjusted for the effect of covariables in a matrix w this method was used by horn et al 2011 to isolate the effect of climate variables from that of trophic variables on a phytoplankton community lévesque et al 2017 used variation partitioning vp by redundancy analysis in order to partition the effects of temporal spatial and environmental parameters on zooplankton communities canonical correspondence analysis cca another asymmetric technique similar to rda in many aspects was performed in 7 articles mainly with no other data analysis method n 5 71 4 any data suitable for ca can be used as the response matrix y legendre and legendre 2012 ramette 2007 and although cca is suitable for unimodal responses it seems to be robust for other responses e g bimodal unequal ranges ramette 2007 however its predictive power is inferior to that of glm because the same explanatory variables are used for the whole community in constrained ordination whereas species specific subsets of predictors can be defined in modelling guisan et al 1999 cca was used in garcia et al 2012 to study the relationship between fish species abundance and environmental variables water temperature salinity rainfall and also in pace et al 2013 to analyse the link between taxa abundance of aquatic insects and environmental variables like ca this method preserves χ2 distance multiple discriminant analysis mda also called linear discriminant analysis lda or discriminant function analysis dfa is not interpretive but discriminatory paliy and shankar 2016 this technique is used to determine the linear combination of explanatory variables that best defines an already known grouping of objects legendre and legendre 2012 however this method is often used as an exploratory ordination technique james and mcculloch 1990 it was used in kodama et al 2002 to explain the groups of fish and invertebrates constituted with nmds and cluster analysis with environmental variables canonical correlation analysis ccora is the symmetric equivalent of rda and was the most frequently used symmetric constrained analysis method n 5 71 4 the difference between these two techniques can be compared to the difference between simple linear regression and linear correlation legendre and legendre 2012 studied objects e g sites in ccora are described by two matrices containing quantitative parameters i e raw data and treated symmetrically legendre and legendre 2012 stated that this method has limited applications nowadays for two reasons 1 the use of co inertia analysis coia a similar but more flexible technique and 2 many ecological issues are asymmetric i e variables are defined as explanatory or explained by the study design and their roles cannot be swapped nevertheless it was used in five articles once alone in aßmus et al 2009 and four times with other methods for example in molinero et al 2006 where pca was first conducted on both biotic and abiotic variables before the axes were submitted to a ccora as explained above coia is an alternative method to ccora presenting many advantages for example it allows multicollinearity issues among variables in the same matrix it preserves euclidian distance instead of mahalanobis distance and the number of species does not have to be less than the number of sampling sites legendre and legendre 2012 this technique is also based on covariance and not on correlation paliy and shankar 2016 however it was only performed in latli et al 2017 on principal component axes of environmental and faunal variables statico a method that combines partial triadic analysis pta tucker 1966 and coia is used to study the dynamics of the relationship between environmental parameters and biological communities by analysing sequences of paired ecological tables thioulouse et al 2004 it was used only in mazzocchi et al 2012 to investigate stable patterns and interannual changes in the relationships between copepods and their environment 3 7 3 statistical tests correlation tests were the most frequently used data analysis method after linear modelling n 27 and were mainly used in combination with other techniques n 17 63 0 they were mostly performed as pearson correlation tests n 17 63 0 which measures the intensity of the linear relationship between two random variables and does not assume any functional or explanatory response or causal link between them legendre and legendre 2012 thus unlike linear modelling the two variables play the same role and can be swapped spearman s rank order correlation spearman 1907 a non parametric correlation test based on ranks was used in 8 studies to measure the strength of non linear monotonic relationships two other correlation methods were used cross correlation functions ccf to identify the time lag for the predictor that maximises the correlation in gröger and rumohr 2006 licandro et al 2012 and szentkirályi et al 2007 and partial correlation in van der wal and stien 2014 where it was used to analyse the correlation between plant biomass and weather parameters cloud cover and rainfall after controlling for the effect of temperature we were not able to determine which correlation technique was used in two articles only three other statistical tests were very occasionally used the bio env procedure permanova and student s t test the bio env procedure clarke and ainsworth 1993 is a technique that aims to select relevant explanatory variables by performing correlation tests between a dissimilarity matrix derived from a species specific metric e g abundance and several dissimilarity abiotic matrices it was used in 8 articles and six times with no other method permutational multivariate analysis of variation permanova anderson 2001 a non parametric method used to perform multivariate anova and test differences between object classes was used in gutiérrez fonseca et al 2018 to assess differences in abiotic parameters between groups after non metric multidimensional scaling student s t test was performed in lawrence et al 2010 to detect differences in biotic integrity between two categories of climate parameters 3 7 4 other data analysis methods the five remaining categories of data analysis techniques are found in only 7 articles although most of the models reported in the studies can be depicted as statistical models three articles used mechanistic models unlike empirical models mechanistic models which are considered to be both realistic and general are based on real cause effect relationships but their predictive power is often lower guisan and zimmermann 2000 poggiale and dauvin 2001 used a discrete population dynamics model that included sea temperature competition and environmental pollution calibrated by minimizing the distance between simulated and observed data to estimate the different parameters e g carrying capacity optimal growth temperature a similar method was used by mutshinda et al 2017 and kerimoglu et al 2013 the self organizing map som kohonen 1982 is an unsupervised learning algorithm of the artificial neural network ann that identifies clusters and maps high dimensional data into a two dimensional representational space every input data item selects the best matching model each one associated with a neuron that is represented on the two dimensional grid of the som with similar models associated with closer neurons kohonen 2013 in choi et al 2015 both environmental and community data were used as input variables while penczak 2011 only entered biotic variables and then performed a manova on environmental variables using the som clusters as categorical explanatory variable classification and regression trees cart is a model based tree classifier that explains the variation of a response variable with one or more predictors by splitting the data into nodes that best distinguish between samples ayón and swartzman 2008 de ath and fabricius 2000 this technique is suitable for the analysis of complex ecological data and has many strengths it can deal with non linear relationships missing values and categorical or quantitative variables nevertheless this method is univariate unlike multivariate regression trees mrt an extension of cart to multivariate response data de ath 2002 larsen and speckman 2004 ayón and swartzman 2008 used this method to determine the parameter with the strongest effect on zooplankton biovolume asymmetric eigenvector maps aem blanchet et al 2008 is a spatial eigenfunction analysis a family of methods for multiscale analysis where eigenvectors of spatial configuration matrices are calculated and then used as predictors aem specifically considers asymmetric directional physical processes in order to model multivariate spatial distributions and can be extended to time series analysis legendre and gauthier 2014 for example lévesque et al 2017 performed aem to model temporal structure and used it as an explanatory variable of zooplankton taxa abundance finally wavelet analysis is a time series analysis method that has many advantages over other similar techniques e g spectral analysis including robustness to missing values and non necessity of stationarity of the time series torrence and compo 1998 it was performed in menge et al 2011 by means of cross wavelet and wavelet coherence to investigate respectively the covariance and the correlation between recruitment of barnacles and mussels and each environmental variable in a temporal framework 4 discussion 4 1 trends in study characteristics and study design our review documented a wide variety of study designs methods of data analysis and modelling in long term studies with an increasing number of studies since the mid 1990s while this increase may partly be due to difficulty finding older articles the dominant duration of studies i e up to twenty years and the average publication date 2010 suggest that many of the studies were initiated in the early 1990s in the context of a growing awareness of biodiversity loss e g the rio de janeiro earth summit in 1992 more recently the effect of climate change on biodiversity which has been the subject of a growing body of published literature chapman et al 2014 jaeschke et al 2014 may also contribute to the increasing number of long term studies the fact that 75 of the articles resulting from our search concerned aquatic ecosystems especially marine systems was surprising because none of the key words in our search was directly linked to this type of habitat or to the biological communities that live in it by contrast jaeschke et al 2014 reviewed studies on the impact of climate change on organisms and ecosystems published between 2003 and 2013 and found that 44 of the studies focused on aquatic ecosystems this suggests that aquatic habitats are either the subject of long term studies older long term studies or studies that focus on parameters not necessarily linked to climate change due to the focus on aquatic habitats in our review only taxa and groups associated with these habitats were widely investigated taxa linked mainly to terrestrial habitats being underrepresented as in jaeschke et al 2014 south america asia and africa are underrepresented in the reviewed studies compared to europe and north america jaeschke et al 2014 demonstrated a positive correlation between gross domestic product and the number of studies per country thus the low number of studies carried out in south america asia and africa might be due to financial reasons especially as funding is a major challenge in long term ecological monitoring strayer et al 1986 we expected more articles to be associated with lter and similar networks and the relatively low number may be due to our selection criteria the use of community indices is less than we expected as these have many advantages such as the synthesis of information however they also have a number of drawbacks notably regarding the use of cardinal indices e g shannon index which are the most commonly used diversity indices for instance all individuals of the same taxon are considered equal e g their body size is not taken into account and all taxa are assumed to be equally different cousins 1991 peet 1974 researchers working with these widely used indices are also confronted with the problem of knowing which index to use this in turn raises another equally important question what is meant by diversity this is a critical issue because diversity may refer to different concepts namely species richness equitability and heterogeneity peet 1974 and the absence of a clear cut definition has led to the development of a large number of diversity indices hurlbert 1971 the choice of the appropriate index must also be based on the community to be studied e g the taxa involved and on knowledge about it i e species richness known or unknown pielou 1966 at last specific characteristics of similar indices should be compared for instance the shannon index is more sensitive to rare species than the simpson index peet 1974 finally diversity indices carry specific recommendations for example they should only be used for members of a single taxocene in other words taxa that are likely to be of about the same size to have similar life histories and compete over both evolutionary and ecological time deevey 1969 this review documented a wide range of sampling strategies especially with regard to duration frequency and number of study sites this finding is in accordance with magurran et al 2010 who observed that long term ecological studies show considerable variation in their sampling design and that this can be attributed to several factors such as the variety of study aims or the life cycle duration of the monitored taxa the duration of the reviewed studies median 20 years is longer than that found by jackson and fureder 2006 median 9 years this difference could be due to their focus on freshwater macroinvertebrates whose life cycles are shorter than those of many taxa studied in the articles in our review we also assume that years with no data were not always indicated which may have led to an overestimation of the study s duration as in jaeschke et al 2014 we observed more field observation than experimental studies which could be explained by our selection criterion of studies analysing the effects of two or more abiotic parameters on two or more taxa 4 2 data analysis methods despite the fact that our review focused on long term ecological studies few data analysis techniques accounted for temporal correlation in the response data therefore most of the tools described in the studies could also be used with short term studies although we selected studies involving multiple taxa and abiotic parameters most of the methods used were univariate and not multivariate this might be due to the fact that community metrics were exclusively analysed using univariate techniques moreover these methods were often used on species specific metrics applied to groups of species e g total abundance or when only a few taxa were studied it may also be because multivariate analyses can be more difficult to understand perform and interpret and might be computationally demanding paliy and shankar 2016 one could argue that the application of two or more methods which occurred in almost half of the reviewed studies indicates a lack of accuracy in the study design and its underlying rationale however in general both univariate and multivariate techniques were performed in such situations in order 1 to analyse the effects of environmental parameters at both community and species level e g constrained ordination was often used in combination with statistical modelling or 2 to produce synthetic variables before performing the analysis itself e g unconstrained ordination was often performed before statistical modelling and correlation tests the combination of several data analysis techniques may highlight their complementarity rather than methodological weakness the preponderance of linear models and correlation tests compared to other univariate methods may be due to the flexibility of linear modelling and the simplicity of both techniques compared to more complex and recent procedures e g maximum entropy modelling additive modelling by contrast the frequency of use of multivariate methods especially ordination techniques is more balanced between the techniques because they appear to be less flexible and more specialised e g techniques suited to short versus long gradients symmetric versus asymmetric methods direct versus indirect gradient analysis most reported models belong to the statistical type with mechanistic models only observed in three articles and no analytical model the latter focuses on precision and generality and is thus designed to be used within a limited or simplified reality guisan and zimmermann 2000 the absence of this type of model could be explained by our selection criteria e g at least two abiotic factors together with the overwhelming majority of observational studies in the reviewed articles involving many ecological phenomena despite multiple criticisms of frequentist methods in the literature e g beninger et al 2012 dorazio 2016 garamszegi et al 2009 hobbs and hilborn 2006 stephens et al 2007 analyses performed in a bayesian framework were very rare we also observed only a modest use of glm compared to ordinary linear models in many cases the specification of a non gaussian distribution e g poisson binomial is not relevant for most of the community metrics used in the reviewed studies and linear modelling is therefore more appropriate nevertheless we suspect that glm e g poisson regression was sometimes called linear modelling or linear regression the infrequent use of modelling methods other than linear modelling can be explained both by their specificity e g maxent for presence only data manova for more than one response variable and a grouping explanatory factor and by the lack of knowledge nevertheless because these methods are very specific and can be used when linear modelling is not possible researchers should know about them and when they can be used regarding ordination techniques pca was used more than ca because the former was performed on both biotic and abiotic variables whereas the latter was used only on biological data due to the more restricted input data legendre and legendre 2012 suggested that coia is used more than ccora because of its flexibility but we found coia in only one article and ccora in five the fact that coia is currently used less in ecology than ccora could be due to its relative novelty asymmetric constrained ordination methods were used much more frequently than symmetric ones this is consistent with the fact that 1 many ecological issues are asymmetric legendre and legendre 2012 and 2 we only selected studies analysing the effects of environmental parameters on biological communities i e asymmetric topics however this preferential use of asymmetric methods is much more marked for constrained ordination methods than for univariate techniques we assume that this difference is due to the application of correlation tests instead of linear models to study asymmetric topics this can be appropriate when not only the response variable but also the predictors are random legendre and legendre 2012 even if model ii regression is a more generally accepted alternative laws and archie 1981 the ordination methods used in the reviewed studies are not model based but algorithm based hui et al 2015 warton et al 2015 no doubt because the development of multivariate model based approaches is extremely recent our findings on the relative frequency of multivariate techniques are broadly similar to those of previous studies for instance james and mcculloch 1990 who summarised and reviewed the use of multivariate techniques in ecology and systematics also found that pca was the most frequently used ordination method and that linear models were widely used however they highlighted many differences in the use of analysis methods in their literature review asymmetric constrained analyses i e cca and rda were not reported which is not surprising because these are recent methods that had only been developed a few years previously similarly ramette 2007 found that exploratory methods performed by means of pca and cluster analysis were used much more often than interpretive methods most of the methods used to analyse multidimensional ecological data sets mentioned in legendre and legendre 2012 were encountered in our study selection however we did not find a number of other methods that have been described in similar reviews i e james and mcculloch 1990 paliy and shankar 2016 parker and arnold 1999 ramette 2007 table 8 although their use might be appropriate descriptions of these methods many of which have been developed recently are provided in similar reviews cited above in particular in paliy and shankar 2016 4 3 overview of prospective data analysis techniques the decision tree fig 6 could provide a rough guide to groups of potential approaches while descriptions of methods and examples of uses given in the results section should help researchers to differentiate between techniques however the decision tree only introduces potential tools based on broad features and does not assess their relevance notably for long term ecological studies techniques shown in table 8 are also suggested in addition to methods found in the reviewed articles paliy and shankar 2016 fig 8 provided a decision table that could also help select multivariate techniques 4 4 limitations of this study the main purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the study design features and data analysis techniques that are currently used in long term ecological studies its purpose is not to assess whether the features and analyses used in each study are the most suitable or whether the techniques assumptions are satisfied within the framework of this review only a few general indications can be given e g fig 6 techniques that are common in ecological studies are frequently misused for example 1 misinterpretation of p values and overlooking statistical power in the frequentist approach and null hypothesis testing beninger et al 2012 2 temporal autocorrelation in time series i e observations that are closer in time are more similar or less in the case of negative temporal autocorrelation than observations paired at random zuur et al 2009 3 model specifications and validation essential assumptions e g for linear modelling linearity in parameters predictors not correlated with the error term

24954,many ecological processes that play important roles in ecosystems occur over long time periods and can therefore not always be properly studied with short term studies however researchers have to face many challenges while setting up long term ecological studies including the choice of relevant data analysis methods and the design of the study i e sampling frequency number of sites etc this literature review based on 99 original studies provides an overview of methodological choices used to analyse the effects of abiotic parameters on biological communities on a long term scale to this end the main characteristics of study design were recorded e g sampling frequency duration taxa variables and the different data analysis tools summarised and analysed we found that long term ecological studies focusing on the effects of environmental factors on biotic parameters mostly concerned aquatic habitats studies substantially varied in their design although many of them had similar aims univariate methods almost entirely performed by means of linear modelling and correlation tests were used more often than multivariate methods finally constrained and unconstrained ordination methods were used equally and other data analysis tools were rare finally we created a decision key to help researchers choose the appropriate analysis tools for their specific long term study keywords lter data analysis sampling multivariate data modelling statistics 1 introduction the effects of environmental parameters on biological communities can occur at different time scales from less than a day e g effect of tides to several millennia e g effect of continental glaciation and at different spatial scales from less than a plot e g effect of microtopography to the entire earth e g effect of climate change franklin et al 1990 magnuson 1990 although various phenomena qualified as long term play a key role in ecosystems franklin et al 1990 there is often a difference between the funding duration of ecological studies and the relevant time scale to study these phenomena callahan 1984 this discrepancy combined with the increasing number of potential drivers of ecosystem change that occur simultaneously e g rising temperature pollution habitat destruction has led to an increasing demand for data from long term ecological studies and to the development of long term ecological programs such as the long term ecological research lter network callahan 1984 there is no consensus about the definition of long term in ecological studies it can be based either on ecological criteria e g generation time of the studied organism time scale of ecological processes or on operational constraints e g funding cycles human life span knapp et al 2012 strayer et al 1986 because both strategies have advantages and drawbacks lindenmayer et al 2012 strayer et al 1986 a minimum duration threshold 10 years for example can be chosen to compromise between the two approaches lindenmayer et al 2012 wolfe et al 1987 several types of short term study e g retrospective studies modelling substitution of space for time and use of systems of fast dynamics offer distinct advantages over long term studies and allow the analysis of long term ecological phenomena for that reason researchers should also consider these less funding dependent options strayer et al 1986 although these alternatives are not always achievable knowledge of ecosystem behaviour over long time scales is indispensable to gain a deeper understanding of the processes that drive ecosystems and to disentangle anthropogenic and natural changes as well as short term fluctuations and long term trends haase et al 2016 long term studies are appropriate to investigate processes that can be classified in four categories slow processes e g forest succession vertebrate population cycles rare events e g fire flood disease subtle processes i e when the magnitude of the long term trend is small compared to the year to year variance and complex phenomena involving a combination of multiple abiotic parameters that cannot be studied statistically with few observations strayer et al 1986 long term ecological studies have thus contributed and continue to contribute to many findings in ecological sciences franklin et al 1990 magurran et al 2010 this approach makes it possible to quantify ecological responses to environmental change and to understand complex ecosystem phenomena occurring over a prolonged period in addition to providing ecological data for model development parameterization and validation lindenmayer et al 2012 wolfe et al 1987 it also promotes multidisciplinary research supports environmental policies and ecosystem management and plays an important role in societal issues e g efficacy of fertilisers soil acidification impact of sewage pollution on lakes education e g students involved in these projects and communication to the general public lindenmayer et al 2012 strayer et al 1986 however long term ecological studies have serious disadvantages the main one being the need of long term funding staff and facilities thus these studies are limited to time scales ranging from a few decades to one or two centuries strayer et al 1986 researchers conducting this type of study also have to face other essential challenges such as dealing with changing objectives and schemes that can lead to modifications in methodology magurran et al 2010 implementing long term studies on ecosystems and ecological processes requires a series of methodological choices covering roughly the following steps 1 selection of study sites 2 choice of taxa and abiotic variables to monitor 3 selection of the appropriate spatial and temporal scales for the monitoring and 4 selection of data analysis methods while steps 2 and 3 refer to study design step 4 can include or be followed by modelling of the monitored system the methodological choices are largely dependent on the type and extent of the investigated ecosystem the life cycle duration of the investigated taxa and the dimension of the area where the life cycle takes place fig 1 the main focus of a long term study that surveys biodiversity is often to identify the main drivers of community and ecosystem dynamics datasets resulting from those studies thus typically comprise different kinds of biota and different series of environmental parameters although these parameters are also referred to as abiotic parameters they are actually not independent of life but have coevolved with it so the term conbiotic parameters would be more appropriate fath and müller 2019 data analysis that aims to explain biota i e response variables by environmental parameters explanatory variables can be performed with a potentially wide variety of techniques that should be chosen according to the type number and frequency distribution of data many authors have discussed the applications of data analysis methods in ecology most of them focusing on specific methods or approaches e g bayesian methods linear and additive modelling in an ecological framework e g beninger et al 2012 boldina and beninger 2016 dale and fortin 2002 dorazio 2016 guisan et al 2002 hobbs and hilborn 2006 mukhopadhyay and banerjee 2015 by contrast only a few articles introduce a wide set of analytical tools often with respect to a particular research area e g buttigieg and ramette 2014 garamszegi et al 2009 paliy and shankar 2016 parker and arnold 1999 ramos et al 2015 literature reviews on data analysis techniques applied to ecology e g crowley 1992 james and mcculloch 1990 jennions 2003 ramette 2007 are even less common similarly many articles and books on ecology focus on study design e g hurlbert 1984 morrison 2010 strayer et al 1986 yoccoz et al 2001 however information about what is actually applied in the field by researchers i e sampling design field methods measured variables etc is not easily available although this could be valuable for researchers designing long term studies examples are jaeschke et al 2014 who reviewed aspects including the areas taxa and parameters of studies analysing the impact of climate change on ecosystems and jackson and fureder 2006 who summarised the duration and number of sites and sample years of 46 long term studies of freshwater macroinvertebrates literature reviews covering both data analysis and study design in a long term framework are even rarer although it is critical 1 to consider the selection of data analysis methods and study design simultaneously as the former is conditioned by the latter and 2 to choose the methods carefully considering the resources necessary to conduct long term ecological studies and the particularities of their methodology in this paper we aim to give an overview of the main characteristics of study design in existing long term studies and the methods used to analyse the resulting data the first part of this article summarises study features with regard to the following questions 1 what are the main characteristics of these studies i e aims location and sampling strategy 2 which taxa and habitats are investigated 3 which and how many environmental parameters and biological metrics are used 4 how are data analysed the second part of this article provides details on the data analysis techniques that were performed in the reviewed articles 2 materials and methods 2 1 search strategy we examined the web of science all databases between may and june 2018 covering all publications available up to that point and exclusively belonging to the web of science biodiversity and conservation and environmental sciences and ecology categories to obtain the most relevant papers we used various search keywords and operators table 1 only original studies were considered because a very extensive number of articles matched these requirements about 2500 we restricted the number of potential articles by rejecting studies related to extraneous research areas e g medicine microbiology chemistry or molecular biology or exclusively analysing one very specific effect e g impact of fire and thus not investigating several environmental parameters simultaneously the search was further focused by excluding a list of topics table a1 this produced a total of 511 articles for which abstracts and when necessary the methods section were read among the 511 articles we selected those that explicitly analysed i e using data analysis methods the effects of two or more abiotic factors excluding the drivers shown in table a1 on two or more biotic variables or one explained variable based on several taxa in a long term framework this choice was motivated by the specificity and infrequency of the other topics i e biotic interactions and impacts of the biological compartment on environmental characteristics however the presence of biotic variables among abiotic predictors was not a reason for rejecting articles given the various definitions of long term and because it was not our purpose to discuss them in this review we considered as long term the studies qualified as such by their authors and characterised by a long term sampling design we thus excluded in line with lindenmayer et al 2012 retrospective investigations sensu likens 1989 e g studies based on tree rings studies using simulated data and studies with extended gaps between sampling in total the relevant sections i e the ones dealing with effects of abiotic parameters on biocoenosis of 99 articles were analysed in depth for this study 2 2 study characterisation the following characteristics were recorded 1 investigated ecosystem i e taxa and habitat 2 geographical location 3 lter involvement 4 aim of the study 5 explained variables i e total number and type 6 explanatory variables i e total number and type 7 sampling strategy i e study duration sampling frequency number of sites and type of study observational or experimental and 8 data analysis methods only the features associated with the section focusing on the effects of abiotic parameters on biocoenosis were analysed when recording the investigated ecosystems only the biological communities used as explained variables were retained we followed the taxonomic indications of the authors whether the authors defined the organisms they studied with monophyletic group names or not e g aquatic invertebrates benthic communities plankton in the first case we used taxonomic classification table 3 lower part whereas in the second case we based our analyses on the terms given by the authors table 3 upper part to compute the number of explained variables we considered the measurement of one taxon e g abundance as one explained variable even if the community composition was analysed as a whole e g with ordination methods and not every taxon separately the computation of the number of explanatory variables takes into account every single relevant explanatory variable including variables belonging to the direct anthropogenic impact category that were considered as abiotic factors the calculation of study duration was based on the temporal interval of the dependent variables dataset minus the number of years without sampling in the few cases in which quantitative data were missing e g concerning time lag number of studied species sampling frequency semi quantitative classes e g from one to five variables more than five variables were used to characterise the studies data analysis methods used to select variables before analysis e g correlation tests among explanatory variables to avoid multicollinearity issues were not mentioned unless the method led to the creation of new variables used in the analysis process itself e g ordination axes summarising an extensive set of variables secondary analysis tools i e resampling techniques and post hoc tests associated with the main methods were recorded but were not developed in this review spearman s rank order correlation spearman 1907 was performed to test the correlation between the number of articles published per year and the year more details on study characterisation methodology are available as supplementary materials table a2 3 results publication dates of the 99 reviewed articles

data grouped into five year intervals with the exception of the most recent data spanning 2 5 years fig 2 3 1 ecosystems most of the articles concentrated on aquatic habitats with almost half focusing on marine habitats and about a quarter on terrestrial habitats table 2 most terrestrial studies were conducted in grasslands or woodlands but five articles involved different kinds of terrestrial habitats at the same time wide and non monophyletic group names were used in almost half of the articles n 47 to describe their biological material table 3 upper part several groups and taxa were highly represented plankton was studied in almost a quarter of the articles fish crustaceans and benthic communities were all examined in more than 10 of the studies several phyla exclusively or mostly associated with aquatic habitats e g cnidaria mollusca and echinodermata were rarely investigated but may have been included in articles studying zooplankton aquatic invertebrates or benthic communities similarly hexapods were mainly studied in terrestrial habitats n 6 85 7 of hexapod studies but we assume that insects were often studied as part of aquatic invertebrates and benthic communities green plants mammals and birds were mostly studied in terrestrial habitats viridiplantae n 9 100 mammalia n 6 85 7 aves n 5 83 3 several articles investigated many taxa or species groups for instance tian et al 2006 used fisheries catch results and included 58 species of fish molluscs crustaceans echinoderms marine mammals and algae on the other hand clotfelter et al 2007 focused on only 13 species but at four trophic levels two oak species three rodents one songbird and 7 raptors that were only used as dependent variables analysing interactions between biotic and abiotic factors at different trophic levels 3 2 localities more than half of the reviewed studies concerned europe n 54 and more than a quarter were conducted in north america n 28 fig 3 a the remaining quarter concerned asia n 7 oceania n 6 africa n 2 south america n 2 and antarctica n 1 ershova et al 2015 counted for both north america and asia because the study location was the chukchi sea the most

this network in 8 articles three in the usa three in europe one in brazil and one in the arctic 3 3 aims for more than half of the studies n 57 the analysis of environmental effects on biological communities was a secondary goal used to understand the temporal i e intra or inter annual or spatial variability of biotic variables by comparing it to spatio temporal variability of abiotic parameters e g climatic variables or sampling site features for instance kimmel and roman 2004 assessed monthly abundance variability of two copepod species in relation to water quality metrics consequently the analysis of abiotic effects on biotic parameters often followed a trend analysis or a comparison of biological measurements between locations in the article structure e g möllmann et al 2000 a second category comprising 36 articles involved studies whose primary goal was to relate structure and community composition to abiotic characteristics these articles aimed 1 to detect differences of ecological preferences between taxa e g comparison of the habitat of native and invasive fish species in haupt and phelps 2016 2 to understand differences in community assemblages and structures e g brooker et al 2012 highlighted the effects of temperature and precipitation on spatial patterns of plant communities or 3 to compare different effects of environmental parameters on biological communities e g short term versus long term climatic effects on bird distribution in bateman et al 2016 climatic parameters versus logging effect on zooplankton communities in lévesque et al 2017 lastly a few articles n 6 aim to evaluate one very specific effect but include several confounding variables in the analyses to control for other effects and isolate the studied one for instance to study the long term effect of an oil spill on a benthic population poggiale and dauvin 2001 created a population dynamics model taking into account not only environmental pollution i e the factor to be studied but also sea water temperature and competition i e confounding factors 3 4 explained variables a third of the articles n 32 concerned a small number of explained variables from one to five fig 3b twenty one studies used between six and 20 response variables and 37 articles used more than 20 predictands from 21 to 50 n 16 more than 50 n 20 we were not able to determine the number of dependent variables for 10 articles response variables used in the articles concern either a single species or a group of species making up a considerable proportion of the studied community e g guild functional group trait category size class or taxonomic ranks above species such as genus family and order most metrics hereafter called species specific metrics table 4 upper part can be applied to both categories most of them are abundance based but alternative species specific metrics were also used in the reviewed literature e g biomass biovolume covered surface on the other hand several variables hereafter called community metrics table 4 lower part require more than one species to be calculated and meaningful consequently they are only used on groups of species and mostly on all the organisms studied these indices summarise community characteristics and usually outline the taxonomic structure and composition of the community mostly by means of diversity indices e g species richness shannon index simpson index pielou s evenness however community metrics can also focus on alternative community characteristics such as the mean trophic level or biological traits e g life history morphology physiology behaviour using fuzzy coding see chevenet et al 1994 for further details on the methodology species specific metrics were employed in 90 articles either in combination with community metrics n 19 21 1 of articles using species specific metrics or not n 71 78 9 community metrics were only analysed alone in a few studies n 9 3 5 explanatory variables all quantitative predictors can be based on one or multiple measures e g average sum variability minimum maximum they can also illustrate previous abiotic conditions e g weather variables one two and three years before measurement in clotfelter et al 2007 half of the reviewed articles n 52 used from six to 20 independent variables but a large number used fewer from 2 to 5 n 35 fig 3d only 9 articles used more than 20 predictors from 21 to 50 n 7 more than 50 n 2 we were not able to determine the number of explanatory variables for three articles it is worth noting that the two studies with more than 50 predictors kwok et al 2016 ladwig et al 2016 obtained a large number of explanatory variables because of the extensive use of different time lags on a modest number of measures they did not include more than 50 unrelated parameters meteorological e g temperature cloudiness radiation humidity precipitation wind speed atmospheric pressure and climatic measures north atlantic oscillation north pacific gyre oscillation pacific decadal oscillation el niño southern oscillation southern oscillation index north pacific index artic oscillation index etc were used as predictors in almost all the reviewed studies n 89 fig 3c followed by physical and chemical characteristics e g salinity ph dissolved oxygen nutrients and pollutant concentration and hydrological and hydraulic metrics e g depth velocity discharge turbidity wave height sinuosity in 49 and 39 articles respectively the effects of sampling site features e g topography elevation land cover habitat type sedimentary characteristics distance to the coast were analysed in 17 studies while direct anthropogenic impact e g hunting logging engineering oil spill was studied in only five articles sixty eight articles used two or more categories of abiotic variables 3 6 sampling strategy the average study duration of the 99 papers was 23 46 years min 3 max 114 sd 15 92 median 20 fig 4 the sampling frequency occurred monthly or at least several times a year in 32 articles but a significant number of the studies n 22 involved yearly sampling or less fig 3e fieldwork performed more than once a month was less frequent weekly or fortnightly n 15 daily or several times a week n 5 sampling frequency was not indicated in a large number of studies n 25 only three studies can be considered as experimental i e at least one environmental condition was controlled daghighi et al 2017 gutiérrez fonseca et al 2018 and waterkeyn et al 2011 who studied the effects of salinity and hydrological disturbance in mesocosms the remaining 96 articles were observational studies the articles studying only one site were similar in number to those studying more than 20 one site n 12 more than 20 sites n 13 fig 3f most papers involved an intermediate number of sampling stations 2 5 n 29 6 20 n 26 the number of sampling sites in 19 articles could not be determined 3 7 data analysis techniques in all 40 data analysis methods were recorded univariate methods were performed in 73 articles and multivariate techniques were used in 54 articles both methods were used in 28 articles statistical modelling is the most frequent type of analysis used in almost half of the reviewed articles n 46 in particular linear models were used in 34 studies table 5 ordination methods are also common used in 45 articles constrained ordination n 26 unconstrained ordination n 25 statistical tests mostly correlation tests n 27 73 0 of all studies with statistical tests were used in 37 studies the remaining analysis categories were performed in fewer than four articles there is a large gap in the use of univariate methods between the two main techniques i e linear modelling and correlation tests and the others e g additive modelling maxent there is no such gap in multivariate methods at least two distinct data analysis methods were combined in 43 articles to assess the effects of abiotic factors on biological communities with up to five methods involved in the reviewed section of one article ordination methods were often performed in combination with other analysis methods fig 5 for instance unconstrained ordination was associated with statistical tests in 13 studies and constrained ordination was combined with statistical modelling in 8 articles statistical modelling is the most common type of analysis used singly n 27 58 7 of all studies performing statistical modelling 3 7 1 statistical modelling for univariate analyses researchers can choose between three main types of model identified by levins 1966 in population biology analytical or mathematical models empirical or statistical or phenomenological models and mechanistic models also called causal models or process based models guisan and zimmermann 2000 most modelling techniques used in the studies belong to the empirical family i e models that aim to combine precision accuracy of predicted response and realism unrealistic assumptions are limited levins 1966 but do not describe realistic cause effect links between predictors and the response variables or inform about underlying ecological functions and mechanisms guisan and zimmermann 2000 in the reviewed literature statistical modelling was mainly performed by means of linear models table 5 mostly with ordinary and simple linear models n 23 50 0 of articles including modelling approaches table 6 e g linear regressions anova ancova they were used with other methods half of the time the purpose of linear modelling is to describe the relationship between a single response variable and a set of explanatory variables in order to test hypotheses about the model parameters or to forecast or predict values of the response variable legendre and legendre 2012 the response variable and the predictors cannot be interchanged the term linear is misleading it is possible to model non linear relationships e g polynomial trigonometric functions with linear models those models are linear in the parameters zuur et al 2009 i e each term of the explanatory part of the model is either a constant or the product of a parameter i e coefficient and a predictor the random part of an ordinary linear model is only composed of the real random term i e the residuals however the random part can be extended see table 6 with components that allow the model to take into account heterogeneity i e generalized least squares model nested data i e mixed effect model and temporal or spatial correlations e g auto regressive model auto regressive moving average model zuur et al 2009 these extensions were used in many of the studies performing linear modelling n 13 37 1 linear models can also be combined in a hierarchical model hm mackenzie and kendall 2002 royle 2004 which is a sequence of models ordered by their conditional probability structure santoro et al 2016 and which involves at least one model i e level of the hm model referring to an unobserved variable e g population abundance santoro et al 2016 used a two level hierarchical model in order to account for temporal variation in the probability of capture to evaluate changes in abundance when the dependent variable is not gaussian a generalized linear model glm with a non normal distribution e g poisson binomial gamma can be used to relate the explanatory variables to the response variable through a link function e g logarithm logit guisan et al 2002 however relatively few articles n 6 performed glm compared to linear models even though the distribution of the dependent variable is often not gaussian in ecology e g count data proportional data presence absence data the same extensions of the random part for linear models are also available in their generalized form in additive modelling in contrast to linear regressions a smoothing function is used to link an explanatory quantitative variable to the response variable instead of a coefficient zuur et al 2009 this non parametric method was used in only five articles it is an appropriate way of evaluating an empirical relationship instead of estimating the parameters of a model legendre and legendre 2012 it is also possible to generalise this method to non gaussian distributions and to extend the random part while frequentist methods are efficient for model comparison and evaluation bayesian frameworks i e approaches that consider that the parameters to be estimated are not fixed and where prior knowledge can be used zuur et al 2009 have many advantages in linear and additive modelling dorazio 2016 garamszegi et al 2009 hobbs and hilborn 2006 however only gutierrez et al 2016 took a bayesian approach by using markov chain monte carlo mcmc other statistical modelling methods were rarely performed n 8 hierarchical partitioning hp chevan and sutherland 1991 can be used in combination with other modelling techniques e g linear regression in order to assess the independent contribution of each predictor to the variation of the dependent variable it also enables the authors to avoid both multi collinearity issues and overfitting chevan and sutherland 1991 this method was used in marchant and dean 2014 and in latli et al 2017 with linear models and gam respectively maximum entropy modelling maxent jaynes 1957 is a type of species distribution model sdm very similar to glm gam which does not require absence data and has many advantages over other modelling of species distribution using presence only data phillips et al 2006 it was used by bateman et al 2016 and casey et al 2015 path analysis wright 1960 1921 is a special case of structural equations modelling grace et al 2012 legendre and legendre 2012 used to test causal hypothesis between multiple variables shipley 2013 unlike multiple linear regression from which it derives legendre and legendre 2012 it allows for more than a simple correlative relationship between two variables by including mediator moderator and covariate variables in the causal model irvine et al 2015 used this technique to assess the impact of anthropogenic drivers on biological conditions with bayesian estimation of the parameters it was also used by hallett et al 2014 who called it structural equation modelling to relate precipitation to community stability via species richness compensatory dynamics and dominant species stability quantile regression koenker and bassett 1978 is a method that estimates multiple slopes to describe the relationship between a response variable and predictors it is useful in cases of linear regression with heterogeneous variances cade and noon 2003 it was performed by menge et al 2011 to evaluate barnacle and mussel recruitment in response to climatic factors a multivariate analysis of variance manova the equivalent of a univariate analysis of variance anova applied to several continuous and independent response variables buttigieg and ramette 2014 james and mcculloch 1990 was performed in penczak 2011 3 7 2 ordination methods several problems occur when authors have to investigate the link between many explained variables and many drivers drawing all possible scatterplots is not only laborious but also uninformative and it is not possible to draw a plot with more than two or three axes each one representing a descriptor legendre and legendre 2012 however ordination methods widely used in multivariate frameworks make it possible to project such a multidimensional scatter plot onto bivariate graphs with axes representing a substantial portion of the data matrix variability in a reduced space a wide variety of methods were used in the reviewed literature belonging either to the unconstrained family table 7 upper part or to the constrained family table 7 lower part unconstrained ordination techniques aim to display a maximum amount of a dataset s variability on a few axes without presuming causal relationships ramette 2007 these methods are considered as exploratory and are used for indirect gradient analysis gradients are unknown a priori and are inferred from the response data buttigieg and ramette 2014 by contrast in direct gradient analysis gradients are known measured and directly related to the response dataset i e the biological variables in our case buttigieg and ramette 2014 direct gradient analysis can be performed with constrained ordination methods also called canonical analysis by comparing two or more matrices indeed these techniques aim to display only the dataset variation that can be modelled with constraining variables we identified two types of constrained ordination in the reviewed articles asymmetric methods and symmetric methods the asymmetric forms of constrained ordination involve a response matrix i e biotic variables in our case and an explanatory matrix i e environmental parameters in our case that cannot be interchanged without consequences on the analysis these methods combine ordination and regression the ordination of the response matrix is constrained to be linearly related to the explanatory matrix legendre and legendre 2012 however asymmetric constrained ordination methods like all traditional ordination techniques used in the articles are considered as algorithmic because the statistical properties of the data are not taken into account in contrast to model based methods which involve the specification of a statistical model hui et al 2015 warton et al 2015 in symmetric constrained ordination techniques the two data sets play the same role legendre and legendre 2012 most of these methods are considered as interpretive e g cca rda ccora paliy and shankar 2016 indirect gradient analysis was performed with unconstrained ordination as exploratory method mostly by means of ordinary principal components analysis pca which was also the most widely used ordination technique in the reviewed articles n 17 37 8 this method summarises a large number of quantitative variables in a few dimensions principal components that are orthogonal to each other and consist of linear combinations of input variables legendre and legendre 2012 pca was thus almost always used to limit the number of variables and avoid multicollinearity issues only jahan and choi 2014 used a single pca to visualise correlations between abiotic and biotic variables before testing them with a correlation test therefore pca in its ordinary form or in a derived form was not used for analysis strictly speaking and was always performed in combination with other methods e g correlation tests linear models canonical correlation analysis it was applied half the time n 9 47 4 on both biotic and abiotic variables with two separate pcas only on predictors in 7 studies and only on predictands in three articles different kinds of pca were not often used beaugrand et al 2000 performed a 3 mode principal components analysis 3 mode pca based on three classical pcas in order to assess variation of species abundance in time and space a between date pca bpca was used in latli et al 2017 to maximise the distance between the sampling years along the successive bpca axes and licandro et al 2012 used eigenvector filtering adapted to time series with missing values which corresponds to a pca calculated on an autocovariance matrix based on the original time series lagged with itself correspondence analysis ca also called reciprocal averaging was performed in five articles but in three different forms ordinary n 2 fuzzy n 2 and detrended n 1 ordinary correspondence analysis was first proposed for the analysis of two way contingency tables but in ecology it is mostly applied on sites x species presence absence or abundance matrices legendre and legendre 2012 although this method is analogous to pca it aims at maximising the correspondence between rows and columns unlike pca the same result is thus produced when transposing the data matrix moreover it preserves χ2 distance instead of euclidian distance i e ordinary straight line distance vaughan and ormerod 2012 achieved a ca on biological communities and then used the main axis of variation as a dependent variable fuzzy coded correspondence analysis fca chevenet et al 1994 can be applied on fuzzy coded data categories and subcategories e g biological traits and was used to relate community traits to temperature and precipitation in feio et al 2015 or to relate fca axes to environmental parameters in bêche and resh 2007 detrended correspondence analysis dca hill and gauch 1980 is used to remove the arch effect due to unimodal responses of communities to environmental gradients legendre and legendre 2012 it was performed by bortolini et al 2014 on biotic variables to produce axes subsequently used as response variables two other unconstrained ordination techniques were performed non metric multidimensional scaling nmds and min max autocorrelation factor analysis mafa nmds is not an eigenvector based technique so unlike pca and ca the input data is a distance matrix its aim is to represent the objects in a restricted number of dimensions i e two or three with all data variance utilised and it does not preserve the exact distance between objects the interpretations are thus qualitative and subjective james and mcculloch 1990 legendre and legendre 2012 paliy and shankar 2016 ramette 2007 jucevica and melecis 2006 performed an nmds on collembola communities and then used the two axes in correlation tests gutiérrez fonseca et al 2018 used nmds to define groups between macroinvertebrates assemblages and horn et al 2011 applied this method on diatom communities with vector fitting of explanatory variables prior to constrained ordination mafa is similar to pca but the axes represent a measure of autocorrelation van walraven et al 2017 used this technique on biological data prior to correlation test with mafa axes redundancy analysis rda is the most frequently used constrained ordination technique n 9 34 6 and was mainly performed in its ordinary form n 6 66 7 but distance based redundancy analysis db rda n 3 33 3 and partial redundancy p rda n 1 11 1 were also used ordinary redundancy analysis an asymmetric constrained ordination that allows for different types of explanatory variables i e quantitative and qualitative is the extension of multiple regression to the modelling of multivariate response data legendre and legendre 2012 however as mentioned above it is not considered to be model based warton et al 2015 this method is also the canonical version of pca where the components are constrained to be linear combinations of the environmental variables paliy and shankar 2016 ramette 2007 this technique is applied on sites x species matrices response data set and on sites x abiotic factors matrices explanatory data set for example li et al 2015 conducted ordinary rda to analyse the effect of climate factors on vegetation assemblage distance based redundancy analysis also called distance based linear model distlm is a particular form of rda carried out on a distance matrix and thus allows an analysis based on various distance functions it was performed in three studies abonyi et al 2018 pitacco et al 2018 zettler et al 2017 for example to quantify the variation in benthic community explained by climatic parameters in pitacco et al 2018 partial redundancy analysis is used to analyse the effect of an explanatory matrix x on the matrix y adjusted for the effect of covariables in a matrix w this method was used by horn et al 2011 to isolate the effect of climate variables from that of trophic variables on a phytoplankton community lévesque et al 2017 used variation partitioning vp by redundancy analysis in order to partition the effects of temporal spatial and environmental parameters on zooplankton communities canonical correspondence analysis cca another asymmetric technique similar to rda in many aspects was performed in 7 articles mainly with no other data analysis method n 5 71 4 any data suitable for ca can be used as the response matrix y legendre and legendre 2012 ramette 2007 and although cca is suitable for unimodal responses it seems to be robust for other responses e g bimodal unequal ranges ramette 2007 however its predictive power is inferior to that of glm because the same explanatory variables are used for the whole community in constrained ordination whereas species specific subsets of predictors can be defined in modelling guisan et al 1999 cca was used in garcia et al 2012 to study the relationship between fish species abundance and environmental variables water temperature salinity rainfall and also in pace et al 2013 to analyse the link between taxa abundance of aquatic insects and environmental variables like ca this method preserves χ2 distance multiple discriminant analysis mda also called linear discriminant analysis lda or discriminant function analysis dfa is not interpretive but discriminatory paliy and shankar 2016 this technique is used to determine the linear combination of explanatory variables that best defines an already known grouping of objects legendre and legendre 2012 however this method is often used as an exploratory ordination technique james and mcculloch 1990 it was used in kodama et al 2002 to explain the groups of fish and invertebrates constituted with nmds and cluster analysis with environmental variables canonical correlation analysis ccora is the symmetric equivalent of rda and was the most frequently used symmetric constrained analysis method n 5 71 4 the difference between these two techniques can be compared to the difference between simple linear regression and linear correlation legendre and legendre 2012 studied objects e g sites in ccora are described by two matrices containing quantitative parameters i e raw data and treated symmetrically legendre and legendre 2012 stated that this method has limited applications nowadays for two reasons 1 the use of co inertia analysis coia a similar but more flexible technique and 2 many ecological issues are asymmetric i e variables are defined as explanatory or explained by the study design and their roles cannot be swapped nevertheless it was used in five articles once alone in aßmus et al 2009 and four times with other methods for example in molinero et al 2006 where pca was first conducted on both biotic and abiotic variables before the axes were submitted to a ccora as explained above coia is an alternative method to ccora presenting many advantages for example it allows multicollinearity issues among variables in the same matrix it preserves euclidian distance instead of mahalanobis distance and the number of species does not have to be less than the number of sampling sites legendre and legendre 2012 this technique is also based on covariance and not on correlation paliy and shankar 2016 however it was only performed in latli et al 2017 on principal component axes of environmental and faunal variables statico a method that combines partial triadic analysis pta tucker 1966 and coia is used to study the dynamics of the relationship between environmental parameters and biological communities by analysing sequences of paired ecological tables thioulouse et al 2004 it was used only in mazzocchi et al 2012 to investigate stable patterns and interannual changes in the relationships between copepods and their environment 3 7 3 statistical tests correlation tests were the most frequently used data analysis method after linear modelling n 27 and were mainly used in combination with other techniques n 17 63 0 they were mostly performed as pearson correlation tests n 17 63 0 which measures the intensity of the linear relationship between two random variables and does not assume any functional or explanatory response or causal link between them legendre and legendre 2012 thus unlike linear modelling the two variables play the same role and can be swapped spearman s rank order correlation spearman 1907 a non parametric correlation test based on ranks was used in 8 studies to measure the strength of non linear monotonic relationships two other correlation methods were used cross correlation functions ccf to identify the time lag for the predictor that maximises the correlation in gröger and rumohr 2006 licandro et al 2012 and szentkirályi et al 2007 and partial correlation in van der wal and stien 2014 where it was used to analyse the correlation between plant biomass and weather parameters cloud cover and rainfall after controlling for the effect of temperature we were not able to determine which correlation technique was used in two articles only three other statistical tests were very occasionally used the bio env procedure permanova and student s t test the bio env procedure clarke and ainsworth 1993 is a technique that aims to select relevant explanatory variables by performing correlation tests between a dissimilarity matrix derived from a species specific metric e g abundance and several dissimilarity abiotic matrices it was used in 8 articles and six times with no other method permutational multivariate analysis of variation permanova anderson 2001 a non parametric method used to perform multivariate anova and test differences between object classes was used in gutiérrez fonseca et al 2018 to assess differences in abiotic parameters between groups after non metric multidimensional scaling student s t test was performed in lawrence et al 2010 to detect differences in biotic integrity between two categories of climate parameters 3 7 4 other data analysis methods the five remaining categories of data analysis techniques are found in only 7 articles although most of the models reported in the studies can be depicted as statistical models three articles used mechanistic models unlike empirical models mechanistic models which are considered to be both realistic and general are based on real cause effect relationships but their predictive power is often lower guisan and zimmermann 2000 poggiale and dauvin 2001 used a discrete population dynamics model that included sea temperature competition and environmental pollution calibrated by minimizing the distance between simulated and observed data to estimate the different parameters e g carrying capacity optimal growth temperature a similar method was used by mutshinda et al 2017 and kerimoglu et al 2013 the self organizing map som kohonen 1982 is an unsupervised learning algorithm of the artificial neural network ann that identifies clusters and maps high dimensional data into a two dimensional representational space every input data item selects the best matching model each one associated with a neuron that is represented on the two dimensional grid of the som with similar models associated with closer neurons kohonen 2013 in choi et al 2015 both environmental and community data were used as input variables while penczak 2011 only entered biotic variables and then performed a manova on environmental variables using the som clusters as categorical explanatory variable classification and regression trees cart is a model based tree classifier that explains the variation of a response variable with one or more predictors by splitting the data into nodes that best distinguish between samples ayón and swartzman 2008 de ath and fabricius 2000 this technique is suitable for the analysis of complex ecological data and has many strengths it can deal with non linear relationships missing values and categorical or quantitative variables nevertheless this method is univariate unlike multivariate regression trees mrt an extension of cart to multivariate response data de ath 2002 larsen and speckman 2004 ayón and swartzman 2008 used this method to determine the parameter with the strongest effect on zooplankton biovolume asymmetric eigenvector maps aem blanchet et al 2008 is a spatial eigenfunction analysis a family of methods for multiscale analysis where eigenvectors of spatial configuration matrices are calculated and then used as predictors aem specifically considers asymmetric directional physical processes in order to model multivariate spatial distributions and can be extended to time series analysis legendre and gauthier 2014 for example lévesque et al 2017 performed aem to model temporal structure and used it as an explanatory variable of zooplankton taxa abundance finally wavelet analysis is a time series analysis method that has many advantages over other similar techniques e g spectral analysis including robustness to missing values and non necessity of stationarity of the time series torrence and compo 1998 it was performed in menge et al 2011 by means of cross wavelet and wavelet coherence to investigate respectively the covariance and the correlation between recruitment of barnacles and mussels and each environmental variable in a temporal framework 4 discussion 4 1 trends in study characteristics and study design our review documented a wide variety of study designs methods of data analysis and modelling in long term studies with an increasing number of studies since the mid 1990s while this increase may partly be due to difficulty finding older articles the dominant duration of studies i e up to twenty years and the average publication date 2010 suggest that many of the studies were initiated in the early 1990s in the context of a growing awareness of biodiversity loss e g the rio de janeiro earth summit in 1992 more recently the effect of climate change on biodiversity which has been the subject of a growing body of published literature chapman et al 2014 jaeschke et al 2014 may also contribute to the increasing number of long term studies the fact that 75 of the articles resulting from our search concerned aquatic ecosystems especially marine systems was surprising because none of the key words in our search was directly linked to this type of habitat or to the biological communities that live in it by contrast jaeschke et al 2014 reviewed studies on the impact of climate change on organisms and ecosystems published between 2003 and 2013 and found that 44 of the studies focused on aquatic ecosystems this suggests that aquatic habitats are either the subject of long term studies older long term studies or studies that focus on parameters not necessarily linked to climate change due to the focus on aquatic habitats in our review only taxa and groups associated with these habitats were widely investigated taxa linked mainly to terrestrial habitats being underrepresented as in jaeschke et al 2014 south america asia and africa are underrepresented in the reviewed studies compared to europe and north america jaeschke et al 2014 demonstrated a positive correlation between gross domestic product and the number of studies per country thus the low number of studies carried out in south america asia and africa might be due to financial reasons especially as funding is a major challenge in long term ecological monitoring strayer et al 1986 we expected more articles to be associated with lter and similar networks and the relatively low number may be due to our selection criteria the use of community indices is less than we expected as these have many advantages such as the synthesis of information however they also have a number of drawbacks notably regarding the use of cardinal indices e g shannon index which are the most commonly used diversity indices for instance all individuals of the same taxon are considered equal e g their body size is not taken into account and all taxa are assumed to be equally different cousins 1991 peet 1974 researchers working with these widely used indices are also confronted with the problem of knowing which index to use this in turn raises another equally important question what is meant by diversity this is a critical issue because diversity may refer to different concepts namely species richness equitability and heterogeneity peet 1974 and the absence of a clear cut definition has led to the development of a large number of diversity indices hurlbert 1971 the choice of the appropriate index must also be based on the community to be studied e g the taxa involved and on knowledge about it i e species richness known or unknown pielou 1966 at last specific characteristics of similar indices should be compared for instance the shannon index is more sensitive to rare species than the simpson index peet 1974 finally diversity indices carry specific recommendations for example they should only be used for members of a single taxocene in other words taxa that are likely to be of about the same size to have similar life histories and compete over both evolutionary and ecological time deevey 1969 this review documented a wide range of sampling strategies especially with regard to duration frequency and number of study sites this finding is in accordance with magurran et al 2010 who observed that long term ecological studies show considerable variation in their sampling design and that this can be attributed to several factors such as the variety of study aims or the life cycle duration of the monitored taxa the duration of the reviewed studies median 20 years is longer than that found by jackson and fureder 2006 median 9 years this difference could be due to their focus on freshwater macroinvertebrates whose life cycles are shorter than those of many taxa studied in the articles in our review we also assume that years with no data were not always indicated which may have led to an overestimation of the study s duration as in jaeschke et al 2014 we observed more field observation than experimental studies which could be explained by our selection criterion of studies analysing the effects of two or more abiotic parameters on two or more taxa 4 2 data analysis methods despite the fact that our review focused on long term ecological studies few data analysis techniques accounted for temporal correlation in the response data therefore most of the tools described in the studies could also be used with short term studies although we selected studies involving multiple taxa and abiotic parameters most of the methods used were univariate and not multivariate this might be due to the fact that community metrics were exclusively analysed using univariate techniques moreover these methods were often used on species specific metrics applied to groups of species e g total abundance or when only a few taxa were studied it may also be because multivariate analyses can be more difficult to understand perform and interpret and might be computationally demanding paliy and shankar 2016 one could argue that the application of two or more methods which occurred in almost half of the reviewed studies indicates a lack of accuracy in the study design and its underlying rationale however in general both univariate and multivariate techniques were performed in such situations in order 1 to analyse the effects of environmental parameters at both community and species level e g constrained ordination was often used in combination with statistical modelling or 2 to produce synthetic variables before performing the analysis itself e g unconstrained ordination was often performed before statistical modelling and correlation tests the combination of several data analysis techniques may highlight their complementarity rather than methodological weakness the preponderance of linear models and correlation tests compared to other univariate methods may be due to the flexibility of linear modelling and the simplicity of both techniques compared to more complex and recent procedures e g maximum entropy modelling additive modelling by contrast the frequency of use of multivariate methods especially ordination techniques is more balanced between the techniques because they appear to be less flexible and more specialised e g techniques suited to short versus long gradients symmetric versus asymmetric methods direct versus indirect gradient analysis most reported models belong to the statistical type with mechanistic models only observed in three articles and no analytical model the latter focuses on precision and generality and is thus designed to be used within a limited or simplified reality guisan and zimmermann 2000 the absence of this type of model could be explained by our selection criteria e g at least two abiotic factors together with the overwhelming majority of observational studies in the reviewed articles involving many ecological phenomena despite multiple criticisms of frequentist methods in the literature e g beninger et al 2012 dorazio 2016 garamszegi et al 2009 hobbs and hilborn 2006 stephens et al 2007 analyses performed in a bayesian framework were very rare we also observed only a modest use of glm compared to ordinary linear models in many cases the specification of a non gaussian distribution e g poisson binomial is not relevant for most of the community metrics used in the reviewed studies and linear modelling is therefore more appropriate nevertheless we suspect that glm e g poisson regression was sometimes called linear modelling or linear regression the infrequent use of modelling methods other than linear modelling can be explained both by their specificity e g maxent for presence only data manova for more than one response variable and a grouping explanatory factor and by the lack of knowledge nevertheless because these methods are very specific and can be used when linear modelling is not possible researchers should know about them and when they can be used regarding ordination techniques pca was used more than ca because the former was performed on both biotic and abiotic variables whereas the latter was used only on biological data due to the more restricted input data legendre and legendre 2012 suggested that coia is used more than ccora because of its flexibility but we found coia in only one article and ccora in five the fact that coia is currently used less in ecology than ccora could be due to its relative novelty asymmetric constrained ordination methods were used much more frequently than symmetric ones this is consistent with the fact that 1 many ecological issues are asymmetric legendre and legendre 2012 and 2 we only selected studies analysing the effects of environmental parameters on biological communities i e asymmetric topics however this preferential use of asymmetric methods is much more marked for constrained ordination methods than for univariate techniques we assume that this difference is due to the application of correlation tests instead of linear models to study asymmetric topics this can be appropriate when not only the response variable but also the predictors are random legendre and legendre 2012 even if model ii regression is a more generally accepted alternative laws and archie 1981 the ordination methods used in the reviewed studies are not model based but algorithm based hui et al 2015 warton et al 2015 no doubt because the development of multivariate model based approaches is extremely recent our findings on the relative frequency of multivariate techniques are broadly similar to those of previous studies for instance james and mcculloch 1990 who summarised and reviewed the use of multivariate techniques in ecology and systematics also found that pca was the most frequently used ordination method and that linear models were widely used however they highlighted many differences in the use of analysis methods in their literature review asymmetric constrained analyses i e cca and rda were not reported which is not surprising because these are recent methods that had only been developed a few years previously similarly ramette 2007 found that exploratory methods performed by means of pca and cluster analysis were used much more often than interpretive methods most of the methods used to analyse multidimensional ecological data sets mentioned in legendre and legendre 2012 were encountered in our study selection however we did not find a number of other methods that have been described in similar reviews i e james and mcculloch 1990 paliy and shankar 2016 parker and arnold 1999 ramette 2007 table 8 although their use might be appropriate descriptions of these methods many of which have been developed recently are provided in similar reviews cited above in particular in paliy and shankar 2016 4 3 overview of prospective data analysis techniques the decision tree fig 6 could provide a rough guide to groups of potential approaches while descriptions of methods and examples of uses given in the results section should help researchers to differentiate between techniques however the decision tree only introduces potential tools based on broad features and does not assess their relevance notably for long term ecological studies techniques shown in table 8 are also suggested in addition to methods found in the reviewed articles paliy and shankar 2016 fig 8 provided a decision table that could also help select multivariate techniques 4 4 limitations of this study the main purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the study design features and data analysis techniques that are currently used in long term ecological studies its purpose is not to assess whether the features and analyses used in each study are the most suitable or whether the techniques assumptions are satisfied within the framework of this review only a few general indications can be given e g fig 6 techniques that are common in ecological studies are frequently misused for example 1 misinterpretation of p values and overlooking statistical power in the frequentist approach and null hypothesis testing beninger et al 2012 2 temporal autocorrelation in time series i e observations that are closer in time are more similar or less in the case of negative temporal autocorrelation than observations paired at random zuur et al 2009 3 model specifications and validation essential assumptions e g for linear modelling linearity in parameters predictors not correlated with the error term non collinearity between predictors non auto correlation in residuals homoscedasticity and normality in distribution of residuals are frequently violated or not checked boldina and beninger 2016 alternative or better fitting methods often exist e g multivariate techniques specifically designed for time series such as aem prc and statico bayesian methods as alternative frameworks for frequentist techniques likelihood and information theoretic approaches instead of null hypothesis testing readers who are considering an analysis technique based on our decision tree fig 6 are strongly advised to refer to specialized literature on the technique to look carefully at its underlying assumptions and to consider possible alternatives declaration of competing interest none credit
