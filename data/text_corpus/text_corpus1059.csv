5295,natural soils often exhibit stratification thus resulting in distinct flow and deformation patterns within each stratum as acted on by applied compaction stress or induced fluid pressure gradient a comprehensive theoretical model of poroelasticity is rigorously established in the current study which provides a detailed mathematical treatment of soil deformation and pore fluid pressure change through the upper unsaturated and lower saturated zones caused by time invariant external loads this double layer system consists of an upper soil layer bearing air and water simultaneously whereas a lower soil layer remains entirely saturated a linear transformation that exactly separates our coupled model equations into analytically solvable coordinates is first achieved then a boundary value problem involving these equations under a semipermeable drainage scenario is formulated as a representative example which complies with the physical constraint to ensure the continuity of pore water flux and pressure at the interface the problem is solved analytically using laplace transformation and next computed numerically with hydraulic and elasticity parameters corresponding to a saturated clay overlain by an unsaturated sand to evaluate the excess pore fluid pressure and total settlement in each zone a parametric study is also performed to examine the effect of initial water content and soil texture on the deformation behavior of the soil as well as on the development of the pore fluid pressure the excess pore water pressure in each zone is mutually affected therefore if the upper unsaturated zone has a lower hydraulic conductivity it would hinder as compared to the opposite condition the dissipation of the excess pore water pressure in the lower saturated zone as a consequence of water drainage blockage occurring in the former thus a significant implication of our results is that change in thickness of the lower saturated zone created by land surface stress loads will always be overestimated when its interaction with the hydromechanical behavior of the upper unsaturated zone is neglected keywords soil deformation pore pressure changes poroelasticity saturated unsaturated 1 introduction a natural soil is a multi component system that generally contains layered deposits each inherently possessing distinct hydrological and geophysical properties this attribute thus results in a broad spectrum of flow and deformation patterns within strata as responding to changes in interstitial pressure gradient or variations in external stress a central problem has long concerned the predictive mathematical description of simultaneous solid framework deformation and immiscible fluid transport through the vadose zone or aquifer traditionally a two layer soil profile that reflects the phenomenological configuration of the vadose zone and aquifer has been studied as a representative example where an upper layer is composed of a porous medium concurrently bearing air and water accordingly having a saturation dependent hydraulic conductivity and exhibiting negative pressure under tension or suction whereas positive pressure exists in a lower layer that always remains saturated leading to a greater hydraulic conductivity therefore the development of a set of coupled partial differential equations and constitutive relationships complemented with the proper initial and boundary conditions especially at the interface for a detailed macroscopic analysis of water movement through those layered deformable porous formations has been the subject of extensive investigations for many decades in subsurface engineering applications in perhaps the earliest application of mathematical treatments to the mechanics of saturated soils terzaghi 1925 showed that the temporal and spatial evolution of excess pore water pressure caused by applied constant compaction stress can be described by the classical partial differential equation like that for governing the diffusion of heat in solids nevertheless in reality the dissipation of excess pore water pressure at the same time creates an increment in solid stress in turn inducing the deformation of the porous skeleton the latter physical process immediately responds back to the fluid field consequently changing pore pressures and vice versa biot 1941 appeared to be the first to present a pair of coupled equations to account for this two way solid fluid interaction occurring in a saturated porous medium now known as the theory of poroelasticity biot 1956 1962 with connection to the concept of effective stress proposed by terzaghi 1925 bear and corapcioglu 1981 derived one depth averaged field scale flow equation for describing land subsidence due to the withdrawal of groundwater indeed the presence of the second interstitial fluid significantly affects the mechanical response of fluid permeated soils extension of the theory to characterize both quasi static and dynamic poroelastic behaviors in such a more complex system due to the existence of two immiscible pore fluids was systematically achieved in a series of papers such as tuncay and corapcioglu 1996 1997 lo et al 2005 2010 2013 borja 2006 as well as song and borja 2014 grounded on these stimulating works lo et al 2014 generalized the biot 1941 poroelastic model of consolidation to an elastic porous medium containing two immiscible viscous compressible fluids in an eulerian framework and then formulated a set of closed form analytical series solutions applicable for both fully permeable and semi permeable boundary drainage conditions since the degree of water saturation and soil texture are two crucial physical properties that dominate the two way couplingbetween deformable solid matrix and compressiblepore fluids in unsaturated soils the quantitative impact of these two factors on the dissipation of pore water pressure as well as the time rates of change of total settlement was comprehensively examined by lo and lee 2015 an arbitrary form of time dependent external stress was permitted in the model of lo et al 2016 to provide more in depth interpretation of the problem involving strongly coupled transient fluid solid behavior in unsaturated soils lo et al 2017 developed a unifying approach to elucidate the effect of an extra momentum exchange arising from variations in volume fraction and material density of each constituent as a result of gravity forces on the solid fluid coupling mechanics in unsaturated soils a comparative study concerning how this momentum exchange influences fluid filled soils under both unsaturated and saturated conditions was thoroughly discussed by chao et al 2018 employing the technique of laplace transformation and fourier trigonometric series representation deng et al 2019 put forward the general complete complementary and particular solutions for describing the excess pore water pressure and total settlement of saturated soils in response to numerous harmonically varying types of external loading with any desired excitation magnitude and period due to the complex and tedious procedures in the mathematical framework relatively limited progress has been achieved in the derivation of analytical solutions for one dimensional consolidation behavior of a double layer soil involving unsaturated condition which in concept must be quite different from that under full saturation behnke and bianchi 1965 conducted a series of experiments to investigate the pressure distribution developed in two contiguous soil layers ponded with water on the topsoil subject to either transient or steady state flow condition schiffmann and stein 1970 proposed a pioneering approach to address the one dimensional consolidation problem of layered saturated soils in a quantitative manner using the numerical technique of finite element analysis desai and saxena 1977 examined the impact of permeability anisotropy on the consolidation of a multiple layer saturated soil huang and griffiths 2010 later applied the finite element method to evaluate the difference between the coupled and uncoupled consolidation models and then to contrast their accuracy in predicting the excess pore fluid pressure of a four layer saturated soil aside from focusing on the diffusive response i e only first order time derivative terms to be retained the phenomenon of wave induced liquefaction of seabed layered soils was studied by can ulker 2012 incorporating inertial effect zhang et al 2015 presented a variety of analytical solutions to one dimensional consolidation in a double layer saturated foundation under the combined action of depth varying initial pore fluid pressure and time dependent external loading in particular forms based on the coupled partial differential equations developed by dakshanamurthy et al 1984 fazeli et al 2018 numerically solved the layered soil consolidation problem under partial saturation using the approach of the incremental differential quadrature method despite these long standing advances and researches there are so far very few scientific studies undertaken to explore the physics of the stress flow coupling in the system of an upper layer unsaturated soil resemblance to vadose zone and a lower layer saturated soil resemblance to aquifer the analytical solution available for this intricate yet crucial problem is still missing as a first step to tackle these issues the current study develops a rigorous theoretical model of poroelasticity biot 1941 lo et al 2014 for the mathematical description of simultaneous soil deformation and interstitial fluid flow in a two layer soil profile where the upper layer is partially saturated whereas the soil below it is completely filled by water a configuration reflecting the typical geological arrangement with constant thickness encountered in subsurface environment because of the coupling occurring among water air and soil matrix it is required to seek normal coordinates that allow exact separation of our coupled equations into two individual partial differential equations each of which is thus analytically solvable next a boundary value problem involving these equations subject to a semipermeable drainage condition the top surface being permeable yet the bottom surface being impermeable together with obeying the requirement of continuity in pore water flux and pressure at the interface is then set up and later solved analytically using laplace transformation we note in passing that more robust computational models for unsaturated flow are now available in the literature including those that accommodate double porosity and non darcy flows e g borja and choo 2016 choo et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 however our analytical solutions are useful and reliable because they are exact and can be used to verify new computational models afterward these solutions are numerically calculated with hydraulic and elasticity parameters corresponding to a double layer soil consisting of sand texture at the top with its underlying zone containing clay texture to evaluate the excess pore fluid pressure and total settlement induced by constant external loading lastly a unified insight into the impact of soil texture and initial water content on the solid fluid mechanics is also discussed as well as their relative importance is investigated 2 model equations let us consider a two layer system where the upper soil layer with thickness h 2 is partially permeated by air and water while the thickness of the lower soil layer completely bearing water is h 1 fig 1 illustrates the schematic diagram of this system where the upper and lower layers correspond to the vadose zone and aquifer following the consolidation theory of poroelasticity respectively proposed by biot 1941 and lo et al 2014 for fully saturated and variably saturated soils a set of coupled partial differential equations describing the excess pore fluid pressure in the absence of body forces can be formulated for such a stratified system upper soil layer 1 1 q 1 p 1 t q 2 p 2 t b 1 2 p 1 z 2 1 2 q 3 p 1 t q

wetting fluid henceforth termed water p 1 signifies the incremental gauge or excess pressure of air in the upper soil layer p 2 and p 2 denote the incremental gauge or excess pressures of water in the upper and lower soil layers correspondingly q i i 1 4 characterizes the elasticity coefficients defined in lo et al 2014 and q 2 q 3 lo et al 2016 the viscous coupling parameter b j k s k rj η j j 1 2 k rj and η j expressing the relative permeability and dynamic shear viscosity of the fluid phase j respectively k s representing the intrinsic permeability of the porous soil framework c c refers to the coefficient of consolidation for saturated soils see also eq b2 1 in lo et al 2016 the physical representation of the coefficients q i and c c in terms of directly measurable parameters is detailed in appendix a t and z represent the time and vertical position respectively it should be noted that all physical parameters in eq 1 are evaluated in a reference configuration taken here as the unperturbed state prior to external loading because we are dealing with an elastic porous medium undergoing very small deformations biot 1956 lo et al 2005 the central problem in standard theory of poroelasticity another point to be stressed is that the physical quantity in the upper or lower layer is respectively specified as the one without or with the tilde such as p 2 or p 2 other than the subscript 1 or 2 3 boundary value problem now we assume the top z h surface of the upper soil layer to be a drainage boundary with respect to both water and air i e the pore fluid pressures are equivalent to the atmospheric pressure thus its conditions can be depicted mathematically by 2 1 p 1 h t 0 2 2 p 2 h t 0 where h h 1 h 2 since the lower soil layer is entirely saturated the air phase cannot flow through the interface separating these two soil layers which thus behaves as an impermeable barrier to air implying 2 3 p 1 h 1 t z 0 the condition of continuity requires that across the interface between the upper and lower soil layers both the flux and pore pressure of the water phase have to remain the same the imposition of this condition can be realized as 2 4 p 2 h 1 t p 2 h 1 t 2 5 π 2 p 2 h 1 t z π 2 p 2 h 1 t z where π 2 k s η 2 upper layer and π 2 k s η 2 lower layer since k r 2 1 at the interface due to full saturation s 2 1 the bottom surface z 0 of the lower soil layer is presumed to be impervious to water in analogy to the existence of an aquiclude which can be represented by 2 6 p 2 0 t z 0 we note in passing that the wetting interface separating the saturated and unsaturated zones i e z h 1 may fluctuate up and down since water content varies with time due to water drainage through the boundaries during the application of external loads this intricate phenomenon has long brought the derivation of the analytical solution for this problem to be intractable as a first step toward gaining a fundamental physical understanding of this unresolved complicated problem from an analytical perspective the current study examines the situation where the movement of the wetting interface during consolidation is sufficiently small to neglect its effect our result can thus serve as a methodological framework for advancing a more comprehensive theory the initial condition is considered to be the response to undrained situations during which neither the water nor the air content varies as the applied total compaction stress p is introduced the mathematical expression that interprets this physical condition is shown by lo et al 2014 in the form 3 1 p 1 z 0 γ 1 p 3 2 p 2 z 0 γ 2 p 3 3 p 2 z 0 γ 2 p where γ 1 and γ 2 represent the loading efficiencies for air and water in the upper soil layer and γ 2 stands for the loading efficiency for water in the lower soil layer lo et al 2014 these coefficients are related to directly measurable soil properties as summarized in appendix a apparently eqs 1 1 and 1 2 directly arising from the balance equations of momentum for the air and water phases lo et al 2014 feature the coupled terms characterizing the temporal change in p 1 and p 2 since they simultaneously appear in eqs 1 1 and 1 2 to obtain the analytical solution for these partial differential equations we thus need to seek a set of normal coordinates ξ and ζ the linear combinations of p 1 and p 2 as well as independent of each other to decouple eqs 1 1 and 1 2 completely 4 ξ ζ z p 1 p 2 1 d 1 e p 1 p 2 by transforming eqs 1 1 and 1 2 into a matrix form 5 1 k p 1 t p 2 t l 2 p 1 z 2 2 p 2 z 2 5 2 k q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 5 3 l b 1 0 0 b 2 after the linear transformation by introducing z one can have 6 ξ t ζ t z k 1 l z 1 2 ξ z 2 2 ζ z 2 decoupling requires the matrix 7 z k 1 l z 1 e d 1 q 1 q 4 q 2 q 3 1 g 1 g 2 g 3 g 4 to be diagonalized i e g 2 g 3 0 where g 1 g 2 g 3 and g 4 are equal to 8 1 g 1 e b 1 q 4 q 3 d b 2 q 2 q 1 d 8 2 g 2 b 1 q 3 d 2 b 2 q 1 b 1 q 4 d b 2 q 2 0 8 3 g 3 b 1 q 3 e 2 b 2 q 1 b 1 q 4 e b 2 q 2 0 8 4 g 4 d b 1 q 4 q 3 e b 2 q 2 q 1 e it follows from eqs 8 2 and 8 3 that one has 9 1 d b 2 q 1 b 1 q 4 b 1 q 4 b 2 q 1 2 4 b 1 b 2 q 2 q 3 2 b 1 q 3 9 2 e b 2 q 1 b 1 q 4 b 1 q 4 b 2 q 1 2 4 b 1 b 2 q 2 q 3 2 b 1 q 3 as a consequence eqs 1 1 and 1 2 can be decoupled into a pair of partial differential equations whose dependent variables ξ and ζ are the linear combinations of p 1 and p 2 by 10 1 ξ

e d 11 2 p 2 ξ ζ e d the corresponding initial and boundary conditions prescribed in eqs 2 and 3 in turn can be respectively written in terms of the coordinates ξ and ζ as 12 1 ξ z 0 γ 1 d γ 2 p 12 2

10 1 accordingly reducing it to an ordinary differential equation 13 s ψ z s ξ z 0 c 1 d 2 ψ z s d z 2 where ψ z s 0 ξ z t exp s t d t with the input of the initial condition in eq 12 1 the general solution to ψ z s can be expressed in the form 14 ψ z s a s sinh β 1 z b s cosh β 1 z γ 1 d γ 2 p s where a s and b s are the functions to be determined from the boundary conditions in eqs 12 2 and 12 3 as well as the parameter β 1 is defined as β 1 2 s c 1 along the same lines after applying laplace time transformation of eqs 1 3 and 10 2 together with taking into account the initial conditions in eqs 3 3 and 12 4 one can correspondingly deduce the general solution to ξ z s and p 2 z s in the form 15 1 ξ z s c s sinh β 2 z f s cosh β 2 z γ 1 e γ 2 p s 15 2 p 2 z s g s sinh β 3 z h s cosh β 3 z

provided for the determination of the functions c s f s g s and h s as an aside it should be noted that the governing eqs 1 1 and 1 2 represent a coupled system of equations which have been uncoupled via eqs 10 1 and 10 2 using normal coordinates this results in a pair of solutions for ξ and ζ via eqs 13 and 15 1 within a laplace transformation domain however the governing equation for the lower layer is given by eq 1 3 alone which results in the solution for p 2 via eq 15 2 within the laplace transformation domain following the procedure presented in appendix c the solution to p 2 z t ξ z t

subsequently the time dependent total settlements in the unsaturated the upper layer and saturated the lower layer zones s t and s t can be in turn calculated respectively by lo et al 2014 17 1 s t h

need to know the information of the elasticity coefficients q i i 1 4 together with the viscous coupling parameters b j j 1 2 which are dependent on the capillary pressure p c p 1 p 2 and the relative permeabilities k r 1 and k r 2 respectively it follows that water retention curve describing the relationship between capillary pressure and water saturation as well as hydraulic conductivity function depicting that between relative permeability and water saturation are required for computation of the coefficients q i and b j in the current study the widely known van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976

s express the residual and saturated volumetric fractions of water respectively van genuchten 1980 since the residual saturation is typically small we thus neglect it to set the water saturation s 2 equal to the effective water saturation s 2 e in eq 18 to verify the accuracy of our analytical solution we compare it to the biot 1941 model under the same boundary drainage condition with each layer having an identical clay texture and being entirely saturated by water fig 2 shows the comparison result evidently indicating that the dimensionless pore water pressure normalized by p obtained in this study eq 16 is in an excellent agreement with that determined from the biot model see also eq b5 in lo and lee 2015 the latter solution is presented in terms of the solid line in fig 2 5 results and discussions next a double layer soil consisting of an upper layer with sand texture and a lower layer with clay texture is selected as an illustrative example the elasticity and hydraulic coefficients necessary for numerical computations are summarized in table 1 which also lists the fitting parameters in the van genuchten mualem model for specifying the capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability saturation relationships at a given water saturation for clay loam and sand these parameters are given in rawls et al 1992 and lo et al 2007 numerical calculations to substitute the hydraulic elasticity and fitting parameters of sand loam and clay into eqs 16 and 17 to evaluate the excess pore air and water pressures as well as total settlement are implemented in matlab fig 3 illustrates the dependence on the dimensionless depth normalized by h of the dimensionless pore water pressure developed inside this double layer soil with respect to elapsed time 1 min 1 h and 1 day for three initial water saturations s 2 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 in the upper layer unsaturated sand it should be noted that the value of the number n of x n see also eq 16 necessary for solutions to be absolutely convergent and sufficiently accurate falls within the range varying from n 20 to n 100 for a two layer fully saturated soil verruijt 2013 which primarily relies on its hydraulic and elasticity properties however for a two layer soil with the upper layer under partial saturation as investigated in the current study we note that n 900 is required in order to ensure that the solution converges sufficiently leading the pore fluid pressures to be smooth at the layer interface see also figs 3 4 6 7 9 and 10 it can be seen from fig 3 that due to the presence of the interface the dimensionless pore water pressure in each layer is mutually affected on account of the continuity condition of pore water pressure and flux as pointed out in lo et al 2014 water only sustains a certain portion of external load at the moment when the load is imposed on the unsaturated soils as opposed to saturated soils where the load is almost borne by water alone in the upper soil layer since the loading efficiency γ 2 in sand takes the value around 0 03 0 06 see also lo et al 2014 for initial water saturation we investigated s 2 0 7 0 9 the excess pore water pressure generated is thus very small and also dissipates very fast this implies that most external load is carried directly by the solid skeleton in the upper soil layer in turn inducing immediate settlement see also fig 5 a in reference to the excess pore water pressure in the lower layer its dissipation proceeds slower than that in the upper layer due to a lower hydraulic conductivity as far as the dimensionless pore air pressure in the upper layer is concerned its spatial distribution is shown in fig 4 with respect to initial water saturation and elapsed time it can be observed that this excess pressure is negligible even at the earlier time t 1 min fig 5 depicts the impact of initial water content on dimensionless total settlement normalized by the maximum total settlement in the current study 0 013 m induced in both the upper and lower soil layers we also examine dimensionless total settlement for a single lower soil layer without the existence of the upper soil layer as plotted in fig 5 b it is clear from fig 5 that the dimensionless total settlement is independent of initial water saturation in each layer according to eq 17 this can be readily understood in a physical sense because the excess pore water and air pressures have nearly the same magnitude for each initial water saturation see also figs 3 and 4 thus leading to a very similar total settlement another physical implication of fig 5 b may be taken that as the upper layer consists of a higher permeability soil the settlement of the lower layer would behave like a single layer thus a conceptual simplification can be inferred from this result to address the effect of soil texture on the intimate two way mechanical coupling between the fluids and solid we investigate an opposite double layer soil profile i e unsaturated clay resides in the upper layer but the lower layer contains water saturated sand instead fig 6 gives a graphic description of the dimensionless pore water pressure along the dimensionless depth for varying initial water saturation and elapsed time evidently fig 6 reveals that the dissipation of excess pore water pressure in the lower layer saturated sand is hindered as compared to the opposite condition by the presence of the upper layer unsaturated clay despite water drainage being faster in sand than that in clay due to its lower hydraulic conductivity the dimensionless pore air pressure in the upper soil layer is examined in terms of elapsed time depth and initial water content in fig 7 this pressure apparently dissipates much slower than that in the opposite double layer we inspected previously see also fig 4 the induced dimensionless total settlement in each layer is then shown in fig 8 all curves in fig 8 a bear a similar trend that the dimensionless total settlement increases and then attains the final status around at t 4 hours irrespective of initial water saturation the largest dimensionless total settlement occurs as s 2 0 9 we can observe from fig 8 b that the dimensionless total settlement in the lower layer saturated sand is diminished because of the presence of the upper layer unsaturated clay comparison of figs 5 and 8 provides a physically consistent interpretation that as the upper layer contains a lower permeability soil the dissipation of excess pore water pressure in the lower layer would be encumbered thus it requires to take more time for total settlement to achieve the final state to gain a more physical insight into the effect of soil texture on variations in fluid flow and solid deformation of a two layer system an additional illustrative example of unsaturated loam upper layer and saturated sand lower layer is investigated the result of which is presented in figs 9 11 a comparative examination of figs 6 and 9 reveals that the pore water pressure in the lower sand layer dissipates much faster as unsaturated loam sits in the upper layer instead of unsaturated clay a direct physical cause behind this phenomenon is that the former has a higher hydraulic conductivity than the latter thus yielding more water drainage it is noted in passing that the pore water pressure across the interface is indeed continuous in figs 3 6 and 9 a change in pore water pressure gradient right above the interface is due to the existence of different dissipation rate in each soil layer which primarily depends on its hydraulic conductivity at given water saturation a final important point to be drawn concerning figs 3 11 is that the arrangement of soil horizons is crucial in controlling the transient nature of interactions between soil deformation and fluid flow occurring in a two layer system under a semipermeable boundary condition thus the practical significance of our results is to emphasize the necessity to account for the hydromechanical coupling between the solid skeleton and the interstitial fluids in the upper unsaturated zone if one would like to accurately evaluate soil deformation and pore fluid pressure changes in the lower saturated zone in response to ground surface compaction loads 6 conclusions we present a generalized mathematical model that provides a detailed description of the deformation pressure coupling between the porous solid skeleton and the interstitial fluids across the upper and lower zones where the former layer constitutes unsaturated soils while the latter layer is composed of saturated soils eq 1 the theoretical framework developed is quite general and thus its extension to a three or multiple layer system is straightforward our model is comprehensive to feature a set of coupled partial different equations that exactly account for interphase exchange of linear momentum between the fluid phases and the solid matrix caused by their relative velocities therefore a normal coordinate transformation is rationally established to decouple these equations into an analytically solvable formulation eq 10 a boundary value problem that is physically consistent with the continuity requirement of pore water pressure and flux across the interface between these two contiguous soil layers is formulated to quantitatively evaluate the excess pore fluid pressure and total settlement the analytical solution is well portrayed in eqs 16 and 17 the principal result in the current study the approach developed in the current study is quite general so that our analytical solution can be readily extended e g for a fully permeable boundary drainage condition a significant indication from our numerical calculation is that as external loads are exerted on ground surface the existence of the upper unsaturated zone considerably influences the development of total settlement and pore water pressure in the lower saturated zone through the continuity condition stipulated on the interface which thereby would impede the expulsion of water and in turn diminish the pressure dissipation rate in the latter lower saturated zone when the former

5295,natural soils often exhibit stratification thus resulting in distinct flow and deformation patterns within each stratum as acted on by applied compaction stress or induced fluid pressure gradient a comprehensive theoretical model of poroelasticity is rigorously established in the current study which provides a detailed mathematical treatment of soil deformation and pore fluid pressure change through the upper unsaturated and lower saturated zones caused by time invariant external loads this double layer system consists of an upper soil layer bearing air and water simultaneously whereas a lower soil layer remains entirely saturated a linear transformation that exactly separates our coupled model equations into analytically solvable coordinates is first achieved then a boundary value problem involving these equations under a semipermeable drainage scenario is formulated as a representative example which complies with the physical constraint to ensure the continuity of pore water flux and pressure at the interface the problem is solved analytically using laplace transformation and next computed numerically with hydraulic and elasticity parameters corresponding to a saturated clay overlain by an unsaturated sand to evaluate the excess pore fluid pressure and total settlement in each zone a parametric study is also performed to examine the effect of initial water content and soil texture on the deformation behavior of the soil as well as on the development of the pore fluid pressure the excess pore water pressure in each zone is mutually affected therefore if the upper unsaturated zone has a lower hydraulic conductivity it would hinder as compared to the opposite condition the dissipation of the excess pore water pressure in the lower saturated zone as a consequence of water drainage blockage occurring in the former thus a significant implication of our results is that change in thickness of the lower saturated zone created by land surface stress loads will always be overestimated when its interaction with the hydromechanical behavior of the upper unsaturated zone is neglected keywords soil deformation pore pressure changes poroelasticity saturated unsaturated 1 introduction a natural soil is a multi component system that generally contains layered deposits each inherently possessing distinct hydrological and geophysical properties this attribute thus results in a broad spectrum of flow and deformation patterns within strata as responding to changes in interstitial pressure gradient or variations in external stress a central problem has long concerned the predictive mathematical description of simultaneous solid framework deformation and immiscible fluid transport through the vadose zone or aquifer traditionally a two layer soil profile that reflects the phenomenological configuration of the vadose zone and aquifer has been studied as a representative example where an upper layer is composed of a porous medium concurrently bearing air and water accordingly having a saturation dependent hydraulic conductivity and exhibiting negative pressure under tension or suction whereas positive pressure exists in a lower layer that always remains saturated leading to a greater hydraulic conductivity therefore the development of a set of coupled partial differential equations and constitutive relationships complemented with the proper initial and boundary conditions especially at the interface for a detailed macroscopic analysis of water movement through those layered deformable porous formations has been the subject of extensive investigations for many decades in subsurface engineering applications in perhaps the earliest application of mathematical treatments to the mechanics of saturated soils terzaghi 1925 showed that the temporal and spatial evolution of excess pore water pressure caused by applied constant compaction stress can be described by the classical partial differential equation like that for governing the diffusion of heat in solids nevertheless in reality the dissipation of excess pore water pressure at the same time creates an increment in solid stress in turn inducing the deformation of the porous skeleton the latter physical process immediately responds back to the fluid field consequently changing pore pressures and vice versa biot 1941 appeared to be the first to present a pair of coupled equations to account for this two way solid fluid interaction occurring in a saturated porous medium now known as the theory of poroelasticity biot 1956 1962 with connection to the concept of effective stress proposed by terzaghi 1925 bear and corapcioglu 1981 derived one depth averaged field scale flow equation for describing land subsidence due to the withdrawal of groundwater indeed the presence of the second interstitial fluid significantly affects the mechanical response of fluid permeated soils extension of the theory to characterize both quasi static and dynamic poroelastic behaviors in such a more complex system due to the existence of two immiscible pore fluids was systematically achieved in a series of papers such as tuncay and corapcioglu 1996 1997 lo et al 2005 2010 2013 borja 2006 as well as song and borja 2014 grounded on these stimulating works lo et al 2014 generalized the biot 1941 poroelastic model of consolidation to an elastic porous medium containing two immiscible viscous compressible fluids in an eulerian framework and then formulated a set of closed form analytical series solutions applicable for both fully permeable and semi permeable boundary drainage conditions since the degree of water saturation and soil texture are two crucial physical properties that dominate the two way couplingbetween deformable solid matrix and compressiblepore fluids in unsaturated soils the quantitative impact of these two factors on the dissipation of pore water pressure as well as the time rates of change of total settlement was comprehensively examined by lo and lee 2015 an arbitrary form of time dependent external stress was permitted in the model of lo et al 2016 to provide more in depth interpretation of the problem involving strongly coupled transient fluid solid behavior in unsaturated soils lo et al 2017 developed a unifying approach to elucidate the effect of an extra momentum exchange arising from variations in volume fraction and material density of each constituent as a result of gravity forces on the solid fluid coupling mechanics in unsaturated soils a comparative study concerning how this momentum exchange influences fluid filled soils under both unsaturated and saturated conditions was thoroughly discussed by chao et al 2018 employing the technique of laplace transformation and fourier trigonometric series representation deng et al 2019 put forward the general complete complementary and particular solutions for describing the excess pore water pressure and total settlement of saturated soils in response to numerous harmonically varying types of external loading with any desired excitation magnitude and period due to the complex and tedious procedures in the mathematical framework relatively limited progress has been achieved in the derivation of analytical solutions for one dimensional consolidation behavior of a double layer soil involving unsaturated condition which in concept must be quite different from that under full saturation behnke and bianchi 1965 conducted a series of experiments to investigate the pressure distribution developed in two contiguous soil layers ponded with water on the topsoil subject to either transient or steady state flow condition schiffmann and stein 1970 proposed a pioneering approach to address the one dimensional consolidation problem of layered saturated soils in a quantitative manner using the numerical technique of finite element analysis desai and saxena 1977 examined the impact of permeability anisotropy on the consolidation of a multiple layer saturated soil huang and griffiths 2010 later applied the finite element method to evaluate the difference between the coupled and uncoupled consolidation models and then to contrast their accuracy in predicting the excess pore fluid pressure of a four layer saturated soil aside from focusing on the diffusive response i e only first order time derivative terms to be retained the phenomenon of wave induced liquefaction of seabed layered soils was studied by can ulker 2012 incorporating inertial effect zhang et al 2015 presented a variety of analytical solutions to one dimensional consolidation in a double layer saturated foundation under the combined action of depth varying initial pore fluid pressure and time dependent external loading in particular forms based on the coupled partial differential equations developed by dakshanamurthy et al 1984 fazeli et al 2018 numerically solved the layered soil consolidation problem under partial saturation using the approach of the incremental differential quadrature method despite these long standing advances and researches there are so far very few scientific studies undertaken to explore the physics of the stress flow coupling in the system of an upper layer unsaturated soil resemblance to vadose zone and a lower layer saturated soil resemblance to aquifer the analytical solution available for this intricate yet crucial problem is still missing as a first step to tackle these issues the current study develops a rigorous theoretical model of poroelasticity biot 1941 lo et al 2014 for the mathematical description of simultaneous soil deformation and interstitial fluid flow in a two layer soil profile where the upper layer is partially saturated whereas the soil below it is completely filled by water a configuration reflecting the typical geological arrangement with constant thickness encountered in subsurface environment because of the coupling occurring among water air and soil matrix it is required to seek normal coordinates that allow exact separation of our coupled equations into two individual partial differential equations each of which is thus analytically solvable next a boundary value problem involving these equations subject to a semipermeable drainage condition the top surface being permeable yet the bottom surface being impermeable together with obeying the requirement of continuity in pore water flux and pressure at the interface is then set up and later solved analytically using laplace transformation we note in passing that more robust computational models for unsaturated flow are now available in the literature including those that accommodate double porosity and non darcy flows e g borja and choo 2016 choo et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 however our analytical solutions are useful and reliable because they are exact and can be used to verify new computational models afterward these solutions are numerically calculated with hydraulic and elasticity parameters corresponding to a double layer soil consisting of sand texture at the top with its underlying zone containing clay texture to evaluate the excess pore fluid pressure and total settlement induced by constant external loading lastly a unified insight into the impact of soil texture and initial water content on the solid fluid mechanics is also discussed as well as their relative importance is investigated 2 model equations let us consider a two layer system where the upper soil layer with thickness h 2 is partially permeated by air and water while the thickness of the lower soil layer completely bearing water is h 1 fig 1 illustrates the schematic diagram of this system where the upper and lower layers correspond to the vadose zone and aquifer following the consolidation theory of poroelasticity respectively proposed by biot 1941 and lo et al 2014 for fully saturated and variably saturated soils a set of coupled partial differential equations describing the excess pore fluid pressure in the absence of body forces can be formulated for such a stratified system upper soil layer 1 1 q 1 p 1 t q 2 p 2 t b 1 2 p 1 z 2 1 2 q 3 p 1 t q

wetting fluid henceforth termed water p 1 signifies the incremental gauge or excess pressure of air in the upper soil layer p 2 and p 2 denote the incremental gauge or excess pressures of water in the upper and lower soil layers correspondingly q i i 1 4 characterizes the elasticity coefficients defined in lo et al 2014 and q 2 q 3 lo et al 2016 the viscous coupling parameter b j k s k rj η j j 1 2 k rj and η j expressing the relative permeability and dynamic shear viscosity of the fluid phase j respectively k s representing the intrinsic permeability of the porous soil framework c c refers to the coefficient of consolidation for saturated soils see also eq b2 1 in lo et al 2016 the physical representation of the coefficients q i and c c in terms of directly measurable parameters is detailed in appendix a t and z represent the time and vertical position respectively it should be noted that all physical parameters in eq 1 are evaluated in a reference configuration taken here as the unperturbed state prior to external loading because we are dealing with an elastic porous medium undergoing very small deformations biot 1956 lo et al 2005 the central problem in standard theory of poroelasticity another point to be stressed is that the physical quantity in the upper or lower layer is respectively specified as the one without or with the tilde such as p 2 or p 2 other than the subscript 1 or 2 3 boundary value problem now we assume the top z h surface of the upper soil layer to be a drainage boundary with respect to both water and air i e the pore fluid pressures are equivalent to the atmospheric pressure thus its conditions can be depicted mathematically by 2 1 p 1 h t 0 2 2 p 2 h t 0 where h h 1 h 2 since the lower soil layer is entirely saturated the air phase cannot flow through the interface separating these two soil layers which thus behaves as an impermeable barrier to air implying 2 3 p 1 h 1 t z 0 the condition of continuity requires that across the interface between the upper and lower soil layers both the flux and pore pressure of the water phase have to remain the same the imposition of this condition can be realized as 2 4 p 2 h 1 t p 2 h 1 t 2 5 π 2 p 2 h 1 t z π 2 p 2 h 1 t z where π 2 k s η 2 upper layer and π 2 k s η 2 lower layer since k r 2 1 at the interface due to full saturation s 2 1 the bottom surface z 0 of the lower soil layer is presumed to be impervious to water in analogy to the existence of an aquiclude which can be represented by 2 6 p 2 0 t z 0 we note in passing that the wetting interface separating the saturated and unsaturated zones i e z h 1 may fluctuate up and down since water content varies with time due to water drainage through the boundaries during the application of external loads this intricate phenomenon has long brought the derivation of the analytical solution for this problem to be intractable as a first step toward gaining a fundamental physical understanding of this unresolved complicated problem from an analytical perspective the current study examines the situation where the movement of the wetting interface during consolidation is sufficiently small to neglect its effect our result can thus serve as a methodological framework for advancing a more comprehensive theory the initial condition is considered to be the response to undrained situations during which neither the water nor the air content varies as the applied total compaction stress p is introduced the mathematical expression that interprets this physical condition is shown by lo et al 2014 in the form 3 1 p 1 z 0 γ 1 p 3 2 p 2 z 0 γ 2 p 3 3 p 2 z 0 γ 2 p where γ 1 and γ 2 represent the loading efficiencies for air and water in the upper soil layer and γ 2 stands for the loading efficiency for water in the lower soil layer lo et al 2014 these coefficients are related to directly measurable soil properties as summarized in appendix a apparently eqs 1 1 and 1 2 directly arising from the balance equations of momentum for the air and water phases lo et al 2014 feature the coupled terms characterizing the temporal change in p 1 and p 2 since they simultaneously appear in eqs 1 1 and 1 2 to obtain the analytical solution for these partial differential equations we thus need to seek a set of normal coordinates ξ and ζ the linear combinations of p 1 and p 2 as well as independent of each other to decouple eqs 1 1 and 1 2 completely 4 ξ ζ z p 1 p 2 1 d 1 e p 1 p 2 by transforming eqs 1 1 and 1 2 into a matrix form 5 1 k p 1 t p 2 t l 2 p 1 z 2 2 p 2 z 2 5 2 k q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 5 3 l b 1

q 2 q 3 2 b 1 q 3 as a consequence eqs 1 1 and 1 2 can be decoupled into a pair of partial differential equations whose dependent variables ξ and ζ are the linear combinations of p 1 and p 2 by 10 1 ξ

provided for the determination of the functions c s f s g s and h s as an aside it should be noted that the governing eqs 1 1 and 1 2 represent a coupled system of equations which have been uncoupled via eqs 10 1 and 10 2 using normal coordinates this results in a pair of solutions for ξ and ζ via eqs 13 and 15 1 within a laplace transformation domain however the governing equation for the lower layer is given by eq 1 3 alone which results in the solution for p 2 via eq 15 2 within the laplace transformation domain following the procedure presented in appendix c the solution to p 2 z t ξ z t

subsequently the time dependent total settlements in the unsaturated the upper layer and saturated the lower layer zones s t and s t can be in turn calculated respectively by lo et al 2014 17 1 s t h

need to know the information of the elasticity coefficients q i i 1 4 together with the viscous coupling parameters b j j 1 2 which are dependent on the capillary pressure p c p 1 p 2 and the relative permeabilities k r 1 and k r 2 respectively it follows that water retention curve describing the relationship between capillary pressure and water saturation as well as hydraulic conductivity function depicting that between relative permeability and water saturation are required for computation of the coefficients q i and b j in the current study the widely known van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 model will be employed to illustrate these relationships see also chen et al 1999 18 1 1 χ h c 1 m 1 m s 2 e θ 2 θ 2 r θ 2 s θ 2 r 18 2 k r 1 s 2 e 1 s 2 e ϑ 1 s 2 e 1 m 2 m 18 3 k r 2 s 2 e s 2 e ϑ 1

s express the residual and saturated volumetric fractions of water respectively van genuchten 1980 since the residual saturation is typically small we thus neglect it to set the water saturation s 2 equal to the effective water saturation s 2 e in eq 18 to verify the accuracy of our analytical solution we compare it to the biot 1941 model under the same boundary drainage condition with each layer having an identical clay texture and being entirely saturated by water fig 2 shows the comparison result evidently indicating that the dimensionless pore water pressure normalized by p obtained in this study eq 16 is in an excellent agreement with that determined from the biot model see also eq b5 in lo and lee 2015 the latter solution is presented in terms of the solid line in fig 2 5 results and discussions next a double layer soil consisting of an upper layer with sand texture and a lower layer with clay texture is selected as an illustrative example the elasticity and hydraulic coefficients necessary for numerical computations are summarized in table 1 which also lists the fitting parameters in the van genuchten mualem model for specifying the capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability saturation relationships at a given water saturation for clay loam and sand these parameters are given in rawls et al 1992 and lo et al 2007 numerical calculations to substitute the hydraulic elasticity and fitting parameters of sand loam and clay into eqs 16 and 17 to evaluate the excess pore air and water pressures as well as total settlement are implemented in matlab fig 3 illustrates the dependence on the dimensionless depth normalized by h of the dimensionless pore water pressure developed inside this double layer soil with respect to elapsed time 1 min 1 h and 1 day for three initial water saturations s 2 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 in the upper layer unsaturated sand it should be noted that the value of the number n of x n see also eq 16 necessary for solutions to be absolutely convergent and sufficiently accurate falls within the range varying from n 20 to n 100 for a two layer fully saturated soil verruijt 2013 which primarily relies on its hydraulic and elasticity properties however for a two layer soil with the upper layer under partial saturation as investigated in the current study we note that n 900 is required in order to ensure that the solution converges sufficiently leading the pore fluid pressures to be smooth at the layer interface see also figs 3 4 6 7 9 and 10 it can be seen from fig 3 that due to the presence of the interface the dimensionless pore water pressure in each layer is mutually affected on account of the continuity condition of pore water pressure and flux as pointed out in lo et al 2014 water only sustains a certain portion of external load at the moment when the load is imposed on the unsaturated soils as opposed to saturated soils where the load is almost borne by water alone in the upper soil layer since the loading efficiency γ 2 in sand takes the value around 0 03 0 06 see also lo et al 2014 for initial water saturation we investigated s 2 0 7 0 9 the excess pore water pressure generated is thus very small and also dissipates very fast this implies that most external load is carried directly by the solid skeleton in the upper soil layer in turn inducing immediate settlement see also fig 5 a in reference to the excess pore water pressure in the lower layer its dissipation proceeds slower than that in the upper layer due to a lower hydraulic conductivity as far as the dimensionless pore air pressure in the upper layer is concerned its spatial distribution is shown in fig 4 with respect to initial water saturation and elapsed time it can be observed that this excess pressure is negligible even at the earlier time t 1 min fig 5 depicts the impact of initial water content on dimensionless total settlement normalized by the maximum total settlement in the current study 0 013 m induced in both the upper and lower soil layers we also examine dimensionless total settlement for a single lower soil layer without the existence of the upper soil layer as plotted in fig 5 b it is clear from fig 5 that the dimensionless total settlement is independent of initial water saturation in each layer according to eq 17 this can be readily understood in a physical sense because the excess pore water and air pressures have nearly the same magnitude for each initial water saturation see also figs 3 and 4 thus leading to a very similar total settlement another physical implication of fig 5 b may be taken that as the upper layer consists of a higher permeability soil the settlement of the lower layer would behave like a single layer thus a conceptual simplification can be inferred from this result to address the effect of soil texture on the intimate two way mechanical coupling between the fluids and solid we investigate an opposite double layer soil profile i e unsaturated clay resides in the upper layer but the lower layer contains water saturated sand instead fig 6 gives a graphic description of the dimensionless pore water pressure along the dimensionless depth for varying initial water saturation and elapsed time evidently fig 6 reveals that the dissipation of excess pore water pressure in the lower layer saturated sand is hindered as compared to the opposite condition by the presence of the upper layer unsaturated clay despite water drainage being faster in sand than that in clay due to its lower hydraulic conductivity the dimensionless pore air pressure in the upper soil layer is examined in terms of elapsed time depth and initial water content in fig 7 this pressure apparently dissipates much slower than that in the opposite double layer we inspected previously see also fig 4 the induced dimensionless total settlement in each layer is then shown in fig 8 all curves in fig 8 a bear a similar trend that the dimensionless total settlement increases and then attains the final status around at t 4 hours irrespective of initial water saturation the largest dimensionless total settlement occurs as s 2 0 9 we can observe from fig 8 b that the dimensionless total settlement in the lower layer saturated sand is diminished because of the presence of the upper layer unsaturated clay comparison of figs 5 and 8 provides a physically consistent interpretation that as the upper layer contains a lower permeability soil the dissipation of excess pore water pressure in the lower layer would be encumbered thus it requires to take more time for total settlement to achieve the final state to gain a more physical insight into the effect of soil texture on variations in fluid flow and solid deformation of a two layer system an additional illustrative example of unsaturated loam upper layer and saturated sand lower layer is investigated the result of which is presented in figs 9 11 a comparative examination of figs 6 and 9 reveals that the pore water pressure in the lower sand layer dissipates much faster as unsaturated loam sits in the upper layer instead of unsaturated clay a direct physical cause behind this phenomenon is that the former has a higher hydraulic conductivity than the latter thus yielding more water drainage it is noted in passing that the pore water pressure across the interface is indeed continuous in figs 3 6 and 9 a change in pore water pressure gradient right above the interface is due to the existence of different dissipation rate in each soil layer which primarily depends on its hydraulic conductivity at given water saturation a final important point to be drawn concerning figs 3 11 is that the arrangement of soil horizons is crucial in controlling the transient nature of interactions between soil deformation and fluid flow occurring in a two layer system under a semipermeable boundary condition thus the practical significance of our results is to emphasize the necessity to account for the hydromechanical coupling between the solid skeleton and the interstitial fluids in the upper unsaturated zone if one would like to accurately evaluate soil deformation and pore fluid pressure changes in the lower saturated zone in response to ground surface compaction loads 6 conclusions we present a generalized mathematical model that provides a detailed description of the deformation pressure coupling between the porous solid skeleton and the interstitial fluids across the upper and lower zones where the former layer constitutes unsaturated soils while the latter layer is composed of saturated soils eq 1 the theoretical framework developed is quite general and thus its extension to a three or multiple layer system is straightforward our model is comprehensive to feature a set of coupled partial different equations that exactly account for interphase exchange of linear momentum between the fluid phases and the solid matrix caused by their relative velocities therefore a normal coordinate transformation is rationally established to decouple these equations into an analytically solvable formulation eq 10 a boundary value problem that is physically consistent with the continuity requirement of pore water pressure and flux across the interface between these two contiguous soil layers is formulated to quantitatively evaluate the excess pore fluid pressure and total settlement the analytical solution is well portrayed in eqs 16 and 17 the principal result in the current study the approach developed in the current study is quite general so that our analytical solution can be readily extended e g for a fully permeable boundary drainage condition a significant indication from our numerical calculation is that as external loads are exerted on ground surface the existence of the upper unsaturated zone considerably influences the development of total settlement and pore water pressure in the lower saturated zone through the continuity condition stipulated on the interface which thereby would impede the expulsion of water and in turn diminish the pressure dissipation rate in the latter lower saturated zone when the former upper unsaturated zone possesses lower hydraulic conductivity credit authorship contribution statement weicheng lo conceptualization methodology writing original draft supervision ronaldo i borja

5296,assessing the impact of climate change on floodplain productivity poses unique challenges for hydrodynamic models for example the dynamics of floodplain fisheries are governed both by inundation dynamics across thousands of km2 and water storage timing within small depressions which serve as fish habitat connected to the river network by meter scale manmade canals controlled by flow across fishing weirs here we propose to represent these features as a system of effective interconnected sub grid elements within a coarse scale model we test this strategy over the logone floodplain in cameroon and its floodplain fishery we first validate this strategy for a local study area 30 km2 we find that hydraulic models at resolutions from 30 m to 500 m are able to reproduce hydraulic dynamics as documented by in situ water level observations when applied to the entire floodplain 16 000 km2 we find that the proposed modeling strategy allows accurate prediction of observed pattern of recession in the depressions artificially removing floodplain canals in the model causes residence time of water in depressions to be overpredicted by approximately 30 days this study supports the strategy of modeling fine scale interconnected features as a system of sub grid elements in a coarse resolution model for applications such as assessing the sensitivity of floodplain fisheries to future climate change keywords hydrodynamic modeling flood inundation mapping logone floodplain small scale processes 1 introduction predicting and modeling flood extent and timing is vital to understanding the dynamics of floodplain fish and fisheries thompson and polet 2000 welcomme and hagborg 1977 floodplain fish have evolved to flooding seasonality and their populations are driven by both flood and dry season duration timing and magnitude depending on the location and season floodplain fisheries employ various techniques to catch fish some techniques like the use of fish canals alter the drainage system impacting flood extent and timing of onset and recession of floods which in turn affect the fish population and productivity delclaux et al 2011 laborde et al 2016 moritz et al 2016 future climate change is expected to produce changes in rainfall patterns and flows in river channels which will also impact floodplain dynamics in order to study the effects of floodplain fisheries and climate change on floodplain dynamics researchers have turned to hydrodynamic models hydrodynamic models are used to study complex links between hydrologic systems and social ecological systems bockelmann et al 2004 casas mulet et al 2014 devries et al 2012 garcía et al 2011 nislow et al 2002 and the impacts of climate change hirabayashi et al 2013 o neill and hulme 2009 hydrodynamic models predict the extent and timing of floods and hence providing means to estimate some of the most critical parameters governing fish population in floodplain fisheries welcomme and hagborg 1977 neal et al 2012 introduced sub grid modeling a strategy to systematically include and parameterize the effects of river channels smaller than the model grid scale in two dimensional hydraulic models a strategy that has opened the door to new applications kennedy et al 2019 komi et al 2017 schumann et al 2016 2013 wing et al 2017 wood et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2011 the need to estimate fish productivity and population for floodplain fisheries applications represent novel challenges to existing approaches however in order for hydraulic models to be useful in the context of understanding floodplain fisheries they will have to account for an interconnected system of elements functioning at sub grid spatial scales natural floodplain depressions store water on floodplains and provide habitat for fish to grow meter scale manmade canals link depressions and the river network and provide means to harvest fish at the end of the season weirs and fishnets are often installed on these canals and modulate flow during recession such features are typically ignored in conventional hydrologic and hydrodynamic model simulations fernández et al 2016 rajib et al 2019 sub grid modeling provides the means of representing such features within a larger scale model neal et al 2012 that has primarily been used to represent small river channels must be adapted to represent this entire floodplain depression canal river system of interconnected sub grid features the objective of this paper is to describe and evaluate a strategy for hydrodynamic modeling that can be coupled with a canal fishery model we propose the following adaptations to traditional sub grid modeling i we aggregate multiple fish canals and multiple depressions into a single effective model element to be represented as a sub grid feature ii we treat depression storage as a sub grid element as well as the fish canals thus creating an interconnected network of multiple types of sub grid features iii we propose a strategy for modeling fishnet structures as weirs as described below taken together these approaches represent a distinct and novel strategy in hydraulic modeling we test this modeling approach in the logone floodplain in the far north region of cameroon we work from a previous study in this area that reproduced large scale floodplain dynamics but ignored fish canals and other small scale processes important to hydraulic connectivity and fisheries fernández et al 2016 we assess sub grid modeling with a two part strategy first we study a single depression with multiple canals over a 30 km2 area and explore whether our strategy successfully captures observed water level dynamics as we vary the model spatial scale secondly we investigate whether a coarse scale 500 m model of the entire floodplain 16 000 km2 is capable of reproducing inundation dynamics within floodplain depressions which are sensitive to the presence of canals as demonstrated by laborde et al 2016 if demonstrated to adequately capture both local and floodplain scale dynamics the sub grid modeling approach will pave the way to couple hydrodynamic and fisheries models to study the impacts of the same small scale features on fisheries this type of modeling approach enhances our capacity to quantify and understand the effect of small canals in floodplains and flood prone areas 2 study area 2 1 geography hydrology and hydraulics the logone floodplain also known as yaayre covers about 16 000 km2 delclaux et al 2011 and is located in the far north region of cameroon it supports a large number of people with a population of about 200 000 laborde et al 2016 mitchell 2013 the floodplain is a part of lake chad basin and contains the waza national park 1700 km2 and kalamaloue national park 48 km2 the floodplain is highly productive and acts as breeding grounds for fish when inundated and provides dry season pastures that support cattle and other livestock and fertile land for growing rice the logone floodplain is a small part of the logone watershed and is located at the downstream part of the logone river fig 1 the floodplain has semi arid climate while the rest of the watershed has tropical wet and dry savannah climate murumkar et al 2020 the floodplain has mean annual rainfall of about 700 mm the upstream part of the watershed receives about 1200 mm annually evans and loth 2004a 2004b murumkar et al 2020 the first rainfall on the floodplain generally in june july plays an important role by saturating the dry clayey soil and overbank flow from logone logomatya and lorome mazra river channels floods the region in september october the region is inundated for about three to four months delclaux et al 2011 jung et al 2011 local rainfall has less control over flooding than the flow in the logone overbank flow is the biggest contributor to the inundation of the floodplain evans and loth 2004a because the area is relatively flat the flood spreads over a large area of about 8000 km2 delclaux et al 2010 before it drains back to the logone and the el beid river in the north the floodplain also experiences significant evapotranspiration throughout the year naah 1990 used piché evaporimeters and estimated the annual potential evaporation rate between 2700 mm and 3000 mm on the floodplain however it is important to note that maximum potential evaporation occurs between february and april when the floodplain is dry in the past decades human activities have significantly modified floodplain dynamics as a part of a large agricultural project semry ii for irrigated cultivation of rice the cameroonian government constructed a dam on the logone in 1979 which created a 400 km2 reservoir lake maga fig 1 upstream of the floodplain loth 2004 as a result of this the flooding in the floodplain reduced by about 30 delclaux et al 2010 which had a negative impact on the ecological and social systems in the floodplain loth 2004 scholte 2005 2 2 canal fisheries fishing is an important regional livelihood on the logone floodplain delclaux et al 2011 laborde et al 2016 landolt 2010 loth 2004 fishing techniques used include fish traps cast nets gill nets hooks and lines grass fishing over the last half century fish canals have gained popularity and their numbers have increased exponentially delclaux et al 2011 laborde et al 2016 fish canals are man made channels connecting the river to natural depressions in the terrain which act as seasonal ponds fig 2 fishers dig new fish canals and maintain the old ones by removing the deposited sediments from the previous flood these canals are used during flood recession to drain floodwater and channel fish moving off the floodplain through fishnets fig 2 a the technique is effective because the fish canals can drain high volumes of water during the period of highest fish densities fig 2 b shows a photograph of a fish canal in the dry season and fig 2 c shows a photograph of an installed fishnet in a fish canal in the dry season water is generally restricted to the rivers see fig 1 lake maga and a few natural depressions floodwaters bring fish onto the floodplain the inundated floodplain and natural depressions act as feeding and breeding grounds for fish fish population dynamics are driven by flooding patterns the onset of flooding is typically when fish spawn and the inundated floodplain provides a productive habitat for their primary growth period fish mortality is highest in the dry season when water volume is low because of high temperatures and low oxygen fish population biomass follows a boom and bust pattern similar to floodplain water volume floodplain fish production is driven by flooding patterns production has a positive relationship with flood magnitude and a negative relationship with dry season severity additionally flood timing and aquatic habitat connectivity are also important variables in spawning and survival success understanding spatial and temporal patterns in flooding is necessary to evaluate the availability of a key natural resource for regional livelihoods however fish canals connect the floodplain to the river and act as a hydraulic extension of the river drainage network increasing use of fish canals could potentially have effects on the flood dynamics with a change in inundation patterns or the timing of onset and recession of flooding our objective was to build a hydrodynamic model that captures the effect of these small scale features i e fish canals and fishnets on flood inundation dynamics locally in the depressions and globally in the whole floodplain system 3 methods and data 3 1 hydrodynamic modeling of the logone floodplain we used lisflood fp model to simulate hydrodynamic processes in rivers floodplain and fish canals lisflood fp is a grid based hydraulic model with one dimensional channel representation and two dimensional floodplain representation based on a simplification of the shallow water equations bates et al 2010 bates and de roo 2000 it can represent small channels using a sub grid scale parametrization of the channels geometry and friction neal et al 2012 where the channel is represented on a sub grid scale by using parameters to represent channel geometry and friction with sub grid parametrization rivers with widths smaller than the spatial resolution of the dem can be simulated efficiently and a separate 1d channel model is not necessary neal et al 2012 schumann et al 2014a 2014b simplified versions of the shallow water equations are then solved in the sub grid channel and floodplain grid cell simultaneously lisflood fp has been used to simulate inundation patterns for specific flood events bates et al 2005 neal et al 2011 and to study long term floodplain dynamics rudorff et al 2014a 2014b schumann et al 2013 among other applications using lisflood fp we build hydrodynamic models at the bara depression details in section 3 2 and of the larger logone floodplain details in section 3 3 below we build the bara model at 30 m resolution to capture small scale processes and upscale it to 500 m while preserving the effects of these small scale features we then build a model of the logone floodplain at 500 m resolution to examine the effects of the small scale processes on the larger system we introduce a new feature in lisflood fp to represent the fishnet structure which is modeled as a combination of a weir and trash screen this feature is specially included for this application and is not available in the standard version of lisflood fp fig 2 c shows a photograph of a fishnet in operation and consists of sandbags to obstruct the flow which we represent as the weir and a mesh made from twigs and leaves which we represent as the trash screen water drop across the fishnet fig 2 c is captured as a loss due to expansion and contraction of the flow area in the weir caused by the acceleration of flow through the structure balkham et al 2010 equations 1 2 and fig 3 show the mathematical representation of this structure 1 h s z w y w h ex y d where hs is the afflux of weir flow zw is the height of weir crest yw is the depth of weir flow over crest hex is head loss due to contraction and yd the downstream water depth 2 q c w b y w 3 2 where q is the discharge in m3 s cw is the discharge coefficient for weir flow typically between 1 4 and 1 7 and b is the effective width at the screen b width screen coefficient 3 2 modeling approach bara the bara region is a small area of about 30 km2 in the logone floodplain that we studied for understanding flooding dynamics the site consists of a river channel a depression of 1 1 km2 and nine fish canals that connect them lorome mazra the river channel in bara flows from south to north to study the effects of fish canals and fishnets we built a hydraulic model of bara at a resolution of 30 m where each fish canal is individually represented i e every fish canal is represented as a unique sub grid channel to quantify the impact of small scale local features captured in a coarser model we also built a hydraulic model of the same bara site at a resolution of 500 m 3 2 1 field data in the dry season of 2015 we surveyed the bara depression using auto levels to obtain the relative elevation profile of the depression first we established a reference point and recorded the location and ground elevation of this point using a gps then we recorded the locations and elevations of 97 sample points relative to the reference point using an auto level we performed ordinary kriging on this dataset to interpolate depression elevations at 30 m resolution fig 4 a shows the locations where we collected data and the final product after ordinary kriging we created a synthetic digital elevation model dem of the region outside of the depression fig 4 b by assuming that the floodplain has a slope of 10 cm km from south to north as obtained from shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem as the mean slope along the entire floodplain the interpolated data was burnt into the dem to represent the depression in the summer of 2016 we surveyed all the fish canals in the bara region and measured their width and depth at 50 m intervals this data gave us information about the longitudinal and cross sectional profiles of all the fish canals in bara region we used this data to parametrize the width and depth of all fish canals in this region we collected water depth measurements during the flood recession in all the representative features of the terrain floodplain depression fish canal and river channel laborde et al 2018 to understand the coupling among them a staff gage was installed in two locations for each feature water depth was recorded in each location twice daily fig 4 b shows the locations of these measurements water depth measurements were recorded for eleven days between 8 and 22 november 2014 no measurements between 13 and 16 november 2014 daily mean water depth was obtained from the collected data and the observed depth anomaly was used to evaluate the performance of the bara model 3 2 2 parametrization of river channel fish canals and fishnets bathymetry data was not available for the lorome mazra river so we approximated channel geometry using remote sensing data we used a 2009 satellite imagery from worldview 1 which has a spatial resolution of 50 cm to estimate the width of lorome mazra to be 25 m from the field data collected in 2014 the mean depth of fish canals along lorome mazra was 1 3 m with the range between 0 1 m and 2 8 m the depth of the river channel has to be greater than the depth of fish canals using this and the knowledge of field experts we assumed the depth of lorome mazra to be 3 m with an embankment of 60 cm height along the river in the 30 m model the nine fish canals were represented as individual features from the field data collected in 2016 we found that the mean width of the fish canals was 3 m and the mean depth of the canals near their start at the depression was 20 cm the canal bed sloped from the depression towards the river channel with a mean bed slope of 60 cm km we built the coarse resolution 500 m model similar to the fine resolution bara model the river channel was represented as a sub grid channel 25 m wide and 3 m deep the fish canals were also represented as sub grid channels as in the 30 m model however each fish canal could not be represented individually as multiple canals fell within a 500 m grid cell if there was more than one fish canal in a grid cell all the canals were aggregated such that the storage capacity of the aggregated fish canal was the same as the total storage capacity of all the fish canals falling in the grid cell the width of the aggregated canal was calculated as the sum of average width of all the canals falling in a grid cell a uniform depth of 0 5 m was assumed an aggregated canal generally consists of 1 or 2 grid cells so it wasn t feasible to define a bed slope gradient the aggregated length was calculated by dividing the storage capacity of the 30 m model by width and depth of fish canals the depression was also represented as a sub grid feature which preserved the volume of water stored in the depression from the fine resolution formulation the depth of the depression was assumed to be uniform as 0 5 m mean depth of depression in the fine resolution model and the length was calculated given the width of the cell was 500 m the fishnet used to capture fish works by channeling water flow in the canal through a small orifice which has a net attached sandbags are used to obstruct the flow the mesh above the sand bags force the fish to move and be caught in the fishnet fig 2 c in lisflood fp we represented this feature as a combination of a weir and trash screen photographs collected during field data collection were used to approximate the width of the weir which represented the orifice to which the fishnet was attached and the crest height of the weir which represented the depth of sandbags we used field photographs to estimate the weir width as 0 5 m 1 6th times the average width of the fish canal and crest height as 30 cm a trash screen coefficient was used to allow a portion of water to flow through the screen we calibrated its coefficient value to produce the desired water drop across the fishnet and found that a trash screen coefficient of 0 8 produced a describable water drop across the fishnet of about 20 cm ascertained from field photographs and knowledge of field experts 3 2 3 boundary conditions there are no streamflow gages on the lorome mazra river and hence direct discharge observations were not available to set up this model we obtained the upstream channel flow for the model from the logone model in fernández et al 2016 bara is inundated each year from the overbank flow from the lorome mazra river and the flood wave slowly moving from south to north in the floodplain to represent the flood wave we calibrated a time varying water elevation boundary condition along the south boundary as described in the following section we used monthly open water evaporation rates from naah 1990 we assumed that all precipitation was either infiltrated before soil saturation or evaporated and did not include precipitation in the model fernández et al 2018 3 2 4 calibration of the bara model we used the water level data collected during the flood recession of 2014 to understand the flood recession dynamics and we set up the bara model with boundary conditions to recreate the same a flow along the south boundary accounted for the flood wave moving into the bara region from upstream the depth of water entering along the south boundary was represented as a height boundary condition we assumed that the floodplain was inundated for three months delclaux et al 2011 since we used a semi synthetic dem to build the bara model we needed a credible way to represent the flood wave flowing from south to north we calibrated the depth of water entering the domain along the south boundary and the onset of flood recession at bara the maximum flood depth 60 cm and the timing of onset of recession 5 november 2001 were calibrated such that depth anomalies in the model for all the features floodplain depression and fish canals were similar to those observed in the field data 3 3 modeling approach logone floodplain we built the large scale logone model similar to the coarse resolution bara model using lisflood fp and quantified the effects of fish canals on the depressions by implementing a no canal simulation the model was simulated for a period of 7 years between 2001 and 2007 the details are described below 3 3 1 topographic data accurate topographic information is crucial for predicting flood inundation using hydrodynamic models airborne light detection and ranging lidar dems offer the best horizontal resolution and vertical accuracy however high resolution lidar dems are not available in the logone floodplain the best available dems in this region were obtained from satellite data srtm dems are available globally at a spatial resolution of 30 m random error in their elevation accuracy in sub saharan africa is 2m rodriguez et al 2006 comparable to the flood depth in the logone floodplain delclaux et al 2011 hence modeling with srtm will produce spatial inconsistencies in inundation predictions fernández et al 2016 the multi error removed improved terrain merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 was produced by removing multiple errors from existing globally available dems and we used merit dem in the present study in the logone floodplain absolute bias stripe noise speckle noise and tree height bias were removed from srtm dem to get the merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 we chose a coarse resolution 500 m in order for the model to mimic spatial resolutions likely to be used when requiring computationally efficient simulations across future climate scenarios simulation at 500 m resolution allowed us to capture more of the depressions used for floodplain fisheries and was computationally more tractable than the 250 m resolution note that fernández et al 2016 found that 250 m 500 m and 1000 m model simulations produced similar overall skill in reproducing inundation dynamics over the floodplain albeit for a different model configuration we resampled the merit dem to 500 m using bicubic interpolation we used a hole filling process to ensure that there were no troughs that acted as sinks in the dem all the channel banks in the floodplain were smoothed using a moving average filter using a window of 7 7 cells this was done to ensure that the river channel did not have sudden changes in the terrain 3 3 2 sub grid parametrization of river channels fish canals and depressions similar to the bara model the river channels were represented as sub grid elements in lisflood fp the locations of sub grid channels are defined as regions each river channel was defined as a unique region the logone river was divided into two regions approximately upstream and downstream of logone gana values for the different parameters parameters controlling the depth of the channel given width channel type and manning s roughness coefficient were defined for each region for the model we assumed that the channel was clean straight with no rifts and rectangular in shape and used a manning s n of 0 025 s m1 3 chow 1959 the width of all the channels were estimated from high resolution satellite imagery of the floodplain the width of the logone river ranged between 100 m and 400 m all other channels had widths less than 100 m the details of the calibration for river widths is given in section 3 3 4 in the logone model the fish canals were represented as sub grid elements similar to the representation in the 500 m bara model the widths of the fish canals were obtained from field data collected in 2013 the field data collection included the length of each canal in the logone floodplain the width depth and elevation at the start depression and end river of each fish canal the dataset has information for 1286 fish canals the mean length of a fish canal was 809 m and the median length was 533 m this meant that most fish canals were contained in 1 2 pixels of 500 m resolution since it is not possible to define the slope obtained from the field data in one or two pixels and most of the canals are not longer than two pixels we used a constant depth to define its geometry the mean depth of the fish canals was derived from the field data and all fish canals were assumed to have a constant bankfull depth of 0 8 m the fish canals were represented as a unique sub grid region with manning s n value of 0 025 s m1 3 similar to the river channels as in the 500 m bara model the depressions were also represented as sub grid elements in the logone model the location and area of the depressions were obtained by depression mapping using satellite imagery supervised maximum likelihood classification was performed on the cloud free imagery from the thermal infrared band of landsat 5 1986 87 and landsat 7 2000 03 during the dry season we only considered the 48 depressions that had canals draining into them in consultation with the field experts we assumed that all the depressions had a constant depth of 1 m the fishnet was represented as defined in the bara model the parameters of the fishnet were retained from the calibrated bara model 3 3 3 boundary conditions in situ measurement of daily discharges were available at katoa bongor and logone gana katoa is located at the upstream part of our study area and the discharge measurements available here were used to define the upstream boundary condition bongor is located 60 km upstream of katoa which is not included in the model domain previous studies suggest that the difference in discharge between bongor and katoa is due to overbank flow from the logone that flows from south to north along the chadian side of the logone river naah 1990 seeber 2013 to account for this flow on the chadian side of the floodplain as in fernández et al 2016 we assumed an additional flow on the east side of the logone river as the difference in discharge between bongor and katoa in our model domain logone gana is located in the domain of the model downstream of katoa we used the discharge time series at katoa and bongor as the boundary conditions we assumed a spin up time of three months may to july 2001 and considered the model predictions starting august 1st 2001 we did not provide a precipitation input for the model because flooding in the logone floodplain is dominated from overbank flow we assumed that all the precipitation on the floodplain is either infiltrated or evaporated and has no impact on the flooding fernández et al 2018 2016 evaporation rates are high and we used monthly evaporation values from naah 1990 3 3 4 calibration of the logone model fernández et al 2016 showed that even though the model captured the flow in the river channel and hence channel to floodplain flow accurately flood inundation maps produced from the model had spatial disagreement with observations this disagreement can be attributed to error in topography as it is the major remaining unknown mason et al 2016 and shastry and durand 2019 both use different methods to modify topography for improving flood simulations here we manually calibrated the merit dem such that lisflood fp produced inundation maps that were more accurate in the process of calibration the dem pixel elevations were altered such that water was forced to flow to the areas that were classified as inundated in the landsat imagery in other words the pixel elevations of areas predicted by lisflood fp to be dry were reduced if the landsat images classified them to be inundated and vice versa flood inundation maps obtained from classified landsat images fernández et al 2016 in 2006 were used for this calibration leopold and maddock 1953 derived empirical relationships between river width depth discharge and catchment area based on extensive field measurements in over 100 river locations in the united states these relationships have been used for multiple rivers in many previous studies since annis et al 2019 blöschl and sivapalan 1995 camporese et al 2010 finnegan et al 2005 flint 1974 frasson et al 2019 gippel and stewardson 1998 kim et al 2019 magilligan 1992 park 1977 pinter and heine 2005 schumm 1956 tarboton et al 1991 whipple and tucker 1999 yamazaki et al 2011 this same geometric theory is used in the sub grid formulation of lisflood fp neal et al 2012 as this relationship can be used to estimate river geometry eq 3 in data scarce areas where bathymetry data doesn t exist fernández et al 2016 lewis et al 2013 schumann et al 2014a 2014b fernández et al 2016 calculated the depth of the logone by estimating r and p as parameters obtained by fitting a curve to the channel cross sections data from evans 1999 the depth of the channel was defined as 3 depth r width p to limit model complexity we used a constant depth for each unique channel region the logone river was divided into two regions approximately upstream and downstream of logone gana and all other river channels were defined as independent regions the mean value of depths for the two logone regions obtained from fernández et al 2016 were used the upstream logone channel depth was increased from its initial value 4 1 m to 4 3 m to curtail overbank flooding in some regions all other channels were calibrated to have a linear relationship with the width p 1 with r ranging from 0 03 to 0 12 resulting depth values ranged from 2 m to 3 m we calibrated the value of manning s n such that the simulated flow of water on the floodplain matched the observations from classified landsat imagery since depressions and floodplain were known to have dense vegetation in them while flooded we started with a manning s coefficient of 0 1 s m1 3 chow 1959 however with that n the flood receded quickly and the floodplain was dry much before the observations suggested we increased the roughness coefficient for the floodplain to 0 3 and the depressions to 0 25 so that the floodplain retained water for longer 3 3 5 evaluation of the logone model 3 3 5 1 river flow we used the discharge measurements at logone gana to compare and evaluate the performance of the logone model the accuracy of the simulation was evaluated by using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is defined as eq 4 4 e 1 i 1 n o i m i 2 i 1 n o i m 2 where o refers to the observations and m refers to model predictions 3 3 5 2 inundation area we used 40 flood inundation maps from multi temporal landsat etm imagery between 2001 and 2007 to assess the performance of the logone model in producing flood inundation extents we used 13 flood inundation maps in 2006 january to december for manual calibration of the dem and the rest to evaluate the performance of the model in the simulation period between 2001 and 2007 we consider 2006 as calibration period and 2001 2005 and 2007 as evaluation period we chose 2006 for calibration because we had images in the dry season the flooding season and the flood recession season landsat images of the floodplain between july to september when the floods start that are clear of cloud cover are rare and limited the data we could use for this period to produce flood inundation maps from the landsat images the following process was performed first the missing data in the images from landsat 7 images due to the failure of the scan line corrector slc instrument on board was handled by using a gap filling method the method involved filling the no data pixels in landsat etm slc off images with the linear least square regression analysis of their slc on counterparts fernández et al 2016 landsat 7 slc on image on 21 october 2001 was used in a iterative self organizing data analysis isodata classifier to extract and mask out open waters on lake maga and the logone river clouded areas and cloud shadowed areas were masked by a 3 3 window size majority analysis where blue reflectance is greater than 0 2 fernández et al 2016 sakamoto et al 2007 flood extents were delineated by using a threshold based classification of the short wave infrared swir band landsat etm band 7 similar to fernández et al 2016 and westra and de wulf 2009 we compared the model predicted flood inundation maps with the satellite observed flood inundation to asses the spatial performance of the model we used two commonly used evaluation measures critical success index csi and hit rate aronica et al 2002 hawker et al 2018 sampson et al 2015 schaefer 1990 schumann et al 2016 when flood predictions are compared with observations we have four classes true positive tp flooded predicted as flooded or hit true negative tn non flooded predicted as non flooded false positive fp non flooded predicted as flooded or false alarm and false negative fn flooded predicted as non flooded or miss csi is a measure of accuracy when tn is not considered eq 5 it is sensitive to hits while penalizing both misses and false alarms 5 csi tp tp f p f n csi values range from 0 to 1 where a value of 1 indicates that the model is in full agreement with the observations the hit rate gives the fraction of flooded area that is correctly predicted by the model eq 6 the values range from 0 to 1 higher value indicates that the model predicts flood inundation better 6 hit rate tp tp f n we calculated the evaluation statistics only for the flooding season for this purpose we consider september to january as the flooded season and february to august as the dry season 3 3 6 comparison with a no canal simulation we compared two scenarios one with and one without canals and examined what effect canals had on flood dynamics in the depressions to understand the role of canals on the floodplain we simulated the logone model without any canals all the parameters were kept the same except for the canals this no canal simulation was then compared with the original simulation with canals in terms of flood inundation area flood volume and timing of flood recession in the depressions 4 results and discussion 4 1 bara comparison of model simulations and field observations the field data collected in 2014 showed there was a difference between the rate of recession in the river and the other parts of the system the river stage reduced by 1 m while the water levels in the floodplain depression and fish canals reduced only by 0 4 m in the two weeks of observations during flood recession the fishnet structure in the model was used to capture this dynamic of the system fig 5 shows the recession rates in all the features of the floodplain for the collected field data as well as the model the plot shows the depth anomaly with respect to water level on day one of measurement the slower recession rates in the floodplain depression and fish canal compared to that in the river channel is evident table 1 shows the difference in water depth in the different features of the floodplain between day 1 and day 15 of the measurements the corresponding model simulated change in water depth and the nse of simulated time series are also shown it shows that the water drops a little slower in the model initially but achieves the observed water level drop by the end of the measurement period the different recession rate of the river from the other features was effectively captured in the coarse resolution model as well fig 5 b the water depth difference in the observations and model and their corresponding nse is shown in table 1 for the various features of the floodplain the range of nse is from 0 56 to 0 88 which shows that the performance of the coarse resolution model is similar to that of the fine resolution model nse range 0 61 0 93 and has managed to capture the floodplain dynamics in the coarse resolution model the use of 500 m resolution model to study the entire floodplain is justified by this result that the 500 m model when run at bara still reproduces the water levels observed in the field with a similar precision as the 30 m model in the floodplain fishnet installed in fish canals have an obstruction made from sandbags and a screen made from twigs and tree branches which slows down the flow of water from the fish canal to the river the fishnet structure we incorporated in the model successfully captured this by creating a drop across the fishnet fig 6 shows the water drop across the fishnet on three days during the flood recession it shows that there is a considerable drop caused by the fishnet as the flood recession progresses 4 2 logone floodplain 4 2 1 flow mass balance the logone floodplain receives water from the logone river and loses most water due to evaporation fig 7 shows the modeled mean mass balance for the six year study period the mean volume difference between the input and output flows in the model is 0 79 we assumed that all the precipitation on the floodplain either infiltrated or evaporated and ignored its effect fig 7 does not show evaporation as a major flux however if we consider the modeled evaporation along with the precipitation that has evaporated it becomes a major flux on the floodplain we studied the dynamics of components of water balance by looking at the entire time series of discharge and evaporation the model inflow and outflow for the entire time series are shown in fig 8 a the calibration period in the time series is shaded in gray there is a noticeable lag between the peak inflow and outflow discharges with a mean of 29 days and a standard deviation of 10 39 days as the water has to traverse over 200 km along the river between the inflow and outflow locations the evaporation in the floodplain is shown in fig 8 b the peak evaporation occurs around november corresponding to when there is a peak flood in the summer months even though potential evapotranspiration is very high actual evapotranspiration is quite low as water in confined to the river channels and lake maga fig 9 shows the time series of observed and simulated discharge at logone gana there was no recorded discharge between june 2nd and october 30th 2006 the model accurately simulated the discharge at logone gana the difference between modeled and observed discharge was less than 100 m3 s more than 85 of the time however it should be noted that peak discharge is generally under estimated in the model at logone gana the nse of discharge prediction at logone gana was 0 94 the accurate prediction of discharge at logone gana means that the model also accurately predicted the amount of water on the floodplain between katoa and logone gana 4 2 2 flood inundation we compared the model predicted inundation maps to those derived from satellite observations over the entire model domain the comparison between observed and simulated inundated area is shown in fig 10 the gray area shows the calibration period meaning the landsat derived flood maps obtained during this time period was used for the manual calibration of the dem the observed and simulated inundated area had a pearson correlation coefficient r of 0 94 and coefficient of determination r2 of 0 81 the model does not capture the peak in 2001 2002 and 2005 but it captures the receding inundated area accurately the accurate prediction of flow at logone gana shown in fig 9 means that the model also accurately predicts the channel to floodplain flow due to overbank flooding this result is reinforced in fig 10 where the model again accurately predicts the magnitude of inundated area comparison between observed and simulated patterns of flood inundation is shown in fig 11 a to f shows the flood inundation patterns during the flooded season of the calibration period of 2006 it shows that the model captures the flood inundation pattern quite well the spatial mismatch is primarily due to the quality of topographic data and justifies the use of manual calibration to adjust the dem although manual calibration of the dem improved the spatial performance of the model there is still room for improvement recent methods like mason et al 2016 and shastry and durand 2019 could potentially be used to improve the dem and hence spatial performance of the model the spatial patterns in two december maps fig 11 e and f show that the movement of flood wave in the model is quicker than observed along the west side of the logone river and much slower on the east side this could be because of difference in vegetation between the two regions during the flooded season we use a constant high value of manning s coefficient for the entire floodplain to account for vegetation on the west side of the logone river on the east side of the logone river the model holds on to the water for longer because of this however the conclusions of this paper regarding the depressions and fish canals on the west side are not affected by this fig 11 g to l show the flood inundation patterns on the days of peak flood from satellite imagery between 2001 and 2005 the observed peak flooded imagery occurs in the months of october and november there are two available satellite images during this period in 2005 and both are shown we analyzed the spatial accuracy of predicted flood inundation maps by comparing them to satellite derived observations table 2 shows csi and hit rate values for calibration and validation periods the mean csi during calibration and validation was 0 33 and 0 25 respectively and the mean hit rate during calibration was 0 46 and during validation was 0 32 the mean values are lower due to the fact that flood recession in the model is much quicker than observed this can be clearly seen in fig 11 e and f however the model captures the peak flood inundation pretty well in 2006 the peak inundation is captured with a hit rate of 0 71 during the evaluation period the maximum hit rate is 0 67 during the peak of 1 november 2005 it should be noted that the model does not capture the peaks in terms of discharge fig 9 and magnitude of inundated area fig 10 and these peaks may be captured if the spatial prediction capability at the peaks could be further improved 4 2 3 impact of fishnets and fish canals on water storage in depressions the effect of the fishnet structure on the flow in the fish canal in bara depression in the large scale logone model is shown in fig 12 it shows the water surface elevation along the length of the fish canal on three days during the flood recession the water drop across the fishnet structure is clearly seen the fishnet structure slows down the flow of water from the fish canal to the river and the model is able to capture this effectively fig 13 shows timeseries of water storage in depressions from two model simulations with and without including fish canals fig 13 also shows the total inundated area within all depressions based on the landsat inundated area maps while both model simulations overestimate the duration of inundation the simulation including canals is most likely closer to reality for example in 2006 for the simulation including canals by december 3 the total depression storage was 763 ha m around half the maximum value 1542 ha m on october 14 the simulation that neglects canals does not reach the half maximum value until more than a month later on january 12 2007 the landsat observation on november 20 almost perfectly captured the halfway point of the depression inundation 5 8 km2 down from 12 2 km2 on october 3 the observations reach the halfway point around the same time as the simulation including canals the simulation without canals retains its water too long indeed the landsat observation on january 7 2007 shows that the depressions were essentially dry 0 1 km2 when the simulation without canals is still half full similar dynamics exist for the other years the date depressions are empty is an average of 29 2 days earlier in simulations that include canals see fig 13 thus simulations including fish canals more closely represents the correct inundation dynamics within the depressions duration of inundation in the depressions is a critical variable for floodplain fisheries as the duration of inundation in depressions governs fish growth the quicker recession in depressions as noticed in model simulations and confirmed by observations shortens the growing season for fish resulting in lower fish biomass at the time of recession when most of the fishing occurs 5 conclusions the goal of the study was to evaluate the strategy of using a hydrodynamic model with sub grid scale channels and structures to represent small scale anthropogenic controls on floodplain dewatering at the scale of the entire logone floodplain this was accomplished using the lisflood fp model applied to the logone floodplain in cameroon we built a fine resolution model 30 m of one depression bara with fish canals and fishnets which were successful in approximating the physical processes on the floodplain we reproduced the change in water levels across all features floodplain depression fish canals and river channel as observed during two weeks of flood recession we upscaled this model to a larger resolution of 500 m and found that with the help of sub grid parametrization of fish canals and depressions we were still able to successfully capture the processes on the floodplain it is noteworthy that a 500 m resolution hydrodynamic model was capable of accurately representing small scale features like fish canals that are a few meters wide and fishnets constructed across these fish canals we applied this strategy of representing fish canals and depressions as sub grid features to the entire floodplain to assess their impact on the flow patterns we found that fish canals are critical for modeling inundation timing in the depressions model simulations excluding canals emptied around a month too late compared to satellite observations with important implications for using such models to inform fish growth and population fishing is a major source of income in the logone floodplain and lower fish catches would have a huge impact on the local economy these modeling strategies enable us to quantify small scale processes in a computationally efficient model these models can be coupled with fisheries model like described in welcomme and hagborg 1977 to study the impacts of these small scale features on floodplain

5296,assessing the impact of climate change on floodplain productivity poses unique challenges for hydrodynamic models for example the dynamics of floodplain fisheries are governed both by inundation dynamics across thousands of km2 and water storage timing within small depressions which serve as fish habitat connected to the river network by meter scale manmade canals controlled by flow across fishing weirs here we propose to represent these features as a system of effective interconnected sub grid elements within a coarse scale model we test this strategy over the logone floodplain in cameroon and its floodplain fishery we first validate this strategy for a local study area 30 km2 we find that hydraulic models at resolutions from 30 m to 500 m are able to reproduce hydraulic dynamics as documented by in situ water level observations when applied to the entire floodplain 16 000 km2 we find that the proposed modeling strategy allows accurate prediction of observed pattern of recession in the depressions artificially removing floodplain canals in the model causes residence time of water in depressions to be overpredicted by approximately 30 days this study supports the strategy of modeling fine scale interconnected features as a system of sub grid elements in a coarse resolution model for applications such as assessing the sensitivity of floodplain fisheries to future climate change keywords hydrodynamic modeling flood inundation mapping logone floodplain small scale processes 1 introduction predicting and modeling flood extent and timing is vital to understanding the dynamics of floodplain fish and fisheries thompson and polet 2000 welcomme and hagborg 1977 floodplain fish have evolved to flooding seasonality and their populations are driven by both flood and dry season duration timing and magnitude depending on the location and season floodplain fisheries employ various techniques to catch fish some techniques like the use of fish canals alter the drainage system impacting flood extent and timing of onset and recession of floods which in turn affect the fish population and productivity delclaux et al 2011 laborde et al 2016 moritz et al 2016 future climate change is expected to produce changes in rainfall patterns and flows in river channels which will also impact floodplain dynamics in order to study the effects of floodplain fisheries and climate change on floodplain dynamics researchers have turned to hydrodynamic models hydrodynamic models are used to study complex links between hydrologic systems and social ecological systems bockelmann et al 2004 casas mulet et al 2014 devries et al 2012 garcía et al 2011 nislow et al 2002 and the impacts of climate change hirabayashi et al 2013 o neill and hulme 2009 hydrodynamic models predict the extent and timing of floods and hence providing means to estimate some of the most critical parameters governing fish population in floodplain fisheries welcomme and hagborg 1977 neal et al 2012 introduced sub grid modeling a strategy to systematically include and parameterize the effects of river channels smaller than the model grid scale in two dimensional hydraulic models a strategy that has opened the door to new applications kennedy et al 2019 komi et al 2017 schumann et al 2016 2013 wing et al 2017 wood et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2011 the need to estimate fish productivity and population for floodplain fisheries applications represent novel challenges to existing approaches however in order for hydraulic models to be useful in the context of understanding floodplain fisheries they will have to account for an interconnected system of elements functioning at sub grid spatial scales natural floodplain depressions store water on floodplains and provide habitat for fish to grow meter scale manmade canals link depressions and the river network and provide means to harvest fish at the end of the season weirs and fishnets are often installed on these canals and modulate flow during recession such features are typically ignored in conventional hydrologic and hydrodynamic model simulations fernández et al 2016 rajib et al 2019 sub grid modeling provides the means of representing such features within a larger scale model neal et al 2012 that has primarily been used to represent small river channels must be adapted to represent this entire floodplain depression canal river system of interconnected sub grid features the objective of this paper is to describe and evaluate a strategy for hydrodynamic modeling that can be coupled with a canal fishery model we propose the following adaptations to traditional sub grid modeling i we aggregate multiple fish canals and multiple depressions into a single effective model element to be represented as a sub grid feature ii we treat depression storage as a sub grid element as well as the fish canals thus creating an interconnected network of multiple types of sub grid features iii we propose a strategy for modeling fishnet structures as weirs as described below taken together these approaches represent a distinct and novel strategy in hydraulic modeling we test this modeling approach in the logone floodplain in the far north region of cameroon we work from a previous study in this area that reproduced large scale floodplain dynamics but ignored fish canals and other small scale processes important to hydraulic connectivity and fisheries fernández et al 2016 we assess sub grid modeling with a two part strategy first we study a single depression with multiple canals over a 30 km2 area and explore whether our strategy successfully captures observed water level dynamics as we vary the model spatial scale secondly we investigate whether a coarse scale 500 m model of the entire floodplain 16 000 km2 is capable of reproducing inundation dynamics within floodplain depressions which are sensitive to the presence of canals as demonstrated by laborde et al 2016 if demonstrated to adequately capture both local and floodplain scale dynamics the sub grid modeling approach will pave the way to couple hydrodynamic and fisheries models to study the impacts of the same small scale features on fisheries this type of modeling approach enhances our capacity to quantify and understand the effect of small canals in floodplains and flood prone areas 2 study area 2 1 geography hydrology and hydraulics the logone floodplain also known as yaayre covers about 16 000 km2 delclaux et al 2011 and is located in the far north region of cameroon it supports a large number of people with a population of about 200 000 laborde et al 2016 mitchell 2013 the floodplain is a part of lake chad basin and contains the waza national park 1700 km2 and kalamaloue national park 48 km2 the floodplain is highly productive and acts as breeding grounds for fish when inundated and provides dry season pastures that support cattle and other livestock and fertile land for growing rice the logone floodplain is a small part of the logone watershed and is located at the downstream part of the logone river fig 1 the floodplain has semi arid climate while the rest of the watershed has tropical wet and dry savannah climate murumkar et al 2020 the floodplain has mean annual rainfall of about 700 mm the upstream part of the watershed receives about 1200 mm annually evans and loth 2004a 2004b murumkar et al 2020 the first rainfall on the floodplain generally in june july plays an important role by saturating the dry clayey soil and overbank flow from logone logomatya and lorome mazra river channels floods the region in september october the region is inundated for about three to four months delclaux et al 2011 jung et al 2011 local rainfall has less control over flooding than the flow in the logone overbank flow is the biggest contributor to the inundation of the floodplain evans and loth 2004a because the area is relatively flat the flood spreads over a large area of about 8000 km2 delclaux et al 2010 before it drains back to the logone and the el beid river in the north the floodplain also experiences significant evapotranspiration throughout the year naah 1990 used piché evaporimeters and estimated the annual potential evaporation rate between 2700 mm and 3000 mm on the floodplain however it is important to note that maximum potential evaporation occurs between february and april when the floodplain is dry in the past decades human activities have significantly modified floodplain dynamics as a part of a large agricultural project semry ii for irrigated cultivation of rice the cameroonian government constructed a dam on the logone in 1979 which created a 400 km2 reservoir lake maga fig 1 upstream of the floodplain loth 2004 as a result of this the flooding in the floodplain reduced by about 30 delclaux et al 2010 which had a negative impact on the ecological and social systems in the floodplain loth 2004 scholte 2005 2 2 canal fisheries fishing is an important regional livelihood on the logone floodplain delclaux et al 2011 laborde et al 2016 landolt 2010 loth 2004 fishing techniques used include fish traps cast nets gill nets hooks and lines grass fishing over the last half century fish canals have gained popularity and their numbers have increased exponentially delclaux et al 2011 laborde et al 2016 fish canals are man made channels connecting the river to natural depressions in the terrain which act as seasonal ponds fig 2 fishers dig new fish canals and maintain the old ones by removing the deposited sediments from the previous flood these canals are used during flood recession to drain floodwater and channel fish moving off the floodplain through fishnets fig 2 a the technique is effective because the fish canals can drain high volumes of water during the period of highest fish densities fig 2 b shows a photograph of a fish canal in the dry season and fig 2 c shows a photograph of an installed fishnet in a fish canal in the dry season water is generally restricted to the rivers see fig 1 lake maga and a few natural depressions floodwaters bring fish onto the floodplain the inundated floodplain and natural depressions act as feeding and breeding grounds for fish fish population dynamics are driven by flooding patterns the onset of flooding is typically when fish spawn and the inundated floodplain provides a productive habitat for their primary growth period fish mortality is highest in the dry season when water volume is low because of high temperatures and low oxygen fish population biomass follows a boom and bust pattern similar to floodplain water volume floodplain fish production is driven by flooding patterns production has a positive relationship with flood magnitude and a negative relationship with dry season severity additionally flood timing and aquatic habitat connectivity are also important variables in spawning and survival success understanding spatial and temporal patterns in flooding is necessary to evaluate the availability of a key natural resource for regional livelihoods however fish canals connect the floodplain to the river and act as a hydraulic extension of the river drainage network increasing use of fish canals could potentially have effects on the flood dynamics with a change in inundation patterns or the timing of onset and recession of flooding our objective was to build a hydrodynamic model that captures the effect of these small scale features i e fish canals and fishnets on flood inundation dynamics locally in the depressions and globally in the whole floodplain system 3 methods and data 3 1 hydrodynamic modeling of the logone floodplain we used lisflood fp model to simulate hydrodynamic processes in rivers floodplain and fish canals lisflood fp is a grid based hydraulic model with one dimensional channel representation and two dimensional floodplain representation based on a simplification of the shallow water equations bates et al 2010 bates and de roo 2000 it can represent small channels using a sub grid scale parametrization of the channels geometry and friction neal et al 2012 where the channel is represented on a sub grid scale by using parameters to represent channel geometry and friction with sub grid parametrization rivers with widths smaller than the spatial resolution of the dem can be simulated efficiently and a separate 1d channel model is not necessary neal et al 2012 schumann et al 2014a 2014b simplified versions of the shallow water equations are then solved in the sub grid channel and floodplain grid cell simultaneously lisflood fp has been used to simulate inundation patterns for specific flood events bates et al 2005 neal et al 2011 and to study long term floodplain dynamics rudorff et al 2014a 2014b schumann et al 2013 among other applications using lisflood fp we build hydrodynamic models at the bara depression details in section 3 2 and of the larger logone floodplain details in section 3 3 below we build the bara model at 30 m resolution to capture small scale processes and upscale it to 500 m while preserving the effects of these small scale features we then build a model of the logone floodplain at 500 m resolution to examine the effects of the small scale processes on the larger system we introduce a new feature in lisflood fp to represent the fishnet structure which is modeled as a combination of a weir and trash screen this feature is specially included for this application and is not available in the standard version of lisflood fp fig 2 c shows a photograph of a fishnet in operation and consists of sandbags to obstruct the flow which we represent as the weir and a mesh made from twigs and leaves which we represent as the trash screen water drop across the fishnet fig 2 c is captured as a loss due to expansion and contraction of the flow area in the weir caused by the acceleration of flow through the structure balkham et al 2010 equations 1 2 and fig 3 show the mathematical representation of this structure 1 h s z w y w h ex y d where hs is the afflux of weir flow zw is the height of weir crest yw is the depth of weir flow over crest hex is head loss due to contraction and yd the downstream water depth 2 q c w b y w 3 2 where q is the discharge in m3 s cw is the discharge coefficient for weir flow typically between 1 4 and 1 7 and b is the effective width at the screen b width screen coefficient 3 2 modeling approach bara the bara region is a small area of about 30 km2 in the logone floodplain that we studied for understanding flooding dynamics the site consists of a river channel a depression of 1 1 km2 and nine fish canals that connect them lorome mazra the river channel in bara flows from south to north to study the effects of fish canals and fishnets we built a hydraulic model of bara at a resolution of 30 m where each fish canal is individually represented i e every fish canal is represented as a unique sub grid channel to quantify the impact of small scale local features captured in a coarser model we also built a hydraulic model of the same bara site at a resolution of 500 m 3 2 1 field data in the dry season of 2015 we surveyed the bara depression using auto levels to obtain the relative elevation profile of the depression first we established a reference point and recorded the location and ground elevation of this point using a gps then we recorded the locations and elevations of 97 sample points relative to the reference point using an auto level we performed ordinary kriging on this dataset to interpolate depression elevations at 30 m resolution fig 4 a shows the locations where we collected data and the final product after ordinary kriging we created a synthetic digital elevation model dem of the region outside of the depression fig 4 b by assuming that the floodplain has a slope of 10 cm km from south to north as obtained from shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem as the mean slope along the entire floodplain the interpolated data was burnt into the dem to represent the depression in the summer of 2016 we surveyed all the fish canals in the bara region and measured their width and depth at 50 m intervals this data gave us information about the longitudinal and cross sectional profiles of all the fish canals in bara region we used this data to parametrize the width and depth of all fish canals in this region we collected water depth measurements during the flood recession in all the representative features of the terrain floodplain depression fish canal and river channel laborde et al 2018 to understand the coupling among them a staff gage was installed in two locations for each feature water depth was recorded in each location twice daily fig 4 b shows the locations of these measurements water depth measurements were recorded for eleven days between 8 and 22 november 2014 no measurements between 13 and 16 november 2014 daily mean water depth was obtained from the collected data and the observed depth anomaly was used to evaluate the performance of the bara model 3 2 2 parametrization of river channel fish canals and fishnets bathymetry data was not available for the lorome mazra river so we approximated channel geometry using remote sensing data we used a 2009 satellite imagery from worldview 1 which has a spatial resolution of 50 cm to estimate the width of lorome mazra to be 25 m from the field data collected in 2014 the mean depth of fish canals along lorome mazra was 1 3 m with the range between 0 1 m and 2 8 m the depth of the river channel has to be greater than the depth of fish canals using this and the knowledge of field experts we assumed the depth of lorome mazra to be 3 m with an embankment of 60 cm height along the river in the 30 m model the nine fish canals were represented as individual features from the field data collected in 2016 we found that the mean width of the fish canals was 3 m and the mean depth of the canals near their start at the depression was 20 cm the canal bed sloped from the depression towards the river channel with a mean bed slope of 60 cm km we built the coarse resolution 500 m model similar to the fine resolution bara model the river channel was represented as a sub grid channel 25 m wide and 3 m deep the fish canals were also represented as sub grid channels as in the 30 m model however each fish canal could not be represented individually as multiple canals fell within a 500 m grid cell if there was more than one fish canal in a grid cell all the canals were aggregated such that the storage capacity of the aggregated fish canal was the same as the total storage capacity of all the fish canals falling in the grid cell the width of the aggregated canal was calculated as the sum of average width of all the canals falling in a grid cell a uniform depth of 0 5 m was assumed an aggregated canal generally consists of 1 or 2 grid cells so it wasn t feasible to define a bed slope gradient the aggregated length was calculated by dividing the storage capacity of the 30 m model by width and depth of fish canals the depression was also represented as a sub grid feature which preserved the volume of water stored in the depression from the fine resolution formulation the depth of the depression was assumed to be uniform as 0 5 m mean depth of depression in the fine resolution model and the length was calculated given the width of the cell was 500 m the fishnet used to capture fish works by channeling water flow in the canal through a small orifice which has a net attached sandbags are used to obstruct the flow the mesh above the sand bags force the fish to move and be caught in the fishnet fig 2 c in lisflood fp we represented this feature as a combination of a weir and trash screen photographs collected during field data collection were used to approximate the width of the weir which represented the orifice to which the fishnet was attached and the crest height of the weir which represented the depth of sandbags we used field photographs to estimate the weir width as 0 5 m 1 6th times the average width of the fish canal and crest height as 30 cm a trash screen coefficient was used to allow a portion of water to flow through the screen we calibrated its coefficient value to produce the desired water drop across the fishnet and found that a trash screen coefficient of 0 8 produced a describable water drop across the fishnet of about 20 cm ascertained from field photographs and knowledge of field experts 3 2 3 boundary conditions there are no streamflow gages on the lorome mazra river and hence direct discharge observations were not available to set up this model we obtained the upstream channel flow for the model from the logone model in fernández et al 2016 bara is inundated each year from the overbank flow from the lorome mazra river and the flood wave slowly moving from south to north in the floodplain to represent the flood wave we calibrated a time varying water elevation boundary condition along the south boundary as described in the following section we used monthly open water evaporation rates from naah 1990 we assumed that all precipitation was either infiltrated before soil saturation or evaporated and did not include precipitation in the model fernández et al 2018 3 2 4 calibration of the bara model we used the water level data collected during the flood recession of 2014 to understand the flood recession dynamics and we set up the bara model with boundary conditions to recreate the same a flow along the south boundary accounted for the flood wave moving into the bara region from upstream the depth of water entering along the south boundary was represented as a height boundary condition we assumed that the floodplain was inundated for three months delclaux et al 2011 since we used a semi synthetic dem to build the bara model we needed a credible way to represent the flood wave flowing from south to north we calibrated the depth of water entering the domain along the south boundary and the onset of flood recession at bara the maximum flood depth 60 cm and the timing of onset of recession 5 november 2001 were calibrated such that depth anomalies in the model for all the features floodplain depression and fish canals were similar to those observed in the field data 3 3 modeling approach logone floodplain we built the large scale logone model similar to the coarse resolution bara model using lisflood fp and quantified the effects of fish canals on the depressions by implementing a no canal simulation the model was simulated for a period of 7 years between 2001 and 2007 the details are described below 3 3 1 topographic data accurate topographic information is crucial for predicting flood inundation using hydrodynamic models airborne light detection and ranging lidar dems offer the best horizontal resolution and vertical accuracy however high resolution lidar dems are not available in the logone floodplain the best available dems in this region were obtained from satellite data srtm dems are available globally at a spatial resolution of 30 m random error in their elevation accuracy in sub saharan africa is 2m rodriguez et al 2006 comparable to the flood depth in the logone floodplain delclaux et al 2011 hence modeling with srtm will produce spatial inconsistencies in inundation predictions fernández et al 2016 the multi error removed improved terrain merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 was produced by removing multiple errors from existing globally available dems and we used merit dem in the present study in the logone floodplain absolute bias stripe noise speckle noise and tree height bias were removed from srtm dem to get the merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 we chose a coarse resolution 500 m in order for the model to mimic spatial resolutions likely to be used when requiring computationally efficient simulations across future climate scenarios simulation at 500 m resolution allowed us to capture more of the depressions used for floodplain fisheries and was computationally more tractable than the 250 m resolution note that fernández et al 2016 found that 250 m 500 m and 1000 m model simulations produced similar overall skill in reproducing inundation dynamics over the floodplain albeit for a different model configuration we resampled the merit dem to 500 m using bicubic interpolation we used a hole filling process to ensure that there were no troughs that acted as sinks in the dem all the channel banks in the floodplain were smoothed using a moving average filter using a window of 7 7 cells this was done to ensure that the river channel did not have sudden changes in the terrain 3 3 2 sub grid parametrization of river channels fish canals and depressions similar to the bara model the river channels were represented as sub grid elements in lisflood fp the locations of sub grid channels are defined as regions each river channel was defined as a unique region the logone river was divided into two regions approximately upstream and downstream of logone gana values for the different parameters parameters controlling the depth of the channel given width channel type and manning s roughness coefficient were defined for each region for the model we assumed that the channel was clean straight with no rifts and rectangular in shape and used a manning s n of 0 025 s m1 3 chow 1959 the width of all the channels were estimated from high resolution satellite imagery of the floodplain the width of the logone river ranged between 100 m and 400 m all other channels had widths less than 100 m the details of the calibration for river widths is given in section 3 3 4 in the logone model the fish canals were represented as sub grid elements similar to the representation in the 500 m bara model the widths of the fish canals were obtained from field data collected in 2013 the field data collection included the length of each canal in the logone floodplain the width depth and elevation at the start depression and end river of each fish canal the dataset has information for 1286 fish canals the mean length of a fish canal was 809 m and the median length was 533 m this meant that most fish canals were contained in 1 2 pixels of 500 m resolution since it is not possible to define the slope obtained from the field data in one or two pixels and most of the canals are not longer than two pixels we used a constant depth to define its geometry the mean depth of the fish canals was derived from the field data and all fish canals were assumed to have a constant bankfull depth of 0 8 m the fish canals were represented as a unique sub grid region with manning s n value of 0 025 s m1 3 similar to the river channels as in the 500 m bara model the depressions were also represented as sub grid elements in the logone model the location and area of the depressions were obtained by depression mapping using satellite imagery supervised maximum likelihood classification was performed on the cloud free imagery from the thermal infrared band of landsat 5 1986 87 and landsat 7 2000 03 during the dry season we only considered the 48 depressions that had canals draining into them in consultation with the field experts we assumed that all the depressions had a constant depth of 1 m the fishnet was represented as defined in the bara model the parameters of the fishnet were retained from the calibrated bara model 3 3 3 boundary conditions in situ measurement of daily discharges were available at katoa bongor and logone gana katoa is located at the upstream part of our study area and the discharge measurements available here were used to define the upstream boundary condition bongor is located 60 km upstream of katoa which is not included in the model domain previous studies suggest that the difference in discharge between bongor and katoa is due to overbank flow from the logone that flows from south to north along the chadian side of the logone river naah 1990 seeber 2013 to account for this flow on the chadian side of the floodplain as in fernández et al 2016 we assumed an additional flow on the east side of the logone river as the difference in discharge between bongor and katoa in our model domain logone gana is located in the domain of the model downstream of katoa we used the discharge time series at katoa and bongor as the boundary conditions we assumed a spin up time of three months may to july 2001 and considered the model predictions starting august 1st 2001 we did not provide a precipitation input for the model because flooding in the logone floodplain is dominated from overbank flow we assumed that all the precipitation on the floodplain is either infiltrated or evaporated and has no impact on the flooding fernández et al 2018 2016 evaporation rates are high and we used monthly evaporation values from naah 1990 3 3 4 calibration of the logone model fernández et al 2016 showed that even though the model captured the flow in the river channel and hence channel to floodplain flow accurately flood inundation maps produced from the model had spatial disagreement with observations this disagreement can be attributed to error in topography as it is the major remaining unknown mason et al 2016 and shastry and durand 2019 both use different methods to modify topography for improving flood simulations here we manually calibrated the merit dem such that lisflood fp produced inundation maps that were more accurate in the process of calibration the dem pixel elevations were altered such that water was forced to flow to the areas that were classified as inundated in the landsat imagery in other words the pixel elevations of areas predicted by lisflood fp to be dry were reduced if the landsat images classified them to be inundated and vice versa flood inundation maps obtained from classified landsat images fernández et al 2016 in 2006 were used for this calibration leopold and maddock 1953 derived empirical relationships between river width depth discharge and catchment area based on extensive field measurements in over 100 river locations in the united states these relationships have been used for multiple rivers in many previous studies since annis et al 2019 blöschl and sivapalan 1995 camporese et al 2010 finnegan et al 2005 flint 1974 frasson et al 2019 gippel and stewardson 1998 kim et al 2019 magilligan 1992 park 1977 pinter and heine 2005 schumm 1956 tarboton et al 1991 whipple and tucker 1999 yamazaki et al 2011 this same geometric theory is used in the sub grid formulation of lisflood fp neal et al 2012 as this relationship can be used to estimate river geometry eq 3 in data scarce areas where bathymetry data doesn t exist fernández et al 2016 lewis et al 2013 schumann et al 2014a 2014b fernández et al 2016 calculated the depth of the logone by estimating r and p as parameters obtained by fitting a curve to the channel cross sections data from evans 1999 the depth of the channel was defined as 3 depth r width p to limit model complexity we used a constant depth for each unique channel region the logone river was divided into two regions approximately upstream and downstream of logone gana and all other river channels were defined as independent regions the mean value of depths for the two logone regions obtained from fernández et al 2016 were used the upstream logone channel depth was increased from its initial value 4 1 m to 4 3 m to curtail overbank flooding in some regions all other channels were calibrated to have a linear relationship with the width p 1 with r ranging from 0 03 to 0 12 resulting depth values ranged from 2 m to 3 m we calibrated the value of manning s n such that the simulated flow of water on the floodplain matched the observations from classified landsat imagery since depressions and floodplain were known to have dense vegetation in them while flooded we started with a manning s coefficient of 0 1 s m1 3 chow 1959 however with that n the flood receded quickly and the floodplain was dry much before the observations suggested we increased the roughness coefficient for the floodplain to 0 3 and the depressions to 0 25 so that the floodplain retained water for longer 3 3 5 evaluation of the logone model 3 3 5 1 river flow we used the discharge measurements at logone gana to compare and evaluate the performance of the logone model the accuracy of the simulation was evaluated by using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is defined as eq 4 4 e 1 i 1 n o i m i 2 i 1 n o i m 2 where o refers to the observations and m refers to model predictions 3 3 5 2 inundation area we used 40 flood inundation maps from multi temporal landsat etm imagery between 2001 and 2007 to assess the performance of the logone model in producing flood inundation extents we used 13 flood inundation maps in 2006 january to december for manual calibration of the dem and the rest to evaluate the performance of the model in the simulation period between 2001 and 2007 we consider 2006 as calibration period and 2001 2005 and 2007 as evaluation period we chose 2006 for calibration because we had images in the dry season the flooding season and the flood recession season landsat images of the floodplain between july to september when the floods start that are clear of cloud cover are rare and limited the data we could use for this period to produce flood inundation maps from the landsat images the following process was performed first the missing data in the images from landsat 7 images due to the failure of the scan line corrector slc instrument on board was handled by using a gap filling method the method involved filling the no data pixels in landsat etm slc off images with the linear least square regression analysis of their slc on counterparts fernández et al 2016 landsat 7 slc on image on 21 october 2001 was used in a iterative self organizing data analysis isodata classifier to extract and mask out open waters on lake maga and the logone river clouded areas and cloud shadowed areas were masked by a 3 3 window size majority analysis where blue reflectance is greater than 0 2 fernández et al 2016 sakamoto et al 2007 flood extents were delineated by using a threshold based classification of the short wave infrared swir band landsat etm band 7 similar to fernández et al 2016 and westra and de wulf 2009 we compared the model predicted flood inundation maps with the satellite observed flood inundation to asses the spatial performance of the model we used two commonly used evaluation measures critical success index csi and hit rate aronica et al 2002 hawker et al 2018 sampson et al 2015 schaefer 1990 schumann et al 2016 when flood predictions are compared with observations we have four classes true positive tp flooded predicted as flooded or hit true negative tn non flooded predicted as non flooded false positive fp non flooded predicted as flooded or false alarm and false negative fn flooded predicted as non flooded or miss csi is a measure of accuracy when tn is not considered eq 5 it is sensitive to hits while penalizing both misses and false alarms 5 csi tp tp f p f n csi values range from 0 to 1 where a value of 1 indicates that the model is in full agreement with the observations the hit rate gives the fraction of flooded area that is correctly predicted by the model eq 6 the values range from 0 to 1 higher value indicates that the model predicts flood inundation better 6 hit rate tp tp f n we calculated the evaluation statistics only for the flooding season for this purpose we consider september to january as the flooded season and february to august as the dry season 3 3 6 comparison with a no canal simulation we compared two scenarios one with and one without canals and examined what effect canals had on flood dynamics in the depressions to understand the role of canals on the floodplain we simulated the logone model without any canals all the parameters were kept the same except for the canals this no canal simulation was then compared with the original simulation with canals in terms of flood inundation area flood volume and timing of flood recession in the depressions 4 results and discussion 4 1 bara comparison of model simulations and field observations the field data collected in 2014 showed there was a difference between the rate of recession in the river and the other parts of the system the river stage reduced by 1 m while the water levels in the floodplain depression and fish canals reduced only by 0 4 m in the two weeks of observations during flood recession the fishnet structure in the model was used to capture this dynamic of the system fig 5 shows the recession rates in all the features of the floodplain for the collected field data as well as the model the plot shows the depth anomaly with respect to water level on day one of measurement the slower recession rates in the floodplain depression and fish canal compared to that in the river channel is evident table 1 shows the difference in water depth in the different features of the floodplain between day 1 and day 15 of the measurements the corresponding model simulated change in water depth and the nse of simulated time series are also shown it shows that the water drops a little slower in the model initially but achieves the observed water level drop by the end of the measurement period the different recession rate of the river from the other features was effectively captured in the coarse resolution model as well fig 5 b the water depth difference in the observations and model and their corresponding nse is shown in table 1 for the various features of the floodplain the range of nse is from 0 56 to 0 88 which shows that the performance of the coarse resolution model is similar to that of the fine resolution model nse range 0 61 0 93 and has managed to capture the floodplain dynamics in the coarse resolution model the use of 500 m resolution model to study the entire floodplain is justified by this result that the 500 m model when run at bara still reproduces the water levels observed in the field with a similar precision as the 30 m model in the floodplain fishnet installed in fish canals have an obstruction made from sandbags and a screen made from twigs and tree branches which slows down the flow of water from the fish canal to the river the fishnet structure we incorporated in the model successfully captured this by creating a drop across the fishnet fig 6 shows the water drop across the fishnet on three days during the flood recession it shows that there is a considerable drop caused by the fishnet as the flood recession progresses 4 2 logone floodplain 4 2 1 flow mass balance the logone floodplain receives water from the logone river and loses most water due to evaporation fig 7 shows the modeled mean mass balance for the six year study period the mean volume difference between the input and output flows in the model is 0 79 we assumed that all the precipitation on the floodplain either infiltrated or evaporated and ignored its effect fig 7 does not show evaporation as a major flux however if we consider the modeled evaporation along with the precipitation that has evaporated it becomes a major flux on the floodplain we studied the dynamics of components of water balance by looking at the entire time series of discharge and evaporation the model inflow and outflow for the entire time series are shown in fig 8 a the calibration period in the time series is shaded in gray there is a noticeable lag between the peak inflow and outflow discharges with a mean of 29 days and a standard deviation of 10 39 days as the water has to traverse over 200 km along the river between the inflow and outflow locations the evaporation in the floodplain is shown in fig 8 b the peak evaporation occurs around november corresponding to when there is a peak flood in the summer months even though potential evapotranspiration is very high actual evapotranspiration is quite low as water in confined to the river channels and lake maga fig 9 shows the time series of observed and simulated discharge at logone gana there was no recorded discharge between june 2nd and october 30th 2006 the model accurately simulated the discharge at logone gana the difference between modeled and observed discharge was less than 100 m3 s more than 85 of the time however it should be noted that peak discharge is generally under estimated in the model at logone gana the nse of discharge prediction at logone gana was 0 94 the accurate prediction of discharge at logone gana means that the model also accurately predicted the amount of water on the floodplain between katoa and logone gana 4 2 2 flood inundation we compared the model predicted inundation maps to those derived from satellite observations over the entire model domain the comparison between observed and simulated inundated area is shown in fig 10 the gray area shows the calibration period meaning the landsat derived flood maps obtained during this time period was used for the manual calibration of the dem the observed and simulated inundated area had a pearson correlation coefficient r of 0 94 and coefficient of determination r2 of 0 81 the model does not capture the peak in 2001 2002 and 2005 but it captures the receding inundated area accurately the accurate prediction of flow at logone gana shown in fig 9 means that the model also accurately predicts the channel to floodplain flow due to overbank flooding this result is reinforced in fig 10 where the model again accurately predicts the magnitude of inundated area comparison between observed and simulated patterns of flood inundation is shown in fig 11 a to f shows the flood inundation patterns during the flooded season of the calibration period of 2006 it shows that the model captures the flood inundation pattern quite well the spatial mismatch is primarily due to the quality of topographic data and justifies the use of manual calibration to adjust the dem although manual calibration of the dem improved the spatial performance of the model there is still room for improvement recent methods like mason et al 2016 and shastry and durand 2019 could potentially be used to improve the dem and hence spatial performance of the model the spatial patterns in two december maps fig 11 e and f show that the movement of flood wave in the model is quicker than observed along the west side of the logone river and much slower on the east side this could be because of difference in vegetation between the two regions during the flooded season we use a constant high value of manning s coefficient for the entire floodplain to account for vegetation on the west side of the logone river on the east side of the logone river the model holds on to the water for longer because of this however the conclusions of this paper regarding the depressions and fish canals on the west side are not affected by this fig 11 g to l show the flood inundation patterns on the days of peak flood from satellite imagery between 2001 and 2005 the observed peak flooded imagery occurs in the months of october and november there are two available satellite images during this period in 2005 and both are shown we analyzed the spatial accuracy of predicted flood inundation maps by comparing them to satellite derived observations table 2 shows csi and hit rate values for calibration and validation periods the mean csi during calibration and validation was 0 33 and 0 25 respectively and the mean hit rate during calibration was 0 46 and during validation was 0 32 the mean values are lower due to the fact that flood recession in the model is much quicker than observed this can be clearly seen in fig 11 e and f however the model captures the peak flood inundation pretty well in 2006 the peak inundation is captured with a hit rate of 0 71 during the evaluation period the maximum hit rate is 0 67 during the peak of 1 november 2005 it should be noted that the model does not capture the peaks in terms of discharge fig 9 and magnitude of inundated area fig 10 and these peaks may be captured if the spatial prediction capability at the peaks could be further improved 4 2 3 impact of fishnets and fish canals on water storage in depressions the effect of the fishnet structure on the flow in the fish canal in bara depression in the large scale logone model is shown in fig 12 it shows the water surface elevation along the length of the fish canal on three days during the flood recession the water drop across the fishnet structure is clearly seen the fishnet structure slows down the flow of water from the fish canal to the river and the model is able to capture this effectively fig 13 shows timeseries of water storage in depressions from two model simulations with and without including fish canals fig 13 also shows the total inundated area within all depressions based on the landsat inundated area maps while both model simulations overestimate the duration of inundation the simulation including canals is most likely closer to reality for example in 2006 for the simulation including canals by december 3 the total depression storage was 763 ha m around half the maximum value 1542 ha m on october 14 the simulation that neglects canals does not reach the half maximum value until more than a month later on january 12 2007 the landsat observation on november 20 almost perfectly captured the halfway point of the depression inundation 5 8 km2 down from 12 2 km2 on october 3 the observations reach the halfway point around the same time as the simulation including canals the simulation without canals retains its water too long indeed the landsat observation on january 7 2007 shows that the depressions were essentially dry 0 1 km2 when the simulation without canals is still half full similar dynamics exist for the other years the date depressions are empty is an average of 29 2 days earlier in simulations that include canals see fig 13 thus simulations including fish canals more closely represents the correct inundation dynamics within the depressions duration of inundation in the depressions is a critical variable for floodplain fisheries as the duration of inundation in depressions governs fish growth the quicker recession in depressions as noticed in model simulations and confirmed by observations shortens the growing season for fish resulting in lower fish biomass at the time of recession when most of the fishing occurs 5 conclusions the goal of the study was to evaluate the strategy of using a hydrodynamic model with sub grid scale channels and structures to represent small scale anthropogenic controls on floodplain dewatering at the scale of the entire logone floodplain this was accomplished using the lisflood fp model applied to the logone floodplain in cameroon we built a fine resolution model 30 m of one depression bara with fish canals and fishnets which were successful in approximating the physical processes on the floodplain we reproduced the change in water levels across all features floodplain depression fish canals and river channel as observed during two weeks of flood recession we upscaled this model to a larger resolution of 500 m and found that with the help of sub grid parametrization of fish canals and depressions we were still able to successfully capture the processes on the floodplain it is noteworthy that a 500 m resolution hydrodynamic model was capable of accurately representing small scale features like fish canals that are a few meters wide and fishnets constructed across these fish canals we applied this strategy of representing fish canals and depressions as sub grid features to the entire floodplain to assess their impact on the flow patterns we found that fish canals are critical for modeling inundation timing in the depressions model simulations excluding canals emptied around a month too late compared to satellite observations with important implications for using such models to inform fish growth and population fishing is a major source of income in the logone floodplain and lower fish catches would have a huge impact on the local economy these modeling strategies enable us to quantify small scale processes in a computationally efficient model these models can be coupled with fisheries model like described in welcomme and hagborg 1977 to study the impacts of these small scale features on floodplain

5297,droughts have been occurring with increased frequency and bringing with them considerable losses due to its nature the best approach to monitoring and assessing droughts is in terms of stochastic theories as a consequence this study applied spi in the hydrological drought detection and examine interpret drought related phenomena the 3 month spi is used to decide the drought development and terminate phases based on the coincidence of hydrological drought and anomalies in precipitation four primary characteristics were determined to clarify the descriptions of drought magnitude and occurrence duration deficit occurrence time and recurrence year a stochastic process of drought is established to take account these characteristics using the copula function and a poisson process as well as non stationarity case study on the shihmen and zengwen reservoir watersheds in taiwan revealed that hydrological drought events often coincide with meteorological drought but some inconsistencies due to unusual hydrological hysteresis in rainfall and runoff our analysis raised several issues including the choice of drought identification parameters and spi time scale threshold which should take into account anthropogenic activity and hydrological characteristics a positive correlation between drought duration and drought deficit and a negative correlation between them and occurrence time were identified it was also observed that subsequent drought event may be more severe due to the partial recovery of hydrological condition in terms of non stationarity our results do not show strong evidence of long term trend for drought characteristics some limitations could be due to the percentile to percentile basis of copula this issue may need to be examined using non stationary copula analysis or time variant correlation covariance models in the end we demonstrated that this framework can apply in forecasting drought conditions and generating synthetic droughts for use in the formulation of water resources management strategies and the development of drought preparedness plans keywords drought identification spi streamflow copula poisson nonstationarity 1

wilhite and glantz 1985 mishra and singh 2011 parry et al 2016 the problem of defining drought can be attributed to differences in the perspective of academics in different fields as well as

definitions of drought can be grouped into four categories meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic wilhite and glantz 1985 american meteorological society 2004 mishra and singh 2010 the meteorological definition of drought refers to a lack of precipitation in a given a region for a given period of time which is often preceded by above normal temperatures and often precedes other forms of drought mishra and singh 2010 dai 2011 the hydrological definition refers to a period of insufficient resources to meet the requirements established by a water resource management system wilhite 2000 mishra and singh 2010 in simpler terms it refers to the availability of water measured as stream flow aron and emmanuel 1982 smakhtin 2001 the agricultural definition of drought refers to a supply of water that is insufficient to sustain crops whereas a socioeconomic drought references the supply or demand for specific commodities in the economy these four types of drought can occur independently concurrently or sequentially ams 2004 researchers have formulated a number of indices for the characterization of drought each of which has particular strengths and weaknesses keyantash and dracup 2002 essentially a drought index is a prime variable used to assess the effects of a drought and define the underlying parameters the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 1968 and standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 are commonly used to describe drought from a meteorological perspective pdsi estimates are based on monthly precipitation temperature and the local availability of water and are extensively used in the united states mishra and singh 2010 jain et al 2015 spi estimates are based on long term precipitation records in which precipitation is quantified as a standardized departure from the climatological average and can be calculated for a variety of time scales in addition other indices which could be used to evaluate drought condition for example also include standardized streamflow index ssi standardized water level index swi standardized runoff index sri streamflow drought index sdi and etc due to its simplicity and convenience spi is more widely used throughout the world mishra and singh 2010 dai 2011 hydrologic drought analysis focuses on streamflow data and water availability dracup et al 1980 sen 1980 zelenhasić and salvai 1987 chang and stenson 1990 frick et al 1990 mohan and rangacharya 1991 clausen and pearson 1995 the simplest definition of hydrological drought is a deficit of water compared with normal conditions this approach proposed by yevjevich 1967 is known as the threshold level method or run method and many researchers have adopted this rationale dracup et al 1980 zelenhasić and salvai 1987 salas et al 2005 smakhtin 2001 and kao and govindaraju 2010 by this kind of methods the hydrological drought can be characterized by a duration severity and or average intensity however all assessments depend on what is the normal conditions we expected in other words researchers must determine the magnitude and or duration of the water deficit that would qualify as a drought therefore a key issue in applying the threshold level method i e an operational definition is characterizing the drought in terms of onset continuation and termination of that particular episode as well as its severity the threshold used most widely is the median or mean flow referring as normal conditions shiau et al 2007 salvadori and de michele 2015 tosunoglu and kisi 2016 parry et al 2016 besides zelenhasić and salvai 1987 used the run method with different percentile thresholds and found that the 95th and 90th percentiles were the most statistically accurate for the identification of droughts also some other studies adopted thresholds that involve a fixed probability percentile or a fraction of the mean which is specific to their perspective or application tallaksen et al 1997 demuth and kulls 1997 demuth and heinrich 1997 hisdal et al 2001 engeland et al 2004 fleig et al 2006 byzedi and saghafian 2010 in recent studies the threshold level method has been implemented using variable thresholds on daily seasonal and monthly scales hisdal et al 2004 kjeldsen et al 2000 threshold selection is usually an arbitrary matter however it should be linked to the effects in key economic sectors reflecting increasing levels of risk and vulnerability to drought recently parry et al 2016 proposed a systematic quantitative methodology aimed specifically at characterizing the various phases of hydrological drought this method identifies the development and termination phases of drought using predetermined parameters established by experts based on well known hydrological droughts on historical record in the current study drought termination is defined as a distinctive phase applicable to river flow records pertaining to catchments in the united kingdom uk their results provide an unprecedented historical perspective on hydrological droughts in the uk despite weaknesses in the selection of parameters the proposed drought identification method provides strong guidance for the determination of the spatial and temporal characteristics of drought drought is a multi scalar phenomenon mckee et al 1993 wherein the effects of precipitation deficits become evident in surface and subsurface hydrology systems at different temporal scales numerous studies have focused on individual drought categories few studies have analyzed the relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought nonetheless researchers have clearly demonstrated that the use of standardized indicators for meteorological and hydrological drought enables consistent characterization across components of the hydrological cycle lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 barker et al 2016 huang et al 2017 used the spi and the standardized streamflow index ssi to characterize meteorological and hydrological droughts in terms of propagation and correlation they found statistically positive linkages between meteorological and hydrological droughts on long term as well as short term time scales one fundamental advantage of spi is the fact that it can be computed for a variety of time scales when dealing with short term drought e g agricultural drought or long term drought e g hydrological drought mishra and singh 2010 determining an appropriate time scale for spi can be helpful for the identification of hydrological drought agnew 2000 bachmair et al 2016 zakhem and kattaa 2016 due to the stochastic nature of drought the best approach to monitoring and assessing these events is in terms of probability and stochastic theories shiau 2006 ayantobo et al 2018 researchers have made great strides in modeling various aspects of drought including the identification and prediction of duration and severity both of which must be considered in the design of water supply systems in univariate probabilistic analysis drought characteristics are investigated separately cancelliere and salas 2004 serinaldi et al 2009 however this kind of approach may not provide a comprehensive appraisal of droughts or account for significant correlations among different characteristics the copula method introduced by sklar in 1959 has been employed extensively in multivariate analysis due to its ability to overcome many of the drawbacks inherent to conventional methods salvadori and de michele 2015 zhang et al 2015 she et al 2016 salvadori and de michele 2015 provided a comprehensive review of the copula for drought analysis nonetheless most of those studies constructed 2 dimensional copulas with a focus on severity and duration relatively little research has been dedicated to the function of multidimensional copulas yang et al 2018 variation in drought characteristics due to climate change is a growing concern in drought analysis mishra and singh 2010 it is widely believed that climate change and human activities have increased the frequency of drought and its corresponding impact however it is necessary to determine whether these effects are due to hydrological factors or other considerations there is ongoing debate concerning the effects of climate change on the frequency and severity of drought many studies have focused on the meteorological factors e g temperature or precipitation often by downscaling the outputs of the atmosphere ocean general circulation models aogcms to model drought variables at local scales loukas et al 2007 ghosh and mujumdar 2007 loukas et al 2008 blenkinsop and fowler 2007 burke and brown 2010 dubrovsky et al 2009 burke and brown 2010 jenkins and warren 2015 schlaepfer et al 2017 nonetheless the reliability of aogcm projections remains an issue of debate lee and you 2013 the utilization of aogcms is limited by unrealistic in daily or weekly temporal resolution and biased in regional scale which could be problematic in drought analysis several studies have used large scale hydrological models to simulate surface water characteristics for drought analysis andreadis et al 2005 andreadis and lettenmaier 2006 shukla and wood 2008 sheffield and wood 2008 mishra et al 2009 however this approach is greatly limited by the capacity of the model in reasonably estimating hydrological variables an alternative is non stationary frequency analysis which is extended from stationary frequency analysis by assuming the same probability distribution functions under variation in time strupczewski et al 2001a b investigated the trends involved in first two moments of a probability distribution function in linear or parabolic form they performed maximum likelihood estimation ml and weighted least squares estimation wls to derive these trends chen et al 2017 reviewed many of the procedures related to the identification of statistical trends parametric or nonparametric and proposed a framework by which to examine the non stationarity of first and second moments based on the principles of identification of distribution and trends idt this study employed parametric wls estimation and non parametric discrete wavelet analysis dwt in conjunction with ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd for the identification of trends in annual maximum rainfall in this study we developed a drought analysis framework to examine and interpret drought related phenomena in which spi was used for parameter determination this integration made it possible to obtain robust values for the characteristics of drought this study also proposed a stochastic process of drought using the copula function and a poisson process while taking into account long term nonstationary analysis we demonstrated that this framework is able to applied in forecasting drought conditions and generating synthetic droughts for simulated water resource models 2 methodology our objective in this study was to develop a model framework in analysis of hydrological droughts as a stochastic process we quantified the characteristics of drought and used a poisson process and copula distribution for the interpretation of drought characteristics the proposed framework could be used to simulate the occurrence of droughts for planning purposes taking into account the non stationary nature of droughts under the effects of climate change fig 1 illustrates the proposed framework and each component is discussed individually below 2 1 drought identification this study focused on hydrological drought which can cause problems for water supply systems as indicated by low reservoir storage thus our first task was the identification of drought events within a time series this study adopted the statistical method proposed by parry et al 2016 in which the development and termination of drought is used to identify drought events based on flow data however we employed a more general method for the selection of parameters used in drought identification under the different hydrological conditions which may be encountered in the uk and taiwan based on the definition of drought proposed by parry et al 2016 the process of identifying a drought begins with the conversion of mean flow data into a percentage anomaly of the monthly long term average lta within a given reference period the transform function used as the threshold in defining drought is shown below 1 q anom t 100 q obs t q lta m 1 where t is the time step index m is the month of the time step qanom t is the streamflow anomaly percentage at time t and qobs t is the observed streamflow at t qlta m is the long term average in the mth month which is used as the truncation level to indicate the occurrence of a drought if the streamflow is lower than this average zelenhasić and salvai 1987 parry et al 2016 identified three parameters for use in the detection of drought based on historical data with prior expert knowledge on drought occurrence in the uk the parameters included d the number of months of below average flows required for the drought development phase to begin r the number of months of intermittent above average flows permitted within d and t the number of consecutive months of above average flow required for the end of the drought termination phase the phases of drought are shown in fig 2 the start of a drought development phase refers to the first month of d consecutive months for which q anom t is negative the end of the drought termination phase is the last month of t consecutive months for which q anom t is greater than 0 this definition permits streamflow above the average for brief periods of time less than t in order to account for minor wet interludes during drought development the values assigned to parameters d r and t vary according to location moreover the use of q lta m may be better suited to areas with stable hydrological conditions such as the uk in regions with obvious dry and wet periods droughts may only begin with low flow phases during the dry period but during the wet period even flow that is below the average should not cause too many problems due to the fact that streamflow is much higher than demand and storage facilities are probably able to mitigate the impact of these fluctuations under these conditions a constant truncation level over the year may be more appropriate for the identification of drought events in the current study we adopted a similar approach however we replaced q lta m in eq 1 with a fixed truncation level qτ for the entire time domain thus eq 1 is reformulated as follows 2 q anom t 100 q obs t q τ 1 based on this modification the truncation level is an important parameter which should be coordinated with d r and t for the identification of drought in the current study we incorporated rainfall related data with the spi in determining these parameters 3 parameter determination using spi the spi mckee et al 1993 is widely used to characterize meteorological drought on a range of time scales generally spi calculation is based on a long term average precipitation series for a specific period such as 1 3 6 or 12 months the spi quantifies observed precipitation as a standardized departure from a selected probability distribution function which is then transformed to standard normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 spi values can be interpreted as the standard deviation by which the observed anomaly deviates from the long term mean mckee et al 1993 clausen and pearson 1995 recent studies have used meteorological drought indices e g spi as indicators of hydrological drought and water resources variables e g soil moisture surface runoff and reservoir storage vicente serrano and lopez moreno 2005 edossa et al 2010 fiorillo and guadagno 2010 vicente serrano et al 2010 vasiliades et al 2011 in the current study spi was used in parameter selection for the detection of hydrological drought we applied 3 month spi to determine d r t and q τ for the definition of hydrological drought considering the current climate situation we believe that this approach better reflects shortages in inflow from the perspective of reservoirs parameter estimation was based the coincidence of hydrological drought and anomalies in precipitation criterion sn was used to judge the goodness of these matches as follows 3 d i 1 i f h i m i 0 e l s e s n i n d i n 100 where i is the yearly index hi is a boolean variable indicating that the hydrological drought occurred in a given year and mi is the counterpart of meteorological drought occurrence n refers to the total number of years included in the analysis using above formulation sn ranges from 0 to 100 where a higher value indicates that the selected parameter set led to better results 4 drought characteristics after identifying an instance of drought we quantify its characteristics with a focus on occurrence and severity the magnitude of drought is represented by two characteristics drought duration dur and drought deficit def the occurrence of drought was defined by the drought occurrence time in the current year oct and the drought recurrence year rty dur refers to the period in which the streamflow is below qτ def is the sum of qanom t throughout the period of drought oct indicates the time at which the drought occurred for the sake of simplification it is defined as the number of days from august 1st and the beginning of drought rty refers to the number of years that passed between two drought events these characteristics are presented in fig 3 4 1 stochastic drought processes this study developed a stochastic process for the interpretation of drought occurrence and severity in previous studies drought characteristics were generally described using independent univariate distributions a few studies employed the joint modeling of drought characteristics with higher dimensional correlation particularly that derived from streamflow data tosunoglu and kisi 2016 however there could be correlations among those characteristics bivariate joint distribution is one possible option however that approach is limited by the fact that the same family is required for each marginal distribution thus we adopted a more general copula process to describe a 3 dimensional joint multivariate distribution for the three continuous drought characteristics dur def and oct the drought recurrence year rty which is a discrete random variable was modeled using a well known poisson process based on an exponential distribution of recurrence intervals without incorporated in the copula since it not provides to much information but comes more technical problems 4 2 copulas a copula is a multivariate distribution function used to capture the degree of dependence between sets of variables without any restriction on the selection of distributions based on sklar s theorem 1959 any multivariate distribution can be fully characterized by its marginal i e univariate distribution function and a copula a copula function connects several univariate marginal distributions to a full multivariate distribution resulting in a joint distribution function for n dimensional continuous random variables x 1 x 2 x n with their marginal cumulative distribution function cdf f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n and the multivariate joint cdf is f x 1 x 2 x n u i f i x i i 1 ñ there exists one unique n copula c such that 4 f x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n c u 1 u 2 u n copula function c is used to model the degree of dependence between variables xi eq 4 is a joint cdf with the cdf of marginal distributions f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n similarly the joint density function f can be expressed as follows 5 f x 1 x 2 x n c u 1 u 2 u n i 1 n f i x i where f is the probably density function pdf of xi and c is the density function of copula c for the sake of simplification this study adopted a popular gaussian copula capable of preserving tractability and computational efficiency andersen and sidenius 2004 pitt et al 2006 the gaussian copula density function is expressed as follows 6 c u σ k 1 2 exp z t k 1 i z 2 where z is a vector of normal scores with the element z i φ 1 u i as mentioned uj is the value of cdf for xj φ is the cdf of the normalized gaussian distribution i is the n dimensional identity matrix and k is the correlation matrix note that the multivariate gaussian pdf is a special case where all margins are univariate gaussian in this case matrix k for the pearson correlation matrix covariance matrix is described as follows 7 k 1 ρ x 1 x 2 ρ x 1 x n ρ x 2 x 1 1 ρ x 2 x n ρ x n x 1 ρ x n x 2 1 where ρ x i x j is the pearson correlation coefficient for variables x i and x j however if the margins have a non gaussian distribution then ρ x i x j in matrix k is replaced by the linear correlation of two normal scores 8 ρ z i z j ρ φ 1 u i φ 1 u j constructing a 3 dimensional copula model based on three continuous drought characteristics i e dur def and oct makes it necessary to obtain the optimal continuous marginal distributions via fitting most previous works on drought analysis used two continuous distributions exponential and gamma a number of researchers have utilized an exponential distribution to fit drought duration and gamma distribution to fit drought severity zelenhasić and salvai 1987 loaiciga and leipnik 1996 salas et al 2005 shiau 2006 shiau et al 2007 shiau and modarres 2009 to make our results more generalizable we examined six marginal distribution candidates including normal log normal exponential gamma left skewed and right skewed gumbel the forms of the density functions used for these distributions are listed in table 1 the goodness of fit of these distributions was assessed in terms of three criteria bayesian information criterion bic and the kolmogorov smirnov test k s test selection of the optimal distribution was implemented using the following steps 1 eliminate candidate distributions in which the p value of the k s test is smaller than 0 1 2 compare the bic values of the filtered distributions and select the distribution with the lowest bic value besides we also calculated akaike information criterion aic as another reference 4 3 poisson process the poisson process is widely used to model the occurrence of events in time and space many researchers in the field of hydrology have utilized the poisson process for the quantitative analysis of drought and precipitation e g gupta and duckstein 1975 rodriguez iturbe et al 1984 cowpertwait 1998 abaurrea and cebrián 2002 yoo et al 2008 in this study the drought recurrence year rty was characterized using the poisson process the probability density function of the poisson distribution with a random variable x is expressed as follows 9 p x x λ t k k exp λ t where k is k factorial and parameter λ t refers to the shape of the distribution based on given state space t and the expected number of events 4 4 non stationarity in this study we also addressed the issue of non stationarity in hydrologic conditions we sought to obtain an appropriate representation of future drought conditions using an identification of distribution trend idt model in which probability distribution and a time trend in the first two statistical moments were used to account for climatic trends strupczewski et al 2001b you et al 2013 time dependent variations in the observed process are modeled as a linear or parabolic trend in the parameters of the probability distributions for example in a gamma distribution the nonstationary form can be expressed as follows 10 f x x t 1 β t α t γ α t x t α t 1 exp x t β t assuming the first and second order moments µ t and σ t can be interpreted as a polynomial function following 11 μ t c μ 2 t 2 c μ 1 t c μ 0 σ t c σ 2 t 2 c σ 1 t c σ 0 where c μ 2 c μ 1 c μ 0 c σ 2 c σ 1 and c σ 0 are the polynomial coefficients for the trend models of mean and standard deviation correspondingly parameters α t and β t in eq 10 can be expressed as a function of the first and second order moments as follows 12 α t μ t 2 σ t 2 β t σ t 2 μ t to determine the trends in μ t and σ t as well as the parameters in α t and β t we used the ml method to estimate time dependent parameters for drought properties strupczewski et al 2001b ml estimationis under the assumedstatistical modeltheobserved datais most probable with largest likelihood ml provides a consistent approach to parameter estimation it provides a high degree of efficiency and numerical stability by taking advantage of the properties of the specific estimation problem with the requirement of a special analytical solution in the example above the optimal parameter set can be determined by maximizing the log likelihood as an optimization problem as follows 13 ln m l max c i 1 n ln f x i c where c c μ 0 c μ 1 c μ 2 c σ 0 c σ 1 c σ 2 and i is the index of the ith observation from the total n realization to account for the complexity and robustness of function selection bayesian information criterion bic is used as a criterion to select the optimal form of a trend eq 11 in fitting a model the likelihood increases with the inclusion of additional parameters however there is always the chance of overfitting bic considers the tradeoff between number of parameters and the goodness of fit the bic criterion is written as follows 14 bic 2 ln m l ln n k where ml is the maximum likelihood as notated n is the number of observations and k is the number of estimation parameters the model with thelowest bicis preferred 5 study area the proposed framework was used to evaluate the drought situation in a case study of two reservoir watersheds in taiwan taiwan lies across the tropic of cancer in east asia the climate there is strongly influenced by the east asian monsoon and pacific typhoons which produce an average annual rainfall of 2500 mm and close to 5000 mm in some regions in the east of the country northern and central taiwan have a humid subtropical climate whereas most of southern taiwan has a tropical monsoon climate the average monthly temperature ranges from 15 to 20 c in the winter and approximately 28 c in the summer precipitation in taiwan is influenced by the northeasterly monsoon during the cold season september to april and the southwesterly monsoon during the warm season may to august in the winter the northeast experiences steady rain whereas the central and southern parts of the island are mostly sunny most of the typhoons strike between july and october throughout the year the north south orientated central mountain range dominating the terrain of the island causes large spatial variations in climate due to orographic effects despite the abundance of precipitation much of the water shortage problem in taiwan is due to steep topography unequal spatial temporal distribution of rainfall and a high population density particularly during the dry season it can be difficult to satisfy the demand for water taiwan receives 60 of the annual rainfall between may and october whereas southern taiwan receives 90 over the same period taiwan depends heavily on reservoirs to regulate its water supply particularly in southern taiwan the ratio of rainfall in rainy season to dry season in northern taiwan is 6 4 and 9 1 in southern taiwan this distribution makes it difficult to effectively store and utilize water resources effectively in this study we investigated two of the most important reservoirs in taiwan shihmen and zengwen as shown in fig 4 shihmen reservoir is in the north of the island and zengwen is in the south this study utilized daily precipitation and 10 day inflow data in shihmen reservoir from 1965 to 2015 and zengwen reservoir from 1974 to 2017 shihmen reservoir supplies much of the demand for water in northern taiwan including irrigation and public demand in taoyuan county and parts of new taipei city the watershed area of the shihmen reservoir covers 763 4 km2 with effective storage of 1 97 108 m3 supplying approximately 4 6 108 m3 water resources agency 2019 for public demand when taking into account all water usage the ratio of water supply yield to reservoir capacity is between 4 and 5 this means that the shihmen reservoir must be accessed more than four times annually to satisfy the demand for water zengwen reservoir is the largest reservoir in taiwan supplying water primarily for irrigation and secondarily for municipal and industrial usage in the chiayi and tainan areas the watershed area of the zengwen reservoir is 481 km2 with effective storage of approximately 5 1 108 m3 the ratio of annual water supply to reservoir capacity is slightly greater than unity note that 90 of inflow is during the wet season and only 10 during the dry season water resources agency 2019 in this situation storage plays a more important role than does inflow in the operation of zengwen reservoir severe droughts often occur when insufficient water is available from the preceding wet season due to high agricultural demand in the spring 6 results and discussions 6 1 drought characteristics for each 10 day interval we converted average rainfall time series in the last 3 month period from daily precipitation data for the two reservoirs and then calculated the corresponding spi for this study area 1 or 2 month spi is obviously too short for the drought development but 6 month spi is too long since it could over the wet and dry season for this reason the 3 month spi was selected to identify instances of meteorological drought for shihmen reservoir we selected a threshold of 1 to capture moderate droughts based on the spi mckee et al 1993 for zengwen reservoir in the south of taiwan we selected a threshold of 1 25 to define the meteorological drought due to the drier climate and greater capacity of the reservoir the selection domains of the parameters were as follows d 8 to 15 r 0 to 3 t 1 to 4 and q anom t 40 to 90 we employed the exhaustive search algorithm esa to obtain the values for d r t and qr the optimal sets of the parameters for shihmen and zengwen reservoir are listed in table 2 the match score sn was 92 for shihmen reservoir and 81 3 for zengwen reservoir based on previous experience conducting drought analysis in taiwan we obtained a moderate value for d which represents a drought of sufficient duration to have a negative impact on agriculture a relatively short r caused by intermittent high flows temporarily eases drought conditions however it is insufficient for a complete recovery similar t as a critical condition to the end of drought moreover a larger threshold q anom t indicates how low the flow is which cause the drought our results revealed that the temporal indices were similar for both reservoirs d 10 indicates that nearly three months 100 days are required to initiate a drought r 2 and t 2 indicates that 20 days are required for recovery slight difference of qt 54 and 61 percentile respectively exists in shihmen and zengwen reservoir which shows how severe the inflow conditions are could cause drought the high capacity inflow ratio of zengwen reservoir means that a lower qt is required to reflect the situation of this reservoir parry et al 2016 reported that the selections made using the long term average tend to have higher number of drought events than those used in threshold based studies low flow thresholds have been widely used in other studies and a threshold level of q70 q90 is generally considered appropriate fleig et al 2006 in this study we obtained slightly higher inflow thresholds q54 and q64 due to the critical water supply associated with these two reservoir watersheds theoretically a higher threshold should increase the overall drought duration and extend the development and termination phases however due to high variability in the hydrological conditions in taiwan between dry and flood seasons multi year drought events are not usually the case this parametric set did not capture any droughts exceeding one year the uk study by parry et al 2016 set d at ten months r at one month and t at two months the moderately high value for d ensured that the model would be able to capture multi season and multi year droughts the relative short r was meant to find a balance between an unrealistically large number of events and none at all the hydrological variability of many catchments in the uk requires a value of t greater than one in order to account for wet interludes during droughts droughts in taiwan occur only during the dry season and end with the first typhoon therefore the value of d in this study is much lower a few weeks to a few months of normal inflow is generally sufficient for both taiwan and the uk to recover from drought however the streamflow variation in taiwan is far greater than in the uk therefore r and t are shorter parry et al 2016 used monthly intervals whereas we used 10 day intervals their selection of parameters r and t may have been due to lower temporal resolution as mentioned before the monthly time steps used in their study may have obscured indicators of drought termination or underestimated the speed at which drought terminated fig 5 shows the drought events identified using the parameter sets for shihmen and zengwen reservoirs the upper side of each figure shows normalized inflow where the red curve indicates the drought development phase and the blue curve indicates the period leading up to the drought termination phase drought development begins when streamflow drops below the threshold and ends at the time step of maximum negative drought termination is defined as the phase of a drought in which multiple consecutive time steps present inflow exceeding the threshold the lower side of fig 5 shows the rolling 3 month spi in 10 day intervals we found that some of the events identified by spi were missed using the method in this study for example the spi for shihmen reservoir in 1985 indicates a water deficit from the perspective of precipitation however our method gave no indication of the relatively low streamflow conditions that could lead to drought in the following year 1986 the low inflow conditions indicated the onset of drought but that observation did not correspond to a low spi in that period in that year while precipitation events occurred at the normal rate inflow was relatively low not as expected unusual hydrological hysteresis may account for this lack of consistency a similar situation was observed in zengwen reservoir in 1987 2005 and 2014 this raises questions with regard to spi time scale intervals and thresholds in drought detection which may be very influential in hydrological drought parametric sets we believe that the selection of spi time scales and or thresholds should account for anthropogenic activity as well hydrological characteristics in the study area in the case studies there is a very high demand for agricultural water use around 70 in this study we opted for a 3 month spi with the hope that this would be capable of capturing the anomalies that impact soil water conditions and agricultural production the spi thresholds of 1 and 1 25 in the current study respectively indicate 15 87 and 6 68 meteorological risk in areas with greater abundance of water resources and or lower demand a lower spi could be used to identify drought events 6 2 drought characteristics and univariate distributions after drought events are defined using the selected parameter sets the four primary characteristics dur def oct and rty can be determined for further analysis the correlations between the first three characteristics were simulated using the copula model which links multivariate distributions to their univariate marginal functions in this way the univariate distribution of drought duration dur drought deficit def and drought occurrence time oct can be derived from the six candidates listed in table 1 whereas recurrence year rty is derived according to the poisson distribution table 3 lists the results for the optimal univariate marginal functions pertaining to each drought characteristic three of the characteristics dur def and oct were all not rejected by the k s test for most distributions at a significance level of 10 in both reservoir watersheds drought duration dur did not pass fitting with the log normal distribution dur neither passed fitting with gamma distribution in shihmen reservoir nor the exponential distribution in zengwen reservoir in both watersheds drought deficit and occurrence time did not pass fitting with the exponential distribution note that the k s test is a general instrument designed to detect differences in the location as well as the shape of distributions based on the maximum absolute difference between the cumulative distribution functions exponential distribution was easily rejected by the k s test due to its limited freedom in terms of fitting a good fit of exponential distribution requires a small standard deviation from the mean with skewness around 2 log normal distribution is usually characterized in terms of the log transformed variable the logarithm of which is symmetric and normally distributed this is not always the case for time variables such as dur and oct however it would be a reasonable approach for def all of the distributions other than exponential and logarithmic presented interpretive capacity under these variables table 4 lists the distributions that best fit all of the variables basically these distributions are those with the lowest aic and bic values among those that were not rejected by the k s test it is interesting to note that the drought duration and water deficit in shihmen are both right skewed whereas those in zengwen are slightly left skewed and the occurrence time is the opposite this implies that droughts in shihmen watershed are slightly less severe i e there are fewer events of large duration and or large deficit note also that droughts in that area tend to occur later in the year a high proportion of the droughts in zengwen watershed are of greater severity and longer duration and they tend to occur earlier in the year these results can be explained by the fact that shihmen watershed has more stable inflow and less variability between the dry and wet seasons whereas zengwen watershed has unstable inflow and considerable variability between the dry and wet seasons thus the moderate streamflow fluctuations leave shihmen reservoir susceptible to drought throughout the entire dry period whereas zengwen is particularly susceptible to drought at the very beginning of the dry period moreover droughts in taiwan always end when the wet season begins i e with the coming of mei yu or the first typhoon the expected inverse relation between occurrence time and duration severity means that droughts that occur earlier are likely to be more severe and last longer the drought characteristics the recurrence year rty is interpreted through the poisson process we applied the chi square goodness of fit test chi square test to account for this discrete distribution our results show that rty is not rejected using the null in goodness of fit tests with poisson distribution our results also show that the droughts in shihmen reservoir are not as severe as those in than zengwen reservoir and occur less frequently this may be due to the nature of the droughts in the two watersheds or our selection of spi for drought identification 6 3 copula model correlations among drought characteristics can be evaluated in greater detail using the copula model in multivariate situations three continuous drought characteristics are transformed into standard normal distribution for the construction of a gaussian copula table 5 lists the correlation matrix used in the construction of the copula using original and standardized data as expected dur and def were positively correlated whereas both characteristics were negatively correlated with oct furthermore the non gaussianity of these variables is not particularly strong we did not observe a significant difference between the correlations derived before and after standardization although rty is not incorporated in copula model the correlation among rty and other characteristics were also calculated as additional information the correlation could almost be ignored in shihmen and not very significant in zengwen however it still can observe that rty is negatively correlated with dur and def and positively correlated with oct this implies subsequent drought event may be more serious in its severity comparing to that after normal of wet years it may be that the recovery of hydrological drought is not complete yet and influence the streamflow condition in coming year for the same reason the occurrence could a little bit earlier comparing to longer interval year rty among two drought events with the correlation matrix a gaussian copula can be constructed using marginal distributions parameterized separately from the dependence structure of the joint distribution the original data is better fitted a non gaussian distribution so marginal distribution should be transformed from a gaussian distribution back into its original best fitting model here we adopted the sampling method proposed by papoulis 1991 and duda et al 2012 to guarantee statistical similarity and significance this framework was used to simulate 5000 samples for each reservoir watershed as shown in fig 6 the results of which verified the efficacy of the our three parameter copula model for drought analysis 6 4 non stationarity analysis the proposed method was used to investigate non stationarity in accounting for the impact of climate change on drought characteristics table 6 lists the identified long term trend for each drought characteristic using the ml method and bic accordingly the trends identified in the parameters in the marginals of our copula model are also trend functions of time by a connection of mean and standard deviation fig 7 presents the non stationarity of drought characteristics presented by the time variant mean and standard deviation corresponding to historical data our analysis revealed only one characteristic presenting strong non stationarity the exception of drought deficit in zengwen it means the severity might increase in this area in coming future there was a linear increase in the standard deviation of occurrence time the occurrence time although not increase in its mean value in the future but the variability could increase in general the drought characteristics still not shows a strong evidence with obvious climate change impact in these two watersheds some clue for potential impact in the future could be sensed but need for further observation 6 5 synthetic droughts under non stationary scenarios using a copula model the fitted trend functions and copula model were used to synthesize future drought events under the impact of climate change two important components in this framework are the time variant marginal probability distribution and invariant copula correlation model this framework makes it possible to generate synthetic drought characteristics for use in elucidating future drought conditions to guide the formulation of an appropriate strategy fig 8 presents synthetic time variant drought characteristics from 2015 to 2050 overall the non stationary model proved effective in capturing patterns in non stationarity and could use to generate synthetic droughts based on the fitted trend function table 7 lists the drought characteristics in 2015 2030 and 2050 under non stationary scenarios we can see from these results that the mean and standard deviation of drought deficit in the shihmen reservoir watershed remained constant as well as drought duration the standard deviation of drought occurrence time increased from 42 17 days in 2015 to 58 63 days in 2050 which could be interpreted as 40 chance of droughts occurring two weeks earlier in 2050 drought duration in the zengwen reservoir did not change significantly either however the deficit is likely to be 30 greater in 2050 than in 2015 drought duration and deficit are both critical factors associated with the severity of droughts under the effects of climate change shihmen presented obvious changes in the temporal patterns of drought however it is likely that those effects could be mitigated by contrast zengwen reservoir is facing a reduction in the availability of water which would be difficult to mitigate these results indicate that water conservation efforts should focus on water quantity rather than allocation i e encouraging water conservation or developing new sources of water we also generated six groups 50 000 data points each group for four drought characteristics in 2015 2030 and 2030 the statistical properties of which are listed in table 8 it is not surprising that the statistical properties were consistent with the predefined marginal distribution synthetic simulations can be used to produce representative data which retains the statistical characteristics of historical events it is therefore possible to use synthetic hydrologic sequences to reproduce hydrologic features and generate variability sufficient to meet the requirements of water resource engineers the results of non stationarity analysis are also useful for local governments seeking to determine whether current policy pertaining to water supply will be applicable to future scenarios an issue we would like to discuss is that our study indicated the correlation among drought characteristics that dur and def are positively correlated with each other while these two characteristics are negatively correlated with oct nonetheless long term trends revealed an increase in def in zengwen watershed why does the corresponding characteristics dur not increase simultaneously with time neither oct decreases as well the copula quantifies the correlation structure between two marginal distributions on a percentile to percentile basis thus one variable is time variant but the structure does not change therefore the other variable can maintain its stationarity within this structure the complexity of time variant correlation in quantity or the trend relationship was beyond the scope of this study however it should be examined in the future 7 conclusions this paper presents a comprehensive framework for drought analysis including methods for the identification of drought characteristics and the derivation of stochastic process parameters as well as issues pertaining to correlation and non stationarity we first sought to clarify the definition of droughts as well as the phases of droughts based on four distinguishing characteristics spi was used to make the definitions more robust however the parameters and threshold in drought identification may influence the result but it could depend on the knowledge and understanding in the study area we defined four drought characteristics to clarify the descriptions of drought magnitude and occurrence duration deficit occurrence time and recurrence year we also took correlation and non stationarity into account in establishing a model by which to generate synthetic drought series to assist in forecasting and dealing with water management issues our case study on the shihmen and zengwen reservoir watersheds in taiwan revealed that hydrological drought events often coincide with meteorological drought but some inconsistencies due to unusual hydrological hysteresis in rainfall and runoff our analysis raised several issues including the choice of drought identification parameters and spi time scale threshold the important parameters included the length of the drought development phase the amount of intermittent above average flow and time at which the drought termination phase ends the selection of these parameters should take into account anthropogenic activity and hydrological characteristics in this study we used a slightly higher inflow threshold to account for the severe water supply difficulties associated with these two reservoir watersheds the correlations among drought characteristics are generally straightforward there is a positive correlation between drought duration and drought deficit and a negative correlation between these two characteristics and occurrence time this can no doubt be attributed to pronounced differences between dry and flood seasons in the study area droughts always end when the first typhoons come in june or july which means that when a drought occurs earlier it inevitably lasts longer and ends up being more severe on the other hand subsequent drought event may be more severe due to the partial recovery of hydrological condition in terms of non stationarity long term trends in deficiency were only observed in zengwen watershed note that only shihmen watershed presented a time dependent increase in the occurrence time changes in the temporal patterns of drought have been widely discussed in taiwan however our results show no evidence of this trend moreover the trends in drought duration deficit and occurance time in our case study correspond with historical data the increase of one characteristic due to the time variation does not lead to corresponding change of another one this is because the limitation of copula which quantifies the correlation between two marginal distributions on a percentile to percentile basis we suggest that future researchers examine this issue using non stationary copula analysis or time variant correlation covariance models to summarize the drought analysis framework presented in this study provides guidance in the interpretation and forecasting of drought characteristics the proposed method examines the relationships within or among meteorological hydrological and anthropogenic effects by examining the chronology of drought characteristics throughout river systems and hydrological cycles our findings could help to elucidate issues associated with droughts for use in the formulation of water resources management strategies and the development of drought preparedness plans in the study region credit authorship

5297,droughts have been occurring with increased frequency and bringing with them considerable losses due to its nature the best approach to monitoring and assessing droughts is in terms of stochastic theories as a consequence this study applied spi in the hydrological drought detection and examine interpret drought related phenomena the 3 month spi is used to decide the drought development and terminate phases based on the coincidence of hydrological drought and anomalies in precipitation four primary characteristics were determined to clarify the descriptions of drought magnitude and occurrence duration deficit occurrence time and recurrence year a stochastic process of drought is established to take account these characteristics using the copula function and a poisson process as well as non stationarity case study on the shihmen and zengwen reservoir watersheds in taiwan revealed that hydrological drought events often coincide with meteorological drought but some inconsistencies due to unusual hydrological hysteresis in rainfall and runoff our analysis raised several issues including the choice of drought identification parameters and spi time scale threshold which should take into account anthropogenic activity and hydrological characteristics a positive correlation between drought duration and drought deficit and a negative correlation between them and occurrence time were identified it was also observed that subsequent drought event may be more severe due to the partial recovery of hydrological condition in terms of non stationarity our results do not show strong evidence of long term trend for drought characteristics some limitations could be due to the percentile to percentile basis of copula this issue may need to be examined using non stationary copula analysis or time variant correlation covariance models in the end we demonstrated that this framework can apply in forecasting drought conditions and generating synthetic droughts for use in the formulation of water resources management strategies and the development of drought preparedness plans keywords drought identification spi streamflow copula poisson nonstationarity 1 introduction in recent decades droughts have been occurring with increased frequency and bringing with them economic social and environmental losses wilhite 2000 andreadis et al 2005 mishra and singh 2011 given the consequences and pervasiveness of droughts they are considered the costliest natural disaster in terms of the number of people they affect in the future drought is likely to have the most significant effect on global and local economies under climate change keyantash and dracup 2002 vasiliades et al 2011 the term drought refers to an abnormally low precipitation event recurring over a period of months or years shiau 2006 dai 2011 despite widespread attention from researchers there is still considerable disagreement as to the concept and definition of these climate events wilhite and glantz 1985 mishra and singh 2011 parry et al 2016 the problem of defining drought can be attributed to differences in the perspective of academics in different fields as well as differences in hydrological and anthropogenic conditions essentially the definition of drought tends to vary from one region to another and according to the perspective of the speaker overall the definitions of drought can be grouped into four categories meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic wilhite and glantz 1985 american meteorological society 2004 mishra and singh 2010 the meteorological definition of drought refers to a lack of precipitation in a given a region for a given period of time which is often preceded by above normal temperatures and often precedes other forms of drought mishra and singh 2010 dai 2011 the hydrological definition refers to a period of insufficient resources to meet the requirements established by a water resource management system wilhite 2000 mishra and singh 2010 in simpler terms it refers to the availability of water measured as stream flow aron and emmanuel 1982 smakhtin 2001 the agricultural definition of drought refers to a supply of water that is insufficient to sustain crops whereas a socioeconomic drought references the supply or demand for specific commodities in the economy these four types of drought can occur independently concurrently or sequentially ams 2004 researchers have formulated a number of indices for the characterization of drought each of which has particular strengths and weaknesses keyantash and dracup 2002 essentially a drought index is a prime variable used to assess the effects of a drought and define the underlying parameters the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 1968 and standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 are commonly used to describe drought from a meteorological perspective pdsi estimates are based on monthly precipitation temperature and the local availability of water and are extensively used in the united states mishra and singh 2010 jain et al 2015 spi estimates are based on long term precipitation records in which precipitation is quantified as a standardized departure from the climatological average and can be calculated for a variety of time scales in addition other indices which could be used to evaluate drought condition for example also include standardized streamflow index ssi standardized water level index swi standardized runoff index sri streamflow drought index sdi and etc due to its simplicity and convenience spi is more widely used throughout the world mishra and singh 2010 dai 2011 hydrologic drought analysis focuses on streamflow data and water availability dracup et al 1980 sen 1980 zelenhasić and salvai 1987 chang and stenson 1990 frick et al 1990 mohan and rangacharya 1991 clausen and pearson 1995 the simplest definition of hydrological drought is a deficit of water compared with normal conditions this approach proposed by yevjevich 1967 is known as the threshold level method or run method and many researchers have adopted this rationale dracup et al 1980 zelenhasić and salvai 1987 salas et al 2005 smakhtin 2001 and kao and govindaraju 2010 by this kind of methods the hydrological drought can be characterized by a duration severity and or average intensity however all assessments depend on what is the normal conditions we expected in other words researchers must determine the magnitude and or duration of the water deficit that would qualify as a drought therefore a key issue in applying the threshold level method i e an operational definition is characterizing the drought in terms of onset continuation and termination of that particular episode as well as its severity the threshold used most widely is the median or mean flow referring as normal conditions shiau et al 2007 salvadori and de michele 2015 tosunoglu and kisi 2016 parry et al 2016 besides zelenhasić and salvai 1987 used the run method with different percentile thresholds and found that the 95th and 90th percentiles were the most statistically accurate for the identification of droughts also some other studies adopted thresholds that involve a fixed probability percentile or a fraction of the mean which is specific to their perspective or application tallaksen et al 1997 demuth and kulls 1997 demuth and heinrich 1997 hisdal et al 2001 engeland et al 2004 fleig et al 2006 byzedi and saghafian 2010 in recent studies the threshold level method has been implemented using variable thresholds on daily seasonal and monthly scales hisdal et al 2004 kjeldsen et al 2000 threshold selection is usually an arbitrary matter however it should be linked to the effects in key economic sectors reflecting increasing levels of risk and vulnerability to drought recently parry et al 2016 proposed a systematic quantitative methodology aimed specifically at characterizing the various phases of hydrological drought this method identifies the development and termination phases of drought using predetermined parameters established by experts based on well known hydrological droughts on historical record in the current study drought termination is defined as a distinctive phase applicable to river flow records pertaining to catchments in the united kingdom uk their results provide an unprecedented historical perspective on hydrological droughts in the uk despite weaknesses in the selection of parameters the proposed drought identification method provides strong guidance for the determination of the spatial and temporal characteristics of drought drought is a multi scalar phenomenon mckee et al 1993 wherein the effects of precipitation deficits become evident in surface and subsurface hydrology systems at different temporal scales numerous studies have focused on individual drought categories few studies have analyzed the relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought nonetheless researchers have clearly demonstrated that the use of standardized indicators for meteorological and hydrological drought enables consistent characterization across components of the hydrological cycle lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 barker et al 2016 huang et al 2017 used the spi and the standardized streamflow index ssi to characterize meteorological and hydrological droughts in terms of propagation and correlation they found statistically positive linkages between meteorological and hydrological droughts on long term as well as short term time scales one fundamental advantage of spi is the fact that it can be computed for a variety of time scales when dealing with short term drought e g agricultural drought or long term drought e g hydrological drought mishra and singh 2010 determining an appropriate time scale for spi can be helpful for the identification of hydrological drought agnew 2000 bachmair et al 2016 zakhem and kattaa 2016 due to the stochastic nature of drought the best approach to monitoring and assessing these events is in terms of probability and stochastic theories shiau 2006 ayantobo et al 2018 researchers have made great strides in modeling various aspects of drought including the identification and prediction of duration and severity both of which must be considered in the design of water supply systems in univariate probabilistic analysis drought characteristics are investigated separately cancelliere and salas 2004 serinaldi et al 2009 however this kind of approach may not provide a comprehensive appraisal of droughts or account for significant correlations among different characteristics the copula method introduced by sklar in 1959 has been employed extensively in multivariate analysis due to its ability to overcome many of the drawbacks inherent to conventional methods salvadori and de michele 2015 zhang et al 2015 she et al 2016 salvadori and de michele 2015 provided a comprehensive review of the copula for drought analysis nonetheless most of those studies constructed 2 dimensional copulas with a focus on severity and duration relatively little research has been dedicated to the function of multidimensional copulas yang et al 2018 variation in drought characteristics due to climate change is a growing concern in drought analysis mishra and singh 2010 it is widely believed that climate change and human activities have increased the frequency of drought and its corresponding impact however it is necessary to determine whether these effects are due to hydrological factors or other considerations there is ongoing debate concerning the effects of climate change on the frequency and severity of drought many studies have focused on the meteorological factors e g temperature or precipitation often by downscaling the outputs of the atmosphere ocean general circulation models aogcms to model drought variables at local scales loukas et al 2007 ghosh and mujumdar 2007 loukas et al 2008 blenkinsop and fowler 2007 burke and brown 2010 dubrovsky et al 2009 burke and brown 2010 jenkins and warren 2015 schlaepfer et al 2017 nonetheless the reliability of aogcm projections remains an issue of debate lee and you 2013 the utilization of aogcms is limited by unrealistic in daily or weekly temporal resolution and biased in regional scale which could be problematic in drought analysis several studies have used large scale hydrological models to simulate surface water characteristics for drought analysis andreadis et al 2005 andreadis and lettenmaier 2006 shukla and wood 2008 sheffield and wood 2008 mishra et al 2009 however this approach is greatly limited by the capacity of the model in reasonably estimating hydrological variables an alternative is non stationary frequency analysis which is extended from stationary frequency analysis by assuming the same probability distribution functions under variation in time strupczewski et al 2001a b investigated the trends involved in first two moments of a probability distribution function in linear or parabolic form they performed maximum likelihood estimation ml and weighted least squares estimation wls to derive these trends chen et al 2017 reviewed many of the procedures related to the identification of statistical trends parametric or nonparametric and proposed a framework by which to examine the non stationarity of first and second moments based on the principles of identification of distribution and trends idt this study employed parametric wls estimation and non parametric discrete wavelet analysis dwt in conjunction with ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd for the identification of trends in annual maximum rainfall in this study we developed a drought analysis framework to examine and interpret drought related phenomena in which spi was used for parameter determination this integration made it possible to obtain robust values for the characteristics of drought this study also proposed a stochastic process of drought using the copula function and a poisson process while taking into account long term nonstationary analysis we demonstrated that this framework is able to applied in forecasting drought conditions and generating synthetic droughts for simulated water resource models 2 methodology our objective in this study was to develop a model framework in analysis of hydrological droughts as a stochastic process we quantified the characteristics of drought and used a poisson process and copula distribution for the interpretation of drought characteristics the proposed framework could be used to simulate the occurrence of droughts for planning purposes taking into account the non stationary nature of droughts under the effects of climate change fig 1 illustrates the proposed framework and each component is discussed individually below 2 1 drought identification this study focused on hydrological drought which can cause problems for water supply systems as indicated by low reservoir storage thus our first task was the identification of drought events within a time series this study adopted the statistical method proposed by parry et al 2016 in which the development and termination of drought is used to identify drought events based on flow data however we employed a more general method for the selection of parameters used in drought identification under the different hydrological conditions which may be encountered in the uk and taiwan based on the definition of drought proposed by parry et al 2016 the process of identifying a drought begins with the conversion of mean flow data into a percentage anomaly of the monthly long term average lta within a given reference period the transform function used as the threshold in defining drought is shown below 1 q anom t 100 q obs t q lta m 1 where t is the time step index m is the month of the time step qanom t is the streamflow anomaly percentage at time t and qobs t is the observed streamflow at t qlta m is the long term average in the mth month which is used as the truncation level to indicate the occurrence of a drought if the streamflow is lower than this average zelenhasić and salvai 1987 parry et al 2016 identified three parameters for use in the detection of drought based on historical data with prior expert knowledge on drought occurrence in the uk the parameters included d the number of months of below average flows required for the drought development phase to begin r the number of months of intermittent above average flows permitted within d and t the number of consecutive months of above average flow required for the end of the drought termination phase the phases of drought are shown in fig 2 the start of a drought development phase refers to the first month of d consecutive months for which q anom t is negative the end of the drought termination phase is the last month of t consecutive months for which q anom t is greater than 0 this definition permits streamflow above the average for brief periods of time less than t in order to account for minor wet interludes during drought development the values assigned to parameters d r and t vary according to location moreover the use of q lta m may be better suited to areas with stable hydrological conditions such as the uk in regions with obvious dry and wet periods droughts may only begin with low flow phases during the dry period but during the wet period even flow that is below the average should not cause too many problems due to the fact that streamflow is much higher than demand and storage facilities are probably able to mitigate the impact of these fluctuations under these conditions a constant truncation level over the year may be more appropriate for the identification of drought events in the current study we adopted a similar approach however we replaced q lta m in eq 1 with a fixed truncation level qτ for the entire time domain thus eq 1 is reformulated as follows 2 q anom t 100 q obs t q τ 1 based on this modification the truncation level is an important parameter which should be coordinated with d r and t for the identification of drought in the current study we incorporated rainfall related data with the spi in determining these parameters 3 parameter determination using spi the spi mckee et al 1993 is widely used to characterize meteorological drought on a range of time scales generally spi calculation is based on a long term average precipitation series for a specific period such as 1 3 6 or 12 months the spi quantifies observed precipitation as a standardized departure from a selected probability distribution function which is then transformed to standard normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 spi values can be interpreted as the standard deviation by which the observed anomaly deviates from the long term mean mckee et al 1993 clausen and pearson 1995 recent studies have used meteorological drought indices e g spi as indicators of hydrological drought and water resources variables e g soil moisture surface runoff and reservoir storage vicente serrano and lopez moreno 2005 edossa et al 2010 fiorillo and guadagno 2010 vicente serrano et al 2010 vasiliades et al 2011 in the current study spi was used in parameter selection for the detection of hydrological drought we applied 3 month spi to determine d r t and q τ for the definition of hydrological drought considering the current climate situation we believe that this approach better reflects shortages in inflow from the perspective of reservoirs parameter estimation was based the coincidence of hydrological drought and anomalies in precipitation criterion sn was used to judge the goodness of these matches as follows 3 d i 1 i f h i m i 0 e l s e s n i n d i n 100 where i is the yearly index hi is a boolean variable indicating that the hydrological drought occurred in a given year and mi is the counterpart of meteorological drought occurrence n refers to the total number of years included in the analysis using above formulation sn ranges from 0 to 100 where a higher value indicates that the selected parameter set led to better results 4 drought characteristics after identifying an instance of drought we quantify its characteristics with a focus on occurrence and severity the magnitude of drought is represented by two characteristics drought duration dur and drought deficit def the occurrence of drought was defined by the drought occurrence time in the current year oct and the drought recurrence year rty dur refers to the period in which the streamflow is below qτ def is the sum of qanom t throughout the period of drought oct indicates the time at which the drought occurred for the sake of simplification it is defined as the number of days from august 1st and the beginning of drought rty refers to the number of years that passed between two drought events these characteristics are presented in fig 3 4 1 stochastic drought processes this study developed a stochastic process for the interpretation of drought occurrence and severity in previous studies drought characteristics were generally described using independent univariate distributions a few studies employed the joint modeling of drought characteristics with higher dimensional correlation particularly that derived from streamflow data tosunoglu and kisi 2016 however there could be correlations among those characteristics bivariate joint distribution is one possible option however that approach is limited by the fact that the same family is required for each marginal distribution thus we adopted a more general copula process to describe a 3 dimensional joint multivariate distribution for the three continuous drought characteristics dur def and oct the drought recurrence year rty which is a discrete random variable was modeled using a well known poisson process based on an exponential distribution of recurrence intervals without incorporated in the copula since it not provides to much information but comes more technical problems 4 2 copulas a copula is a multivariate distribution function used to capture the degree of dependence between sets of variables without any restriction on the selection of distributions based on sklar s theorem 1959 any multivariate distribution can be fully characterized by its marginal i e univariate distribution function and a copula a copula function connects several univariate marginal distributions to a full multivariate distribution resulting in a joint distribution function for n dimensional continuous random variables x 1 x 2 x n with their marginal cumulative distribution function cdf f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n and the multivariate joint cdf is f x 1 x 2 x n u i f i x i i 1 ñ there exists one unique n copula c such that 4 f x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n c u 1 u 2 u n copula function c is used to model the degree of dependence between variables xi eq 4 is a joint cdf with the cdf of marginal distributions f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n similarly the joint density function f can be expressed as follows 5 f x 1 x 2 x n c u 1 u 2 u n i 1 n f i x i where f is the probably density function pdf of xi and c is the density function of copula c for the sake of simplification this study adopted a popular gaussian copula capable of preserving tractability and computational efficiency andersen and sidenius 2004 pitt et al 2006 the gaussian copula density function is expressed as follows 6 c u σ k 1 2 exp z t k 1 i z 2 where z is a vector of normal scores with the element z i φ 1 u i as mentioned uj is the value of cdf for xj φ is the cdf of the normalized gaussian distribution i is the n dimensional identity matrix and k is the correlation matrix note that the multivariate gaussian pdf is a special case where all margins are univariate gaussian in this case matrix k for the pearson correlation matrix covariance matrix is described as follows 7 k 1 ρ x 1 x 2 ρ x 1 x n ρ x 2 x 1 1 ρ x 2 x n ρ x n x 1 ρ x n x 2 1 where ρ x i x j is the pearson correlation coefficient for variables x i and x j however if the margins have a non gaussian distribution then ρ x i x j in matrix k is replaced by the linear correlation of two normal scores 8 ρ z i z j ρ φ 1 u i φ 1 u j constructing a 3 dimensional copula model based on three continuous drought characteristics i e dur def and oct makes it necessary to obtain the optimal continuous marginal distributions via fitting most previous works on drought analysis used two continuous distributions exponential and gamma a number of researchers have utilized an exponential distribution to fit drought duration and gamma distribution to fit drought severity zelenhasić and salvai 1987 loaiciga and leipnik 1996 salas et al 2005 shiau 2006 shiau et al 2007 shiau and modarres 2009 to make our results more generalizable we examined six marginal distribution candidates including normal log normal exponential gamma left skewed and right skewed gumbel the forms of the density functions used for these distributions are listed in table 1 the goodness of fit of these distributions was assessed in terms of three criteria bayesian information criterion bic and the kolmogorov smirnov test k s test selection of the optimal distribution was implemented using the following steps 1 eliminate candidate distributions in which the p value of the k s test is smaller than 0 1 2 compare the bic values of the filtered distributions and select the distribution with the lowest bic value besides we also calculated akaike information criterion aic as another reference 4 3 poisson process the poisson process is widely used to model the occurrence of events in time and space many researchers in the field of hydrology have utilized the poisson process for the quantitative analysis of drought and precipitation e g gupta and duckstein 1975 rodriguez iturbe et al 1984 cowpertwait 1998 abaurrea and cebrián 2002 yoo et al 2008 in this study the drought recurrence year rty was characterized using the poisson process the probability density function of the poisson distribution with a random variable x is expressed as follows 9 p x x λ t k k exp λ t where k is k factorial and parameter λ t refers to the shape of the distribution based on given state space t and the expected number of events 4 4 non stationarity in this study we also addressed the issue of non stationarity in hydrologic conditions we sought to obtain an appropriate representation of future drought conditions using an identification of distribution trend idt model in which probability distribution and a time trend in the first two statistical moments were used to account for climatic trends strupczewski et al 2001b you et al 2013 time dependent variations in the observed process are modeled as a linear or parabolic trend in the parameters of the probability distributions for example in a gamma distribution the nonstationary form can be expressed as follows 10 f x x t 1 β t α t γ α t x t α t 1 exp x t β t assuming the first and second order moments µ t and σ t can be interpreted as a polynomial function following 11 μ t c μ 2 t 2 c μ 1 t c μ 0 σ t c σ 2 t 2 c σ 1 t c σ 0 where c μ 2 c μ 1 c μ 0 c σ 2 c σ 1 and c σ 0 are the polynomial coefficients for the trend models of mean and standard deviation correspondingly parameters α t and β t in eq 10 can be expressed as a function of the first and second order moments as follows 12 α t μ t 2 σ t 2 β t σ t 2 μ t to determine the trends in μ t and σ t as well as the parameters in α t and β t we used the ml method to estimate time dependent parameters for drought properties strupczewski et al 2001b ml

taiwan taiwan lies across the tropic of cancer in east asia the climate there is strongly influenced by the east asian monsoon and pacific typhoons which produce an average annual rainfall of 2500 mm and close to 5000 mm in some regions in the east of the country northern and central taiwan have a humid subtropical climate whereas most of southern taiwan has a tropical monsoon climate the average monthly temperature ranges from 15 to 20 c in the winter and approximately 28 c in the summer precipitation in taiwan is influenced by the northeasterly monsoon during the cold season september to april and the southwesterly monsoon during the warm season may to august in the winter the northeast experiences steady rain whereas the central and southern parts of the island are mostly sunny most of the typhoons strike between july and october throughout the year the north south orientated central mountain range dominating the terrain of the island causes large spatial variations in climate due to orographic effects despite the abundance of precipitation much of the water shortage problem in taiwan is due to steep topography unequal spatial temporal distribution of rainfall and a high population density particularly during the dry season it can be difficult to satisfy the demand for water taiwan receives 60 of the annual rainfall between may and october whereas southern taiwan receives 90 over the same period taiwan depends heavily on reservoirs to regulate its water supply particularly in southern taiwan the ratio of rainfall in rainy season to dry season in northern taiwan is 6 4 and 9 1 in southern taiwan this distribution makes it difficult to effectively store and utilize water resources effectively in this study we investigated two of the most important reservoirs in taiwan shihmen and zengwen as shown in fig 4 shihmen reservoir is in the north of the island and zengwen is in the south this study utilized daily precipitation and 10 day inflow data in shihmen reservoir from 1965 to 2015 and zengwen reservoir from 1974 to 2017 shihmen reservoir supplies much of the demand for water in northern taiwan including irrigation and public demand in taoyuan county and parts of new taipei city the watershed area of the shihmen reservoir covers 763 4 km2 with effective storage of 1 97 108 m3 supplying approximately 4 6 108 m3 water resources agency 2019 for public demand when taking into account all water usage the ratio of water supply yield to reservoir capacity is between 4 and 5 this means that the shihmen reservoir must be accessed more than four times annually to satisfy the demand for water zengwen reservoir is the largest reservoir in taiwan supplying water primarily for irrigation and secondarily for municipal and industrial usage in the chiayi and tainan areas the watershed area of the zengwen reservoir is 481 km2 with effective storage of approximately 5 1 108 m3 the ratio of annual water supply to reservoir capacity is slightly greater than unity note that 90 of inflow is during the wet season and only 10 during the dry season water resources agency 2019 in this situation storage plays a more important role than does inflow in the operation of zengwen reservoir severe droughts often occur when insufficient water is available from the preceding wet season due to high agricultural demand in the spring 6 results and discussions 6 1 drought characteristics for each 10 day interval we converted average rainfall time series in the last 3 month period from daily precipitation data for the two reservoirs and then calculated the corresponding spi for this study area 1 or 2 month spi is obviously too short for the drought development but 6 month spi is too long since it could over the wet and dry season for this reason the 3 month spi was selected to identify instances of meteorological drought for shihmen reservoir we selected a threshold of 1 to capture moderate droughts based on the spi mckee et al 1993 for zengwen reservoir in the south of taiwan we selected a threshold of 1 25 to define the meteorological drought due to the drier climate and greater capacity of the reservoir the selection domains of the parameters were as follows d 8 to 15 r 0 to 3 t 1 to 4 and q anom t 40 to 90 we employed the exhaustive search algorithm esa to obtain the values for d r t and qr the optimal sets of the parameters for shihmen and zengwen reservoir are listed in table 2 the match score sn was 92 for shihmen reservoir and 81 3 for zengwen reservoir based on previous experience conducting drought analysis in taiwan we obtained a moderate value for d which represents a drought of sufficient duration to have a negative impact on agriculture a relatively short r caused by intermittent high flows temporarily eases drought conditions however it is insufficient for a complete recovery similar t as a critical condition to the end of drought moreover a larger threshold q anom t indicates how low the flow is which cause the drought our results revealed that the temporal indices were similar for both reservoirs d 10 indicates that nearly three months 100 days are required to initiate a drought r 2 and t 2 indicates that 20 days are required for recovery slight difference of qt 54 and 61 percentile respectively exists in shihmen and zengwen reservoir which shows how severe the inflow conditions are could cause drought the high capacity inflow ratio of zengwen reservoir means that a lower qt is required to reflect the situation of this reservoir parry et al 2016 reported that the selections made using the long term average tend to have higher number of drought events than those used in threshold based studies low flow thresholds have been widely used in other studies and a threshold level of q70 q90 is generally considered appropriate fleig et al 2006 in this study we obtained slightly higher inflow thresholds q54 and q64 due to the critical water supply associated with these two reservoir watersheds theoretically a higher threshold should increase the overall drought duration and extend the development and termination phases however due to high variability in the hydrological conditions in taiwan between dry and flood seasons multi year drought events are not usually the case this parametric set did not capture any droughts exceeding one year the uk study by parry et al 2016 set d at ten months r at one month and t at two months the moderately high value for d ensured that the model would be able to capture multi season and multi year droughts the relative short r was meant to find a balance between an unrealistically large number of events and none at all the hydrological variability of many catchments in the uk requires a value of t greater than one in order to account for wet interludes during droughts droughts in taiwan occur only during the dry season and end with the first typhoon therefore the value of d in this study is much lower a few weeks to a few months of normal inflow is generally sufficient for both taiwan and the uk to recover from drought however the streamflow variation in taiwan is far greater than in the uk therefore r and t are shorter parry et al 2016 used monthly intervals whereas we used 10 day intervals their selection of parameters r and t may have been due to lower temporal resolution as mentioned before the monthly time steps used in their study may have obscured indicators of drought termination or underestimated the speed at which drought terminated fig 5 shows the drought events identified using the parameter sets for shihmen and zengwen reservoirs the upper side of each figure shows normalized inflow where the red curve indicates the drought development phase and the blue curve indicates the period leading up to the drought termination phase drought development begins when streamflow drops below the threshold and ends at the time step of maximum negative drought termination is defined as the phase of a drought in which multiple consecutive time steps present inflow exceeding the threshold the lower side of fig 5 shows the rolling 3 month spi in 10 day intervals we found that some of the events identified by spi were missed using the method in this study for example the spi for shihmen reservoir in 1985 indicates a water deficit from the perspective of precipitation however our method gave no indication of the relatively low streamflow conditions that could lead to drought in the following year 1986 the low inflow conditions indicated the onset of drought but that observation did not correspond to a low spi in that period in that year while precipitation events occurred at the normal rate inflow was relatively low not as expected unusual hydrological hysteresis may account for this lack of consistency a similar situation was observed in zengwen reservoir in 1987 2005 and 2014 this raises questions with regard to spi time scale intervals and thresholds in drought detection which may be very influential in hydrological drought parametric sets we believe that the selection of spi time scales and or thresholds should account for anthropogenic activity as well hydrological characteristics in the study area in the case studies there is a very high demand for agricultural water use around 70 in this study we opted for a 3 month spi with the hope that this would be capable of capturing the anomalies that impact soil water conditions and agricultural production the spi thresholds of 1 and 1 25 in the current study respectively indicate 15 87 and 6 68 meteorological risk in areas with greater abundance of water resources and or lower demand a lower spi could be used to identify drought events 6 2 drought characteristics and univariate distributions after drought events are defined using the selected parameter sets the four primary characteristics dur def oct and rty can be determined for further analysis the correlations between the first three characteristics were simulated using the copula model which links multivariate distributions to their univariate marginal functions in this way the univariate distribution of drought duration dur drought deficit def and drought occurrence time oct can be derived from the six candidates listed in table 1 whereas recurrence year rty is derived according to the poisson distribution table 3 lists the results for the optimal univariate marginal functions pertaining to each drought characteristic three of the characteristics dur def and oct were all not rejected by the k s test for most distributions at a significance level of 10 in both reservoir watersheds drought duration dur did not pass fitting with the log normal distribution dur neither passed fitting with gamma distribution in shihmen reservoir nor the exponential distribution in zengwen reservoir in both watersheds drought deficit and occurrence time did not pass fitting with the exponential distribution note that the k s test is a general instrument designed to detect differences in the location as well as the shape of distributions based on the maximum absolute difference between the cumulative distribution functions exponential distribution was easily rejected by the k s test due to its limited freedom in terms of fitting a good fit of exponential distribution requires a small standard deviation from the mean with skewness around 2 log normal distribution is usually characterized in terms of the log transformed variable the logarithm of which is symmetric and normally distributed this is not always the case for time variables such as dur and oct however it would be a reasonable approach for def all of the distributions other than exponential and logarithmic presented interpretive capacity under these variables table 4 lists the distributions that best fit all of the variables basically these distributions are those with the lowest aic and bic values among those that were not rejected by the k s test it is interesting to note that the drought duration and water deficit in shihmen are both right skewed whereas those in zengwen are slightly left skewed and the occurrence time is the opposite this implies that droughts in shihmen watershed are slightly less severe i e there are fewer events of large duration and or large deficit note also that droughts in that area tend to occur later in the year a high proportion of the droughts in zengwen watershed are of greater severity and longer duration and they tend to occur earlier in the year these results can be explained by the fact that shihmen watershed has more stable inflow and less variability between the dry and wet seasons whereas zengwen watershed has unstable inflow and considerable variability between the dry and wet seasons thus the moderate streamflow fluctuations leave shihmen reservoir susceptible to drought throughout the entire dry period whereas zengwen is particularly susceptible to drought at the very beginning of the dry period moreover droughts in taiwan always end when the wet season begins i e with the coming of mei yu or the first typhoon the expected inverse relation between occurrence time and duration severity means that droughts that occur earlier are likely to be more severe and last longer the drought characteristics the recurrence year rty is interpreted through the poisson process we applied the chi square goodness of fit test chi square test to account for this discrete distribution our results show that rty is not rejected using the null in goodness of fit tests with poisson distribution our results also show that the droughts in shihmen reservoir are not as severe as those in than zengwen reservoir and occur less frequently this may be due to the nature of the droughts in the two watersheds or our selection of spi for drought identification 6 3 copula model correlations among drought characteristics can be evaluated in greater detail using the copula model in multivariate situations three continuous drought characteristics are transformed into standard normal distribution for the construction of a gaussian copula table 5 lists the correlation matrix used in the construction of the copula using original and standardized data as expected dur and def were positively correlated whereas both characteristics were negatively correlated with oct furthermore the non gaussianity of these variables is not particularly strong we did not observe a significant difference between the correlations derived before and after standardization although rty is not incorporated in copula model the correlation among rty and other characteristics were also calculated as additional information the correlation could almost be ignored in shihmen and not very significant in zengwen however it still can observe that rty is negatively correlated with dur and def and positively correlated with oct this implies subsequent drought event may be more serious in its severity comparing to that after normal of wet years it may be that the recovery of hydrological drought is not complete yet and influence the streamflow condition in coming year for the same reason the occurrence could a little bit earlier comparing to longer interval year rty among two drought events with the correlation matrix a gaussian copula can be constructed using marginal distributions parameterized separately from the dependence structure of the joint distribution the original data is better fitted a non gaussian distribution so marginal distribution should be transformed from a gaussian distribution back into its original best fitting model here we adopted the sampling method proposed by papoulis 1991 and duda et al 2012 to guarantee statistical similarity and significance this framework was used to simulate 5000 samples for each reservoir watershed as shown in fig 6 the results of which verified the efficacy of the our three parameter copula model for drought analysis 6 4 non stationarity analysis the proposed method was used to investigate non stationarity in accounting for the impact of climate change on drought characteristics table 6 lists the identified long term trend for each drought characteristic using the ml method and bic accordingly the trends identified in the parameters in the marginals of our copula model are also trend functions of time by a connection of mean and standard deviation fig 7 presents the non stationarity of drought characteristics presented by the time variant mean and standard deviation corresponding to historical data our analysis revealed only one characteristic presenting strong non stationarity the exception of drought deficit in zengwen it means the severity might increase in this area in coming future there was a linear increase in the standard deviation of occurrence time the occurrence time although not increase in its mean value in the future but the variability could increase in general the drought characteristics still not shows a strong evidence with obvious climate change impact in these two watersheds some clue for potential impact in the future could be sensed but need for further observation 6 5 synthetic droughts under non stationary scenarios using a copula model the fitted trend functions and copula model were used to synthesize future drought events under the impact of climate change two important components in this framework are the time variant marginal probability distribution and invariant copula correlation model this framework makes it possible to generate synthetic drought characteristics for use in elucidating future drought conditions to guide the formulation of an appropriate strategy fig 8 presents synthetic time variant drought characteristics from 2015 to 2050 overall the non stationary model proved effective in capturing patterns in non stationarity and could use to generate synthetic droughts based on the fitted trend function table 7 lists the drought characteristics in 2015 2030 and 2050 under non stationary scenarios we can see from these results that the mean and standard deviation of drought deficit in the shihmen reservoir watershed remained constant as well as drought duration the standard deviation of drought occurrence time increased from 42 17 days in 2015 to 58 63 days in 2050 which could be interpreted as 40 chance of droughts occurring two weeks earlier in 2050 drought duration in the zengwen reservoir did not change significantly either however the deficit is likely to be 30 greater in 2050 than in 2015 drought duration and deficit are both critical factors associated with the severity of droughts under the effects of climate change shihmen presented obvious changes in the temporal patterns of drought however it is likely that those effects could be mitigated by contrast zengwen reservoir is facing a reduction in the availability of water which would be difficult to mitigate these results indicate that water conservation efforts should focus on water quantity rather than allocation i e encouraging water conservation or developing new sources of water we also generated six groups 50 000 data points each group for four drought characteristics in 2015 2030 and 2030 the statistical properties of which are listed in table 8 it is not surprising that the statistical properties were consistent with the predefined marginal distribution synthetic simulations can be used to produce representative data which retains the statistical characteristics of historical events it is therefore possible to use synthetic hydrologic sequences to reproduce hydrologic features and generate variability sufficient to meet the requirements of water resource engineers the results of non stationarity analysis are also useful for local governments seeking to determine whether current policy pertaining to water supply will be applicable to future scenarios an issue we would like to discuss is that our study indicated the correlation among drought characteristics that dur and def are positively correlated with each other while these two characteristics are negatively correlated with oct nonetheless long term trends revealed an increase in def in zengwen watershed why does the corresponding characteristics dur not increase simultaneously with time neither oct decreases as well the copula quantifies the correlation structure between two marginal distributions on a percentile to percentile basis thus one variable is time variant but the structure does not change therefore the other variable can maintain its stationarity within this structure the complexity of time variant correlation in quantity or the trend relationship was beyond the scope of this study however it should be examined in the future 7 conclusions this paper presents a comprehensive framework for drought analysis including methods for the identification of drought characteristics and the derivation of stochastic process parameters as well as issues pertaining to correlation and non stationarity we first sought to clarify the definition of droughts as well as the phases of droughts based on four distinguishing characteristics spi was used to make the definitions more robust however the parameters and threshold in drought identification may influence the result but it could depend on the knowledge and understanding in the study area we defined four drought characteristics to clarify the descriptions of drought magnitude and occurrence duration deficit occurrence time and recurrence year we also took correlation and non stationarity into account in establishing a model by which to generate synthetic drought series to assist in forecasting and dealing with water management issues our case study on the shihmen and zengwen reservoir watersheds in taiwan revealed that hydrological drought events often coincide with meteorological drought but some inconsistencies due to unusual hydrological hysteresis in rainfall and runoff our analysis raised several issues including the choice of drought identification parameters and spi time scale threshold the important parameters included the length of the drought development phase the amount of intermittent above average flow and time at which the drought termination phase ends the selection of these parameters should take into account anthropogenic activity and hydrological characteristics in this study we used a slightly higher inflow threshold to account for the severe water supply difficulties associated with these two reservoir watersheds the correlations among drought characteristics are generally straightforward there is a positive correlation between drought duration and drought deficit and a negative correlation between these two characteristics and occurrence time this can no doubt be attributed to pronounced differences between dry and flood seasons in the study area droughts always end when the first typhoons come in june or july which means that when a drought occurs earlier it inevitably lasts longer and ends up being more severe on the other hand subsequent drought event may be more severe due to the partial recovery of hydrological condition in terms of non stationarity long term trends in deficiency were only observed in zengwen watershed note that only shihmen watershed presented a time dependent increase in the occurrence time changes in the temporal patterns of drought have been widely discussed in taiwan however our results show no evidence of this trend moreover the trends in drought duration deficit and occurance time in our case study correspond with historical data the increase of one characteristic due to the time variation does not lead to corresponding change of another one this is because the limitation of copula which quantifies the correlation between two marginal distributions on a percentile to percentile basis we suggest that future researchers examine this issue using non stationary copula analysis or time variant correlation covariance models to summarize the drought analysis framework presented in this study provides guidance in the interpretation and forecasting of drought characteristics the proposed method examines the relationships within or among meteorological hydrological and anthropogenic effects by examining the chronology of drought characteristics throughout river systems and hydrological cycles our findings could help to elucidate issues associated with droughts for use in the formulation of water resources management strategies and the development of drought preparedness plans in the study region credit authorship

5298,a novel approach of combining regionalization and satellite observations of various hydrological variables were employed to significantly improve prediction of streamflow signatures at geopolitically ungauged basins using the proposed step wise physiography and climate based regionalization approach the model performance at ungauged basins reached 80 of performance of locally calibrated parameters and significantly outperformed the global regionalization parameters the proposed water level based flow correlation was found to help diagnose models and outperform the existing performance metrics of simulated water levels at ungauged basins the study also set up the first multi national multi catchment hydrological model in the greater mekong region the top global biodiversity and major disaster risk hotspot in the world through sequential and iterative refinement of the existing global hydrological model new model setup or existing models in the poorly gauged and ungauged basins could benefit from the proposed approach to predict and evaluate models at ungauged basins keywords catchment model regionalization flow correlation satellite observations altimetry mekong 1 introduction adequate and reliable information about streamflows are imperative for effective management of water resources streamflow data are required for practical applications such as the design of drainage or water supply infrastructure as well as planning short term and long term water use with respect to changes of land use and climate however only a small fraction of catchments in any part of the world possess a stream gauge blöschl et al 2013 additionally the number of actively gauged stations has in recent years declined significantly due to reduced government funds for monitoring networks ad hoc group et al 2001 shiklomanov et al 2002 given the scarcity of operational gauging stations the availability of streamflow data is becoming increasingly limited in addition to the global trend of declining streamflow gauges accessing existing data is often more difficult in transboundary river catchments unfollowing the human defined political or administrative boundaries transboundary river basins account for roughly one half of the earth s land surface generate about 60 of the global freshwater flow and are home to nearly 40 of the world s population unep dhi unep 2016 at least one transboundary water body exists in almost every non island state in the world even if international agreements enabling data and information sharing among states exist in principle in practice data sharing is often complex in transboundary waters gerlak et al 2011 for example in the okavango river basin although there is agreement between namibia and botswana on sharing river flow data it is debated how to validate the accuracy of shared data turton et al 2003 or in the case of the jordan river basin where there are asymmetric power relations intentionally ambiguous mechanisms were designed by stronger states to allow no actual data exchange while diffusing domestic opposition fischhendler 2008 these transboundary river basins are thus considered as geopolitically ungauged where data observation networks may exist but data are unavailable for use due to geopolitical constraints kibler et al 2014 since streamflow observations are not available and accessible for all locations hydrological models often rely on regionalization approaches to transfer information from gauged to ungauged catchments see beck et al 2016 razavi and coulibaly 2012 blöschl et al 2013 parajka et al 2013 hrachowitz et al 2013 he et al 2011 for reviews there are different regionalization approaches with their respective advantages and limitations in general approaches that transfer calibrated parameter sets with respect to their climatic and physiographic similarity and or simultaneously calibrate multiple catchments with similar characteristics performed better than other approaches arheimer et al 2020 beck et al 2016 donnelly et al 2016 garambois et al 2015 kim and kaluarachchi 2008 parajka et al 2007 sellami et al 2014 nonetheless it is of question if this approach would work in the case of process based distributed hydrological models which inevitably have a large number of parameters process based distributed hydrological models which have parameters linked to physiography and or climate in the context of multi catchment modeling approach including both gauged and ungauged basins is a type of regionalization abbaspour et al 2015 arheimer et al 2020 donnelly et al 2016 hossain et al 2017 mohammed et al 2018 most of these studies used physiography linked parameter sets except the most recent study by arheimer et al 2020 that included similarity in climate characteristics among them the study by donnelly et al 2016 explicitly evaluated physiography linked parameter sets and concluded that they were useful for prediction at ungauged basins arheimer et al 2020 included climate linked parameter sets by assigning different potential evapotranspiration algorithms for catchments characterized according to köppen climate classification however it is questionable if the choice of climate regions based on köppen classification was optimal due to no explicit quantification of improvement in simulating streamflow the growing availability of spatially distributed remotely sensed data and open global data sources together with better computational capacity and advanced methods to assure better data quality has brought the possibility of macroscale hydrological modeling at the continental scale e g pechlivanidis and arheimer 2015 abbaspour et al 2015 donnelly et al 2016 and the global scale arheimer et al 2020 beck et al 2016 döll et al 2003 however it is known that global scale hydrological models do not always have satisfactory performance over all stations within their expansive domains constraining their application for management purposes furthermore the evaluation of model performance has been undertaken at gauged or pseudo gauged stations accordingly it is of question how to discern at which station model can satisfactorily capture the observed hydrological regimes an innovative approach to evaluate model at ungauged basins without using streamflow data is thus required while streamflow data are less available and accessible water level or stream stage data are more widely obtainable because there is less investment of people and equipment to measure them and increasingly more access and coverage of stage data derived from satellite altimetry become available okeowo et al 2017 lee et al 2009 water level observations either from in situ observations or derived from satellite altimetry have been increasingly used to calibrate hydrological models towards replacing streamflow information for poorly and ungauged basins getirana 2010 sun et al 2012 lindström 2016 jian et al 2017 and used innovatively to estimate important hydrological information for mekong river basin chang et al 2019 kim et al 2019 however the evaluation of hydrological models using the existing performance metrics based on water level only can yield inaccurate results due to inherent numerical problems lindström 2016 jian et al 2017 therefore it is vital to develop methods that more effectively utilize water level data where available for evaluation of model at ungauged basins as a surrogate for streamflow similar flow dynamics mean discharge relative flow variability and catchment response rates have been found between catchments having high spatial correlation of daily streamflow p 0 9 rather than catchments having spatial proximity archfield and vogel 2010 betterle et al 2017 betterle et al 2019 instead of using streamflow for ungauged catchments receptor water level observations can be used to find the most highly correlated gauged catchments donor this approach is named as water level based flow correlation in this study if a model can simulate similar correlation to the observed correlation patterns between gauged using streamflow and ungauged using water level it is hypothesized that performance of simulated ungauged catchments is as similar as gauged catchments it is thus worth exploring whether this hypothesis is valid accordingly the overarching goal of this work is to develop and test a new method of using satellite observations and regionalization to improve the prediction of streamflow at geopolitically ungauged basins using hydrological predictions for the environment hype semi distributed hydrological model lindström et al 2010 a first subcontinent scale hydrological model would be setup for the greater mekong region which is a global biodiversity and major disaster risk hotspot but poorly simulated in the existing global hydrological models constraining their use for pressing management purposes tordoff et al 2012 dilley et al 2005 du et al 2018 the region covers 13 river basins of which six international river basins make up 90 of total area passing the entire territory of vietnam laos cambodia and parts of china thailand and myanmar fig 1 the specific objectives of this work are to i examine how far a multi catchment hype model using global open data sources including satellite observations can predict flow signatures for gauged catchments in the region ii identify whether physiography and climate based regionalized parameters could improve prediction of streamflow signatures at ungauged catchments iii determine whether water level based flow correlation could help to evaluate model performance at ungauged catchments 2 data 2 1 input dataset for hype model the study used hype semi

region were added mohammed et al 2018 tang et al 2019 since different forcing datasets have different spatial resolutions table 1 the nearest grid approach was used to assign the characteristics to each sub catchment considering vietnam to be the country that needs to monitor water resources outside of the country given 60 of water is generated outside of the country world bank 2019 du et al 2016 any streamflow observations inside vietnam are named as gauged catchments used for calibration whereas the observations outside of vietnam where available are named as geopolitically ungauged catchments gauged but not used for calibration sources of the additional ground observations of streamflow water level and precipitation were supplemented by project partners to calibrate and validate

europe donnelly et al 2016 and across the globe arheimer et al 2020 the hype model code has been developed since 2005 with a flexible approach to start with simple process descriptions and further refine and increase complexity when necessary lindström et al 2005 bergström 1991 beven 2011 the model structure is based on a multi catchment approach allowing simultaneous modeling of multiple river basins with each river basin divided into multiple subbasins and each subbasin further divided into hydrologic response units hrus each hru can be divided vertically into three maximum distinct soil

provided to calculate snow melt evapotranspiration and infiltration according to the physical characteristics of the modeled catchments the runoff from the land classes is then routed through the network of rivers and lakes to generate river flow which could be dampened due to effect of lakes and reservoirs hype can also simulate the effect of floodplains which is crucial for large river systems and their deltas andersson et al 2017 and it can also simulate the transport and concentration of nutrients in both soil rivers and lakes lindström et al 2010 in addition to natural dynamics the model can simulate simplified water management schemes such as regulated reservoirs hydropower and irrigation there are several parameters used in hype that can be constrained in a stepwise manner using different types of observed data arheimer and lindström 2013 the parameters may be soil type dependent e g field capacity land cover dependent e g evapotranspiration coefficient or general across the domain e g river routing parameters parameters which are linked to physiography and or climate rather than to a specific catchment are thus assumed to be transferable to ungauged sites more details on the hype model including visual schematic diagram can be found in the web based documentation http www smhi net hype wiki and lindström et al 2010 the hype model has explicit lake routing including two types of lakes which are local lakes and outlet lakes local lakes which are located inside the subbasin only receive a portion of local surface runoff and then flows to main river of the same subbasin outlet lakes which are located near the main river receive both local runoff after it has passed local lakes and the river flow from upstream subbasins each lake can be set with an individually defined depth the outflow from lakes when water level is above a defined threshold can be either determined by a general rating curve or a specific rating curve the rating curve for a lake outlet is written as q k w w 0 p thus water level can be also seen as a transformation of streamflow w w o q k 1 p where q is the outflow or streamflow m3 s w is water level m w0 a threshold m k p are rate and exponent of rating curve parameters lindström 2016 when w0 is known w w 0 is equal to water depth lake water levels which are easier and cheaper to be measured are mainly used with the purpose of estimating streamflow through established rating curves meanwhile there are a lot of basins that have no observations of streamflow therefore lindström 2016 tested if hype can be calibrated using water level data instead of streamflow the study found that water levels could be useful for calibration of hydrological models without measuring streamflow by establishing a traditional rating curve but using a constant rating curve exponent his suggestion of using p 2 while adjusting k and w0 appropriately for all lakes resulted in a reasonable agreement with observed daily water level records based on the assumption of parabolic lake outlets which agreed with the previous study by maidment 1992 accordingly to integrate river elevation derived from envisat altimetry into hype modeled streamflow must be converted to water level using outlet lake routine from hype negligibly small outlet lakes which have inflow equal to outflow no storage capacity to affect streamflow were added in subbasin where there is either in situ observations of streamflow and water level or envisat derived river elevation to reduce uncertainty of estimating water depth in addition to constant p constant k 100 and w0 0 were used so equation 2 becomes w q 100 1 2 since the proposed method water level based flow correlation explained in section 3 3 emphasized the temporal dynamics rather than the true magnitude of a variable it was not necessary to estimate the exact water depth simulated w would be compared with either in situ observations of water level at geopolitically ungauged catchments or envisat derived water elevation at envisat ungauged catchments envisat ungauged catchments are catchments that have virtual stations of envisat derived water level but mostly have no observations of streamflow except 3 catchments that are located in geopolitically ungauged catchments table 2 3 2 grouping catchments using climatic indexes similar seasonal water balance patterns between catchments which could be explored based on three climatic indices alone i e climatic aridity timing of seasonal precipitation and a temperature based measure of snowiness was found to provide a useful backdrop to the signatures of streamflow variability over various time scales daily to decadal and states low flow to floods berghuijs et al 2014 this study applied berghuijs et al 2014 s approach to robustly group catchments based on their similarity in climatic characteristics accordingly two dimensionless indices that account for similar water balances among catchments were calculated namely the aridity index and the seasonality index snowiness is not considered in this study since there is almost no snow impact in the study area proposed by budyko 1974 the aridity index is defined as φ e p where e is the average potential evaporation rate mm day and p is the average precipitation rate mm day this average is calculated from 2002 to 2009 the same time period used to calibrate the model φ can range from 0 to infinity in theory with higher values associated with more arid climate here it is assumed that the seasonal variability of precipitation and air temperature can be modeled as simple sine curves milly 1994 potter et al 2005 woods 2009 as follows p t p 1 δ p sin 2 π t s p τ p t t t δ t s i n 2 π t s t τ t where t is the time days s is a phase shift days τ is the duration of the cycle under consideration here 365 days p is the average precipitation mm day t is the average temperature c day over same period 2002 2009 δ p and δ t are dimensionless seasonal amplitudes and the subscripts p and t stand for precipitation mm day and temperature c day respectively p t is the precipitation rate mm day and t t is temperature c day as a function of t using a least squares optimization δ p and δ t were obtained for all individual 1120 catchments in the hype study domain then the seasonality index δ p was calculated using woods 2009 δ p δ p s g n δ t c o s 2 π s p s t τ where δ p indicates whether precipitation is in phase with the potential evaporation and temperature regimes the parameter δ p can range from 1 to 1 with the former representing strongly winter dominant precipitation p out of phase with t and the latter showing strongly summer dominant precipitation p in phase with t δ p 0 indicates the uniform precipitation throughout the year 3 3 water level based flow correlation between gauged and ungauged catchments a measured correlation matrix pearson s r correlation coefficient between daily in situ water level of geopolitically ungauged catchments and daily streamflow of gauged catchments was calculated to find the most highly correlated reference gauged catchments to the study ungauged catchments similarly a measured correlation matrix between envisat derived water level of ungauged catchments outside of vietnam and the daily streamflow of gauged catchments was also computed to examine the assumption that the correlation between two daily streamflow series was similar to water level based flow correlation between daily water level either in situ observations of water level or envisat derived water level and streamflow a corresponding correlation matrix between daily streamflow of geopolitically ungauged catchments and daily streamflow of gauged catchments was made from previous studies on flow correlation correlation coefficients larger than 0 9 were recommended to consider as being highly correlated catchments archfield and vogel 2010 betterle et al 2019 because there were less catchments considered in the study r 0 7 was selected as the threshold correlation coefficient because r was smaller in the study only catchments in the same climatic group section 3 2 were examined to ensure they have similar climate characteristics 3 4 step wise physiography and climate based regionalization at gauged basins for data sparse regions step wise calibration approach was shown to be a useful method to reduce the problem of equifinality of the final model output andersson et al 2017 donnelly et al 2016 arheimer and lindström 2013 strömqvist et al 2012 at each key process lumped calibration was carried out simultaneously for sub groups of gauged basins representative gauged basins rgbs with upstream areas dominated by a specific land use or soil type when calibration for a specific group of rgbs is deemed satisfactory the parameters for that responding land use or soil type can be kept constant and the next parameters for another group can be calibrated using another set of rgbs the step wise separation followed the hydrological pathways through the landscape starting with climate inputs precipitation evapotranspiration then subsequently moving downstream to soils infiltration storage runoff then the rivers and lakes routing and storage after each step evaluation of model performance was undertaken for all 19 gauged stations and the best performance parameter set was used in the next step of the model refinement the period 2002 2009 was selected as the calibrated period to analyze errors and refine the model this period was chosen because it aligned with the availability of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis derived potential evapotranspiration pet and envisat derived water level the earlier part of the simulation period 1991 2001 was retained for independent validation at the same stations a key objective in calibrating the greater mekong hype model was to represent the main hydrological processes of all river basins therefore model evaluation and refinements primarily focused on achieving satisfactory performance across the whole basin using consistent descriptions rather than excellent performance at few locations the streamflow signatures to be evaluated in the study were the daily and monthly specific streamflow mm day and mm month high flow 5th percentile of daily specific flow in mm day low flow 95th percentile of daily specific flow in mm day and medium flow 50th percentile of daily specific flow in mm day these signatures were selected because they are the most important and widely used signatures of catchment runoff response to be applied in water resources planning and environmental studies arheimer et al 2020 donnelly et al 2016 table 3 the entire domain scale performance was quantified by first calculating key performance criteria for each of the above flow signatures at each of the 19 streamflow gauges available inside vietnam fig 1 and then computing summary statistics to describe model performance across all locations the model s ability to simulate daily and monthly streamflow at each gauge was quantified with standard metrics including the kling gupta efficiency kge and its components r β α which are directly linked with pearson s correlation coefficient relative error re and relative error of standard deviation resd variability ratio respectively gupta et al 2009 table 4 for constraining pet parameter values absolute value of re was used to find the best agreements between modeled pet and modis derived pet both automatic and manual calibration approach were employed to take advantage of strengths of both methods the advantage of the former is power and speed of computation and objective parameter constraints nevertheless it is unlikely to provide physically acceptable parameter estimates which are mostly addressed by highly labor intensive manual calibration boyle et al 2000 the automatic approach was the differential evolution markov chain demc method ter braak 2006 demc allowed to examine parameter sensitivity probability based uncertainty estimate and a better convergence towards the global optimum two step demc automatic calibration was undertaken firstly short runs around 400 iterations were done to examine parameter sensitivity secondly longer runs with at least 1000 iterations were undertaken for only sensitive parameters to allow convergence to global optimum values demc automation was then followed by manual checks to ensure the physically acceptable parameter ranges and simulated hydrograph similar to the observed patterns table 5 describes the model parameters to be calibrated and lists the initial parameter values for each parameter other parameters were kept as default as the baseline parameters from the first greater mekong hype model version gm hype v1 the same roughly calibrated parameter sets of the first world wide hype model version 1 0 wwh v1 0 arheimer et al 2020 step wise physiography and climate based regionalization framework for estimating different groups of model parameter values in each step were as follows 1 for precipitation and temperature different datasets of precipitation and temperature were used with the baseline parameters from wwh v1 0 roughly calibrated model at global scale without undertaking any additional calibration to identify the optimal climate forcing datasets for the region daily kge was used to evaluate this step this model step after selecting the optimal climate data was named as the greater mekong hype model version 1 0 gm hype v1 0 2 pet parameter values lb kc5 alb see table 5 for description of parameter values were constrained using the absolute value of re between annually simulated pet and modis derived pet pet algorithm selected in the study was food and agriculture organization fao penman monteith which was integrated inside the hype model allen et al 1998 monteith 1965 this algorithm was selected so that it was more comparable to modis based pet which was also based on penman monteith logic mu et al 2011 two step demc automatic calibration was undertaken to obtain the optimal values for each rgb of each land cover type 10 main land cover types were grouped from 36 european space agency esa climate change initiative cci v1 6 data see details of land cover description and grouping in arheimer et al 2020 thirdly manual checks of parameter values for each group were made to ensure their acceptable physical meaning this model step after selecting optimal parameter values was named as the greater mekong hype model version 1 1 gm hype v1 1 3 parameters related to soil storage flow paths and runoff generation 19 parameters provided in table 5 were first optimally tuned by two step demc calibration with daily kge used as the objective function because all gauged and ungauged basins were mainly vegetated areas only parameters for vegetated soils were calibrated the remaining parameters were kept as default following automatic calibration manual check was done to examine the physical meaning of parameters and hydrograph simulation of other signatures daily streamflow q95 q5 and q50 this model step after selecting the optimal parameter values was named as the greater mekong hype model version 1 2 gm hype v1 2 4 each catchment group section 3 2 was evaluated separately and calibrated using regional correction parameters cevpcorr rrcscorr see table 5 for description of parameter values hundecha et al 2016 two step demc with daily kge as the objective function and manual checks were done for all flow signatures daily streamflow q95 q5 and q50 this model step after selecting the optimal regional correction parameter values was named as the greater mekong hype model version 1 3 gm hype v1 3 3 5 performance of regionalized parameters at ungauged basins the performance of physiography and climate based regionalized parameters was assessed with the following approach at 12 geopolitically ungauged to be used for independent evaluation fig 3 kge re for daily streamflow re for q95 q5 q50 were obtained by using the following sets of parameters 1 step wise physiography and climate based regionalization parameters transfer from gauged catchments par gm hype v1 3 section 3 4 2 global regionalization parameters from the wwh v1 3 arheimer et al 2020 this parameter set was forced with the same climate data as the wwh v1 3 model hydrogfd precipitation and temperature 3 locally calibrated parameters in the ideal situation where observed streamflow were available for calibration step one to three of section 3 4 without manual calibration so that selected parameters can be objective the performance metrics from the three parameter sets were compared to address research objective 2 section 1 if the proposed regionalization method could help improve prediction of streamflow signatures at ungauged basins 3 6 model evaluation at ungauged basins using water level based flow correlation at 12 geopolitically ungauged and 17 envisat ungauged catchments which were assumed to have no observations of streamflow but only water level different performance metrics were used to examine if water levels can be modelled with a satisfactory level of performance water levels e g modeled in situ altimetry derived are water heights that include both water depths and mean heights of river beds with respect to different vertical references mean heights of river beds however are mostly unknown unless being surveyed with large financial resources and manpower or estimated with high uncertainty although pearson s correlation coefficient can capture temporal variation between modeled and recorded water levels it could not evaluate the bias errors between them thus different performance metrics have been developed to remove this bias instead of estimating differences between observed and modeled variables getirana 2010 proposed nash sutcliffe efficiency for anomalies nseanom which is a modified nse metrics to to calculate the differences between their anomalies similarly lindström 2016 introduced nash sutcliffe efficiency adjusted for bias nsew to eliminate the bias between them table 4 nevertheless due to numerical problems these modified formulations can yield inaccurate results because modeled water levels without unknown mean heights of river beds are within ranges of few meters whereas recorded water levels are within several hundred meters above sea levels lindström 2016 therefore in practice it is recommended to evaluate water depths however in ungauged or geopolitically ungauged basins in situ data are scare accordingly this study proposed applying hydrologic similarity theory betterle et al 2017 archfield and vogel 2010 by assuming that the most highly correlated reference gauged catchments using daily streamflow also have similar performance to that of the study ungauged catchments using water level to use this method first the modeled water levels of the ungauged catchments were evaluated against recorded water levels using pearson s correlation coefficient nseanom and nsew for in situ water levels evaluation was undertaken at both daily and monthly time steps for envisat derived water levels evaluation was performed at any day step that has recorded data one daily observation every 35 days nseanom and nsew were used only to examine if numerical problems of evaluating models based on water levels existed when only modeled water level had good correlation with recorded water level r 0 7 following steps were undertaken this condition ensured that the temporal variation of modeled water levels against observations was captured secondly the modeled correlation between modeled water levels of the ungauged catchments and modeled streamflow of the reference most highly correlated catchments was computed if there was similar result between modeled correlation and measured correlation modeled correlation can range from 0 5 to 0 9 compared to measured correlation performance of reference gauged catchment was assumed to be the performance of ungauged catchment to cross validate this assumption performance of ungauged catchments against the historical observations of streamflow where available was evaluated and compared with the assumption fig 4 4 results 4 1 catchment delineation and characteristics the world hydrological input set up tool whist developed by smhi swedish meteorological and hydrological institute developer of hype model was used to delineate catchment borders arheimer et al 2020 consistent with the wwh v1 3 catchment delineation was defined using the same approach according to the locations of gauging stations in the river network including 19 gauged stations and 12 geopolitically ungauged the outlets of large lakes reservoirs and seeking to reach an average catchment size of 1 000 km2 arheimer et al 2020 as a result the greater mekong region 1 2 million km2 was divided into 1 120 sub catchments with an average size of 1 047 km2 sub catchments within low lying areas with extensive floodplains tended to have a larger size average 3 600 km2 among which the tonlesap basin had the largest size of 10 000 km2 the outputs of catchment delineation were quality checked with station metadata obtained from governmental reports 100 of the estimated catchment areas were found to fall within 5 of the areas reported by these metadata for lakes and reservoirs in total 15 lakes and 18 reservoirs only lakes and reservoirs larger than 10 km2 recorded by glwd and grand were considered in this version were identified similar to wwh v1 3 hrus represented a combination of land cover characteristics and elevation resulting in 169 hrus details of hrus can be found in arheimer et al 2020 different hydrological active soil depths were assigned for the hrus based on the variability in vegetation and elevation they represented as suggested by troch et al 2009 and gao et al 2014 and currently used in wwh v1 3 arheimer et al 2020 similar to wwh v1 3 detailed description of soil properties was not included in hype model to reduce number of parameters nevertheless five general distinct soil classes including i no soil water ii urban soil iii rock no texture iv vegetated soil and v irrigated soil based on impermeable conditions and infiltration of land covers were identified to describe the hydrological processes in the region 4 2 grouping catchments using climatic indexes across all 1 120 catchments and during the 2002 to 2009 study period the aridity index ranged from 0 4 to 1 7 whereas seasonality index ranges from 0 3 to 1 accordingly consistent with berghuijs et al 2014 four catchment groups were made including group 1 humidity φ 0 75 with mild seasonality δ p 0 5 group 2 humidity φ 0 75 with high seasonality δ p 0 5 group 3 sub humidity φ 0 75 with mild seasonality δ p 0 5 and group 4 sub humidity φ 0 75 with high seasonality δ p 0 5 table 6 fig 5 shows the geographic spread and organization of four catchment groups obtained from this classification approach see figure supplementary 2 for spatial distribution of all catchments based on group classification most catchments having historical streamflow observations both gauged and ungauged were classified as group 3 or group 4 catchments of group 1 were mostly located near the coastal area with stronger humidity and more wet season dominant precipitation catchments of group 3 were located mostly in the southwest of the region with less humidity and less seasonal water variability catchments of group 4 were located mostly in the northwest of the region with less humidity and more dry season dominant precipitation grouping catchments using climatic indexes could provide a robust reference to further regionalize parameters for each climate group this study adapted a simple regional calibration approach following hundecha et al 2016 after step wise calibration of the model for all catchments we evaluated the model for each catchment group to find out which signatures need to be refined and then performed regional calibration separately by using group specific correction parameters it should be noted that only catchment group 1 3 and 4 could be calibrated and validated whereas catchment group 2 had no validation because there were no gauged stations for this group 4 3 water level based flow correlation between gauged and ungauged catchments fig 6 validates the assumption that water level based flow correlation using daily observed in situ water levels and streamflow had similar results to the correlation using both daily observed streamflow observations in the case of envisat derived water levels because there were less observations one daily observation every 35 days the correlation coefficient became slightly smaller but the difference was negligible accordingly for the geopolitically ungauged and envisat ungauged catchments in catchment group 3 talai g18 was found to be the reference most highly correlated gauged catchment for the geopolitically ungauged and envisat ungauged catchments in catchment group 4 laocai g2 laichau g4 yenbai g6 xala g9 were the reference most highly correlated gauged catchments 4 4 step wise physiography and climate based regionalization at gauged basins 4 4 1 baseline model performance gm hype v1 0 six sets of precipitation and temperature data were used to identify the most appropriate climate inputs for the model among them hydrogfd had the coarsest resolution 0 5 grid whereas mswep trmm and ncep were gridded at had 0 25 resolution there were 176 in situ precipitation stations to examine the quality of different climate data inputs of the model the period 2000 2006 was selected to examine their correlation as it was the period that all datasets were available in terms of magnitudes it was found that hydrogfd and trmm precipitation datasets overestimated during wet months 5 and 7 respectively and underestimated during dry months 13 and 5 respectively compared to the in situ precipitation resulting in weaker correlation with in situ precipitation 0 65 and 0 53 respectively table 7 mswep had smaller bias less than 1 for the entire year and stronger correlation with in situ precipitation there was unfortunately no in situ temperature dataset to compare with hydrogfd and ncep monthly average temperature from hydrogfd was larger than monthly average ncep fig 7 using the initial default parameter set wwh v1 0 with different sets of climate data no significant difference in model performance was found between them any temperature dataset combined with the same precipitation dataset resulted in almost similar performance among the precipitation datasets mswep led to the highest model performance followed by hydrogfd and trmm since the mswep precipitation and ncep temperature datasets had better resolution both at 0 25 this set of forcing data was selected as the climate input data to be used for the baseline model gm hype v1 0 table 8 4 4 2 refining potential evapotranspiration gm hype v1 1 evaporation is a significantly important process in all river basins in vietnam accounting for around 50 of precipitation on average nguyen 2005 given the importance of evaporation in the region and large errors of streamflow variability in many locations of the baseline model calibration was undertaken to estimate pet the upper limit of evaporation in the model among three pet related parameters land use dependent parameter kc5 was found to be sensitive the posterior kc5 was found to reduce relative volumetric errors re between modeled pet and modis derived pet by 40 compared to initial kc5 value table 5 with this posterior kc5 values model performance for all flow signatures significantly improved over all stations particularly for kge from 0 3 to 0 47 for daily streamflow in this model version nevertheless low flows were significantly underestimated while high flow were overestimated requiring refinement of the soil storage and flow paths process fig 8 4 4 3 refining soil storage and flow paths gm hype v1 2 the gm hype v1 1 model displayed a quick and peaky response of streamflow to rainfall events resulting in the underestimation of low flows and the overestimation of high flows fig 9 demc automation found the sensitive parameters that needed to be calibrated they were parameters governing the soil porosities wcep1 wcep2 wcep3 percolation mperc2 subsurface runoff and surface runoff macrate mactrinf mactrsm rrcs2 parameters of the gm hype v1 1 model represented significantly little soil storage and high recession coefficients therefore soil related parameters were adjusted to increase soil storage capacity more infiltration and lower recession coefficients for subsurface runoff in addition runoff components horton overland flow dunne overland flow subsurface flow for different soil classes were unreasonable compared to dunne theory dunne 1978 li et al 2014 accordingly srrcs dunne overland flow related parameter and srrate horton overland flow related parameter were manually calibrated so that horton overland flow dominated in urban and bare soil class whereas subsurface runoff and dunne overland flow dominated in vegetated soil class refining these descriptions helped to maintain physical meaning of parameters while significantly improving overall simulated flow signatures for all gauged catchments during both the calibration and validation period for instance for the calibration period compared to the gm hype v1 1 model the kge for daily streamflow improved from 0 47 to 0 7 on the other hand volumetric errors of low flows significantly reduced to 27 from 95 and high flow from 35 to 1 7 fig 8 4 4 4 refining seasonal water balances among catchment groups gm hype v1 3 the model gm hype v1 2 had an overall satisfactory performance for both daily and monthly streamflow time series in both the calibration and validation periods kge for daily streamflow was above 0 5 however the low flow signature q95 was underestimated for few stations in the model gm hype v1 2 the global physiography based parameters which were based on soil and land cover characteristics of catchments were used for all catchments evaluating the model gm hype v1 2 for each catchment group only 3 groups having gauged stations the global physiography based parameters were more suitable for catchment group 3 whereas low flow signatures for both catchment groups 1 and 4 were still underestimated fig 10 catchment group 1 with humidity and mild seasonality has more wet season dominant storage variation whereas catchment group 4 with sub humidity and high seasonality has more dry season dominant storage variation berghuijs et al 2014 accordingly various correction factors evapotranspiration and recession coefficients were used to simultaneously consider the variety of climate characteristics between catchments hundecha et al 2016 in a trial and error the correction factor for the soil recession coefficient rrcscorr has resulted in improvement for the low flow signatures for group 1 and group 4 for both calibration and validation periods whereas other parameter cevpcorr did not result in any improvement 4 5 performance of regionalized parameters at ungauged basins table 9 summarizes the performance in terms of kge re for daily streamflow re for q5 q95 q50 obtained in 12 geopolitically ungauged evaluation catchments using physiography based regionalized parameters par gm hype v1 2 physiography and climate based regionalized parameter sets from gauged catchments par gm hype v1 3 global regionalization parameter sets par wwh v1 3 and locally calibrated parameter sets similar to arheimer et al 2020 although global regionalization parameters could characterize spatial variability of flow signatures across the globe they had difficulties in capturing low flows particularly in tropical catchments the difference between physiography based regionalized parameters and physiography and climate based regionalized parameters was not significant nevertheless the later could significantly reduce volumetric errors of low flow because only one extra parameter was used in the wwh v1 3 compared to previous model version compared to locally calibrated parameters physiography and climate based regionalized parameters reached nearly 80 in terms of kge for daily streamflow and was even a slightly better in terms of volumetric errors for low flow medium and high flow fig 11 shows performance of daily simulated streamflow of all catchments in terms of kge compared to their historical observations of streamflow during validation period 1991 2001 for two model versions including baseline gm hype v1 0 and final gm hype v1 3 the catchments presented in fig 11 include both gauged catchments located inside black vietnamese boundary and geopolitically ungauged catchments located outside of black vietnamese boundary most of simulated catchments using the final model version have better captured hydrological processes of the region resulting in a substantial improvement mostly blue dots in fig 11b in both model versions streamflow in lang son located in bang giang ky cung basin northeast of vietnam the only yellow dot in fig 11b was not well simulated the reason could be the underrepresented spatial variation of precipitation in the catchment owing to the its small size the smallest size 1 500 km2 in all evaluated catchments in the study future research could be further improved by using the average of the nearest precipitation grids or higher resolution precipitation datasets like nasa global precipitation measure integrated multi satellite retrievals with 0 1 resolution gpm imergf v6 le et al 2020 4 6 model evaluation at ungauged basins using water level based flow correlation to evaluate the performance of model at ungauged catchments that have observed water levels evaluation framework using water level based flow correlation fig 4 and existing performance metrics of simulated water levels was used this section applied the framework and performance metrics for both baseline and final model versions to examine if this method and or performance metrics can work for both scenarios fig 12 and fig 13 accordingly firstly the daily and or monthly simulated water levels were evaluated against the recorded water levels using the existing performance metrics for simulated water levels including pearson s correlation coefficients nseanom and nsew from fig 12 and fig 13 conflicting performance results of simulated water levels compared to observed water levels were found in any row of both figures inconsistent colors between r nseanom and nsew for simulated water levels especially for envisat derived water level were shown for example from fig 12d at eu 107 station pearson s correlation coefficient dark blue color good result showed that simulated water level had good temporal correlation with observed water levels nseanom blue color acceptable result informed that they had acceptable magnitude bias nsew orange color bad result advised that they had significantly high magnitude bias comparing simulated streamflow of this station with observed streamflow blue color of kge acceptable result the model was found to simulate daily flow at acceptable level but could not capture high flows light purple color of q5 overestimated and low flows yellow color of q95 highly underestimated this finding confirmed previous studies that model performance based on only water levels could yield inaccurate results in modelling streamflow signatures lindström 2016 jian et al 2017 additionally unlike water levels that have limited performance metrics and derived hydrological signatures there is a high variety of performance metrics to evaluate various signatures of streamflow that could help diagnose model problems and inform where to improve for example kge metric can inform whether temporal pattern or variation or magnitude of daily flow is not good gupta et al 2009 whereas relative volumetric errors of flow signatures from flow duration curve high low and medium can inform which part of runoff surface or subsurface runoff is not well represented yokoo and sivapalan 2011 accordingly it raised a question how to have extra important model diagnostic information if only observations of water levels are available water level based flow correlation was found to possibly address the above question using water level based flow correlation evaluation framework firstly temporal patterns of simulated water levels were examined against observations using correlation coefficients which were all above 0 7 for both model versions fig 12 fig 13 secondly modeled correlation between simulated water levels of ungauged catchments and simulated streamflow of gauged catchments were compared against measured correlation between observed water levels of ungauged catchments and observed streamflow of gauged catchments the difference between them was within 0 2 for both model versions thus the performance of ungauged catchments was similar to the performance of the most highly correlated gauged catchments see figure supplementary 4 accordingly in both baseline and final model versions performance of ungauged catchments were similar to performance of the most highly correlated gauged catchments for all flow signatures it was then validated with any ungauged catchments that have historical observed streamflow to cross validate the hypothesis consistent results were found for all flow signatures between the reference most highly correlated gauged catchments and ungauged catchments having observed streamflow where available for cross validation to accept the hypothesis for catchments having only envisat derived water level without observed streamflow its performance cannot be validated nevertheless since this method worked for both in situ water levels and 3 catchments having both envisat derived water level and observed streamflow performance of the remaining 14 catchments with envisat derived water level could be evaluated using the reference most highly correlated gauged catchments accordingly it showed that water level based flow correlation method could be used to evaluate the model performance at ungauged catchments having only observations of water levels furthermore compared to previous studies that used water levels to evaluate model performance this approach can not only overcome numerical problems of existing performance metrics for water levels but also provide important model diagnostic information on how to improve model performance without streamflow observations 5 discussion 5 1 step wise physiography and climate based regionalization at gauged basins catchment models are important tools to support decision makers in sustainable planning of water resources the greater mekong region is the top global biodiversity hotspot but increasingly facing urgent socio economic development and climate change impacts accordingly it is imperative to have a multi national and multi catchment model to support river basin authorities it could thus help predict river flows across administrative borders and allocate water resources among water users in a harmonized manner for the first time a multi national and multi catchment greater mekong hype was set up in this important region the analysis of the final model gm hype v1 3 version kge of daily and monthly streamflow is 0 7 and 0 8 respectively shows that the model is useful for water authorities in managing water related issues the model has been setup on the foundation of the world wide hype model and successfully refined to capture the hydrological processes for the region it shows that global hydrological model in this case the world wide hype model could be a useful starting point as a time saving alternative for other regions to further refine it with local expert knowledge so that it could be useful in supporting decision makers for water management additionally further refining an existing model would allow critical knowledge and experiences shared between research groups and practitioners thus increasing full transparency in the research process further understanding of general hydrological patterns process and functions between catchments it can thus ultimately advance hydrological sciences toward a unified theory of hydrology at catchment scale sivapalan 2005 and better predict flow signatures at ungauged basins blöschl et al 2013 the approach of sequentially and iteratively both automatically and manually refining inadequately described hydrological processes together with local knowledge can substantially improve the appropriateness of model application in a new region calibration is inevitable in process based distributed model because of impossibility to measure all required model parameters at the model simulation scale beven 1989 blöschl and sivapalan 1995 this study combined both automatic and manual calibration to combine the strengths of both methods to achieve more physically acceptable parameters at a timely efficient manner at each step in hydrological processes the study area has various seasonal water variability due to its substantial precipitation and evaporation variability from tropical monsoon effect therefore using climatic indexes aridity index and seasonality index is a useful approach to group catchments so that all catchments can be simulated in the same modeling domain adding one simple step step 4 in the step wise calibration approach in section 3 4 into the common step wise physiography based parameters helped reduce the underestimation of low flow of two catchment groups in this study simple regionalized parameter approach correction parameters were used more substantial model improvement could be made if other regionalization approaches could be employed such as linear parameter estimation based on catchment descriptors hundecha et al 2016 future studies could examine this hypothesis 5 2 performance of regionalized parameters at ungauged basins hype with physiography and climate based regionalized parameters appears to perform as good as locally calibrated parameters and outperform global regionalization parameters in all flow signatures this result confirms findings of the previous studies that similarity in catchment characteristics and climate characteristics can lead to similarity in rainfall runoff responses beck et al 2016 berghuijs et al 2014 climatic indexes based on observations of precipitation and temperature during the same period with observations of streamflow could provide more dynamically agreeing characteristics of each catchment rather than using köppen climate classification which has different timeline with streamflow observation kottek et al 2006 the evaluated catchments are all vegetated either forest or agricultural lands catchments so the difference in physiography is not significant nevertheless physiography based regionalized parameters are demonstrated to predict well flow signatures in ungauged basins across europe donnelly et al 2016 this approach could be helpful for existing model using physiography based regionalized parameters to be further improved without altering the current parameter sets since this is a poorly gauged region obtaining more streamflow observations would be challenging therefore it is important to develop more approaches to validate the simulated streamflow from model for ungauged catchments the next section is one of those attempts another approach to cross validate simulated streamflow for ungauged catchments could be using ensemble learning regression combining satellite altimetry data and a hydrologic model which could be hype model in this case kim et al 2019c 5 3 model evaluation at ungauged basins using water level based flow correlation to evaluate model performance at ungauged basins both existing performance metrics of water levels and proposed water level based flow correlation were adopted inconsistent and even conflicting performance results using different performance metrics happened for both baseline and final models which make diagnosing and evaluating the model at ungauged basins difficult figs 12 and 13 meanwhile using water level based flow correlation method both in situ and envisat derived water levels can provide more details regarding model diagnostics of which signature needs to be further refined for instance in the baseline model fig 12 using the performance of the reference most highly correlated gauged catchments it informed that model could not capture low flow for both catchment group 3 and catchment group 4 for this study the threshold for identifying the most correlation catchments were only 0 7 because of limited ground observations data access in this region is particularly arduous therefore correlation threshold was lower than other studies archfield and vogel 2010 betterle et al 2017 betterle et al 2019 lower correlation threshold could have reduced the matching performance between the reference most highly correlated gauged catchments and ungauged catchments although the difference is not significant future research could further examine this hypothesis findings show that flow correlation method with in situ water level can be used to evaluate the performance of ungauged catchments through the most highly correlated gauged catchments for envisat derived water level since there are only three virtual stations located in catchments having ground observations three out of 17 envisat ungauged catchments have been validated nevertheless since this method was found to work with both in situ water level and three envisat virtual stations it is assumed that the remaining 14 envisat ungauged catchments could have similar satisfactory simulation to the reference gauged catchments it is expected that not only sub continental multi catchment hydrological models but also multi continental multi catchment hydrological models would benefit from this approach if water level based flow correlation was found between altimetry derived water level in ungauged catchments of a poorly gauged continent and streamflow in gauged catchments of another excessively gauged continent for instance if the study area of gm hype v1 3 could be extended along with water level based flow correlation the performance of the current non validated catchment group 2 of model could be validated meanwhile global scale model could more satisfactorily capture the full range of variability of hydrological regimes that actually exist within their large domains thus it can further increase the ability of hydrological models to be employed routinely and with confidence in ungauged basins more altimetry satellite missions with denser coverage in the future could further advance this approach to improve predictions of flow regimes in ungauged basins 6 conclusion the study uses a novel approach to combine regionalization and satellite observations of various hydrological variable to improve prediction of streamflow signatures at geopolitically ungauged basins using the proposed step wise physiography and climate based regionalization approach the model performance at ungauged basins reached 80 of performance of the ideal situation where observed streamflow data were available for calibration and significantly outperformed the global regionalization parameters using the köppen climate classification this approach would be helpful for both new model setup and existing process based distributed models because it is flexible and does not change the current parameter values of existing models additionally the proposed water level based flow correlation was found to help diagnose models and outperform the existing performance metrics of simulated water levels at ungauged basins it is expected that more satellite altimetry missions with a denser coverage in the future together with macroscale hydrological model either at continental scale or global scale with a wide variety of observed streamflow patterns alemaw and chaoka 2003 arheimer et al 2020 beck et al 2016 döll et al 2003 could benefit from this approach to further evaluate model performance in ungauged basins the study also helps to setup the first multi national multi catchment hydrological model in the greater mekong region the top global biodiversity and major disaster risk hotspot in the world this model version would be useful for water authorities to monitor and plan sustainable use of water resources across administrative boundaries under rapid changing development activities and climate impacts using a common hydrological model concept and setup approach compared to the global hydrological model would allow critical sharing of knowledge and experiences to advance toward a unified theory of hydrology at catchment scale and better predict flow signatures at ungauged basins nevertheless knowledge gaps in aquifers floodplain effect and water extraction by human have not been addressed future model version could be further improved such as using average of the nearest precipitation grids for better reproducing regimes in small catchments incorporating other hydrological data e g groundwater level total terrestrial storage change soil moisture and adding water management modules e g regulated reservoirs irrigation water quality to explore impacts of various changing scenarios from climate and human activities on the vital water food and energy security in the region web data portal could

5298,a novel approach of combining regionalization and satellite observations of various hydrological variables were employed to significantly improve prediction of streamflow signatures at geopolitically ungauged basins using the proposed step wise physiography and climate based regionalization approach the model performance at ungauged basins reached 80 of performance of locally calibrated parameters and significantly outperformed the global regionalization parameters the proposed water level based flow correlation was found to help diagnose models and outperform the existing performance metrics of simulated water levels at ungauged basins the study also set up the first multi national multi catchment hydrological model in the greater mekong region the top global biodiversity and major disaster risk hotspot in the world through sequential and iterative refinement of the existing global hydrological model new model setup or existing models in the poorly gauged and ungauged basins could benefit from the proposed approach to predict and evaluate models at ungauged basins keywords catchment model regionalization flow correlation satellite observations altimetry mekong 1 introduction adequate and reliable information about streamflows are imperative for effective management of water resources streamflow data are required for practical applications such as the design of drainage or water supply infrastructure as well as planning short term and long term water use with respect to changes of land use and climate however only a small fraction of catchments in any part of the world possess a stream gauge blöschl et al 2013 additionally the number of actively gauged stations has in recent years declined significantly due to reduced government funds for monitoring networks ad hoc group et al 2001 shiklomanov et al 2002 given the scarcity of operational gauging stations the availability of streamflow data is becoming increasingly limited in addition to the global trend of declining streamflow gauges accessing existing data is often more difficult in transboundary river catchments unfollowing the human defined political or administrative boundaries transboundary river basins account for roughly one half of the earth s land surface generate about 60 of the global freshwater flow and are home to nearly 40 of the world s population unep dhi unep 2016 at least one transboundary water body exists in almost every non island state in the world even if international agreements enabling data and information sharing among states exist in principle in practice data sharing is often complex in transboundary waters gerlak et al 2011 for example in the okavango river basin although there is agreement between namibia and botswana on sharing river flow data it is debated how to validate the accuracy of shared data turton et al 2003 or in the case of the jordan river basin where there are asymmetric power relations intentionally ambiguous mechanisms were designed by stronger states to allow no actual data exchange while diffusing domestic opposition fischhendler 2008 these transboundary river basins are thus considered as geopolitically ungauged where data observation networks may exist but data are unavailable for use due to geopolitical constraints kibler et al 2014 since streamflow observations are not available and accessible for all locations hydrological models often rely on regionalization approaches to transfer information from gauged to ungauged catchments see beck et al 2016 razavi and coulibaly 2012 blöschl et al 2013 parajka et al 2013 hrachowitz et al 2013 he et al 2011 for reviews there are different regionalization approaches with their respective advantages and limitations in general approaches that transfer calibrated parameter sets with respect to their climatic and physiographic similarity and or simultaneously calibrate multiple catchments with similar characteristics performed better than other approaches arheimer et al 2020 beck et al 2016 donnelly et al 2016 garambois et al 2015 kim and kaluarachchi 2008 parajka et al 2007 sellami et al 2014 nonetheless it is of question if this approach would work in the case of process based distributed hydrological models which inevitably have a large number of parameters process based distributed hydrological models which have parameters linked to physiography and or climate in the context of multi catchment modeling approach including both gauged and ungauged basins is a type of regionalization abbaspour et al 2015 arheimer et al 2020 donnelly et al 2016 hossain et al 2017 mohammed et al 2018 most of these studies used physiography linked parameter sets except the most recent study by arheimer et al 2020 that included similarity in climate characteristics among them the study by donnelly et al 2016 explicitly evaluated physiography linked parameter sets and concluded that they were useful for prediction at ungauged basins arheimer et al 2020 included climate linked parameter sets by assigning different potential evapotranspiration algorithms for catchments characterized according to köppen climate classification however it is questionable if the choice of climate regions based on köppen classification was optimal due to no explicit quantification of improvement in simulating streamflow the growing availability of spatially distributed remotely sensed data and open global data sources together with better computational capacity and advanced methods to assure better data quality has brought the possibility of macroscale hydrological modeling at the continental scale e g pechlivanidis and arheimer 2015 abbaspour et al 2015 donnelly et al 2016 and the global scale arheimer et al 2020 beck et al 2016 döll et al 2003 however it is known that global scale hydrological models do not always have satisfactory performance over all stations within their expansive domains constraining their application for management purposes furthermore the evaluation of model performance has been undertaken at gauged or pseudo gauged stations accordingly it is of question how to discern at which station model can satisfactorily capture the observed hydrological regimes an innovative approach to evaluate model at ungauged basins without using streamflow data is thus required while streamflow data are less available and accessible water level or stream stage data are more widely obtainable because there is less investment of people and equipment to measure them and increasingly more access and coverage of stage data derived from satellite altimetry become available okeowo et al 2017 lee et al 2009 water level observations either from in situ observations or derived from satellite altimetry have been increasingly used to calibrate hydrological models towards replacing streamflow information for poorly and ungauged basins getirana 2010 sun et al 2012 lindström 2016 jian et al 2017 and used innovatively to estimate important hydrological information for mekong river basin chang et al 2019 kim et al 2019 however the evaluation of hydrological models using the existing performance metrics based on water level only can yield inaccurate results due to inherent numerical problems lindström 2016 jian et al 2017 therefore it is vital to develop methods that more effectively utilize water level data where available for evaluation of model at ungauged basins as a surrogate for streamflow similar flow dynamics mean discharge relative flow variability and catchment response rates have been found between catchments having high spatial correlation of daily streamflow p 0 9 rather than catchments having spatial proximity archfield and vogel 2010 betterle et al 2017 betterle et al 2019 instead of using streamflow for ungauged catchments receptor water level observations can be used to find the most highly correlated gauged catchments donor this approach is named as water level based flow correlation in this study if a model can simulate similar correlation to the observed correlation patterns between gauged using streamflow and ungauged using water level it is hypothesized that performance of simulated ungauged catchments is as similar as gauged catchments it is thus worth exploring whether this hypothesis is valid accordingly the overarching goal of this work is to develop and test a new method of using satellite observations and regionalization to improve the prediction of streamflow at geopolitically ungauged basins using hydrological predictions for the environment hype semi distributed hydrological model lindström et al 2010 a first subcontinent scale hydrological model would be setup for the greater mekong region which is a global biodiversity and major disaster risk hotspot but poorly simulated in the existing global hydrological models constraining their use for pressing management purposes tordoff et al 2012 dilley et al 2005 du et al 2018 the region covers 13 river basins of which six international river basins make up 90 of total area passing the entire territory of vietnam laos cambodia and parts of china thailand and myanmar fig 1 the specific objectives of this work are to i examine how far a multi catchment hype model using global open data sources including satellite observations can predict flow signatures for gauged catchments in the region ii identify whether physiography and climate based regionalized parameters could improve prediction of streamflow signatures at ungauged catchments iii determine whether water level based flow correlation could help to evaluate model performance at ungauged catchments 2 data 2 1 input dataset for hype model the study used hype semi distributed hydrological model which has been examined in extensive catchment types worldwide arheimer et al 2020 in this study hype for the greater mekong region is named as greater mekong hype gm hype which has been developed incrementally and the current final version 1 3 gm hype v1 3 was based on the first version gm hype v1 gm hype v1 was the result of a long standing collaboration between swedish meteorological hydrological institute smhi and national center for water resources planning and investigation nawapi to be comparable with the world wide hype model version 1 3 wwh v1 3 arheimer et al 2020 the catchment model hype for the greater mekong region used the same topography and hydrological databases table 1 additionally supplementary forcing and gauging data were used in addition to hydrological global forcing data hydrogfd precipitation and hydrogfd temperature berg et al 2018 multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep precipitation tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42 precipitation and national centers for environmental prediction climate forecast system version 2 ncep cfsv2 temperature which have been examined to perform well in the region were added mohammed et al 2018 tang et al 2019 since different forcing datasets have different spatial resolutions table 1 the nearest grid approach was used to assign the characteristics to each sub catchment considering vietnam to be the country that needs to monitor water resources outside of the country given 60 of water is generated outside of the country world bank 2019 du et al 2016 any streamflow observations inside vietnam are named as gauged catchments used for calibration whereas the observations outside of vietnam where available are named as geopolitically ungauged catchments gauged but not used for calibration sources of the additional ground observations of streamflow water level and precipitation were supplemented by project partners to calibrate and validate the model performance in the region see fig 1 for their locations details of stations names locations and basic information are provided in table supplementary 1 2 2 radar altimetry data the heights of the earth surface every 35 days can be determined using the two way travel time of radar pulses by envisat radar altimeter 2 ra 2 during period from august 2002 to october 2010 see fig 2 and table 2 for their locations altimetric along track data v2 1 of the envisat mission ctoh envisat 2014 01 corrected by ctoh centre de topographie des océans et de l hydrosphère legos france were extracted and time series were generated using the automation algorithm developed in okeowo et al 2017 this algorithm was based on k means clustering for the automatic detection of outliers their method was found to be computationally effective compared to other methods such as kalman filter approach by schwatke et al 2015 and applicable in the mekong river basin kim et al 2019b 3 methods 3 1 the multi catchment hydrological model hype hype is a process oriented semi distributed open source model that is developed and used operationally to deliver high resolution model predictions of water and nutrients lindström et al 2010 arheimer and lindström 2013 initially developed for use in sweden it has more recently been used in applications in for example india pechlivanidis and arheimer 2015 europe donnelly et al 2016 and across the globe arheimer et al 2020 the hype model code has been developed since 2005 with a flexible approach to start with simple process descriptions and further refine and increase complexity when necessary lindström et al 2005 bergström 1991 beven 2011 the model structure is based on a multi catchment approach allowing simultaneous modeling of multiple river basins with each river basin divided into multiple subbasins and each subbasin further divided into hydrologic response units hrus each hru can be divided vertically into three maximum distinct soil layers normally the top layer has a thickness of around 25 cm the second of 1 2 m and the third can be deeper to account for ground water bui et al 2011 the model is forced by precipitation and temperature at either daily or hourly temporal resolution and its calculation starts at hrus and is then aggregated to subbasin level hype calculates flow paths in the soil based on snow melt evapotranspiration surface runoff infiltration percolation macropore flow tile drainage and outflow to the stream from soil layers when water content is above field capacity different algorithms are provided to calculate snow melt evapotranspiration and infiltration according to the physical characteristics of the modeled catchments the runoff from the land classes is then routed through the network of rivers and lakes to generate river flow which could be dampened due to effect of lakes and reservoirs hype can also simulate the effect of floodplains which is crucial for large river systems and their deltas andersson et al 2017 and it can also simulate the transport and concentration of nutrients in both soil rivers and lakes lindström et al 2010 in addition to natural dynamics the model can simulate simplified water management schemes such as regulated reservoirs hydropower and irrigation there are several parameters used in hype that can be constrained in a stepwise manner using different types of observed data arheimer and lindström 2013 the parameters may be soil type dependent e g field capacity land cover dependent e g evapotranspiration coefficient or general across the domain e g river routing parameters parameters which are linked to physiography and or climate rather than to a specific catchment are thus assumed to be transferable to ungauged sites more details on the hype model including visual schematic diagram can be found in the web based documentation http www smhi net hype wiki and lindström et al 2010 the hype model has explicit lake routing including two types of lakes which are local lakes and outlet lakes local lakes which are located inside the subbasin only receive a portion of local surface runoff and then flows to main river of the same subbasin outlet lakes which are located near the main river receive both local runoff after it has passed local lakes and the river flow from upstream subbasins each lake can be set with an individually defined depth the outflow from lakes when water level is above a defined threshold can be either determined by a general rating curve or a specific rating curve the rating curve for a lake outlet is written as q k w w 0 p thus water level can be also seen as a transformation of streamflow w w o q k 1 p where q is the outflow or streamflow m3 s w is water level m w0 a threshold m k p are rate and exponent of rating curve parameters lindström 2016 when w0 is known w w 0 is equal to water depth lake water levels which are easier and cheaper to be measured are mainly used with the purpose of estimating streamflow through established rating curves meanwhile there are a lot of basins that have no observations of streamflow therefore lindström 2016 tested if hype can be calibrated using water level data instead of streamflow the study found that water levels could be useful for calibration of hydrological models without measuring streamflow by establishing a traditional rating curve but using a constant rating curve exponent his suggestion of using p 2 while adjusting k and w0 appropriately for all lakes resulted in a reasonable agreement with observed daily water level records based on the assumption of parabolic lake outlets which agreed with the previous study by maidment 1992 accordingly to integrate river elevation derived from envisat altimetry into hype modeled streamflow must be converted to water level using outlet lake routine from hype negligibly small outlet lakes which have inflow equal to outflow no storage capacity to affect streamflow were added in subbasin where there is either in situ observations of streamflow and water level or envisat derived river elevation to reduce uncertainty of estimating water depth in addition to constant p constant k 100 and w0 0 were used so equation 2 becomes w q 100 1 2 since the proposed method water level based flow correlation explained in section 3 3 emphasized the temporal dynamics rather than the true magnitude of a variable it was not necessary to estimate the exact water depth simulated w would be compared with either in situ observations of water level at geopolitically ungauged catchments or envisat derived water elevation at envisat ungauged catchments envisat ungauged catchments are catchments that have virtual stations of envisat derived water level but mostly have no observations of streamflow except 3 catchments that are located in geopolitically ungauged catchments table 2 3 2 grouping catchments using climatic indexes similar seasonal water balance patterns between catchments which could be explored based on three climatic indices alone i e climatic aridity timing of seasonal precipitation and a temperature based measure of snowiness was found to provide a useful backdrop to the signatures of streamflow variability over various time scales daily to decadal and states low flow to floods berghuijs et al 2014 this study applied berghuijs et al 2014 s approach to robustly group catchments based on their similarity in climatic characteristics accordingly two dimensionless indices that account for similar water balances among catchments were calculated namely the aridity index and the seasonality index snowiness is not considered in this study since there is almost no snow impact in the study area proposed by budyko 1974 the aridity index is defined as φ e p where e is the average potential evaporation rate mm day and p is the average precipitation rate mm day this average is calculated from 2002 to 2009 the same time period used to calibrate the model φ can range from 0 to infinity in theory with higher values associated with more arid climate here it is assumed that the seasonal variability of precipitation and air temperature can be modeled as simple sine curves milly 1994 potter et al 2005 woods 2009 as follows p t p 1 δ p sin 2 π t s p τ p t t t δ t s i n 2 π t s t τ t where t is the time days s is a phase shift days τ is the duration of the cycle under consideration here 365 days p is the average precipitation mm day t is the average temperature c day over same period 2002 2009 δ p and δ t are dimensionless seasonal amplitudes and the subscripts p and t stand for precipitation mm day and temperature c day respectively p t is the precipitation rate mm day and t t is temperature c day as a function of t using a least squares optimization δ p and δ t were obtained for all individual 1120 catchments in the hype study domain then the seasonality index δ p was calculated using woods 2009 δ p δ p s g n δ t c o s 2 π s p s t τ where δ p indicates whether precipitation is in phase with the potential evaporation and temperature regimes the parameter δ p can range from 1 to 1 with the former representing strongly winter dominant precipitation p out of phase with t and the latter showing strongly summer dominant precipitation p in phase with t δ p 0 indicates the uniform precipitation throughout the year 3 3 water level based flow correlation between gauged and ungauged catchments a measured correlation matrix pearson s r correlation coefficient between daily in situ water level of geopolitically ungauged catchments and daily streamflow of gauged catchments was calculated to find the most highly correlated reference gauged catchments to the study ungauged catchments similarly a measured correlation matrix between envisat derived water level of ungauged catchments outside of vietnam and the daily streamflow of gauged catchments was also computed to examine the assumption that the correlation between two daily streamflow series was similar to water level based flow correlation between daily water level either in situ observations of water level or envisat derived water level and streamflow a corresponding correlation matrix between daily streamflow of geopolitically ungauged catchments and daily streamflow of gauged catchments was made from previous studies on flow correlation correlation coefficients larger than 0 9 were recommended to consider as being highly correlated catchments archfield and vogel 2010 betterle et al 2019 because there were less catchments considered in the study r 0 7 was selected as the threshold correlation coefficient because r was smaller in the study only catchments in the same climatic group section 3 2 were examined to ensure they have similar climate characteristics 3 4 step wise physiography and climate based regionalization at gauged basins for data sparse regions step wise calibration approach was shown to be a useful method to reduce the problem of equifinality of the final model output andersson et al 2017 donnelly et al 2016 arheimer and lindström 2013 strömqvist et al 2012 at each key process lumped calibration was carried out simultaneously for sub groups of gauged basins representative gauged basins rgbs with upstream areas dominated by a specific land use or soil type when calibration for a specific group of rgbs is deemed satisfactory the parameters for that responding land use or soil type can be kept constant and the next parameters for another group can be calibrated using another set of rgbs the step wise separation followed the hydrological pathways through the landscape starting with climate inputs precipitation evapotranspiration then subsequently moving downstream to soils infiltration storage runoff then the rivers and lakes routing and storage after each step evaluation of model performance was undertaken for all 19 gauged stations and the best performance parameter set was used in the next step of the model refinement the period 2002 2009 was selected as the calibrated period to analyze errors and refine the model this period was chosen because it aligned with the availability of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis derived potential evapotranspiration pet and envisat derived water level the earlier part of the simulation period 1991 2001 was retained for independent validation at the same stations a key objective in calibrating the greater mekong hype model was to represent the main hydrological processes of all river basins therefore model evaluation and refinements primarily focused on achieving satisfactory performance across the whole basin using consistent descriptions rather than excellent performance at few locations the streamflow signatures to be evaluated in the study were the daily and monthly specific streamflow mm day and mm month high flow 5th percentile of daily specific flow in mm day low flow 95th percentile of daily specific flow in mm day and medium flow 50th percentile of daily specific flow in mm day these signatures were selected because they are the most important and widely used signatures of catchment runoff response to be applied in water resources planning and environmental studies arheimer et al 2020 donnelly et al 2016 table 3 the entire domain scale performance was quantified by first calculating key performance criteria for each of the above flow signatures at each of the 19 streamflow gauges available inside vietnam fig 1 and then computing summary statistics to describe model performance across all locations the model s ability to simulate daily and monthly streamflow at each gauge was quantified with standard metrics including the kling gupta efficiency kge and its components r β α which are directly linked with pearson s correlation coefficient relative error re and relative error of standard deviation resd variability ratio respectively gupta et al 2009 table 4 for constraining pet parameter values absolute value of re was used to find the best agreements between modeled pet and modis derived pet both automatic and manual calibration approach were employed to take advantage of strengths of both methods the advantage of the former is power and speed of computation and objective parameter constraints nevertheless it is unlikely to provide physically acceptable parameter estimates which are mostly addressed by highly labor intensive manual calibration boyle et al 2000 the automatic approach was the differential evolution markov chain demc method ter braak 2006 demc allowed to examine parameter sensitivity probability based uncertainty estimate and a better convergence towards the global optimum two step demc automatic calibration was undertaken firstly short runs around 400 iterations were done to examine parameter sensitivity secondly longer runs with at least 1000 iterations were undertaken for only sensitive parameters to allow convergence to global optimum values demc automation was then followed by manual checks to ensure the physically acceptable parameter ranges and simulated hydrograph similar to the observed patterns table 5 describes the model parameters to be calibrated and lists the initial parameter values for each parameter other parameters were kept as default as the baseline parameters from the first greater mekong hype model version gm hype v1 the same roughly calibrated parameter sets of the first world wide hype model version 1 0 wwh v1 0 arheimer et al 2020 step wise physiography and climate based regionalization framework for estimating different groups of model parameter values in each step were as follows 1 for precipitation and temperature different datasets of precipitation and temperature were used with the baseline parameters from wwh v1 0 roughly calibrated model at global scale without undertaking any additional calibration to identify the optimal climate forcing datasets for the region daily kge was used to evaluate this step this model step after selecting the optimal climate data was named as the greater mekong hype model version 1 0 gm hype v1 0 2 pet parameter values lb kc5 alb see table 5 for description of parameter values were constrained using the absolute value of re between annually simulated pet and modis derived pet pet algorithm selected in the study was food and agriculture organization fao penman monteith which was integrated inside the hype model allen et al 1998 monteith 1965 this algorithm was selected so that it was more comparable to modis based pet which was also based on penman monteith logic mu et al 2011 two step demc automatic calibration was undertaken to obtain the optimal values for each rgb of each land cover type 10 main land cover types were grouped from 36 european space agency esa climate change initiative cci v1 6 data see details of land cover description and grouping in arheimer et al 2020 thirdly manual checks of parameter values for each group were made to ensure their acceptable physical meaning this model step after selecting optimal parameter values was named as the greater mekong hype model version 1 1 gm hype v1 1 3 parameters related to soil storage flow paths and runoff generation 19 parameters provided in table 5 were first optimally tuned by two step demc calibration with daily kge used as the objective function because all gauged and ungauged basins were mainly vegetated areas only parameters for vegetated soils were calibrated the remaining parameters were kept as default following automatic calibration manual check was done to examine the physical meaning of parameters and hydrograph simulation of other signatures daily streamflow q95 q5 and q50 this model step after selecting the optimal parameter values was named as the greater mekong hype model version 1 2 gm hype v1 2 4 each catchment group section 3 2 was evaluated separately and calibrated using regional correction parameters cevpcorr rrcscorr see table 5 for description of parameter values hundecha et al 2016 two step demc with daily kge as the objective function and manual checks were done for all flow signatures daily streamflow q95 q5 and q50 this model step after selecting the optimal regional correction parameter values was named as the greater mekong hype model version 1 3 gm hype v1 3 3 5 performance of regionalized parameters at ungauged basins the performance of physiography and climate based regionalized parameters was assessed with the following approach at 12 geopolitically ungauged to be used for independent evaluation fig 3 kge re for daily streamflow re for q95 q5 q50 were obtained by using the following sets of parameters 1 step wise physiography and climate based regionalization parameters transfer from gauged catchments par gm hype v1 3 section 3 4 2 global regionalization parameters from the wwh v1 3 arheimer et al 2020 this parameter set was forced with the same climate data as the wwh v1 3 model hydrogfd precipitation and temperature 3 locally calibrated parameters in the ideal situation where observed streamflow were available for calibration step one to three of section 3 4 without manual calibration so that selected parameters can be objective the performance metrics from the three parameter sets were compared to address research objective 2 section 1 if the proposed regionalization method could help improve prediction of streamflow signatures at ungauged basins 3 6 model evaluation at ungauged basins using water level based flow correlation at 12 geopolitically ungauged and 17 envisat ungauged catchments which were assumed to have no observations of streamflow but only water level different performance metrics were used to examine if water levels can be modelled with a satisfactory level of performance water levels e g modeled in situ altimetry derived are water heights that include both water depths and mean heights of river beds with respect to different vertical references mean heights of river beds however are mostly unknown unless being surveyed with large financial resources and manpower or estimated with high uncertainty although pearson s correlation coefficient can capture temporal variation between modeled and recorded water levels it could not evaluate the bias errors between them thus different performance metrics have been developed to remove this bias instead of estimating differences between observed and modeled variables getirana 2010 proposed nash sutcliffe efficiency for anomalies nseanom which is a modified nse metrics to to calculate the differences between their anomalies similarly lindström 2016 introduced nash sutcliffe efficiency adjusted for bias nsew to eliminate the bias between them table 4 nevertheless due to numerical problems these modified formulations can yield inaccurate results because modeled water levels without unknown mean heights of river beds are within ranges of few meters whereas recorded water levels are within several hundred meters above sea levels lindström 2016 therefore in practice it is recommended to evaluate water depths however in ungauged or geopolitically ungauged basins in situ data are scare accordingly this study proposed applying hydrologic similarity theory betterle et al 2017 archfield and vogel 2010 by assuming that the most highly correlated reference gauged catchments using daily streamflow also have similar performance to that of the study ungauged catchments using water level to use this method first the modeled water levels of the ungauged catchments were evaluated against recorded water levels using pearson s correlation coefficient nseanom and nsew for in situ water levels evaluation was undertaken at both daily and monthly time steps for envisat derived water levels evaluation was performed at any day step that has recorded data one daily observation every 35 days nseanom and nsew were used only to examine if numerical problems of evaluating models based on water levels existed when only modeled water level had good correlation with recorded water level r 0 7 following steps were undertaken this condition ensured that the temporal variation of modeled water levels against observations was captured secondly the modeled correlation between modeled water levels of the ungauged catchments and modeled streamflow of the reference most highly correlated catchments was computed if there was similar result between modeled correlation and measured correlation modeled correlation can range from 0 5 to 0 9 compared to measured correlation performance of reference gauged catchment was assumed to be the performance of ungauged catchment to cross validate this assumption performance of ungauged catchments against the historical observations of streamflow where available was evaluated and compared with the assumption fig 4 4 results 4 1 catchment delineation and characteristics the world hydrological input set up tool whist developed by smhi swedish meteorological and hydrological institute developer of hype model was used to delineate catchment borders arheimer et al 2020 consistent with the wwh v1 3 catchment delineation was defined using the same approach according to the locations of gauging stations in the river network including 19 gauged stations and 12 geopolitically ungauged the outlets of large lakes reservoirs and seeking to reach an average catchment size of 1 000 km2 arheimer et al 2020 as a result the greater mekong region 1 2 million km2 was divided into 1 120 sub catchments with an average size of 1 047 km2 sub catchments within low lying areas with extensive floodplains tended to have a larger size average 3 600 km2 among which the tonlesap basin had the largest size of 10 000 km2 the outputs of catchment delineation were quality checked with station metadata obtained from governmental reports 100 of the estimated catchment areas were found to fall within 5 of the areas reported by these metadata for lakes and reservoirs in total 15 lakes and 18 reservoirs only lakes and reservoirs larger than 10 km2 recorded by glwd and grand were considered in this version were identified similar to wwh v1 3 hrus represented a combination of land cover characteristics and elevation resulting in 169 hrus details of hrus can be found in arheimer et al 2020 different hydrological active soil depths were assigned for the hrus based on the variability in vegetation and elevation they represented as suggested by troch et al 2009 and gao et al 2014 and currently used in wwh v1 3 arheimer et al 2020 similar to wwh v1 3 detailed description of soil properties was not included in hype model to reduce number of parameters nevertheless five general distinct soil classes including i no soil water ii urban soil iii rock no texture iv vegetated soil and v irrigated soil based on impermeable conditions and infiltration of land covers were identified to describe the hydrological processes in the region 4 2 grouping catchments using climatic indexes across all 1 120 catchments and during the 2002 to 2009 study period the aridity index ranged from 0 4 to 1 7 whereas seasonality index ranges from 0 3 to 1 accordingly consistent with berghuijs et al 2014 four catchment groups were made including group 1 humidity φ 0 75 with mild seasonality δ p 0 5 group 2 humidity φ 0 75 with high seasonality δ p 0 5 group 3 sub humidity φ 0 75 with mild seasonality δ p 0 5 and group 4 sub humidity φ 0 75 with high seasonality δ p 0 5 table 6 fig 5 shows the geographic spread and organization of four catchment groups obtained from this classification approach see figure supplementary 2 for spatial distribution of all catchments based on group classification most catchments having historical streamflow observations both gauged and ungauged were classified as group 3 or group 4 catchments of group 1 were mostly located near the coastal area with stronger humidity and more wet season dominant precipitation catchments of group 3 were located mostly in the southwest of the region with less humidity and less seasonal water variability catchments of group 4 were located mostly in the northwest of the region with less humidity and more dry season dominant precipitation grouping catchments using climatic indexes could provide a robust reference to further regionalize parameters for each climate group this study adapted a simple regional calibration approach following hundecha et al 2016 after step wise calibration of the model for all catchments we evaluated the model for each catchment group to find out which signatures need to be refined and then performed regional calibration separately by using group specific correction parameters it should be noted that only catchment group 1 3 and 4 could be calibrated and validated whereas catchment group 2 had no validation because there were no gauged stations for this group 4 3 water level based flow correlation between gauged and ungauged catchments fig 6 validates the assumption that water level based flow correlation using daily observed in situ water levels and streamflow had similar results to the correlation using both daily observed streamflow observations in the case of envisat derived water levels because there were less observations one daily observation every 35 days the correlation coefficient became slightly smaller but the difference was negligible accordingly for the geopolitically ungauged and envisat ungauged catchments in catchment group 3 talai g18 was found to be the reference most highly correlated gauged catchment for the geopolitically ungauged and envisat ungauged catchments in catchment group 4 laocai g2 laichau g4 yenbai g6 xala g9 were the reference most highly correlated gauged catchments 4 4 step wise physiography and climate based regionalization at gauged basins 4 4 1 baseline model performance gm hype v1 0 six sets of precipitation and temperature data were used to identify the most appropriate climate inputs for the model among them hydrogfd had the coarsest resolution 0 5 grid whereas mswep trmm and ncep were gridded at had 0 25 resolution there were 176 in situ precipitation stations to examine the quality of different climate data inputs of the model the period 2000 2006 was selected to examine their correlation as it was the period that all datasets were available in terms of magnitudes it was found that hydrogfd and trmm precipitation datasets overestimated during wet months 5 and 7 respectively and underestimated during dry months 13 and 5 respectively compared to the in situ precipitation resulting in weaker correlation with in situ precipitation 0 65 and 0 53 respectively table 7 mswep had smaller bias less than 1 for the entire year and stronger correlation with in situ precipitation there was unfortunately no in situ temperature dataset to compare with hydrogfd and ncep monthly average temperature from hydrogfd was larger than monthly average ncep fig 7 using the initial default parameter set wwh v1 0 with different sets of climate data no significant difference in model performance was found between them any temperature dataset combined with the same precipitation dataset resulted in almost similar performance among the precipitation datasets mswep led to the highest model performance followed by hydrogfd and trmm since the mswep precipitation and ncep temperature datasets had better resolution both at 0 25 this set of forcing data was selected as the climate input data to be used for the baseline model gm hype v1 0 table 8 4 4 2 refining potential evapotranspiration gm hype v1 1 evaporation is a significantly important process in all river basins in vietnam accounting for around 50 of precipitation on average nguyen 2005 given the importance of evaporation in the region and large errors of streamflow variability in many locations of the baseline model calibration was undertaken to estimate pet the upper limit of evaporation in the model among three pet related parameters land use dependent parameter kc5 was found to be sensitive the posterior kc5 was found to reduce relative volumetric errors re between modeled pet and modis derived pet by 40 compared to initial kc5 value table 5 with this posterior kc5 values model performance for all flow signatures significantly improved over all stations particularly for kge from 0 3 to 0 47 for daily streamflow in this model version nevertheless low flows were significantly underestimated while high flow were overestimated requiring refinement of the soil storage and flow paths process fig 8 4 4 3 refining soil storage and flow paths gm hype v1 2 the gm hype v1 1 model displayed a quick and peaky response of streamflow to rainfall events resulting in the underestimation of low flows and the overestimation of high flows fig 9 demc automation found the sensitive parameters that needed to be calibrated they were parameters governing the soil porosities wcep1 wcep2 wcep3 percolation mperc2 subsurface runoff and surface runoff macrate mactrinf mactrsm rrcs2 parameters of the gm hype v1 1 model represented significantly little soil storage and high recession coefficients therefore soil related parameters were adjusted to increase soil storage capacity more infiltration and lower recession coefficients for subsurface runoff in addition runoff components horton overland flow dunne overland flow subsurface flow for different soil classes were unreasonable compared to dunne theory dunne 1978 li et al 2014 accordingly srrcs dunne overland flow related parameter and srrate horton overland flow related parameter were manually calibrated so that horton overland flow dominated in urban and bare soil class whereas subsurface runoff and dunne overland flow dominated in vegetated soil class refining these descriptions helped to maintain physical meaning of parameters while significantly improving overall simulated flow signatures for all gauged catchments during both the calibration and validation period for instance for the calibration period compared to the gm hype v1 1 model the kge for daily streamflow improved from 0 47 to 0 7 on the other hand volumetric errors of low flows significantly reduced to 27 from 95 and high flow from 35 to 1 7 fig 8 4 4 4 refining seasonal water balances among catchment groups gm hype v1 3 the model gm hype v1 2 had an overall satisfactory performance for both daily and monthly streamflow time series in both the calibration and validation periods kge for daily streamflow was above 0 5 however the low flow signature q95 was underestimated for few stations in the model gm hype v1 2 the global physiography based parameters which were based on soil and land cover characteristics of catchments were used for all catchments evaluating the model gm hype v1 2 for each catchment group only 3 groups having gauged stations the global physiography based parameters were more suitable for catchment group 3 whereas low flow signatures for both catchment groups 1 and 4 were still underestimated fig 10 catchment group 1 with humidity and mild seasonality has more wet season dominant storage variation whereas catchment group 4 with sub humidity and high seasonality has more dry season dominant storage variation berghuijs et al 2014 accordingly various correction factors evapotranspiration and recession coefficients were used to simultaneously consider the variety of climate characteristics between catchments hundecha et al 2016 in a trial and error the correction factor for the soil recession coefficient rrcscorr has resulted in improvement for the low flow signatures for group 1 and group 4 for both calibration and validation periods whereas other parameter cevpcorr did not result in any improvement 4 5 performance of regionalized parameters at ungauged basins table 9 summarizes the performance in terms of kge re for daily streamflow re for q5 q95 q50 obtained in 12 geopolitically ungauged evaluation catchments using physiography based regionalized parameters par gm hype v1 2 physiography and climate based regionalized parameter sets from gauged catchments par gm hype v1 3 global regionalization parameter sets par wwh v1 3 and locally calibrated parameter sets similar to arheimer et al 2020 although global regionalization parameters could characterize spatial variability of flow signatures across the globe they had difficulties in capturing low flows particularly in tropical catchments the difference between physiography based regionalized parameters and physiography and climate based regionalized parameters was not significant nevertheless the later could significantly reduce volumetric errors of low flow because only one extra parameter was used in the wwh v1 3 compared to previous model version compared to locally calibrated parameters physiography and climate based regionalized parameters reached nearly 80 in terms of kge for daily streamflow and was even a slightly better in terms of volumetric errors for low flow medium and high flow fig 11 shows performance of daily simulated streamflow of all catchments in terms of kge compared to their historical observations of streamflow during validation period 1991 2001 for two model versions including baseline gm hype v1 0 and final gm hype v1 3 the catchments presented in fig 11 include both gauged catchments located inside black vietnamese boundary and geopolitically ungauged catchments located outside of black vietnamese boundary most of simulated catchments using the final model version have better captured hydrological processes of the region resulting in a substantial improvement mostly blue dots in fig 11b in both model versions streamflow in lang son located in bang giang ky cung basin northeast of vietnam the only yellow dot in fig 11b was not well simulated the reason could be the underrepresented spatial variation of precipitation in the catchment owing to the its small size the smallest size 1 500 km2 in all evaluated catchments in the study future research could be further improved by using the average of the nearest precipitation grids or higher resolution precipitation datasets like nasa global precipitation measure integrated multi satellite retrievals with 0 1 resolution gpm imergf v6 le et al 2020 4 6 model evaluation at ungauged basins using water level based flow correlation to evaluate the performance of model at ungauged catchments that have observed water levels evaluation framework using water level based flow correlation fig 4 and existing performance metrics of simulated water levels was used this section applied the framework and performance metrics for both baseline and final model versions to examine if this method and or performance metrics can work for both scenarios fig 12 and fig 13 accordingly firstly the daily and or monthly simulated water levels were evaluated against the recorded water levels using the existing performance metrics for simulated water levels including pearson s correlation coefficients nseanom and nsew from fig 12 and fig 13 conflicting performance results of simulated water levels compared to observed water levels were found in any row of both figures inconsistent colors between r nseanom and nsew for simulated water levels especially for envisat derived water level were shown for example from fig 12d at eu 107 station pearson s correlation coefficient dark blue color good result showed that simulated water level had good temporal correlation with observed water levels nseanom blue color acceptable result informed that they had acceptable magnitude bias nsew orange color bad result advised that they had significantly high magnitude bias comparing simulated streamflow of this station with observed streamflow blue color of kge acceptable result the model was found to simulate daily flow at acceptable level but could not capture high flows light purple color of q5 overestimated and low flows yellow color of q95 highly underestimated this finding confirmed previous studies that model performance based on only water levels could yield inaccurate results in modelling streamflow signatures lindström 2016 jian et al 2017 additionally unlike water levels that have limited performance metrics and derived hydrological signatures there is a high variety of performance metrics to evaluate various signatures of streamflow that could help diagnose model problems and inform where to improve for example kge metric can inform whether temporal pattern or variation or magnitude of daily flow is not good gupta et al 2009 whereas relative volumetric errors of flow signatures from flow duration curve high low and medium can inform which part of runoff surface or subsurface runoff is not well represented yokoo and sivapalan 2011 accordingly it raised a question how to have extra important model diagnostic information if only observations of water levels are available water level based flow correlation was found to possibly address the above question using water level based flow correlation evaluation framework firstly temporal patterns of simulated water levels were examined against observations using correlation coefficients which were all above 0 7 for both model versions fig 12 fig 13 secondly modeled correlation between simulated water levels of ungauged catchments and simulated streamflow of gauged catchments were compared against measured correlation between observed water levels of ungauged catchments and observed streamflow of gauged catchments the difference between them was within 0 2 for both model versions thus the performance of ungauged catchments was similar to the performance of the most highly correlated gauged catchments see figure supplementary 4 accordingly in both baseline and final model versions performance of ungauged catchments were similar to performance of the most highly correlated gauged catchments for all flow signatures it was then validated with any ungauged catchments that have historical observed streamflow to cross validate the hypothesis consistent results were found for all flow signatures between the reference most highly correlated gauged catchments and ungauged catchments having observed streamflow where available for cross validation to accept the hypothesis for catchments having only envisat derived water level without observed streamflow its performance cannot be validated nevertheless since this method worked for both in situ water levels and 3 catchments having both envisat derived water level and observed streamflow performance of the remaining 14 catchments with envisat derived water level could be evaluated using the reference most highly correlated gauged catchments accordingly it showed that water level based flow correlation method could be used to evaluate the model performance at ungauged catchments having only observations of water levels furthermore compared to previous studies that used water levels to evaluate model performance this approach can not only overcome numerical problems of existing performance metrics for water levels but also provide important model diagnostic information on how to improve model performance without streamflow observations 5 discussion 5 1 step wise physiography and climate based regionalization at gauged basins catchment models are important tools to support decision makers in sustainable planning of water resources the greater mekong region is the top global biodiversity hotspot but increasingly facing urgent socio economic development and climate change impacts accordingly it is imperative to have a multi national and multi catchment model to support river basin authorities it could thus help predict river flows across administrative borders and allocate water resources among water users in a harmonized manner for the first time a multi national and multi catchment greater mekong hype was set up in this important region the analysis of the final model gm hype v1 3 version kge of daily and monthly streamflow is 0 7 and 0 8 respectively shows that the model is useful for water authorities in managing water related issues the model has been setup on the foundation of the world wide hype model and successfully refined to capture the hydrological processes for the region it shows that global hydrological model in this case the world wide hype model could be a useful starting point as a time saving alternative for other regions to further refine it with local expert knowledge so that it could be useful in supporting decision makers for water management additionally further refining an existing model would allow critical knowledge and experiences shared between research groups and practitioners thus increasing full transparency in the research process further understanding of general hydrological patterns process and functions between catchments it can thus ultimately advance hydrological sciences toward a unified theory of hydrology at catchment scale sivapalan 2005 and better predict flow signatures at ungauged basins blöschl et al 2013 the approach of sequentially and iteratively both automatically and manually refining inadequately described hydrological processes together with local knowledge can substantially improve the appropriateness of model application in a new region calibration is inevitable in process based distributed model because of impossibility to measure all required model parameters at the model simulation scale beven 1989 blöschl and sivapalan 1995 this study combined both automatic and manual calibration to combine the strengths of both methods to achieve more physically acceptable parameters at a timely efficient manner at each step in hydrological processes the study area has various seasonal water variability due to its substantial precipitation and evaporation variability from tropical monsoon effect therefore using climatic indexes aridity index and seasonality index is a useful approach to group catchments so that all catchments can be simulated in the same modeling domain adding one simple step step 4 in the step wise calibration approach in section 3 4 into the common step wise physiography based parameters helped reduce the underestimation of low flow of two catchment groups in this study simple regionalized parameter approach correction parameters were used more substantial model improvement could be made if other regionalization approaches could be employed such as linear parameter estimation based on catchment descriptors hundecha et al 2016 future studies could examine this hypothesis 5 2 performance of regionalized parameters at ungauged basins hype with physiography and climate based regionalized parameters appears to perform as good as locally calibrated parameters and outperform global regionalization parameters in all flow signatures this result confirms findings of the previous studies that similarity in catchment characteristics and climate characteristics can lead to similarity in rainfall runoff responses beck et al 2016 berghuijs et al 2014 climatic indexes based on observations of precipitation and temperature during the same period with observations of streamflow could provide more dynamically agreeing characteristics of each catchment rather than using köppen climate classification which has different timeline with streamflow observation kottek et al 2006 the evaluated catchments are all vegetated either forest or agricultural lands catchments so the difference in physiography is not significant nevertheless physiography based regionalized parameters are demonstrated to predict well flow signatures in ungauged basins across europe donnelly et al 2016 this approach could be helpful for existing model using physiography based regionalized parameters to be further improved without altering the current parameter sets since this is a poorly gauged region obtaining more streamflow observations would be challenging therefore it is important to develop more approaches to validate the simulated streamflow from model for ungauged catchments the next section is one of those attempts another approach to cross validate simulated streamflow for ungauged catchments could be using ensemble learning regression combining satellite altimetry data and a hydrologic model which could be hype model in this case kim et al 2019c 5 3 model evaluation at ungauged basins using water level based flow correlation to evaluate model performance at ungauged basins both existing performance metrics of water levels and proposed water level based flow correlation were adopted inconsistent and even conflicting performance results using different performance metrics happened for both baseline and final models which make diagnosing and evaluating the model at ungauged basins difficult figs 12 and 13 meanwhile using water level based flow correlation method both in situ and envisat derived water levels can provide more details regarding model diagnostics of which signature needs to be further refined for instance in the baseline model fig 12 using the performance of the reference most highly correlated gauged catchments it informed that model could not capture low flow for both catchment group 3 and catchment group 4 for this study the threshold for identifying the most correlation catchments were only 0 7 because of limited ground observations data access in this region is particularly arduous therefore correlation threshold was lower than other studies archfield and vogel 2010 betterle et al 2017 betterle et al 2019 lower correlation threshold could have reduced the matching performance between the reference most highly correlated gauged catchments and ungauged catchments although the difference is not significant future research could further examine this hypothesis findings show that flow correlation method with in situ water level can be used to evaluate the performance of ungauged catchments through the most highly correlated gauged catchments for envisat derived water level since there are only three virtual stations located in catchments having ground observations three out of 17 envisat ungauged catchments have been validated nevertheless since this method was found to work with both in situ water level and three envisat virtual stations it is assumed that the remaining 14 envisat ungauged catchments could have similar satisfactory simulation to the reference gauged catchments it is expected that not only sub continental multi catchment hydrological models but also multi continental multi catchment hydrological models would benefit from this approach if water level based flow correlation was found between altimetry derived water level in ungauged catchments of a poorly gauged continent and streamflow in gauged catchments of another excessively gauged continent for instance if the study area of gm hype v1 3 could be extended along with water level based flow correlation the performance of the current non validated catchment group 2 of model could be validated meanwhile global scale model could more satisfactorily capture the full range of variability of hydrological regimes that actually exist within their large domains thus it can further increase the ability of hydrological models to be employed routinely and with confidence in ungauged basins more altimetry satellite missions with denser coverage in the future could further advance this approach to improve predictions of flow regimes in ungauged basins 6 conclusion the study uses a novel approach to combine regionalization and satellite observations of various hydrological variable to improve prediction of streamflow signatures at geopolitically ungauged basins using the proposed step wise physiography and climate based regionalization approach the model performance at ungauged basins reached 80 of performance of the ideal situation where observed streamflow data were available for calibration and significantly outperformed the global regionalization parameters using the köppen climate classification this approach would be helpful for both new model setup and existing process based distributed models because it is flexible and does not change the current parameter values of existing models additionally the proposed water level based flow correlation was found to help diagnose models and outperform the existing performance metrics of simulated water levels at ungauged basins it is expected that more satellite altimetry missions with a denser coverage in the future together with macroscale hydrological model either at continental scale or global scale with a wide variety of observed streamflow patterns alemaw and chaoka 2003 arheimer et al 2020 beck et al 2016 döll et al 2003 could benefit from this approach to further evaluate model performance in ungauged basins the study also helps to setup the first multi national multi catchment hydrological model in the greater mekong region the top global biodiversity and major disaster risk hotspot in the world this model version would be useful for water authorities to monitor and plan sustainable use of water resources across administrative boundaries under rapid changing development activities and climate impacts using a common hydrological model concept and setup approach compared to the global hydrological model would allow critical sharing of knowledge and experiences to advance toward a unified theory of hydrology at catchment scale and better predict flow signatures at ungauged basins nevertheless knowledge gaps in aquifers floodplain effect and water extraction by human have not been addressed future model version could be further improved such as using average of the nearest precipitation grids for better reproducing regimes in small catchments incorporating other hydrological data e g groundwater level total terrestrial storage change soil moisture and adding water management modules e g regulated reservoirs irrigation water quality to explore impacts of various changing scenarios from climate and human activities on the vital water food and energy security in the region web data portal could

5299,reoccurring drought through the early 2000s has caused a serious water scarcity issue in the colorado river basin previous modeling studies have focused on the impact of climate change without considering the adaptive behaviors of farmers and under utilized indian water rights in this paper we use a coupled agent based water resource model abm to investigate how the adaptive decisions of farmers can affect water resource management under both climate change impacts and fully utilized indian water right conditions we used five general circulation model projections with rcp8 5 scenarios for the study the results of farm level decision making showed different responses in irrigated areas that were changing due to climate change impact while winter precipitation changes might partially explain the behavior changes no specific pattern could be concluded based on their location also farmers responses about annual water diversion showed more significant inter year variation compared to irrigated areas basin level metrics showed that climate change impacts will generally worsen water scarcity issues as measured in navajo reservoir storage flow to lake powell and instream flow requirement but these basin level water scarcity metrics cannot reflect individual farm level impacts under climate change which is why modeling the bottom up management actions is necessary when the under utilized indian water rights are fully used it is more likely to trigger the shortage sharing agreement due to the higher tribal water depletion evaluation of model uncertainty and a more realistic setup for adaptive actions under drought contingency plans are suggested for future research keywords upper colorado river basin adaptive capacity agent based model drought contingency plans tribal water rights 1 introduction clean and sufficient water supply is one of the sustainable development goals prompted by the united nations un 2015 however water scarcity along with poor water quality and inadequate sanitation still plagues food security and livelihood choices for poor families across the world among many river basins suffering water scarcity around the world the colorado river basin crb in the united states us is one of the most important based on its quantity and supply coverage the entire crb is under water stress due to a long lasting drought dating back to the early 2000s udall and overpeck 2017 concluded that between 2000 and 2014 annual flow reductions averaged 19 3 this was below the 1906 1999 period which is the worst 15 year drought on record this long lasting drought raised the prospect of water delivery curtailments and decreased hydropower production among other effects steele et al 2018 stern and sheikh 2019 however despite previous efforts to alleviate future shortages the basin s hydrological outlook has generally worsened in recent years rhee et al 2019 numerous studies have concluded that ongoing climate change has worsened water scarcity in the crb due to streamflow decline for example cook et al 2019 dawadi and ahmad 2012 ficklin et al 2013 milly and dunne 2016 parsons et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 this decline has been statistically confirmed to be associated with the increasing temperature since the precipitation pattern in the region has not significantly changed for the past 50 years mccab et al 2017 udall and overpeck 2017 vano and lettenmaier 2014 woodhouse and pederson 2018 wi et al 2012 these previous studies focused on climate change impacts by discussing the risk of water scarcity on hydropower generation and irrigation but they did not have a quantitative analysis of adaptive water management actions such as water delivery curtailments water shortage sharing plans and adaptation of water conservation technology therefore without considering the demand response side of water management the suggested risk of water scarcity caused by climate change impacts might be over or underestimated we define adaptive water management in this paper as the societal response to mitigate water scarcity impacts in general these responses can be classified into top down planning such as the 2019 colorado river drought contingency plans dcps authorization act approved by congress p l 116 14 and bottom up behavioral reaction from local residents the dcp approach considered the entire basin establishing additional rules regulations and curtailment requirements across the riparian states for example under the 2019 upper crb dcp the upper basin states wyoming colorado utah and new mexico agree to manage upstream reservoirs to keep the surface of lake powell 35 feet above the minimum elevation needed to run the dam s hydroelectric plant also the demand management program in the 2019 dcp includes seller and buyer agreements allowing for temporary paid reductions in water use stern and sheikh 2019 however this top down planning might be difficult to implement in reality as highlighted by sullivan et al 2019 differences in rules and social norms are not addressed and they could cause problems when norms underlying rules are interpreted differently therefore they suggested a qualitative study that considers the power dynamics among stakeholders meanwhile the heterogeneous water conservation decision making process of different users need to be considered as suggested by taylor et al 2019 to help advance the dcp process these types of bottom up approaches have become popular in recent years studies have used the decentralized management concept garrick 2018 yang et al 2009 or abm hyun et al 2019 khan et al 2017 yang et al 2019 to quantify the behavior change of local residents as a bottom up adaptive management plan another challenge of future water management in the crb especially the upper crb is the under utilized indian water rights these water rights are often the most senior in a basin and their highest priority holds even if other users may have already developed a water infrastructure of their own jankowski 2018 the full utilization of indian water rights will affect other established users even if existing water users can lease water from tribes the additional cost and technological and legal barriers will be a challenge bushnell 2012 there are 22 recognized tribes in the entire crb and they are collectively entitled to 2 9 million acre feet maf 3 6 billion cubic meters bcm per year of colorado river water in the upper crb the current tribal water diversion is about 0 67 maf 0 83 bcm per year but the reserved plus unresolved water rights might push the total water diversion toward 1 82 maf 2 24 bcm per year a 300 increase usbr 2018 therefore it is necessary to consider fully utilized indian water rights in the crb for any water management studies and quantify their effect in the dcp or adaptive management plan to address these research gaps the objective of this paper is to quantify bottom up adaptive water management from farmers under climate change impacts and fully used indian water rights we apply a coupled agent based water resources model hyun et al 2019 to simulate different climate change scenarios while considering farmers adaptive behaviors i e their decisions on water withdrawal can change year by year based on previous experiences and future water availability we also test the influence of under utilized indian water rights following bennett et al 2019 to identify the timing and magnitude of farmers behavioral changes the san juan river basin located in the upper crb was selected as the case study area the rest of the paper is structured as follows we introduce the water use situation in the study area in section 2 the model that we applied and the scenarios we tested are presented in section 3 we show different scenario results from the model at the system and farmer level in section 4 the model uncertainty issue and limitations are discussed in section 5 followed by the conclusions 2 water uses in the san juan river basin the san juan river sjr basin fig 1 is a representative of the diversity present across the crb with a drainage area of 64 570 km2 the upper sjr originates in the san juan mountains part of the rocky mountains of colorado that imparts a snowmelt driven character to the runoff the lower sjr located in new mexico and arizona traverses high desert with intermittent streams that drain into the main tributary of the san juan during the summer when they are charged by summer monsoonal rains bennett et al 2019 all of these physical characteristics are very similar to the entire crb and make it a suitable candidate for the demonstration the navajo nation is the largest water user in the sjr and its current water diversion is utilized mostly for agriculture by the navajo indian irrigation project niip this is a result of years of negotiation among the navajo nation the us government and the state of new mexico and it finally became federal law in 2009 bennett et al 2019 currently niip only diverts 50 of its water rights which is about 200 000 acre feet 247 million cubic meters however according to the 2009 settlement water uses by the navajo nation will increase with the expansion of the niip there are 16 other major irrigation ditches four cities and two power plants located in new mexico also use water from the sjr irrigation is the largest portion of non tribal water use followed by the cooling water uses for the two power plants the main planting season runs from may to october with hay corn and vegetables as the principal crops in the region navajo reservoir is the main water infrastructure in the basin which is used for flood control irrigation domestic industrial water supply and environmental flows the active storage of the reservoir is 1 3 maf 1 6 bcm the maximum release rate is limited to 5000 cubic feet per second cfs or 141 58 cubic meters per second cms the updated regional water plan 2016 summarizes the corresponding action that water users in the sjr need to take under drought conditions the ten largest water users have cooperated to develop a shortage sharing agreement to keep navajo reservoir from drawing down the reservoir pool elevation below 5990 ft 2041 m which is the elevation required for niip diversion the agreement stipulates that all parties share equally in shortages caused by drought 2013 2016 shortage agreement is available at https www fws gov southwest sjrip dr ss03 cfm the 2019 upper crb dcp requires the navajo reservoir s operation along with others such as blue mesa reservoir and flaming gorge reservoir not in the sjr basin to maintain the water level in lake powell potentially through a drawdown of their own storage however no detailed information is available on how navajo reservoir might change its operation at the time this paper is written february 2020 3 method and scenario setup 3 1 modeling approaches for water resources in the sjr the sjr has been the target of several previous modeling studies ewers 2005 used a system dynamics model to evaluate the tradeoff between competing water uses in irrigation and power generation however this model was not process based and used a stochastic flow generator to simulate inflow water supply the setup for navajo reservoir and niip water use was overly simplified and did not fully represent the complexity of water infrastructure operation in the basin ficklin et al 2013 developed a soil and water assessment tool model for the entire upper crb they used the naturalized flow for calibration targets and did not consider the water withdrawal and reservoir operation bennett et al 2018 used the variable infiltration capacity vic model to evaluate the impact of forest distribution on streamflow under climate change similar to ficklin et al 2013 this study only considered the naturalized flow bennett et al 2019 conducted a follow up study and used a vic riverware modeling framework to address the water infrastructure complexity in the sjr they tested the climate change and niip water use impact on five key basin wide metrics we followed bennett et al 2019 and added the adaptive behavior of farmers into the modeling framework via abm to further evaluate the influence of bottom up adaptive management in this basin hyun et al 2019 developed an agent based riverware modeling abm riverware framework that quantified the decisions of major irrigation districts on water withdrawal and irrigated areas in the new mexico portion of the sjr this abm riverware model requires climatic from vic and hydrologic inputs from colorado surface water availability statemod for the reservoir and river routing simulation as well as factors that affect farmer behavior for the simulation of agent decisions a schematic of the modeling platform is given in fig 2 the 16 major irrigation districts in new mexico are grouped by location as upstream of navajo reservoir group 1 the animas river group 2 and downstream of navajo reservoir group 3 this abm riverware framework uses bayesian inference bi mapping to quantify the psychological thought process of farmers with a cognitive map between decisions and relevant preceding factors that could affect decision making a risk perception parameter the λ value in hyun et al 2019 is used in the bi mapping to represent farmer beliefs in the preceding factors and treated as parameters to be calibrated the range of the λ values is from 0 5 risk averse which means farmers will make decisions fully dependent on their previous experience to 1 risk seeking which means farmers will make decisions fully dependent on new information the preceding factors we used in this study are 1 next year s winter precipitation as a proxy of the snowpack 2 last year s flow violation at the basin outlet 3 navajo reservoir storage at the end of the water year september and 4 last year s niip annual water diversion these preceding factors have been confirmed as the main factors for farmers making irrigation decisions in the region and some example cognitive maps that visually link farmers irrigation decisions with those factors can be found in hyun et al 2019 the framework also used the cost loss model to address farmer behavior caused by changing socioeconomic conditions z value in hyun et al 2019 the z value which was calculated as the ratio between the expected cost of taking management action that will potentially increase the gross economic profit and the expected opportunity loss of not taking such management action is an abstract representation of an agent s profitability with 1 being extremely profitable and 0 being absolutely unprofitable their results showed that historical adaptive behaviors could be captured by this abm riverware framework and they provided an improved representation of human decision making processes compared to conventional rule based abms which do not take risk perception into account technical details of this abm riverware framework can be found in hyun et al 2019 we utilized this framework in this paper to understand how these adaptive behaviors might evolve under climate change we recalibrated the abm riverware framework using irrigated area data after the 1960s the main reason was that farmer beliefs in the preceding factors showed a significant change after the navajo reservoir was built especially for downstream farmers like hammond and fruitland cambridge because of the missing precipitation data issue in the noaa database prism monthly winter precipitation products prism 2019 were applied in this study the recalibration results using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliff 1970 and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 are shown in figs s1 and s2 respectively and the calibrated abm parameters for each agent λ and z values are listed in table s1 in the supplementary materials 3 2 scenarios and water scarcity metrics several previous studies quantified the climate change impact on streamflow at the sjr for example wilby et al 1999 and miller et al 2011 used raw and statistically downscaled general circulation model gcm outputs to simulate the streamflow in the sjr and its tributary both of their results showed a decreasing trend in streamflow under climate change bennett et al 2018 and bennett et al 2019 used five gcms ipsl cm5a lr canesm2 ipsl cm5b lr hadgem2 es and miroc esm and they used the latest representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 projection in cmip5 talyor et al 2012 for a similar purpose in this paper we used the same five gcms and rcp 8 5 projection as our climate change scenarios with a simpler naming system ipsl5ar ipsl cm5a lr canesm canesm2 ipsl5b ipsl cm5b lr hadgem2 hadgem2 es and miroc miroc esm fig s3 in the supplement materials shows the mid term and long term climate projections of the five gcms all five gcms predict a warmer climate with an increase of temperature 2 4 3 6 c and only ipsl5ar and hadgem2 predict a drier climate the winter precipitation a key preceding factor that affects agent decisions change inside the san juan basin from these five gcms was also compared with the historical range prism data in fig s3 of the supplemental materials following bennett et al 2019 we used five different basin wide metrics to compare water scarcity across different scenarios table 1 mean annual storage in navajo reservoir provided a general measure of water available to the basin for use san juan chama diversions transboundary water supply via the san juan chama project to the rio grande basin provided a general measure of impact beyond the sjr the total annual shortage was summarized within the sjr basin water shortage from all irrigation districts mean average streamflow at bluff ut represented the water contribution from the sjr to the entire upper crb lake powell impacts on environmental or instream flows were measured at the four corners gage located near the border of new mexico and arizona current operations have a minimum target of 21 days above 5000 cubic feet per second cfs 14 15 cubic meter per second between march 1 and july 31 to maintain the critical habitat fig 3 summarizes all scenarios tested in this paper the abm riverware model is used to quantify farmer decisions about irrigation area and annual water diversion and their resulting impact on five basin level evaluation metrics under 1 historical climate 2 future climate and 3 the combination of climate scenarios with changing niip water diversions we used three different settings for future farmer behaviors to test the impact of bottom up management 1 business as usual used 2013 irrigated areas of each agent throughout the entire simulation period 2 historical minimum irrigated areas of each agent as a boundary condition test were used and 3 dynamically changing irrigated areas with abm were used as the adaptive management the results in the next section follow this logic 4 results 4 1 climate change impacts on farmer decisions fig 4 shows the historical irrigated areas from 1929 to 2013 as black dash lines for each of the 16 irrigation districts and the future irrigated area under five gcms plus full niip water diversion with different colored lines the x axis is the year and the y axis is the irrigated area in acres 1 acre 0 40 ha note that we assume the framers risk perceptions λ toward preceding factors and external socioeconomic conditions z are constant but since the preceding factors themselves especially winter precipitation are changing the actual decision of farmers will change accordingly overall most irrigation districts showed a decreasing pattern of irrigated areas under most of the future climate conditions and to a large extent the curves seemed to follow the historical trend among future climate scenarios ipsl5ar tended to have the lowest irrigated area as they were the driest gcm basin wide canesm and miroc predicted relatively wetter future climate conditions but not every district showed an increasing trend of irrigated areas some interesting pattern of irrigated area tipping points was observed and can potentially be explained by winter precipitation patterns for example ipsl5ar showed a medium winter precipitation value in the upstream of the navajo reservoir region group 1 fig 4a which was the reason the irrigated area under ipsl5ar was not the lowest also the average winter precipitation had a clear shift around 2050 from 147 mm to 126 mm which could possibly cause the trend to change from increasing to decreasing in the irrigated area of nmpineriverarealr a similar reason also caused a tipping point from increasing to decreasing irrigation area in echoditch around 2080 under hadgem2 under ipsl5b some districts jicarilla twinrock farmingtonglade and echoditch in group 1 fig 4a and group 2 animas river fig 4b had a tipping point around 2045 can be explained by the winter precipitation trend the tipping points indicated that available water for agriculture uses reached its potential and the drier climate condition could subdue the agriculture production before 2045 there was a slightly increasing trend of winter precipitation until 2050 the winter precipitation of group 1 and group 2 under these gcms are given in the supplemental materials fig s4 different agents risk perception and their relative upstream downstream location might also affect their decision for example risk perception parameters showed that jicarilla is a risk averse agent with lower λ values while nmpineriverareair is a risk seeking agent with higher λ values under the ipsl5ar scenario the winter precipitation showed a decreasing trend so jicarilla gradually adjusts its irrigation area to adapt the future climate nmpineriverareair was optimistic about the future water availability until it realized that winter precipitation decreased and then it was forced to make a significant change in the irrigation area however under wetter gcm like canesm the increasing irrigated area in jicarilla might partially result in nmpineriverareair decreasing the irrigated area among the 16 irrigation ditches six of them citzenditch fig 4c hammond fig 4c farmersmutal fig 4b fruitlandandcambridge fig 4c jewettvalley fig 4c and hogback fig 4c participated in the shortage sharing agreement and in our abm setting we hypothesized that these districts responded to the agreement and curtailed their irrigated area by half of the previous year after multiple years of irrigated area curtailment this setting allowed us to mimic a real world migration effect if local framers decided to move out of the basin the modeling results showed that toward 2100 under the driest future climate condition ipsl5ar irrigated areas of these six irrigation ditches will become close to zero which indicated that these farmers may move out of the sjr basin a similar pattern of farmers was observed in previous abm studies hailegiorgis et al 2018 this hypothesis needs additional tests in future studies with experts from the population dynamic we further address this topic in the discussion section fig 5 shows the annual water diversion for irrigation of these 16 agents under different climate change plus full niip water diversion impacts from 2014 toward the end of this century in general the trend either increasing or decreasing was very similar to the irrigated area in fig 4 however the annual water diversion showed a larger inter year variation than the irrigated area the main reason for this variation was because the annual irrigation requirement was calculated inside riverware by evapotranspiration since precipitation and temperature changed every year the irrigation requirement also changed accordingly for the irrigated areas also this inter year variation was largest for agents located in the animas river this was because the total water availability in the tributary i e the animas river was limited compared to the mainstem sjr 4 2 climate change impacts on five basin level metrics the impact of future climate change plus full niip water diversion on five basin level metrics are shown in fig 6 fig 6a shows the mean annual storage of the navajo reservoir that represents basin water availability in general water storage in navajo reservoir under climate change will be at a similar level as historical climate conditions except for the driest gcm ipsl5ar this result was comparable with bennett et al 2019 and confirmed that the navajo reservoir has the capacity to smooth the intensifying inter annual flow variability driven by climate change fig 6b shows that in terms of water export from sjr to the rio grande basin miroc will result in a similar level of water export but other gcms showed a decreasing pattern in san juan chama project diversion while hadgem2 and ipsl5ar result in the largest shortages among the five gcms bennett et al 2019 also showed that these two gcms will cause the largest out of the basin water delivery shortage fig 6c shows the sum of the local water shortage among irrigation districts the driest gcm ipsl5ar showed a severe local water shortage as expected fig 6d shows the average streamflow to lake powell that tries to fulfill the upper colorado water compact again it is not surprising that the two drier gcms ipsl5ar and hadgem2 showed the lowest flow and miroc a relatively wetter gcm showed an increase of streamflow to lake powell bennett et al 2019 also showed miroc and canesm had higher than historical water delivery to lake powell finally fig 6e shows the numbers of days between march and july that has daily streamflow at four corners larger than 5000 cfs the black dash line represents the minimal 21 day target the wetter gcm miroc shows more years that this target will be met 66 out of 85 simulation years and the drier gcm ipsl5ar shows the least years 24 out of 85 simulation years a similar conclusion was made by bennett et al 2019 that meeting minimum flow requirements was likely to be a major challenge in the sjr under climate change impacts we used the wetter gcm miroc and the drier gcm ipsl5ar to test how bottom up management might help mitigate the negative impact at a basin wide scale fig 7 showed the results when we changed the irrigated area setting from dynamic adaptive behavior driven by abm into the 1 constant 2013 area for all districts the year 2013 is the latest year we have the historical value or 2 the historical minimal irrigated area value for all districts the results indicated that at the basin level these three different settings of future farmer behavior did not result in any differences under mirco under the ipsl5ar some small improvements were observed in navajo storage local water shortage streamflow to lake powell and instream flow requirement under the minimum irrigated area setting when we compare figs 4 5 and 7 we can highlight the differences of climate change impact on individual irrigation districts and basin wide metrics while climate change impact might significantly affect some irrigation districts irrigated areas fig 4 and water diversions fig 5 these behavioral changes are not observed in any of the basin wide water scarcity metrics fig 7 this comparison shows water allocation in this basin is close to a zero sum game while someone use more water others must use less water to satisfy the basin wide constraints therefore basin wide water scarcity metrics might not be able to reflect the changing local water diversion and irrigated area conditions when policymakers try to implement any dcp in this basin they should consider this situation and incorporate heterogeneous bottom up decision making process from farmers behavioral change in the dcp 4 3 sensitivity of the unutilized niip water rights section 4 1 and section 4 2 demonstrated the impact of full utilization of indian water rights on both farmer and basin level water scarcity in this section we went a step further and showed the impact of indian water rights on individual irrigation districts in the sjr basin we changed the annual niip depletion target inside riverware from full water use to current water use the annual depletion for all tested runs is given in the supplemental materials fig s5 in the abm setting the niip depletion will directly affect agents in group 3 downstream of navajo reservoir because niip directly takes water from the navajo reservoir the niip depletion also indirectly affects other agents because navajo storage affects all agents especially agents who participated in the shortage sharing agreement fig 8 shows six agents including all three groups as a demonstration of current and full utilization of indian water rights under the wetter gcm canesm and drier gcm ipsl5ar conditions the modeling results showed that under wetter future climate conditions most agents would slightly reduce their irrigated areas and associated water diversions to allow larger water storage in the navajo reservoir and fulfill the full use of niip diversion solid gray lines are lower than dotted gray lines this difference was more noticeable in group 3 agents because they were located downstream of the navajo reservoir a similar pattern was observed under the dry future climate condition solid blue lines lower than dotted blue lines meant that all agents were reducing their own irrigated areas and water diversions however one significant difference was the triggering of the shortage sharing agreement the current niip water diversion under the drier future climate condition would not trigger the shortage sharing agreement therefore even with some water scarcity issues most farmers will remain in the region if niip will maintain the current water use this result implied that the expansion of the most senior water rights in the basin might potentially drive junior water right users out 5 discussion 5 1 informing dcp implementation with modeling results the coupled abm riverware model was applied in this paper to evaluate the impact of climate change plus full niip water diversion on both farmer decisions concerning irrigated areas and the resulting impacts of agent decisions on five basin level water scarcity metrics in the first discussion section we tried to explain how our modeling results provide information for basin wide dcp implementation in our simulation sjr delivered an average of 1 14 maf per year to lake powell under historical climate conditions miroc canesm and ipsl5b showed increasing streamflow 1 450 1 246 and 1 224 maf respectively and hadgem2 and ipsl5a showed decreasing streamflow 0 927 and 0 807 maf if we use historical climate conditions as a basis under miroc canesm and ipsl5b sjr basin had the potential to contribute an additional 0 309 0 105 and 0 083 maf per year to lake powell respectively alternatively the average navajo reservoir storage is about 1 283 maf under historical climate conditions again if we used this value as a basis our results showed that under miroc canesm and ipsl5b the navajo reservoir can release additional 0 129 0 013 and 0 085 maf downstream if we combine these two water sources there will be an additional 0 438 0 118 and 0 168 maf of water delivered to lake powell and the lower basin under miroc canesm and ipsl5b respectively although these amounts are not a significant amount of water it can help with water curtailment in the lower basin and mexico for example the additional 0 438 maf under mirco can cover 100 of the water curtailment in the lower basin and mexico if lake mead s water level drops to 1075 1090 ft stern and sheikh 2019 even if the water level dropped to 1050 1075 ft this amount of water could cover 70 of the curtailment stern and sheikh 2019 these results indicated that if the upper basin dcp can be implemented properly the water scarcity condition in the entire crb can be mitigated 5 2 effect of parameter uncertainty on modeling results in the results section we demonstrated the effect of different gcms by using five gcm outcomes and the effects of under utilized indian water rights via different model settings to further improve this coupled modeling framework we tested the uncertainty associated with the model itself in general three types of uncertainty are commonly discussed in the scientific community yang and wi 2018 model input uncertainty i e data uncertainty model structure uncertainty i e equation uncertainty and model parameter uncertainty previous studies have discussed the data uncertainty vano et al 2014 and model structure uncertainty miller et al 2012 in the crb and we want to further explore the effect of model parameter uncertainty and test the equifinality issue beven 2006 on our results in the model calibration process we applied the monte carlo approach to test 200 parameter sets the best 20 sets with the highest nse value compared to historical irrigated areas were selected the calibration results of these sets are shown in fig s6 of the supplemental materials we then ran the abm riverware model under the driest gcm ipsl5ar using these best 20 sets and showed the results in fig 9 in fig 9 the results of the best set are highlighted by blue lines which are the parameters we used in section 4 the results of the other 19 sets are shown as gray lines fig 9a shows the farmer s irrigated area and fig 9b c and d show three basin level water scarcity metrics the navajo storage streamflow to lake powell and the number of days between march and july above 5000 cfs at four corners respectively the effect of model parameter uncertainty was more significant at the farmer level than the basin level among agents those located downstream of the navajo reservoir group 3 showed the largest variation in the irrigated area compared to groups 1 and 2 this was because the navajo reservoir provides a more stable water supply to the downstream irrigation districts therefore different sets of risk perception parameters λ and socioeconomic condition parameters z might be able to achieve a similar value of nse i e equifinality issue the actual annual diversion of each agent is in the supplemental materials fig s7 fig 9b c and d barely showed any differences to indicate that basin level metrics will not be able to demonstrate the equifinality issue this could be a concern of those modeling studies that only focus on basin level results and want to explore the effect of dcp at the local level a comprehensive evaluation of model uncertainty might be needed in the future to further explore this aspect 5 3 model limitation there are other limitations and assumptions in our model worth further discussion first the hypothesis of the action of future farmers on the shortage sharing agreement will need further examination the current abm assumes 50 curtailment of irrigated areas change which is an arbitrary number and the migration results cannot be confirmed with any historical data the curtailment of irrigated areas can be updated by standalone riverware simulation to reflect actual shortages of water furthermore a survey study or local farmer engagement workshops will be needed to quantify the likelihood of local intentions for migration under drought conditions second as we mentioned in section 2 no detailed information is available about how the navajo reservoir will change its operation under upper colorado dcp when such information becomes available the same model can incorporate the new operation rule and test the effect on both basin level water scarcity metrics and farmer level decisions we can also use such information to verify our discussion in section 5 1 about whether sjr can help with the water curtailment in the lower basin finally even though we have metrics to look at climate change impact beyond the sjr basin streamflow lake powell and water export to the rio grande a regional scale model such as the colorado river simulation system can better show how these changes might affect the entire crb 6 conclusion the continuous drought through the early 2000s has caused a serious water scarcity issue in the crb while different modeling approaches have been used to quantify the impact of climate change only a few consider the adaptive behaviors of farmers and the combined effect of climate change and under utilized indian water rights this paper used a coupled abm riverware model to quantify the bottom up adaptive water management under climate change as well as the influence of under utilized indian water rights to identify the potential tipping point of farmer behavioral changes that is the timing of farmer decisions to switch from increasing to decreasing irrigation area the case study results of the sjr basin show that 1 farmers have different responses to expand or reduce irrigated areas to climate change impact while changes in winter precipitation might partially explain the behavioral tipping point no specific pattern can be concluded based on their location 2 farmer responses to annual water diversion showed larger inter year variation compared to irrigated area and farmers located along the animas river showed the highest variation because the water supply in the tributary is relatively limited 3 climate change will in general worsen water scarcity issues in different basin level metrics such as navajo reservoir storage flow to lake powell and instream flow requirements which echo several previous studies 4 basin level water scarcity metrics cannot reflect farm level impacts under climate change which emphasizes the importance of modeling bottom up management actions 5 full utilization of indian water rights will likely trigger the shortage sharing agreement under the drier future climate compare to current tribal water use future studies can focus on several different directions to improve the results of this work a comprehensive evaluation of modeling uncertainty including input data model structure i e equations and model parameters can benefit the scientific community and advance our understanding of the coupled human natural system model the irrigated area curtailment under drought condition the effect of reservoir reoperation under drought contingency plan and the regional impact beyond the sjr basin all need further evaluation also interviews with farmers or surveys about farmer decision behaviors can improve our understanding of the decision process the abm modeling which is another future research direction credit authorship

5299,reoccurring drought through the early 2000s has caused a serious water scarcity issue in the colorado river basin previous modeling studies have focused on the impact of climate change without considering the adaptive behaviors of farmers and under utilized indian water rights in this paper we use a coupled agent based water resource model abm to investigate how the adaptive decisions of farmers can affect water resource management under both climate change impacts and fully utilized indian water right conditions we used five general circulation model projections with rcp8 5 scenarios for the study the results of farm level decision making showed different responses in irrigated areas that were changing due to climate change impact while winter precipitation changes might partially explain the behavior changes no specific pattern could be concluded based on their location also farmers responses about annual water diversion showed more significant inter year variation compared to irrigated areas basin level metrics showed that climate change impacts will generally worsen water scarcity issues as measured in navajo reservoir storage flow to lake powell and instream flow requirement but these basin level water scarcity metrics cannot reflect individual farm level impacts under climate change which is why modeling the bottom up management actions is necessary when the under utilized indian water rights are fully used it is more likely to trigger the shortage sharing agreement due to the higher tribal water depletion evaluation of model uncertainty and a more realistic setup for adaptive actions under drought contingency plans are suggested for future research keywords upper colorado river basin adaptive capacity agent based model drought contingency plans tribal water rights 1 introduction clean and sufficient water supply is one of the sustainable development goals prompted by the united nations un 2015 however water scarcity along with poor water quality and inadequate sanitation still plagues food security and livelihood choices for poor families across the world among many river basins suffering water scarcity around the world the colorado river basin crb in the united states us is one of the most important based on its quantity and supply coverage the entire crb is under water stress due to a long lasting drought dating back to the early 2000s udall and overpeck 2017 concluded that between 2000 and 2014 annual flow reductions averaged 19 3 this was below the 1906 1999 period which is the worst 15 year drought on record this long lasting drought raised the prospect of water delivery curtailments and decreased hydropower production among other effects steele et al 2018 stern and sheikh 2019 however despite previous efforts to alleviate future shortages the basin s hydrological outlook has generally worsened in recent years rhee et al 2019 numerous studies have concluded that ongoing climate change has worsened water scarcity in the crb due to streamflow decline for example cook et al 2019 dawadi and ahmad 2012 ficklin et al 2013 milly and dunne 2016 parsons et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 this decline has been statistically confirmed to be associated with the increasing temperature since the precipitation pattern in the region has not significantly changed for the past 50 years mccab et al 2017 udall and overpeck 2017 vano and lettenmaier 2014 woodhouse and pederson 2018 wi et al 2012 these previous studies focused on climate change impacts by discussing the risk of water scarcity on hydropower generation and irrigation but they did not have a quantitative analysis of adaptive water management actions such as water delivery curtailments water shortage sharing plans and adaptation of water conservation technology therefore without considering the demand response side of water management the suggested risk of water scarcity caused by climate change impacts might be over or underestimated we define adaptive water management in this paper as the societal response to mitigate water scarcity impacts in general these responses can be classified into top down planning such as the 2019 colorado river drought contingency plans dcps authorization act approved by congress p l 116 14 and bottom up behavioral reaction from local residents the dcp approach considered the entire basin establishing additional rules regulations and curtailment requirements across the riparian states for example under the 2019 upper crb dcp the upper basin states wyoming colorado utah and new mexico agree to manage upstream reservoirs to keep the surface of lake powell 35 feet above the minimum elevation needed to run the dam s hydroelectric plant also the demand management program in the 2019 dcp includes seller and buyer agreements allowing for temporary paid reductions in water use stern and sheikh 2019 however this top down planning might be difficult to implement in reality as highlighted by sullivan et al 2019 differences in rules and social norms are not addressed and they could cause problems when norms underlying rules are interpreted differently therefore they suggested a qualitative study that considers the power dynamics among stakeholders meanwhile the heterogeneous water conservation decision making process of different users need to be considered as suggested by taylor et al 2019 to help advance the dcp process these types of bottom up approaches have become popular in recent years studies have used the decentralized management concept garrick 2018 yang et al 2009 or abm hyun et al 2019 khan et al 2017 yang et al 2019 to quantify the behavior change of local residents as a bottom up adaptive management plan another challenge of future water management in the crb especially the upper crb is the under utilized indian water rights these water rights are often the most senior in a basin and their highest priority holds even if other users may have already developed a water infrastructure of their own jankowski 2018 the full utilization of indian water rights will affect other established users even if existing water users can lease water from tribes the additional cost and technological and legal barriers will be a challenge bushnell 2012 there are 22 recognized tribes in the entire crb and they are collectively entitled to 2 9 million acre feet maf 3 6 billion cubic meters bcm per year of colorado river water in the upper crb the current tribal water diversion is about 0 67 maf 0 83 bcm per year but the reserved plus unresolved water rights might push the total water diversion toward 1 82 maf 2 24 bcm per year a 300 increase usbr 2018 therefore it is necessary to consider fully utilized indian water rights in the crb for any water management studies and quantify their effect in the dcp or adaptive management plan to address these research gaps the objective of this paper is to quantify bottom up adaptive water management from farmers under climate change impacts and fully used indian water rights we apply a coupled agent based water resources model hyun et al 2019 to simulate different climate change scenarios while considering farmers adaptive behaviors i e their decisions on water withdrawal can change year by year based on previous experiences and future water availability we also test the influence of under utilized indian water rights following bennett et al 2019 to identify the timing and magnitude of farmers behavioral changes the san juan river basin located in the upper crb was selected as the case study area the rest of the paper is structured as follows we introduce the water use situation in the study area in section 2 the model that we applied and the scenarios we tested are presented in section 3 we show different scenario results from the model at the system and farmer level in section 4 the model uncertainty issue and limitations are discussed in section 5 followed by the conclusions 2 water uses in the san juan river basin the san juan river sjr basin fig 1 is a representative of the diversity present across the crb with a drainage area of 64 570 km2 the upper sjr originates in the san juan mountains part of the rocky mountains of colorado that imparts a snowmelt driven character to the runoff the lower sjr located in new mexico and arizona traverses high desert with intermittent streams that drain into the main tributary of the san juan during the summer when they are charged by summer monsoonal rains bennett et al 2019 all of these physical characteristics are very similar to the entire crb and make it a suitable candidate for the demonstration the navajo nation is the largest water user in the sjr and its current water diversion is utilized mostly for agriculture by the navajo indian irrigation project niip this is a result of years of negotiation among the navajo nation the us government and the state of new mexico and it finally became federal law in 2009 bennett et al 2019 currently niip only diverts 50 of its water rights which is about 200 000 acre feet 247 million cubic meters however according to the 2009 settlement water uses by the navajo nation will increase with the expansion of the niip there are 16 other major irrigation ditches four cities and two power plants located in new mexico also use water from the sjr irrigation is the largest portion of non tribal water use followed by the cooling water uses for the two power plants the main planting season runs from may to october with hay corn and vegetables as the principal crops in the region navajo reservoir is the main water infrastructure in the basin which is used for flood control irrigation domestic industrial water supply and environmental flows the active storage of the reservoir is 1 3 maf 1 6 bcm the maximum release rate is limited to 5000 cubic feet per second cfs or 141 58 cubic meters per second cms the updated regional water plan 2016 summarizes the corresponding action that water users in the sjr need to take under drought conditions the ten largest water users have cooperated to develop a shortage sharing agreement to keep navajo reservoir from drawing down the reservoir pool elevation below 5990 ft 2041 m which is the elevation required for niip diversion the agreement stipulates that all parties share equally in shortages caused by drought 2013 2016 shortage agreement is available at https www fws gov southwest sjrip dr ss03 cfm the 2019 upper crb dcp requires the navajo reservoir s operation along with others such as blue mesa reservoir and flaming gorge reservoir not in the sjr basin to maintain the water level in lake powell potentially through a drawdown of their own storage however no detailed information is available on how navajo reservoir might change its operation at the time this paper is written february 2020 3 method and scenario setup 3 1 modeling approaches for water resources in the sjr the sjr has been the target of several previous modeling studies ewers 2005 used a system dynamics model to evaluate the tradeoff between competing water uses in irrigation and power generation however this model was not process based and used a stochastic flow generator to simulate inflow water supply the setup for navajo reservoir and niip water use was overly simplified and did not fully represent the complexity of water infrastructure operation in the basin ficklin et al 2013 developed a soil and water assessment tool model for the entire upper crb they used the naturalized flow for calibration targets and did not consider the water withdrawal and reservoir operation bennett et al 2018 used the variable infiltration capacity vic model to evaluate the impact of forest distribution on streamflow under climate change similar to ficklin et al 2013 this study only considered the naturalized flow bennett et al 2019 conducted a follow up study and used a vic riverware modeling framework to address the water infrastructure complexity in the sjr they tested the climate change and niip water use impact on five key basin wide metrics we followed bennett et al 2019 and added the adaptive behavior of farmers into the modeling framework via abm to further evaluate the influence of bottom up adaptive management in this basin hyun et al 2019 developed an agent based riverware modeling abm riverware framework that quantified the decisions of major irrigation districts on water withdrawal and irrigated areas in the new mexico portion of the sjr this abm riverware model requires climatic from vic and hydrologic inputs from colorado surface water availability statemod for the reservoir and river routing simulation as well as factors that affect farmer behavior for the simulation of agent decisions a schematic of the modeling platform is given in fig 2 the 16 major irrigation districts in new mexico are grouped by location as upstream of navajo reservoir group 1 the animas river group 2 and downstream of navajo reservoir group 3 this abm riverware framework uses bayesian inference bi mapping to quantify the psychological thought process of farmers with a cognitive map between decisions and relevant preceding factors that could affect decision making a risk perception parameter the λ value in hyun et al 2019 is used in the bi mapping to represent farmer beliefs in the preceding factors and treated as parameters to be calibrated the range of the λ values is from 0 5 risk averse which means farmers will make decisions fully dependent on their previous experience to 1 risk seeking which means farmers will make decisions fully dependent on new information the preceding factors we used in this study are 1 next year s winter precipitation as a proxy of the snowpack 2 last year s flow violation at the basin outlet 3 navajo reservoir storage at the end of the water year september and 4 last year s niip annual water diversion these preceding factors have been confirmed as the main factors for farmers making irrigation decisions in the region and some example cognitive maps that visually link farmers irrigation decisions with those factors can be found in hyun et al 2019 the framework also used the cost loss model to address farmer behavior caused by changing socioeconomic conditions z value in hyun et al 2019 the z value which was calculated as the ratio between the expected cost of taking management action that will potentially increase the gross economic profit and the expected opportunity loss of not taking such management action is an abstract representation of an agent s profitability with 1 being extremely profitable and 0 being absolutely unprofitable their results showed that historical adaptive behaviors could be captured by this abm riverware framework and they provided an improved representation of human decision making processes compared to conventional rule based abms which do not take risk perception into account technical details of this abm riverware framework can be found in hyun et al 2019 we utilized this framework in this paper to understand how these adaptive behaviors might evolve under climate change we recalibrated the abm riverware framework using irrigated area data after the 1960s the main reason was that farmer beliefs in the preceding factors showed a significant change after the navajo reservoir was built especially for downstream farmers like hammond and fruitland cambridge because of the missing precipitation data issue in the noaa database prism monthly winter precipitation products prism 2019 were applied in this study the recalibration results using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliff 1970 and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 are shown in figs s1 and s2 respectively and the calibrated abm parameters for each agent λ and z values are listed in table s1 in the supplementary materials 3 2 scenarios and water scarcity metrics several previous studies quantified the climate change impact on streamflow at the sjr for example wilby et al 1999 and miller et al 2011 used raw and statistically downscaled general circulation model gcm outputs to simulate the streamflow in the sjr and its tributary both of their results showed a decreasing trend in streamflow under climate change bennett et al 2018 and bennett et al 2019 used five gcms ipsl cm5a lr canesm2 ipsl cm5b lr hadgem2 es and miroc esm and they used the latest representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 projection in cmip5 talyor et al 2012 for a similar purpose in this paper we used the same five gcms and rcp 8 5 projection as our climate change scenarios with a simpler naming system ipsl5ar ipsl cm5a lr canesm canesm2 ipsl5b ipsl cm5b lr hadgem2 hadgem2 es and miroc miroc esm fig s3 in the supplement materials shows the mid term and long term climate projections of the five gcms all five gcms predict a warmer climate with an increase of temperature 2 4 3 6 c and only ipsl5ar and hadgem2 predict a drier climate the winter precipitation a key preceding factor that affects agent decisions change inside the san juan basin from these five gcms was also compared with the historical range prism data in fig s3 of the supplemental materials following bennett et al 2019 we used five different basin wide metrics to compare water scarcity across different scenarios table 1 mean annual storage in navajo reservoir provided a general measure of water available to the basin for use san juan chama diversions transboundary water supply via the san juan chama project to the rio grande basin provided a general measure of impact beyond the sjr the total annual shortage was summarized within the sjr basin water shortage from all irrigation districts mean average streamflow at bluff ut represented the water contribution from the sjr to the entire upper crb lake powell impacts on environmental or instream flows were measured at the four corners gage located near the border of new mexico and arizona current operations have a minimum target of 21 days above 5000 cubic feet per second cfs 14 15 cubic meter per second between march 1 and july 31 to maintain the critical habitat fig 3 summarizes all scenarios tested in this paper the abm riverware model is used to quantify farmer decisions about irrigation area and annual water diversion and their resulting impact on five basin level evaluation metrics under 1 historical climate 2 future climate and 3 the combination of climate scenarios with changing niip water diversions we used three different settings for future farmer behaviors to test the impact of bottom up management 1 business as usual used 2013 irrigated areas of each agent throughout the entire simulation period 2 historical minimum irrigated areas of each agent as a boundary condition test were used and 3 dynamically changing irrigated areas with abm were used as the adaptive management the results in the next section follow this logic 4 results 4 1 climate change impacts on farmer decisions fig 4 shows the historical irrigated areas from 1929 to 2013 as black dash lines for each of the 16 irrigation districts and the future irrigated area under five gcms plus full niip water diversion with different colored lines the x axis is the year and the y axis is the irrigated area in acres 1 acre 0 40 ha note that we assume the framers risk perceptions λ toward preceding factors and external socioeconomic conditions z are constant but since the preceding factors themselves especially winter precipitation are changing the actual decision of farmers will change accordingly overall most irrigation districts showed a decreasing pattern of irrigated areas under most of the future climate conditions and to a large extent the curves seemed to follow the historical trend among future climate scenarios ipsl5ar tended to have the lowest irrigated area as they were the driest gcm basin wide canesm and miroc predicted relatively wetter future climate conditions but not every district showed an increasing trend of irrigated areas some interesting pattern of irrigated area tipping points was observed and can potentially be explained by winter precipitation patterns for example ipsl5ar showed a medium winter precipitation value in the upstream of the navajo reservoir region group 1 fig 4a which was the reason the irrigated area under ipsl5ar was not the lowest also the average winter precipitation had a clear shift around 2050 from 147 mm to 126 mm which could possibly cause the trend to change from increasing to decreasing in the irrigated area of nmpineriverarealr a similar reason also caused a tipping point from increasing to decreasing irrigation area in echoditch around 2080 under hadgem2 under ipsl5b some districts jicarilla twinrock farmingtonglade and echoditch in group 1 fig 4a and group 2 animas river fig 4b had a tipping point around 2045 can be explained by the winter precipitation trend the tipping points indicated that available water for agriculture uses reached its potential and the drier climate condition could subdue the agriculture production before 2045 there was a slightly increasing trend of winter precipitation until 2050 the winter precipitation of group 1 and group 2 under these gcms are given in the supplemental materials fig s4 different agents risk perception and their relative upstream downstream location might also affect their decision for example risk perception parameters showed that jicarilla is a risk averse agent with lower λ values while nmpineriverareair is a risk seeking agent with higher λ values under the ipsl5ar scenario the winter precipitation showed a decreasing trend so jicarilla gradually adjusts its irrigation area to adapt the future climate nmpineriverareair was optimistic about the future water availability until it realized that winter precipitation decreased and then it was forced to make a significant change in the irrigation area however under wetter gcm like canesm the increasing irrigated area in jicarilla might partially result in nmpineriverareair decreasing the irrigated area among the 16 irrigation ditches six of them citzenditch fig 4c hammond fig 4c farmersmutal fig 4b fruitlandandcambridge fig 4c jewettvalley fig 4c and hogback fig 4c participated in the shortage sharing agreement and in our abm setting we hypothesized that these districts responded to the agreement and curtailed their irrigated area by half of the previous year after multiple years of irrigated area curtailment this setting allowed us to mimic a real world migration effect if local framers decided to move out of the basin the modeling results showed that toward 2100 under the driest future climate condition ipsl5ar irrigated areas of these six irrigation ditches will become close to zero which indicated that these farmers may move out of the sjr basin a similar pattern of farmers was observed in previous abm studies hailegiorgis et al 2018 this hypothesis needs additional tests in future studies with experts from the population dynamic we further address this topic in the discussion section fig 5 shows the annual water diversion for irrigation of these 16 agents under different climate change plus full niip water diversion impacts from 2014 toward the end of this century in general the trend either increasing or decreasing was very similar to the irrigated area in fig 4 however the annual water diversion showed a larger inter year variation than the irrigated area the main reason for this variation was because the annual irrigation requirement was calculated inside riverware by evapotranspiration since precipitation and temperature changed every year the irrigation requirement also changed accordingly for the irrigated areas also this inter year variation was largest for agents located in the animas river this was because the total water availability in the tributary i e the animas river was limited compared to the mainstem sjr 4 2 climate change impacts on five basin level metrics the impact of future climate change plus full niip water diversion on five basin level metrics are shown in fig 6 fig 6a shows the mean annual storage of the navajo reservoir that represents basin water availability in general water storage in navajo reservoir under climate change will be at a similar level as historical climate conditions except for the driest gcm ipsl5ar this result was comparable with bennett et al 2019 and confirmed that the navajo reservoir has the capacity to smooth the intensifying inter annual flow variability driven by climate change fig 6b shows that in terms of water export from sjr to the rio grande basin miroc will result in a similar level of water export but other gcms showed a decreasing pattern in san juan chama project diversion while hadgem2 and ipsl5ar result in the largest shortages among the five gcms bennett et al 2019 also showed that these two gcms will cause the largest out of the basin water delivery shortage fig 6c shows the sum of the local water shortage among irrigation districts the driest gcm ipsl5ar showed a severe local water shortage as expected fig 6d shows the average streamflow to lake powell that tries to fulfill the upper colorado water compact again it is not surprising that the two drier gcms ipsl5ar and hadgem2 showed the lowest flow and miroc a relatively wetter gcm showed an increase of streamflow to lake powell bennett et al 2019 also showed miroc and canesm had higher than historical water delivery to lake powell finally fig 6e shows the numbers of days between march and july that has daily streamflow at four corners larger than 5000 cfs the black dash line represents the minimal 21 day target the wetter gcm miroc shows more years that this target will be met 66 out of 85 simulation years and the drier gcm ipsl5ar shows the least years 24 out of 85 simulation years a similar conclusion was made by bennett et al 2019 that meeting minimum flow requirements was likely to be a major challenge in the sjr under climate change impacts we used the wetter gcm miroc and the drier gcm ipsl5ar to test how bottom up management might help mitigate the negative impact at a basin wide scale fig 7 showed the results when we changed the irrigated area setting from dynamic adaptive behavior driven by abm into the 1 constant 2013 area for all districts the year 2013 is the latest year we have the historical value or 2 the historical minimal irrigated area value for all districts the results indicated that at the basin level these three different settings of future farmer behavior did not result in any differences under mirco under the ipsl5ar some small improvements were observed in navajo storage local water shortage streamflow to lake powell and instream flow requirement under the minimum irrigated area setting when we compare figs 4 5 and 7 we can highlight the differences of climate change impact on individual irrigation districts and basin wide metrics while climate change impact might significantly affect some irrigation districts irrigated areas fig 4 and water diversions fig 5 these behavioral changes are not observed in any of the basin wide water scarcity metrics fig 7 this comparison shows water allocation in this basin is close to a zero sum game while someone use more water others must use less water to satisfy the basin wide constraints therefore basin wide water scarcity metrics might not be able to reflect the changing local water diversion and irrigated area conditions when policymakers try to implement any dcp in this basin they should consider this situation and incorporate heterogeneous bottom up decision making process from farmers behavioral change in the dcp 4 3 sensitivity of the unutilized niip water rights section 4 1 and section 4 2 demonstrated the impact of full utilization of indian water rights on both farmer and basin level water scarcity in this section we went a step further and showed the impact of indian water rights on individual irrigation districts in the sjr basin we changed the annual niip depletion target inside riverware from full water use to current water use the annual depletion for all tested runs is given in the supplemental materials fig s5 in the abm setting the niip depletion will directly affect agents in group 3 downstream of navajo reservoir because niip directly takes water from the navajo reservoir the niip depletion also indirectly affects other agents because navajo storage affects all agents especially agents who participated in the shortage sharing agreement fig 8 shows six agents including all three groups as a demonstration of current and full utilization of indian water rights under the wetter gcm canesm and drier gcm ipsl5ar conditions the modeling results showed that under wetter future climate conditions most agents would slightly reduce their irrigated areas and associated water diversions to allow larger water storage in the navajo reservoir and fulfill the full use of niip diversion solid gray lines are lower than dotted gray lines this difference was more noticeable in group 3 agents because they were located downstream of the navajo reservoir a similar pattern was observed under the dry future climate condition solid blue lines lower than dotted blue lines meant that all agents were reducing their own irrigated areas and water diversions however one significant difference was the triggering of the shortage sharing agreement the current niip water diversion under the drier future climate condition would not trigger the shortage sharing agreement therefore even with some water scarcity issues most farmers will remain in the region if niip will maintain the current water use this result implied that the expansion of the most senior water rights in the basin might potentially drive junior water right users out 5 discussion 5 1 informing dcp implementation with modeling results the coupled abm riverware model was applied in this paper to evaluate the impact of climate change plus full niip water diversion on both farmer decisions concerning irrigated areas and the resulting impacts of agent decisions on five basin level water scarcity metrics in the first discussion section we tried to explain how our modeling results provide information for basin wide dcp implementation in our simulation sjr delivered an average of 1 14 maf per year to lake powell under historical climate conditions miroc canesm and ipsl5b showed increasing streamflow 1 450 1 246 and 1 224 maf respectively and hadgem2 and ipsl5a showed decreasing streamflow 0 927 and 0 807 maf if we use historical climate conditions as a basis under miroc canesm and ipsl5b sjr basin had the potential to contribute an additional 0 309 0 105 and 0 083 maf per year to lake powell respectively alternatively the average navajo reservoir storage is about 1 283 maf under historical climate conditions again if we used this value as a basis our results showed that under miroc canesm and ipsl5b the navajo reservoir can release additional 0 129 0 013 and 0 085 maf downstream if we combine these two water sources there will be an additional 0 438 0 118 and 0 168 maf of water delivered to lake powell and the lower basin under miroc canesm and ipsl5b respectively although these amounts are not a significant amount of water it can help with water curtailment in the lower basin and mexico for example the additional 0 438 maf under mirco can cover 100 of the water curtailment in the lower basin and mexico if lake mead s water level drops to 1075 1090 ft stern and sheikh 2019 even if the water level dropped to 1050 1075 ft this amount of water could cover 70 of the curtailment stern and sheikh 2019 these results indicated that if the upper basin dcp can be implemented properly the water scarcity condition in the entire crb can be mitigated 5 2 effect of parameter uncertainty on modeling results in the results section we demonstrated the effect of different gcms by using five gcm outcomes and the effects of under utilized indian water rights via different model settings to further improve this coupled modeling framework we tested the uncertainty associated with the model itself in general three types of uncertainty are commonly discussed in the scientific community yang and wi 2018 model input uncertainty i e data uncertainty model structure uncertainty i e equation uncertainty and model parameter uncertainty previous studies have discussed the data uncertainty vano et al 2014 and model structure uncertainty miller et al 2012 in the crb and we want to further explore the effect of model parameter uncertainty and test the equifinality issue beven 2006 on our results in the model calibration process we applied the monte carlo approach to test 200 parameter sets the best 20 sets with the highest nse value compared to historical irrigated areas were selected the calibration results of these sets are shown in fig s6 of the supplemental materials we then ran the abm riverware model under the driest gcm ipsl5ar using these best 20 sets and showed the results in fig 9 in fig 9 the results of the best set are highlighted by blue lines which are the parameters we used in section 4 the results of the other 19 sets are shown as gray lines fig 9a shows the farmer s irrigated area and fig 9b c and d show three basin level water scarcity metrics the navajo storage streamflow to lake powell and the number of days between march and july above 5000 cfs at four corners respectively the effect of model parameter uncertainty was more significant at the farmer level than the basin level among agents those located downstream of the navajo reservoir group 3 showed the largest variation in the irrigated area compared to groups 1 and 2 this was because the navajo reservoir provides a more stable water supply to the downstream irrigation districts therefore different sets of risk perception parameters λ and socioeconomic condition parameters z might be able to achieve a similar value of nse i e equifinality issue the actual annual diversion of each agent is in the supplemental materials fig s7 fig 9b c and d barely showed any differences to indicate that basin level metrics will not be able to demonstrate the equifinality issue this could be a concern of those modeling studies that only focus on basin level results and want to explore the effect of dcp at the local level a comprehensive evaluation of model uncertainty might be needed in the future to further explore this aspect 5 3 model limitation there are other limitations and assumptions in our model worth further discussion first the hypothesis of the action of future farmers on the shortage sharing agreement will need further examination the current abm assumes 50 curtailment of irrigated areas change which is an arbitrary number and the migration results cannot be confirmed with any historical data the curtailment of irrigated areas can be updated by standalone riverware simulation to reflect actual shortages of water furthermore a survey study or local farmer engagement workshops will be needed to quantify the likelihood of local intentions for migration under drought conditions second as we mentioned in section 2 no detailed information is available about how the navajo reservoir will change its operation under upper colorado dcp when such information becomes available the same model can incorporate the new operation rule and test the effect on both basin level water scarcity metrics and farmer level decisions we can also use such information to verify our discussion in section 5 1 about whether sjr can help with the water curtailment in the lower basin finally even though we have metrics to look at climate change impact beyond the sjr basin streamflow lake powell and water export to the rio grande a regional scale model such as the colorado river simulation system can better show how these changes might affect the entire crb 6 conclusion the continuous drought through the early 2000s has caused a serious water scarcity issue in the crb while different modeling approaches have been used to quantify the impact of climate change only a few consider the adaptive behaviors of farmers and the combined effect of climate change and under utilized indian water rights this paper used a coupled abm riverware model to quantify the bottom up adaptive water management under climate change as well as the influence of under utilized indian water rights to identify the potential tipping point of farmer behavioral changes that is the timing of farmer decisions to switch from increasing to decreasing irrigation area the case study results of the sjr basin show that 1 farmers have different responses to expand or reduce irrigated areas to climate change impact while changes in winter precipitation might partially explain the behavioral tipping point no specific pattern can be concluded based on their location 2 farmer responses to annual water diversion showed larger inter year variation compared to irrigated area and farmers located along the animas river showed the highest variation because the water supply in the tributary is relatively limited 3 climate change will in general worsen water scarcity issues in different basin level metrics such as navajo reservoir storage flow to lake powell and instream flow requirements which echo several previous studies 4 basin level water scarcity metrics cannot reflect farm level impacts under climate change which emphasizes the importance of modeling bottom up management actions 5 full utilization of indian water rights will likely trigger the shortage sharing agreement under the drier future climate compare to current tribal water use future studies can focus on several different directions to improve the results of this work a comprehensive evaluation of modeling uncertainty including input data model structure i e equations and model parameters can benefit the scientific community and advance our understanding of the coupled human natural system model the irrigated area curtailment under drought condition the effect of reservoir reoperation under drought contingency plan and the regional impact beyond the sjr basin all need further evaluation also interviews with farmers or surveys about farmer decision behaviors can improve our understanding of the decision process the abm modeling which is another future research direction credit authorship
